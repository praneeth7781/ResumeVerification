Tell your next closest friend she’s the new “invite OP” representative because clearly (old friend) can’t handle it. 

Obviously word it way more professionally than that but seriously, tell them to stop letting him invite you because he isn’t and you want to join them next time so ask someone else to take up the reigns.
You literally just tell the girls, “hey, I would love to join you guys next time. Looks like (friend) keeps not inviting me for some reason. How about next time you all want me to join you invite me and I’ll be there?”

STOP letting your friend be the gatekeeper of your invite. You were clearly getting invited by someone else before. Have them take the lead back up. Unfortunately, you learned this guy isn’t your friend anymore but you’re his boss, you gotta be professional. I would just distance yourself and make sure to keep being the cool boss to everyone else. This reeks of “I want to sabotage you and take your job”.
I mean, you really just have to pick, your girlfriend or your friends, because if you DONT break up with the girlfriend immediately after this, none of these people will ever her over again and most likely will distance or drop you entirely.
My point was “if he’s getting tested regularly, it seems without a doubt he made sure she was tested early on and was negative”.
I never said you shouldn’t. But the reality is most don’t, so anyone who is subscribing to regular texting even in a relationship would be conscious enough to ask a partner about their STD status early on and make sure they were tested recently.
Idk man if he’s getting tested while in a relationship you would think he’s the type to ask about STDs beforehand.
She sounds racist. “I know your type”? I’ll bet OP is not white and the kids are potentially mixed and more white passing than she is.
I’m assuming it’s racism, not classism.
Maybe call the police and actual professionals rather than posting on Reddit…
It just makes it so you can fully focus on moving on, you don’t have a reminder in your life of what you lost or what could have been. You wouldn’t be constantly putting yourself through little moments of longing and sadness. No contact is definitely meant for times like this, because otherwise you’re never going to be able to fully let the past be the past if it really isn’t past.
Yeah. She’s going to totally fuck up her relationship with her kid by tracking her, losing trust when she inevitably breaks the rules, and potentially ends up in legal issues or needing to call the police. 

Some damage can’t be undone, she shouldn’t risk it because she’s already playing with fire saying she’ll show up randomly at her daughter’s job. Especially because it sounds like this may be or turn into an abusive or otherwise toxic relationship. Not enabling it while preserving the relationship as much as possible is the smartest and most parental action to take.
You likely need to simply take the car away from her in its entirety. Don’t track your 22 year old daughter. Simply say, “it’s really clear you’re not okay with following these rules and I don’t want my trust in you to be damaged when you break them, so you need to find a new way to get to work from now on because you’ve both lost access to the car. I’m sorry, but I’m not letting this situation escalate further.”

You can seriously damage your daughter’s trust in you  by tracking her, and I’m sure it won’t feel nice to be confronted with how far your daughter is willing to lie to you over a guy she just met. Don’t make things worse. Make sure she can trust in you as much as possible should anything happen with this guy. Just don’t enable her to be taken advantage of. But be her mom, not a police warden.
(Would)
She was a 36-24-34, 5’5 and 118 lbs at 19, which would probably make her a size 2-4 on today’s standards, at least when she was a teen. I would imagine she filled out a little bit as she grew and ended up maybe a 6-8, which is still a perfectly healthy and beautiful size.
You don’t need a tourist visa for US or Canada, just a passport.
I would be very honest with her that you can’t stop her from going through with it but if she does, that you can’t promise it won’t lead to divorce. It sounds like she’s scared, as I’d make the argument you two were actively trying for kids if you weren’t using any actual birth control and actively were discussing kids. I don’t see this changing in a few years. She can make the choice, but she should do so understanding that it will end the marriage. It does you both a disservice to pretend to be more supportive than you are. It’ll make her feel blinded and could potentially influence her into a decision you are all unhappy with in the end. You can make your feelings known so she can make an informed decision.
Wanting to murder someone is NOT normal. Just because you’re 90 lbs and a teenager does NOT make anything you’re saying okay. Get help. I am not engaging in this anymore.
You need help. He will break up with you and if you don’t speak to a therapist, you’ll end up in jail. Because it won’t be anyone manipulating him, it’ll be him realizing he’s dating a deeply unwell person.
If he’s joking, why didn’t he apologize?
Nothing you’re feeling right now is normal. Please speak to a professional or at least a trusted adult about how you’re feeling.
And if you’re wrong, what if he breaks up with you? What will you do to him?
I wouldn’t entertain that mindset, most relationships at 17 don’t last forever. There’s a very real prospect of you not being with him. Your life should continue beyond that.
Okay…. You definitely need some therapy because that attitude is deeply disturbing. Get some help, you’re only 17, so I get it, but you won’t be well if you keep entertaining such an exceptionally toxic mindset. What will you do if he breaks up with you?
That doesn’t work the way you think it does in the real world. You’ll end up dead if you have that attitude.
Wild that you’d risk tax fraud for the same money either way.
He can’t work in Japan with the proper visa. If he plays, there’s no way it doesn’t catch the attention of Japanese officials and EG gets in trouble. Sure, if he needed to do a business meeting for an hour with 5 people he might be able to get away with it, but not an international, televised event.
It was more like “we aren’t getting results worth the price we are paying” so they dropped him. Can’t really give a guy a demotion, it’s either keep paying the salary or cut him and they clearly made the right call. I’m sure if the org was totally flush with cash they wouldn’t have made such a fast decision, but multiple people in the org have also said the team wasn’t doing well leading up to the decision either.
Because they are all teenagers who fail to understand that an expenditure report isn’t just reporting pure salaries, it’s reporting the cost to the company, which will be at least 50-100% more than the employee salaries and could be 3-4x depending on other overhead costs involved.
I will also remind you that when running a company, expenses tend to run 50-100% of the salaries of your employees, meaning you can likely half the expenditures if you’re trying to figure out what portion of the total cost is on pure salaries the players see, rather than the overhead involved in taxes, benefits, lawyers, offices, equipment, etc.

The number seems wrong because you’re assuming that 100% of the “cost” of a team is player salaries and it typically isn’t, not from the perspective of the company. They’ll factor in at a minimum the taxes, benefits, and other comp package costs, and they’ll also need to have some additional overhead to keep everything running that will be summed in these expenditure reports.
NTA. But you’re going to need to tell them you’re changing the password on X date before the change takes effect and they’ll either need their own account or lose the service then, as you don’t want to run the risk of unknown numbers of households being charged to your account if anyone shares the password, so no one but you will have it from now on.
If you’re inclined to say anything, and only if you’re an active part of the conversations, I would just respond with, “it’s not that we suck you’re just really good at hitting some insane shots! I’m good for a casual player but those are some shots even the pros struggle to hit consistently!”

Kill them with kindness, reframe things as beginners luck and encourage them to keep it up more than them really sucking and you lying about your skills.
Best advice is telling anyone involved not to give you any information about his life. You can always give the gf a heads up and say you don’t have any proof so you just want to give her a heads up so she is cautious about any other red flags and then keep doing what you’ve been doing. The sad thing is, good doesn’t always prevail. Sometimes evil wins. The best we can do is try to combat it and not feed into it.
If you have any articles or police reports or arrest records I’d probably anonymously send it to her and then let her make her own decisions.
My guess is she found it funny or acceptable before but you’ve essentially described yourself as an asshole people like being around. She’s 18, I assume she’s growing up and realizing she really doesn’t want to be the person that loves hanging out with assholes, and that’s why she’s putting some distance. I’ll give you a heads up, there are definitely people out there that find what you are describing totally normal and acceptable behavior, but as you get older, especially in modern society, the number of people who do find that acceptable will rapidly dwindle. If I were you I’d keep that in mind. I’m not saying to completely shift your personality overnight, but you’re only 18. If you can, try to be the person who grows up with their peers and doesn’t get stuck in the “assholes are cool” phase of life.
What are you on about? Not many employers would let you take off 3 days during busy season with a few weeks notice.
In the case of you being weak then I *really* would not default to violence like this, as you’re essentially running the risk of if that hair pin doesn’t make them back down, you have no further defensive options AND you’ve just royally pissed someone off. You’re putting yourself in significantly more danger this way. Be safe.
I mean…. I think the sad reality is if you turn to violence any time a dude disrespects your boundaries, you’re going to find yourself in trouble or seriously hurt. I would probably default to less violent means, but taking self-dense classes and knowing how to properly defend yourself against a genuine attack rather than a standard creep is good. 

I understand how unfair it is, but the reality is, women are going to be subjected to an onslaught of creepy guys who will push boundaries and touch you without consent like that. Violence is sending a very clear message you aren’t okay with it, and where high school boys are concerned, yeah they’ll probably be shocked someone is so forceful and leave you alone, but other people might call the police against you and the reality is, if they’re the one bleeding, you might get a cop that sides with them. Even worse, unless you’re fully able to defend yourself, you may make someone angry enough to seriously hurt you or “teach you a lesson”. You said in a comment you’re weak but fast, so please be smart and safe about when to act in self defense.
People can change. Don’t act as though what someone said three years ago is what they’re beholden to for life.
I mean…. Why do you have an issue with him giving an ultimatum? You two DID discuss it and you responded by essentially saying “well, I can still meet someone I like more than you even if it’s a closed relationship so we might as well keep it open”. Not exactly comforting. 

He’s laying out his boundaries on what he needs to feel like a long distance relationship will work. The discussion really is that simple. “I need xyz” and you either say “I can agree to that” and you two continue dating or “I can’t agree to that” and you break up. It really sounds like what you want is a chance to convince him that an open relationship while living in Portugal is fine. Otherwise, what’s the difference in how he opened up the second conversation? He’s being clear and expediting the discussion. It can be really damaging to trust to try to convince someone why you still want an open relationship and he wants a closed one. 

At this point, the ball is in your court. If you’re telling the truth that you’re fine with closing the relationship, then you should have no issue with his “ultimatum” because ultimately it isn’t an ultimatum, it’s just him communicating and establishing really clear boundaries, which is the only way an open relationship has even lasted thus far.
Lowkey would expect her to just move to a major city. Which I mean, that’s probably what they should do.
You should consult about the actual eviction process and start it. That means giving notice in writing usually and being aware of next steps if they refuse. It’ll be different since you live there as well and own, so a lawyer specializing in landlord tenant disputes will help you out.
I mean you just tell him, “I will not be getting pregnant until we have a baby name picked out. If you really are this stubborn, I will be going to get an implant in this week. This is a hard boundary for me. I am not going to endanger my life with a stressful pregnancy because you’re too stubborn to compromise like an adult and I refuse to bring a child into the world with someone who thinks that’s acceptable behavior.”
I think he thinks now that you’re married you’re not going to leave. It’s normal and common for military to cheat on their spouses. Not everyone, but obviously your husband is one of them. You can choose to be a stereotype or refuse to partake, but sounds like those are your only options.
Sean isn’t on 100T. I’m pretty sure he’s on (Corrected to) Shopify Rebellion as a content creator.
I think you need to accept that not being okay with something isn’t just grumbling about it and going along with what he says in the end, it’s making a clear statement with actions behind it if “I am only paying my share. If that isn’t okay with you, we need to split”. Because at the end of the day, you ARE okay with it because you’ve stayed for FOUR YEARS of this. Love yourself more. You’re definitely being taken advantage of again.
This isn’t really a case of being wrong so much as you need to start respecting yourself. Is this really what you want in a life partner? Someone who is using you to subsidize their life despite making more than you? I mean, he’s selfish at best and totally and plainly using you at worst.
Your friends were directly asked not to tell you your ex’s business. You never asked your friends to keep info from your ex in the same manner. It isn’t really fair to say they chose her. I also assume that since everyone of them knew they were dating, these may have started out as your friends but along the duration of your marriage and you moving, they became mutual friends to both of you.
Tell her. She deserves to know she’s being pursued by a cheater. You owe him nothing AND by telling her, it’ll hopefully give him a reason to stay tf away from you.
Holy shit NTA. I’m not going to diagnose anyone, but you probably should not remain in contact with a woman who has even less control over her own behavior than you. She likely has her own unaddressed struggles but you need to look out for you and I can’t imagine it would be easy to modulate your behavior well when someone is constantly forcing perfection or utter insanity upon your life.
I would honestly think of it this way— you would inevitably lose him anyway. It’s better to lose him and gain a kind hearted man in your boyfriend than lose your boyfriend only to become bitter when your dad inevitably abandons you in the future.
I mean, I think it’s her right to decide if she wants to share that information with you or not. People saying their loyalty is to her and not you isn’t really that fair, as she directly asked them not to tell you, whereas I don’t think you did something similar. The only person I think it’s fair to have an issue with is M28, as he was in a situation to tell you himself or to ask your ex to tell you. 

I personally would just say to M28 “hey, I’m not mad at you for dating ex, but I gotta be honest that it makes me uncomfortable that you listened to me talk about my experiences knowing you were with my ex. I just want to clear the air so we can move forward without it being awkward”. You can decide you want to ditch the whole friend group, but that seems like it’s punishing you more than them. I’d just chalk this up to what happens when you have a lot of mutual friends. It isn’t their place to share news that they were explicitly told not to share.
Well, we’re you aware your husband was wearing that jersey or did you genuinely have no idea this was a jersey let alone a signed jersey until after he got upset with you?

If you were aware beforehand, ofc you’re the AH. Your kid vomiting doesn’t suddenly shut down all higher level thinking in your brain. You can’t possible argue it isn’t your fault for not having the common sense of “I need to get a towel because my husband’s jersey isn’t an appropriate vomit rag”.
NTA. FHV is highly transmissible and can cause tons of issues in kitties. You HAVE to know if either of your cats has it before moving in together and if only one does, you two shouldn’t move in together.
I’m gunna take a guess and say you’ve made similar comments in the past, because calling this a lie is a pretty strong word. It seems pretty clear you DONT trust him, especially since you just said it’s fair he wants someone who trusts him and not that he has someone who trusts him. If you don’t trust him and he knows you don’t trust him, why wouldn’t he call of the wedding?
Most likely women in his culture say similar things too, and once they’re “stuck” in marriage kowtow to tradition. Idk where he’s from, but I have seen it in some other cultures. So he pretended to be okay with everything you’re saying because he figured it wouldn’t matter when you were stuck in the marriage. 


Now it’s up to you to decide— was he right?
It’s common, yeah. Are the guys you’re attracted to very different from you or something? Because I mean, I can imagine this happening if you’re going after the sort of guy who goes after different girls and this is just a “we have very different types” situation.
Probably would see what you can do to reduce your hours so that you can show her with action that you’re serious about making a change. The issue is you work too much. So, work less. Make a change. Give her *quality time* not fancy gifts or expensive dates. She wants to go on hikes or weekend beach trips with you. She wants to make dinner together and fall asleep together, not get fancy jewelry or a giant bouquet of roses. Sure, that’s nice too, but if you try to throw money at the problem rather than make actionable changes in your behavior, she’s gone. For good.
I mean, you said he’s an immigrant. Is this normal in his culture? Because it could also just be that this is what having a wife means *to him*. And if that’s the case, run.
Out of curiosity, why are you not asking your fiancé to handle this? You’re taking care of 95% of wedding planning and you’re the one that needs to move in to care for his grandma? Girl, you gotta make sure this man is an actual adult and capable of taking control of his own life, his own family and his own relationship and not just throwing everything on you because it he isn’t, mark my words, your marriage will end. You will not be able to withstand being the manager of both of your lives forever.
Being understaffed on a particular night doesn’t mean anything about retaining staff. Someone who worked in a restaurant should know the difference. It was a Saturday night, having 1-2 people call off sick could and often DOES make a restaurant understaffed. Says absolutely nothing about the ability of the restaurant to maintain staff.
Ah yes, please mansplain how people who say “I take home well over 6 figures” somehow know less about their own salary than you because you happened to have worked in a restaurant, even though I’m talking about *a fine dining restaurant on the level of $1600 meals being normal* on not just servers in general. 

But go off, I guess you know more than people do about their own jobs. Guess what? Was also a restaurant manager. Some make over 6 figures. It’s not unrealistic or even THAT uncommon in fine dining.
Sorry fam, he isn’t changing for you or your kid. Accept him as he is or decide you want something different. Changing someone isn’t happening. Especially not after 5 months.
You may understand tipping but you don’t understand math. If you are making $100/hour, you need to work less than 20 hours a week to make 6 figures. She’s making well over $100 an hour because this is just one table. And if you don’t believe me, Google it. The articles are out there. It is 100% realistic and common in fine dining. “Waitress/waiter makes 6 figures a year”. Hundreds of threads and articles and AMAs pop up immediately.
Dang fam. You got rejected by the person you let walk all over you and begged for more. I would take this as a wake up call that you’re really struggling with your self esteem and having any amount of self-respect for yourself.

If I were you, I would be asking myself why on earth I still want this to be salvaged? Because I mean she’s NEVER been loyal to you. Never. Never wanted to, never will, and is now isn’t even getting enough from this to want to stay. It sucks, but wake up man. You deserve better!
You can’t be that dense. She’s making at least $100/hour on ONE table and no server at a high end restaurant handled one table at a time. Waitresses do not care if their money comes from the job itself or customers, and there is no way they’re complaining about the pay, because frankly, they’re highly overcompensated here.

Servers at even slightly fancy restaurants let alone one of this level routinely say the real reason they don’t want tipping culture to change is because they make 6 figures and know damn well the job isn’t a job worth 6 figures and if it were changed to a salaried position paid for by the employer, they’d be making $20-25/hour flat rate instead of potentially hundreds of dollars an hour.
NTA. It’s insane anyone would think a waitress should be making well over $150/hour, and if they’re serving a normal number of tables, the real figure would be at least double that. Yeah, they should get a livable wage. It isn’t a job worth more than engineers, lawyers and even some doctors are paid. Sorry, but the expectations of someone without any qualifications being entitled to that kind of salary is utterly insane to me.
Waitresses don’t need to be making $100+ dollars an hour for shitty service. And that’s assuming that was her only table, which it obviously wasn’t if them being busy and understaffed was the underlying reason for poor service. 

Sorry, but a waitress, even at the highest end of restaurants and the best of service, should not be making more than most lawyers, engineers and even some doctors make.
We don’t know if SIL made the rule or if family did. We at least know SIL isn’t putting a stop to it though.
Reaffirming, this isn’t how men are. This is how shitty, unhappy people are. 

How to address it? Be honest. “I have a feeling you’re planning on proposing soon and before we discuss marriage we need to have a serious conversation— I am and have been unhappy and have not felt like my needs are being met for awhile now. I’ve tried to delicately bring it up to you and it ended really tensely so I dropped it, but I can’t marry someone I don’t feel loves me and isn’t putting in effort in maintaining the spark. I know we’ve been together awhile and it’s easy to get comfortable, but I want more for my life than that. I hope you do too. I would love to go to a couple’s therapist if you’re open to it so we can try to talk and find ways to reconnect, but this isn’t a dynamic I will be happy in forever and I want our marriage to last forever.”
We’re you tested for HIV? Because I looked up all of those drugs, and they seem to be commonly used in treating secondary infections associated with HIV. I would likely have your partner get a full, and I mean FULL std panel and have him show you the results. Assuming he is fully clean, then you can decide if you think your unhappiness is truly just a state of mind or not. I can’t tell you to choose happiness, but I will remind you your daughters are learning from the example you set, so act accordingly to what you’d want them to do in the same situation.
Zitrolin appears to be azithromycin, most commonly used to treat chlamydia and gonorrhea. Flucoral appears to be fluconazole and most commonly used to treat yeast infections or secondary infections with HIV. Herclov seems to be used for genital herpes in immunocompromised patients with HIV. 

Given the fact that two of these are given to treat secondary infections due to HIV, and one is a general wide spectrum antibiotic, your partner having a history of shady behavior at best, and they all treat different genital infections, your partner very well may have and is hiding HIV from you, or had an unsafe exposure and went to the doctor to get treatment for a number of sexually transmitted pathogens. This is all information I’ve gathered from looking up the drugs and isn’t medical advice, but you need to be *very* concerned because I do not imagine this combination of drugs being given just because of an old herpes flare up. I’m not familiar with how drugs are prescribed in the regions it says these drugs are available though.
…. You didn’t ask him if he was clean and when he was last tested before sleeping with him? Lady, no offense, but you’re WAY too old to be so dumb and fast and loose with your own health. At this point, you need to decide if you’re happy in this relationship exactly as it is or if you aren’t. If you arent, I would recognize you are a 44 year old woman and old enough to be able to stand up for yourself and say, “I’m not happy. It’s better for us to go our separate ways” and stop teaching your daughters that this is the relationship that they should aim for.
Lol “oh my god I only lied to you once” and “I can’t believe you’re doing this, you don’t love me”

You’re damn fucking right I do not love someone who would so willingly *endanger the lives of mothers and children on the road* because you’re too much of a fuck up to call an Uber home. The fact that completely sober he has no remorse and can say that *to a nurse* who very well may have real trauma surrounding the consequences of drunk driving shows that if anyone in this world is actually unloveable, it might be him.  

I would honestly question the moral integrity of anyone who told me they actually did still love someone who pulled this sort of shit.
Nah I disagree, rather strongly. A girlfriend of 3 years absolutely gets to say “if you want this relationship to continue you need to divorce your wife and I need to see proof”.

Do you know how many women believed the whole bullshit of “we’re separated, we’ll get a divorce eventually! She doesn’t even live around here!” To find him married with a baby on the way? Not saying that’s the case here, but the gf would (and frankly is for letting it go on so long) be an idiot for not wanting the divorce to be official by now AND for wanting to know without a doubt that it is a real divorce. I mean, you need to give your partner some faith and trust, but 3 years into a relationship and 5 years after a separation? Sorry, there’s trust and then there’s being a fool. She still shouldn’t force herself to be at the courthouse but this is absolutely 100% her business. This isn’t a new relationship. This is in the territory of “trying to decide if I can or want to spend my life with this person” territory and at that point, yeah a major decision of “hmmmm should I continue being a married man with a serious girlfriend?” Becomes your business as said serious girlfriend. 

Utterly ridiculous to claim it isn’t her business or that it’s at all similar to her influencing his will.
… I really don’t think it’s fair to say a gf of *three years* should have no say and should keep out of the fact that she’s dating a legally married man. She definitely is fully within her rights to wonder why after 5 years neither of them has finally said, “hey, this marriage is obviously over let’s make it official”. Because even knowing and believing OP that there’s no feelings, *I* am wondering how five years later and multiple state moves, this hasn’t been made official. I mean, she’s had to get licenses and file for new jobs completely “divorced” is saying she’s married. It is definitely weird. It would definitely get a side eye and some questions from any rational, self-respecting person.

Let’s not make a completely valid concern of the girlfriend into an issue of insecurities, because that’s also harmful to women. If I was dating someone “separated”, and three years later they were still just “separated”, omg everyone in my support system would be shaking me to snap out of it and leave.
I would just say, “this is a legal process and the lawyers have advised me to only have us and a lawyer there to take care of things as amicably and quickly as possible. I will see you immediately after and we can celebrate, but I’m going to take their advice here to make sure this happens and happens quickly. I am ready to close this chapter fully.”
…. Could be how?
I… don’t think you’re breaking up for your son and you need to stop framing it that way. You’re breaking up because of you and knowing you’re unhappy. It’s also true that you’re putting your son in the middle of a seemingly unhealthy relationship, but you should not make your child bear the burden of ending your relationship. Own that decision yourself.
NTA, but you need to handle this very delicately. “SO, I am glad you’re excited and willing to support me in this journey, and I am willing to pay up to $4k/month for our home. We can get a really nice place for $4k/month and I would be willing to pay the entirety of the rent BECAUSE I’m so happy to have you join me on this adventure. But if you want a place that’s more than $4k, you need to be willing to pay the difference, because I am not willing to spend any more than 4K. If the place you want is $5k or $10k/month, I don’t really care, you need to pick a place where you’re comfortable with paying that difference. Otherwise, it feels like you want to spend all of the extra money I’m making and that would make this move totally pointless for me. I want to save, and I want to continue being responsible. I need to know that you are I are on the same page here financially before we make this move, because otherwise I honestly don’t see the relationship working out long term if we are on such different wavelengths when it comes to finances.”


Also, not to be “that guy”, but you can DEFINITELY get a NICE place in a good part of town for ~4-5k/month in any city. I lived in a good part of LA for $3k/month in a giant 1bd apartment with high ceilings and I lived overlooking the river in Manhattan in a luxury (small, but extremely nice and plenty for a couple that isn’t working from home) apartment for $5k/month and had a 2 bd apartment in the upper east side for $6k/month. Again, luxury building. 

Yeah, you’re still living like a “normal” well off person, you aren’t getting a mansion with 8 bathrooms, but holy shit you don’t NEED that. Especially if you (her) aren’t making enough to afford it. And I specifically picked the prices for LA and NYC because I know it’s two of the MOST expensive cities you can live in, so absolutely BULLSHIT you need an $8-10k/month apartment for a couple with no kids/pets (where a 1 bed would be plenty and a 2 bd is excess if you want guests) in order to live in a nice place without high crime. Your budget is plenty assuming you aren’t looking to live like a millionaire finding his trophy wife’s lifestyle. 

She needs to learn to make choices. She can’t have everything.
Have you just say her down and said, “hey I’ve noticed this pattern and every time I try to talk to you about it you shut it down, so the options are we either address it now or we need to break up because this isn’t fair to me nor is the lack of communication an attractive trait to me”.
I think the issue is asking at all is going to damage your rep the same amount as trying to force her at this point. If you no longer have any mutual in common, no worries, but otherwise I wouldn’t.
I mean, that just mean another day of childcare. Instead, sending the message after she had to leave of, “hey, daughter is lovely, but I’m not comfortable having a child in my home unsupervised for safety reasons and I can’t guarantee I’ll be home all day while you’re here, so if you’re unable to find childcare for daughter, I don’t mind you taking the day off with just a heads up. Thanks for understanding!”
That’s probably the whole “my toddler is still a toddler and isn’t 100% perfect but we do try very hard to make sure they understand how to behave” thing OP was getting on. Yeah, a baby is still going to be a baby sometimes, but that doesn’t mean good parenting and bad parenting won’t produce, on average, WILDLY different behavior in children.
You’re not an AH, but you do need to bite the bullet, next time they ask just say, “I’m sorry, but every time our toddler and (their kids) get together, toddler gets sick. We need to look after her health first so until all of them are older and have stronger immune systems (ie better behaved or you have time to find a better reason) we don’t feel comfortable doing hang outs.”
You can also use olive oil, followed up by her face wash to remove the oil. Then you can teach about skin care routines to promote natural beauty as that’s a super DIY two step cleanse. The oils help gently break up the makeup and then the face wash removes the oils.
I mean, you’re both being childish. Blowing up his phone is also the immature response because a mature and self-respecting woman would simply say, “when you’re ready to talk, let me know so we can arrange to give each other back the stuff at our places” and never tolerate this behavior from a boyfriend.
This is not a friend, is it? Because if he is genuinely just a friend, you honestly need to back off, you’re coming off like a clingy gf.
Ok well if you genuinely believe that, you are delusional because this was ABSOLUTELY meant to be malicious and controlling.

You need to snap out of whatever trance this dude has put you on before you end up a shell of yourself.
NTA. Just say, “her name won’t be anything after your mom. You can either sit here and figure out a name we both agree to or I will be taking your refusal as permission to unilaterally choose the name, as I am her mother and carried her in my womb for 9 months. You can pick whatever you want of those two options but those are your only two options— compromise or get no say.”
I mean, he’s naturally a flirt. He seems not to think of you as the special woman in his life but as though all women need to be “blessed” by his attention. 🤮

I’ll say I have known people like this, and yes they ended up all cheating/leaving for someone else. That isn’t a comment necessarily on your boyfriend, but what I’ve seen from people who are “flirty and everyone likes them”.
 NTA. You asked what to do, you do nothing. Remind him, “if you want to care for your brother, I will get a job to support us and you can take care of baby and him. That’s your options. I am unable and unwilling to take on that role and I have made that VERY clear. It will go very poorly for you if you try to force this on me and will not end how you intend.”
It also reveals something about you, your comments are coming off very obtuse at points, you two are very obviously not on the same page yet you for some reason are unwilling to talk to him and GET on the same page. That sort of expectation will kill any marriage you do get around to, so you may wanna up your ability to have difficult and awkward convos with your partner.
Give the cops a call.
Heads up…. Your fiancée is pretty willing to straight up lie to your face…. That’s uh…. Something you should look into before you marry her. Good intentioned or not, that’s not wife material right there.
I mean….. did you actually ask him if he had any STDs before having unprotected sex with him? What he did is still likely illegal as usually HIV is a legally reportable disease to any sexual partners, typically before any intercourse has occurred regardless of viral loading, but also too many people assume a partner they’re exclusive with is automatically clean without asking the following, 
-“Do you have any STDs or STIs?”
-“When was the last time you were tested?”
-“Before I feel comfortable having unprotected sex, I want us to BOTH get retested and send each other the results, are you okay with that?” 

Last one is optional, but I have ALWAYS done this. It ensures that both of us were actually tested, tested for EVERYTHING, not just chlamydia and gonorrhea, and that no one is lying or asymptomatic or whatever, and as an added bonus makes it really clear that if you ever do contract an STD from them, they without a doubt cheated and there is no “well maybe it didn’t show up yet!” Crap.
Nah fam, if he was able to remember you giving him a hall pass he was able to remember the three rules you gave him in the same conversation. That’s just a straight lie to try to blame it on the ADHD.
I don’t even think a month has passed since he’s left. This sounds like it happened a few days ago.
Okay, fam. You’re focusing on the wrong things here. Him wanting kids in the past is irrelevant. He said he didn’t want them *now*. People change for a number of reasons. If someone says I don’t want kids, you gotta focus on what they’re telling you, not what you hope they’ll want in the future and not what they wanted in the past. You see how you messed up there?

And unfortunately here’s some more tough love— if you’re moving every 6 months to a new place every time, I wouldn’t picture yourself finding a long term relationship until you’re able to settle down in one place. Guys are less likely than women to make a long distance thing work indefinitely. That might also be playing a factor. Did this guy end things with you around when you had to move again? Is this info you tell the guys?
(He wanted kids with he because he was madly in love with her and not with you because he wasn’t in love with you). I get it hurts, but you’re not doing yourself any favors here.
Could be, yeah. Might not be that either. It’s impossible to know if he didn’t tell you. I don’t think it’s worth your energy to figure out. I think the big takeaway should be “just because one particular individual was unable to love you does not mean you are unlovable in general”. And also, “don’t date men who tell you they don’t want kids”.

I mean, a spark in the beginning can fade quickly. And a spark for you is not a spark for him. Guys can also seem really excited for you when really they just like a new experience. It can also just die for random reasons. It’s called “ick”— you are super into someone and then they do something, could be as innocuous as bad breath, fighting with a waitress, stopping wearing makeup or a million other things and all of a sudden the physical chemistry is just dead. 

But yes, ABSOLUTELY if you want kids and he doesn’t that is enough for any man to immediately dip. You need to be smart here and leave as soon as a man says he doesn’t want kids, because he isn’t going to give you one and he’ll just dump you if you push it or happen to get pregnant. Kids are one of the biggest dealbreakers out there and can instantly kill a person’s attraction to you.

You will find a long term partner, but it start by realizing dating is about finding someone you’re compatible with and wasting time on someone you aren’t compatible with (for instance, someone who doesn’t want kids or someone who isn’t showing you any affection/taking you on dates) just means you’re losing out on the possibility of finding the person you should actually end up with.
I’ll give some tough love because you’re 26 and it’s probably a lesson you’d benefit from learning. Being wrong for a specific person does not necessarily mean there is something wrong with you in general. Yes, I am sure there was a reason why he didn’t fall in love with you. Maybe you did something that annoyed him. Maybe you have a different view on kids or retirement or whatever other fundamental goal/belief. Maybe you two just didn’t have that spark physically. Whatever it is, that is particular to him and your potential relationship with HIM, not a comment on your worth as a person. You kinda see the difference? 

I know that I am an utterly amazing catch, but I also know that I am wrong for a heck of a lot of people out there and they would never fall in love with me if we dated because we just aren’t right for each other. Does that make me as a person unloveable? No, definitely not. It just means I found someone who wasn’t my person. That’s what dating is though! And unfortunately sometimes it takes a few months (or years) to figure out that someone isn’t your person. Be glad it was only a few months, and remember that someone deciding you aren’t what/who they want is usually an individual thing and not a comment on your general worth.
Honestly I wouldn’t be okay with my partner doing this either.
Lol yes, blame the abuse victim for going back to his support system because he’s a man.
Thank you for proving you cannot read, because there was not a single curse in that comment. 

No one said verbal abuse between parents doesn’t affect kids. I simply said abuse directed at the parents isn’t treated as abuse directed at kids in the eyes of the law. But, you have made it crystal clear you have some utterly abhorrent reading comprehension, so at least that makes sense why you don’t understand the difference. Have a good day now.
He is probably disenchanted with serious dating right now, and likely wasn’t very interested in you either. If I had to take a guess, he is having trouble finding and keeping someone he feels that intense chemistry with and has decided to only look for casual sex now. It’s his journey and his burden to bear, I wouldn’t let it weigh too much on you. You’ll find someone who treats you well, but I would start by setting a higher bar for yourself than 6 months in and never being on a date.
There’s an exceptionally large difference between parking illegally in a private residential spot and an emergency services access area and you know it. The issue is exactly that— people who take a mild inconvenience and definitely AH behavior like taking someone’s assigned spot in an apartment and trying to inflate it to as bad a crime as indirectly leading to someone’s death, worthy of the same punishment. Thank you for proving my point, too many people don’t know how to differentiate.
NTA. This is when you say, “family doesn’t take advantage of other family. You used grandma and I’m not letting you use me too. If you don’t knock it off, I’m blocking you all and any breaks you or your kids have been getting from me will end.”

And just stick to it. Be firm. Your uncle is a leech and will bleed you dry. If you aren’t firm and willing to follow through with cutting him out entirely, you won’t keep that inheritance for long, as he’ll find a way to suck it from you too.
INFO: it’s legal in your state. Why did he feel the need to hide this information? If he’s at the point where he feels shame for his habit, it’s an addiction/dependency and he needs professional intervention. Otherwise, there is no reason to hide information with no legal repercussions from medical staff.
Well, remember that not everyone is responsible and only spends the money they have. This is how people end up with payday loans or tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt.
You act like people are responsible and only spend money they have. You can take out loans to pay for a wedding or go into credit card debt.
The weekends were something she asked for in the future, that isn’t happening now. You need to go and read the post again. She works 6-6 5 days a week. It’s not an abnormal work schedule. And I repeat— working until 6 PM doesn’t make you an unfit parent. Yes, even getting home at 7 pm. Fighting with your husband does not make you an unfit parent. Does it make you a *good* parent? No. But you seem to think if you aren’t a perfect parent a court will say “oh nope, you can’t see your kids anymore! They should go with their dad” and that just isn’t how it works. 

Understand this: BEING A BAD PARENT AND AN UNFIT PARENT ARE NOT THE SAME THING AND THIS WOMAN IS A BAD PARENT BUT SHE IS NOT AN UNFIT MOTHER. THE COURTS WILL NOT TAKE HER RIGHT TO SEE HER CHILDREN AWAY FROM HER AND MAKE IT SO THE FATHER CAN LEAVE THE COUNTRY WITH THEM. 

Hopefully the caps will get through your thick skull and if not, I’m not going to keep explaining to you the basic concept of “wanting something to be true does not make it true”.
Nah, she sounds 19
Definitely don’t text him again. I’m not judging for casual sex, but don’t let yourself be used for sex like that. He isn’t that interested and he would only agree to hang out because “eh I guess she isn’t bad enough not to fuck and I am horny” and not because of you as a person. You can use your hand or a toy and have a better time than that. Sorry he isn’t interested, it will likely happen with most guys you sleep with if it isn’t an established relationship/close to beforehand. It’s okay to decide you are or aren’t okay with that reality, but proceed accordingly in the future to what you’re okay with.
It could be, idk, but I am unfortunately familiar with “excessive gaming” being because of an affair, so I won’t project, but definitely a thing. A way more common than I ever wanted to know thing. 

But, the rest of my comment stands. Affair or no affair, doesn’t seem to change the heart of the issue and her unwillingness to change said issues. You can choose yourself and allow yourself to be happy. She’s chosen to be miserable it would seem. You don’t need to go along for that ride though.
Trauma bonding and codependency are definitely a thing and wouldn’t surprise me if it played a role here. I feel for OOP, but I wish she treated herself better than to keep putting up with this much drama for what can be at best considered a difficult relationship. I hope the wedding is uneventful, for her sake.
Hahaha well, the idea of her cheating or not aside, I think if you view your partner having an affair as *an improvement* you should take that as a pretty big sign that something is fundamentally broken in your relationship and if your partner is unwilling or unable to see and work towards fixing that, then maybe the relationship isn’t meant to work out.

It’s okay, btw, for you to leave. You’re right. You DONT deserve this. And you can’t make someone get help, if she’s refusing to make any changes, it seems as though there is only two paths forward— you both stay miserable or only she stays miserable. Maybe one day she’ll choose happiness, but you can’t choose that for her. You can choose it for yourself though.
Yeah OP said there was nowhere else to park in the post, and it was 2 am and they were tired. Plus, honestly, I personally wouldn’t go the confrontation route, too many crazy people in the world.
She literally works until 6 pm, in the post. Most people get off work at 5, it’s an hour different. Most people aren’t unfit or unable to be there for their kids, so the hour isn’t going to change that. 

She is absolutely abusive to *her husband* but none of that is directed at her kids. You want to make it the same thing as being abusive to her kids and I get it, really, I do, but *it just isnt in the eyes of the law*. She’s completely fit to be a mom. This isn’t about me saying she isn’t abusive, this is about me pointing out she IS abusive, to her husband, NOT her kids. There is no way she will be deemed unfit by a court, so his choices are either stay in an abusive situation or leave to his home country. If she won’t willingly give up her kids, then there may be a tough choice to be made. I can’t tell you how many tragic stories I’ve heard of women in the same positions who needed to escape abuse and their partners used the kids as a pawn. If you don’t understand this sad reality, idk what to tell you.
Absolutely!! Be kind to yourself, you can and should allow yourself to feel how you feel, the panic attacks, crying, not eating? That’s real heartbreak. Even the constantly checking his location. It isn’t *healthy* but it is totally normal. You can allow yourself to give into it for a bit, but make sure to give yourself a hard deadline for fully indulging your sadness because you don’t want to lose yourself in this. You WILL survive this. You WILL find someone else, and they WILL make you forget the pain you’re feeling now. That’s life. And just remember, you’ll make it through this, whatever happens.
Working until 6 PM and having a shitty marriage is NOT child abuse. Not by any legal definition, which is all that will matter. I’m sorry, but you’re just factually wrong about how a custody battle would look. You can say what you think should happen until you’re blue in the face but it just isn’t how it works. No judge will say this is abuse, because it isn’t. Working until 6 PM isn’t “not having time for your kids”. It’s called “having a job”. It’s delusional to imply that’s abusive— it’s a fucking extra hour on the normal work schedule!! Plenty of people work until 5 and have a 1-1.5 hour commute. I just cannot fathom how you can intelligently argue working until 6 pm means you don’t have time for your kids. 

His support system is in another country. He may not be able to afford to live in this country alone with his kids. That means, yes, the options are either stay in an abusive situation or leave, because unless his wife willing allows him to take the kids, he cannot take the kids. You want the world to work a certain way, and I get that, but it doesn’t.
Lmao, yeah, the sub that notoriously has a huge gender bias against men having a huge gender bias against men is shocking.
Your partner telling you “no”, planning a bunch of activities to prevent you from being able to and then using your kids as a pawn to prevent you from having any free time to go see your friend because “she’s not comfortable going on the activities alone” *isnt* controlling to you? Wtf? Of course that is. The wife always plans the trips. Again, imagine it’s because she forces herself in that role and doesn’t allow OP to plan things, which is a pretty fair assumption with her blatantly telling him no when he asks to plan something here. OP asks to make time for his friend. She flat out just says “no” and then makes it virtually impossible for him to actually go and do it on his own otherwise he’ll be the reason why his kids can’t go do xyz for fun. 

You cannot genuinely tell me if a man did that to his wife you wouldn’t be waving the red flag. And honestly, if you can’t see how easily this is just a controlling partner, then this conversation is pointless anyway, because it’s pretty apparent to anyone who looks at behavior more than gender. Have a good day now.
… really? You think that’s *less* evidence of her being controlling? That is THE evidence for her being controlling. Just because he’s a man and she’s a woman, let’s not act like that changes anything.
They very obviously only invited OP because they know she’s really good at planning and researching for these sort of trips. It was about what she provides, not her presence.
It’s a road trip. They clearly aren’t driving to get to a destination, they’re driving to enjoy and experience the journey, so it’s not the same as “lets get a bit of sustenance” it’s “let’s see what X city has to offer”. That’s not a reason why they couldn’t plan things though.
It’s a 20 hour road trip. At that point, it seems rather obvious that part of the vacation *IS* the driving, and in that case yes, I think it’s fair to want something more than McDonald’s. You don’t go to hawaii and do nothing but eat fast food, ya know? With gas, car rentals, hotels and food, it’s definitely cheaper to fly if it’s a 20 hour trip, so for sure this is supposed to be part of the experience for them. 


And experience which they absolutely only invited OP on to plan things for them and they need to be adults and ya know, plan things themselves.
It’s good you recognized this is most likely heading towards a breakup. I think it’s best to prepare yourself for it being a breakup, and all of your emotions are natural. You can give yourself a few weeks to grieve a 5 year relationship and make sure that next week you are firm in “we are either together and you are in therapy working towards sorting yourself out or we are done and NC” because anything else is going to destroy you and you need to look out for YOUR mental health. 

He might be happier right now. He’s got friends around, booze, and feels a lot less pressure to be happy or act a certain way. It sucks, it isn’t your fault. You need to trust that this is part of his journey and isn’t a reflection of you necessarily. I’m sorry you’re going through this. Be careful to let yourself feel the hurt while also cutting yourself off once it’s officially done from hurtful info— his location, his SM, anything else that gives insight into his life moving forward. It will only hurt.
That is definitely not true, I have known a number of people who meet a partner or fling or whatever you want to call it, online playing video games never leaving their house.
Is she taking on the mental load or is she just a Type A  personality and controlling? Because remember controlling people do exist and they can be women, and it definitely sounds way more “I’m doing things MY way and you don’t get a say” rather than the typical “nothing ever happens if I don’t do everything and he never gives any input” you see here.
Typically holier than thou redditor ego, seeing as any rational human being knows having your car towed from a private property like that is going to be at least a few hundred bucks which unless you’re quite wealthy is going to hurt at best and seriously endanger your financial well-being at worst. Don’t park illegally, but we also have no idea if this person got lost or what, and the idea that we should treat any mistake as if it’s the end of the world acts as though people don’t routinely make mistakes, and they do. Some kindness and grace should be afforded for what is a normal human experience, because even though you think “well *I* would NEVER do xyz!!!” That probably isn’t as true as you think.
You should sit him down outside of these moments and ask to talk about something with him, honestly. Then say, “I’ve noticed a pattern lately, we’ll be talking and out of nowhere it seems like you’ll say I’m not funny and should stop trying to be funny. But the reality is I’m not trying to be funny. I have never tried to be funny, this is just my personality and how I talk, so it feels like you’re not only criticizing my humor but also who I am. It’s made me think and I’ve realized you’ve never even laughed at anything I’ve said and while I meant it when I said I never try to make you or anyone else laugh, it’s made me think you don’t enjoy me or my company much, and that’s becoming an issue for me we need to address so I’m hoping we can have an open discussion about what’s been going on.”
Eh, it’s also been 3 months, I don’t really think you can conclusively say anything about what this other woman does or doesn’t know.
Well, have the conversation again and next time she replies with that just say, “okay, then it’s clear the relationship isn’t working out. Let’s part ways”. She’s either bluffing, in which case you need to call it out or she ISNT bluffing and it’s only a matter of time before she breaks up with you, so might as well beat her to it and leave with your dignity.
You literally just tell her plainly “if this is how you feel, we need to break up. If you still want to stay together, you need to stop the comments. Which one?” And make her pick and hold her to whatever she picks. If she refuses to pick, tell her you’ve picked for her and it’s over. 

Stop being so passive and firmly shut the behavior down and if she doesn’t back down, you end it. Pretty easy way to show someone what you will and won’t tolerate.
I…. Think you just need to communicate with her, “are you really this unsure about our relationship? Because if you are, I think we should end things now. It isn’t fair to either of us to stay in a relationship where you’re having this much doubts. And if you aren’t that unsure, you need to really be mindful of your language, because it’s starting to feel like you don’t want to be with me, and at this point it’s honestly making it difficult for ME to want to continue seeing you.” 

And then see where the conversation goes, but really, if she doesn’t say “hey, you’re right this was super uncool behavior, I’m sorry and I’ll work on it”, you probably should just end things sooner rather than later, as it’s pretty obvious this isn’t a relationship made to stand the test of time, so if marriage is a goal of yours, why even bother here anymore? Move on to someone who will be sure of you.
LMAO props to you for not even blinking at the ultimate manipulation your family tried to play and just *shutting it down* so hard even the cops breaking up a house party would be impressed.
He was also very likely getting ready to end it if OP hadn’t, “I’m unhappy in our relationship” means “if you don’t change, I’m out”.
You’re aware your opinion doesn’t change how courts sometimes handle these situations right? No, it isn’t okay. But generally, unless the *kids* are in physical danger, courts try to keep both parents in their life. The husband wouldn’t be able to get her deemed unfit and take them out of the country. This isn’t a comment on how things *should* be, but a reminder that unfortunately, no, she is not unfit to be a mother and unfortunately, if the husband’s support system is in another country, he won’t really be able to take his kids with him unless the wife will allow it, and she doesn’t seem the type to do so freely.
You… did though. What do you think saying someone is unfit to be a mother means?
Also, 300 m^2 isn’t really big enough for two separate families. I don’t know if you are currently or ever plan to have a family or even just a partner/pet, but while 300 m2 is good for you and your needs, it isn’t really a two family house as a *permanent* set up, which this obviously would be.
That is definitely not how it works. Plenty of parents work until 6 pm 5 days a week and aren’t forbidden from seeing their kids. That’s insane to suggest.

And even her abuse means nothing if it isn’t provably directed towards her children. Family custody battles unfortunately are notorious for failing to take into consideration abuse of a partner when deciding custody. If she gets even partial custody, he can’t just move them out of the country.
Might not be an option. Abusive partners often don’t just let you walk away with their children and I don’t think he would legally be able to just take them without a custody arrangement to another country. Unfortunately, leaving an abusive relationship isn’t always easy and there isn’t always an easy solution when someone wants to make your life miserable and willing to use your children as pawns just to hurt/control you.
Sure but there’s also plenty of free porn too, that doesn’t stop people from paying the thousands of goth/whatever other category of girl on OF out there.
Does abuse actually change things though? It’s an unfortunate situation but I don’t think it changes the issue of “OP wants time alone with his family and doesn’t want to be paying for things for Harper like a father figure would.” That’s an acceptable boundary to have, yes even if abuse is at play. After all, if Jennifer is aware enough to tell Amber there is abuse at play, she’s aware enough to also know that she shouldn’t be staying and exposing her kid to that environment.
You do you, but it’s unreasonable to suggest you won’t even leave your house until your long term boyfriend is where he said he would meet you.
Trying without any belief it will change isn’t trying, it’s going through the motions.
Therapy is a joke because you’ve decided it’s a joke. Of course if you go into something convinced it will never help, it won’t help 😂 that’s like thinking everyone will break up with you… you make yourself so miserable to be around it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
He cheated on you and feels guilty.
OP said she was living with this guy talking about fantasies of marriage and she’s also extremely close to this cousin. The cousin knew OP had a pregnancy scare with her summer fling, she just didn’t have a name or a face apparently, which feels so weird to me. Possible, absolutely, just so weird.
Ok pause. You’re saying you’re still not over the ex you had at 22? It’s time for therapy. No, you aren’t unlovable, but you are stagnating yourself. It’s okay not to be over him. But you need help, it’s time to love yourself enough to get it.
I think you need to be honest with her, and be very very blunt. “Hey (friend), sorry to message but I didn’t want to wait until closer to the wedding. I love you and want to support you as much as I can on your special day, but I have a very hard budget for how much I can spend in total on the wedding. It’s ($x). I’ve already contributed ($y). I wanted to be really clear that from now on I can’t contribute anything else and I am not comfortable asking people who don’t know you to come to any paid events. If you no longer want me to be a bridesmaid, I will step down and be a regular guest because I don’t want to be a source of stress for you, but I’ve felt a lot of pressure to spend more than I am able to and while I understand it’s unintentional, I want to be really transparent with you.”

And then go from there.
You would be incredibly selfish to message him knowing he is in a relationship. Let him move on. If they break up and you’re still single and feel this way, reach out, but know your place. Do not invite that sort of bad karma into the world.
I’d do it over FaceTime in your backyard, garage or even walking to a park.
Just tell him then, “I want a kid and that hasn’t changed. If you’ve changed you’re mind, that’s you’re right, but we’re no longer compatible. I hope we can split quickly and amicably as I wish you no ill will but am firm on what I want in life.”
For either side, she’s allowed to be willing to die on this hill, but honestly if she knew her sibling was “at risk” and knew she was offering a safe haven, that should have been a conversation she had with her boyfriend long before it came to fruition. Then they could’ve had the discussion and had a plan and he wouldn’t have felt like an outsider in his own home.
To be honest, I would figure out if you can move on from this, if you can’t (and NO ONE would blame you), simply tell her you found her notes and want a divorce, but decide beforehand. I would either accept it and leave it be or tell her you’re looking for a divorce but I wouldn’t tell her what you found and expect your marriage to survive.
I mean hey, if you’ve decided how you want to handle it, go ahead! I hope it goes as well as it can!
Well, she very realistically may be sacrificing her relationship. She seems okay with it, but she should’ve been more upfront about her priorities.
Look fam, if you’re willing to be dumped over this, go ahead, but fully understand that YOURE in the wrong here, not him. You always communicate beforehand, even if the answer is “I am helping my sibling and if you are unwilling to support me in this it’s a dealbreaker”, but you need to have that conversation first. He’d be a fool to propose to a woman who can’t even respect him enough to give him a phone call before agreeing. Your sibling can wait another 20 minutes.
Yeah, but even before all that, how did OP know her cousin was in the same school and major yet never mention his name to the cousin or so much as a picture? I know my closest friend’s partners names and faces well enough that I would *definitely* recognize them if they showed up in my physics class.
Don’t even wait 3 days. Tell her she needs to get a job and start contributing. Let her start the divorce herself.
If you want to protect yourself, you get in front of it. Don’t just wait for him to decide he’s built a strong enough case, instead strike first.
INFO: have you contacted the school and asked for an exception? Because most schools will give out more than the two tickets if you ask.
I mean, the reality is what other choice does she have? Live in her car? She has no family or friends around, is attending a school with poor resources and doesn’t make enough to easily afford a new place. Sometimes you HAVE to act ignorant for self preservation. Not everyone has the luxury to immediately and shamelessly leave shitty situations.
Idk man…. The facts here, I see no way for OP to go “hey, you need to pay for a new place for me” and the grandma to go “oh, okay! Here you go”. I mean like, I guess maybe she could? But I *very* much doubt it, especially because OP’s boyfriend would likely step in and even if he didn’t, I don’t really see a world where a landlord is *legally required* to provide alternative accommodation AND *legally unable* to simply terminate the lease, hence it being a situation that would likely require a legal battle if there’s even any chance of success, which I’m dubious of. I don’t really care to get into a back and forth on hypothetical legal situations though, suffice to say, OP’s housing situation sounds on borrowed time, so she’s better off focusing on that right now and only then looking into anything else if she’s so inclined, because I’m sure if she tried anything legal with her boyfriends elderly grandmother, unless she has backup accommodations right then and there, he isn’t going to continue living with her as she tries to sue his grandma, or even send a strongly worded legal letter.
Definitely OP needs to learn renters rights and how to protect herself, but at this point in time, she probably has much more pressing matters than any potential recourse re:the old apartment. Sometimes unfortunately you learn lessons the hard way. Long, expensive and complicated legal battles aren’t always the answer.
There’s a good chance it wouldn’t go anywhere, landlords are under no obligation to inform you about renter’s insurance, that’s your own responsibility to limit your own liability. Some places landlords can require it, but I’ve never heard of anywhere saying a landlord needs to. Usually the way the law is written a landlord either needs to repair the damage OR if the place is uninhabitable, they can terminate the lease, which it sounds like is what she likely did. I obviously don’t know the law everywhere, but don’t feel bad about not wanting to pursue anything legally, as I can’t imagine a judge seeing “I didn’t know I needed insurance, why didn’t anyone tell me?!” As a very good excuse.
I’m sure it depends, but if the place is uninhabitable, the landlord is allowed usually to just end the lease, which is what it sounds like she did. Typically landlords are only under obligation for their home to be habitable and in the case where it isn’t, end the lease, not to provide adequate housing elsewhere if their accommodations are uninhabitable. Renter’s insurance is what provides accommodation if yours is unavailable, and it’s definitely NOT the responsibility of the landlord to tell you about renter’s insurance, that’s on you to do research and decide. Some places require it, but that’s mostly for their own protections. OP can definitely try to double check, but given her situation, her time money and effort would probably be better spent finding a place to live that meets her needs and she can afford on her own, as I suspect this “friend” won’t let OP stay much longer, much less past when the bf inevitably lets the beans spill.
You probably don’t want to hear it, but unless you have a backup plan, no I would not say anything to him. Right now, things are only somewhat fine because he’s under the impression you’re none the wiser. As soon as you let him know there is no reason to pretend, there’s a goooood chance things get very ugly, and at this point it seems like the people you’re living with are only letting you stay because of your boyfriend. You gotta look out for yourself number 1, so take this information and plan. Find an apartment on your own and get a move in date of asap. Only then should you bring it up, as most likely once you do, he’ll be honest with you and good chance you get kicked out of where you’re staying.
Probably would send them a “we’re so happy you want to celebrate officially becoming a family, but we are holding off on the big celebration with a dress and photos until baby is old enough to be a part. This is important to us and hope you will respect our feelings as they won’t change. That being said, we’d love to have you and fiancée’s parents (said this was as your husband should be sending the message, not you) over for dinner to celebrate all of the good fortune in our lives lately!”
Did you buy or sell? I don’t know if the person who bought/sold it did so? Maybe the real estate agent? Honestly I have no idea how it works, and id say it *usually* is pretty accurate, but it definitely can be inaccurate and I suspect it has to do with someone incorrectly reporting it. Fringe case for sure, but Zillow definitely isnt getting the info from the government for every sale, that’s for sure!

But yes, I saw the price and was a bit annoyed— I wish I didn’t have to spend that extra $100k! But I definitely did.
500k in lottery winnings comes with a minimum $125k in federal taxes and a potential additional $44k in state taxes. That means he only got a maximum of $330-375k. That’s still a lot of money! But it isn’t “buy my family a house” money or “retire early” money. And that’s assuming he was in a position to save all of it, but most likely he had some debts or large purchases he was able to make with that money, like student loans, credit card debt, maybe he paid off a mortgage or bought a new car. 

It sucks, but money doesn’t go anywhere near as far as people think it does, especially when you factor in taxes. So, just remember, even with that huge leg up, you probably can/should still have sympathy for him for all that stuff.
Yep. And for mine, it shows a completely and wildly inaccurate price that’s more than $100k less than I paid, and a price that was never even remotely possible so, while yes it’s a good starting point, it isn’t always 100% accurate.
Just a heads up, those aren’t accurate and must be self-reported by someone. The house I bought was listed as being sold for well over $100k less than I paid. And since I know how much I paid, I know that Zillow was very much not correct.
Well, they’re only 22 now so….. I would probably say there’s not a huge difference between discussing it when they’re 18-19 (the ages they actually were, as they met at 15 and were together for 3+ years) and at 22. It’s really only 3 years different and yes you change in that time, but idk if you’re really ready for marriage at that point where you weren’t before, ya know? But also…. I just find it so hard to understand how OP can be madly in love with him and living with him, but her cousin who she’s really close to and is in the same major and school as had no idea, nor did Kenny. How did you not say anything? All my friends knew about my partner within a few dates, certainly 3 years and marriage talks would never happen without showing a picture or giving a name, ESPECIALLY if I knew someone knew my partner from outside of me. And then, how can you have that sort of heartbreak (it’s rather obvious Kenny ended things) and not say anything to your cousin about it like “hey don’t date him I’m not over him”? Idk man, sounds really weird.
Again, doctors are more than just MDs, and even so, yes, the starting average salary is 211k for medical doctors. That’s after residency, but you can complete your residency in your mid-late 20s, especially if you do medical school in another country or take advantage of a number of accelerated programs that pretty much every med school offers. 

Remember just because you haven’t had this experience, doesn’t mean it hasn’t and can’t happen to someone else. My niece has just graduated as a doctor, yes being vague to illustrate my point, and makes $185k at 24, with a signing bonus of over $10k, and my sibling who graduated a few years ago was able to purchase a 4 bedroom home in a really nice area at 23, this one not a doctor, but in a well paying field. I wouldn’t call it a mansion, but it’s an impressive achievement at 23. 

It happens. It might not be common, but personal experiences on Reddit aren’t supposed to be the average experience, they’re supposed to be what happens to you. So, try to open your perspective on what you see as possible more and don’t discount something as an obvious troll/fake just because you personally haven’t seen something happen. But in the end, totally up to you what to think of what you read on the internet!
It’s grossly selfish to stay in a relationship with the intention of thinking you can change her mind. So, assume she is 100% serious on NEVER wanting kids. If you know wanting kids is a must have in your life (to the best of your abilities), you two are fundamentally incompatible and the only honorable thing to do is leave her to find someone who doesn’t want kids either. 

If you think the right person is worth not having kids for, I would be very honest with her so she is allowed the choice as well, “I have always wanted kids but I also feel a very strong connection with you. I am not asking you to change your mind, but more I am open to seeing if our relationship develops into something more where I accept not being a father, but I also want to give you the choice on if you’re on board, because I can’t guarantee how I will feel in the future and don’t want to put you in an unfair position if we ultimately do disagree.”

Now, chances are she probably will also say, “hey let’s call it here and save us the potential heartbreak”, but at least you’re being open and respecting this woman enough to communicate openly with her. So many guys hear a woman say “I do not want children” and think it means “I don’t want kids *right now*” or think to themselves, “well it’s too early to think about kids anyway so let’s reevaluate in a few months/years”. But no, do not do that. This is WHY people bring it up early, because they don’t want to be in love with someone and have to break up. They know if there’s a fundamental incompatibility it’s just not worth pursuing the relationship further because you can be on the same page in everything and a relationship STILL fail, why pursue one where it’s break is inevitable?
…. Uhm, yes lol it is. The pandemic completely changed the game for salaries in fields with burnout and high demand.

Dentists: average starting is $123k with source: https://research.com/careers/average-dentist-starting-salary

Doctors: sources vary pretty widely depending on specialty, but average entry level doctor salary is $211k with source: https://www.salary.com/research/salary/posting/entry-level-doctor-salary

Vets: $107k average starting salary with source: https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2021-12-01/increase-veterinarians-starting-salaries-long-overdue-economist-says

And this is average starting, meaning a lot of people make substantially more than this right out of the gate. I know a number of people who were graduating this year and had $150k+ offers with starting bonuses just because they were well educated, and there’s such a high demand right now and not enough supply. I don’t really know why it’s so surprising to see why a specialized field in medicine would start out low six figures? Even nurses right now are making $100k+ starting in certain areas. Location matters, your education matters, the experience you gained in school matters, heck, even your connections matter, but it’s definitely not a crazy idea to me at all that someone out there could be a doctor and have a nice ass house before they’re 30.
Girl, come now. Don’t be so dense. He’s 8 years older than you and already trying to isolate you. He wants you to move in with him and is displaying an issue with your job. He wants you to be financially reliant on him to survive, and if you are, then you can’t go back to school to finish your degree. He’s doing his best to make you his good little housewife and you’re playing right into it.
You’re going through something serious, and something scary. You are looking for support and you’re not getting it. You and your boyfriend are both so young that it’s no surprise he isn’t equipped to handle this well, but neither of you are handling the stress too well. 

You shouldn’t need to make up anything, as you did nothing wrong. Ultimately even though it hurts, you need to accept that he is entitled to feel how he feels and if he’s unable to be understanding and supportive of his sick and scared girlfriend, he isn’t the right one for you.
I mean……. No? Lol they are definitely also doctors and it’s also the internet, it’s not super uncommon for people to be intentionally vague about personal details. But anyway, like I said, it’s definitely an unusual path, but totally possible to be a doctor in your mid 20s and have a really nice house.
I was the one who added the med school, the other person just said “a doctor”. You can become a doctor a number of ways without going to med school.

So I reiterate, you can definitely be a doctor in your mid 20s and have a really nice house. Maybe uncommon, definitely doable though.
It’s not even an okay marriage and you’re thinking of staying? Man, you do you, but you’re only 30. If “just okay” is your standard, you can find “just okay” with someone who isn’t going to cheat on you.
Not residency, that’s totally true, but could be a vet or a dentist which makes 6 figures right out of school and are still doctors.
No, he’s over it at this point and moved on to someone else most likely. Trying to fix things is going to make you seem creepy and desperate at this point. Just let it go, you’ve learned something about dating and about yourself and take that with you for future experiences.
I agree here, BUT she also shouldn’t have sex with him if she’d feel used if it was just sex, because it’s very possible that’s how it ends too and she shouldn’t have sex if it will harm her mental health just to potentially keep someone around either.
Am I the only one who thinks it’s at least a little bit wrong to effectively try to manipulate someone into a relationship by using sex as a bargaining chip? I’m not saying it’s wrong to wait to have sex at all, but based on the post it very much feels like she was only waiting because she *was* playing a game.
True, could easily be a dentist or vet, which are doctors, no residency required and both have six figure starting salaries. Like I said, definitely possible, even if not the path most take.

As for student loans, I know when I was in school, more people than you would think graduated without substantial student loans, either trough scholarships, help from parents, or working through school, but that also was very heavily influenced by my going to a top school where most of my class was well off. I’m just a proponent of “even if something isn’t possible for you, doesn’t mean it isn’t possible for anyone” lol
Question— why were you on your laptop and taking calls when hosting a number of friends in your home you hadn’t seen in a bit? That seems to break a lot of hosting etiquette rules and while I’m not calling you an AH for it, does seem like if you weren’t on your laptop or taking calls in the first place this wouldn’t have happened.
Fam, you’re clearly way too young to be on the internet if you think the employees would ever call the cops AND in the event they did, that the cops would do anything more than generally gesture to take a look into it and never follow up.
I mean….. it’s not actually as wild as you think. You graduate from school at around 24-25 if you go straight through and your starting salary can easily be $175k+ with the demand right now, with large starting bonuses and even more if you go into critical/emergency care. You could feasibly be 25-26 and with that level of income afford a $500k-$600k house, which in the right area could absolutely be a mansion or pretty close. And yes, I am talking about in today’s day and age, not 25 years ago.

Definitely not the path most take, but if you prioritize buying a home over renting, I know plenty of mid 20s who own homes and they don’t have nearly the income a new doctor today would have.

ETA: true, med school requires residency, but dentists and vets don’t require residency and are making $100-175k right out of school so, like I said, comment still stands. Just because something is *uncommon* doesn’t mean it’s entirely impossible.
Did we get an age on the friend? He could be older and away at college and in an apartment rented/owned by family. OOP being 18 doesn’t necessarily mean all of his friends are his age, and I knew plenty of people who lived in apartments/houses their family owned while away at school.
That’s why it was so crazy everyone was blaming OOP for simply saying to leave her out of this one. I mean, he’s a parent to two children, and it *should* be on him to manage his own relationship with *his* daughter rather than relying on the step-mom to always be the manager. I feel like it’s super common for people to give the advice “stop fixing things for xyz, otherwise they’ll never learn how to deal with it on their own”, yet here when OOP simply comes to the conclusion of I won’t be fixing things this time, he needs to learn, she’s in the wrong? Just interesting how differently people can perceive the exact same behavior based on if it was advice they gave or just naturally how a person decides to handle a situation. There was no easy answer here, but I get OOP wanting to be able to not always be the decision maker.
Did she delete some posts? Because the ones I see now, while clearly paint her as deeply unhappy in the relationship, shows she’s more of the problem than him, or at least they’re equally the problem.
Hahaha you mean like a teenager would be upset he’s told he needs to finish his chores before he goes out with his friends?
They’re definitely not that much anymore unless you’re *trying* to find something expensive. I went to a show a few months ago and it was $200 for the most expensive seats there were, and plenty of options in the ~$50 range. If you want to do a Broadway show it doesn’t need to be break the bank expensive.
OP is an electrical engineer. Engineers are pretty unanimously across the US excluded from overtime pay, as it is a professional and has the advanced degree exemption.
I mean, he clearly picked her when he yelled at you for your behavior so…. I wouldn’t test this any further if I were you and would just apologize and offer to step down from the wedding party OR wear whatever dress they pick, whatever they prefer. 

Otherwise, kiss your friendship with Mark goodbye.
You should try to repair the relationship but also be aware some of them may not want an enabler in their lives anymore.

I mean….. her behavior in this story alone should be enough to tell you it’s entirely possible she cut them all off for not doing exactly as she said.
I’d just send one message saying “if you truly feel badly about what you did, let me move on and stop contacting me. I have no ill will towards you anymore but I also have no desire to have you in my life in any capacity.”
Oh no, it gets *worse* later, it can start very young though.
If OP says he doesn’t love her that’s totally fair, but a month is plenty of time for love for plenty of people. She definitely needs some help, but she doesn’t appear to be looking for a victim/supply. She sounds like any other insecure 22 year old who doesn’t know how to self regulate their emotions and is hoping a guy will do it for her. Try not to have the darkest outlook possible on people’s intentions when there is a way more common and way more likely answer in that she’s just emotionally immature and struggling with her own demons.
You should be encouraging her to get some therapy because you don’t like hearing someone you love say such things.
Well, this was a new partner and you frankly aren’t entitled to know about a deeply personal letter like that. You said this happened in the beginning of your relationship.
He’s 7. Good chance he’s using Sky BECAUSE it pisses his mom off. Tell her to lay off and take away the appeal of sky being the rebellious name and then maybe he’ll change his mind in time. Or he won’t, but telling a little boy they CANT do something only ever makes them want to do it more.
How long was that stick?
Correct, but this is an established “thing” TM in the horse world.
You don’t sound like you’re a big horse person. Horse people flock to horse people and can be as clique-y as high school mean girls. It’s no surprise the two of them would gravitate to one another when they share such a massive hobby and love of horses. It also sounds like you’re projecting your feelings of loneliness onto the man. Instead, talk to your wife. Tell her you miss one on one time and ask to carve out some time for a date night AND her horse back riding. Communication is key and a marriage takes work on both parties. If you communicate your needs and ask her to help problem solve on how to make time to reconnect, I’m sure these feelings you’re projecting onto the friend’s husband will dissipate, because the real issue here is you don’t feel like you’re spending enough alone time with your wife.
This is only 3 months in? The fuck? Just send him a message back, “you keep trying to guilt me about who loves who more yet you don’t even feel strongly enough about me to be in a genuine relationship. At this point, it’s really clear everything you say is just manipulation to keep getting in my pants and *I* respectful *myself* enough to stop allowing the disrespect. I don’t think it’s a good idea for us to be friends after this, it’s clear you don’t have my best interests at heart and are only interested in getting your dick wet. Don’t worry, I’m sure someone other than me can fill that role. Goodbye and goodluck.”

Then block him. He’s just using you and thinks you have no self esteem. Prove him wrong.
Interesting, I see the opposite on Reddit— everyone says that you should be willing to love your partner regardless of weight/appearance. I definitely disagree there, within reason. 5-10 lbs, whatever. A significantly change in appearance/lifestyle that now clashes with yours though is as much an incompatibility as anything else.

But yes, I agree especially BEFORE you’re in a relationship, if you’ve struggled with weight it’s totally understandable not wanting to be with someone you think wouldn’t be able to handle fluctuations in weight. Never put yourself in a relationship you think might weigh on your own mental well being.
I mean, you can decide not to date someone for literally any reason, yes.
No we’re talking about exactly the same thing! People who think weight doesn’t matter and attraction/lack thereof isn’t a valid reason not to date someone are delusional. But, it’s also fair to not want to date someone who rejected you before solely because of your weight OR even just someone who rejected you before but now can’t get anyone better and is desperate. This is one of those “no one is wrong but actions have consequences” moments.
We can not judge them and also recognize that someone you rejected for any reason probably won’t want to be a second choice.
Where do you live? I’d like to read into this.
I mean, he said in more words that he was an AH for the sake of being an AH because the elderly couple did something a little sneaky too. Seems like no one is amazing here though I can’t blame the elderly couple for giving a try something they probably saw online and had no idea it wouldn’t work.
Am I the only one not believing he’s actually bad at giving gifts and it’s just that OP thinks anything other than exactly what she wants is terrible? I mean… a terrible gift giver doesn’t just come up with a thoughtful gift like this, and the “coaching” more sounds like her just telling him exactly what to get, and since she clearly didn’t this year, he still got a lovely gift and put together a sweet day for her.
It probably wouldn’t be a bad idea to just know if you have toxic plants on the property. Not sure if they’re toxic just to pets or to kids as well (or even if you ever invite kids over) but just being able to quickly know in an emergency is never a bad idea! Even if it’s something as simple as asking the gardener to text you when he plants something new.
Get the annulment and then sue her in civil court for the cost of things. You may not win, but you might. It’s easy to represent yourself.
Fam. You’re the problem here, not the ex and not the boyfriend.
It depends on what vibe you’re going for. Is this a new partner or an established relationship? You don’t look cute, but you do look ready to hike. If you’re the type who want someone who loves you even with no effort, this is fine because you’re dressed for the activity. If you still want to look cute and functional, there are hiking/athletic skirts, you could do two braids in your hair, and a cuter more fitting tank top/sports bra and matching socks instead.

And a lot of sunscreen.
It’s either couple’s therapy or divorce. But he isn’t an intentional abuser who would use therapy only to find new ways to abuse OP, he’s just letting his own issues be taken out on OP. There’s a difference. The bigger issue is with OP just working in a call center and both having extreme health issues and him being unemployed, they likely can’t afford couple’s therapy anyway.
Well, ask him if moving in together would help, otherwise, move on.
Bury his head in the sand the same way you are to the fact that your boyfriend very obviously doesn’t want to marry you?
He doesn’t want to propose to you and he doesn’t want to marry you. If he would marry you with no one watching, he would’ve been happy to let you propose. He’s lying to you and you’re letting him because that hurts less than the reality that he doesn’t want to marry you, but is fine enough to continue dating you indefinitely.
I mean at this point, your choices are stay as just a girlfriend and drop the desire to be engaged or wait until you piss him off and he dumps you.
I mean, by staying, you’ve just told him he actually NEVER needs to propose and you’ll just stay. Giving an ultimatum you don’t really mean is a death’s blow for EVER getting the thing, in this case marriage, you want. He is never proposing. He is never asking your father for your hand in marriage. You either get over it and accept it, or you leave, but you’ve totally screwed yourself over for any chance of him ever proposing now because you’ve proven your words and threats are meaningless.
Honestly ESH. Learn to say “No.” and leave it at that. Stop adding qualifiers and allowing yourself to be walked all over. Let the $100 go. But also just tell him that you don’t want to hire him and let that be it. No reasons. No chance to change your mind.
So…. You WANT this to happen again? I mean, do you think it’ll get easier if this keeps happening?
The space will be helpful because it’ll help distinguish between him/you actually wanting to work on things together or you two just being afraid of being alone. If he’s holding on because he’s just afraid of the unknown, then once he gets over that, the marriage will be done anyway. Taking that space makes it more likely that if you move forward it’s genuine and it also just helps to emphasize what being without you would be like, rather than giving him a nice easy transition to leaving you.
The first question you need an answer to is “does he want to work things out with you?” The second question you need an answer to is “do you want to work things out with him?” If you can both answer yes,  he needs to cut her out and send a message saying, “I feel our friendship is starting to cross a boundary that isn’t appropriate for either of us to continue speaking outside of work. It isn’t about you, but I am going to focus on my marriage”

The next thing is he needs to block her. You both need to sign up for marriage counseling and likely individual counseling too. Then, you two should take a break from one another, sleep in separate rooms for at least 6 weeks while you’re working through your feelings and how to move forward. Distance does make the heart grow fonder and often our desire to latch on even tighter in these moments makes it less likely the relationship survives. 

He needs to be honest with you about what he thinks she gets that you don’t and be willing to say the things he thinks are too hurtful. You need to be willing to hear him say some really painful things too. Only once all the issues are out in the open can you two begin to assess if this relationship is fixable. But it starts by deciding if you two are both willing to make it work and you are BOTH willing to make serious changes, otherwise there’s no real point in trying, it’ll only hurt you more.
I mean, plenty of people are shit heads throughout their entire 20s so there’s still help there. It isn’t a magic switch when you turn 25. It’s just that the brain is finally developed. But there’s plenty of people that don’t even START to grow up until that point. So, hopefully there’s hope for her
NTA. If this man were anyone other than your husband, you’d be the AH. You are fully within your rights to tell your husband another woman has a crush on him to ensure proper boundaries are always maintained. Doesn’t matter if the other woman is family or not.
It was a Mother’s Day meal…. I would hope she wouldn’t be a teenager.
INFO: you guys are married. 

Did you forget that once you get married it’s no longer mine and yours but ours? It makes no difference which one of your cards were used.
You’re giving him WAY too much leniency and it’s going to bite YOU in the ass, and hard.
Unless you want to follow in her footsteps, you need to set down some iron clad expectations with your husband because he’s your issue here. If he isn’t willing to put your comfort first, you probably won’t stay married very long.
It’s not the idea of someone asking you to choose. It’s the idea of two separate people’s ENTIRE family asking them to choose, despite knowing and getting along with one another for 7+ years AND three other completely unrelated people to OP. 

Once? Believable. Twice? Kinda weird but sure. No less than SEVEN people from FIVE different upbringings? Nah. Unless you were raised in a cult, but OP already said they weren’t.
Well, think about it this way, do you think people who made mistakes are unable to EVER change? If you do know people can change and learn from poor choices they’ve made, why don’t you think giving someone a chance is the right call? He’s a meth addict. It’ll be easy to spot if he’s still involved in shady shit. And then, if you’re making a judgment based on CURRENT behavior, go for it, but at least give someone a chance to see if it is truly in the past or not.
It’s the internet. If you wanna act like a dumbass and say something blatantly incorrect and easily googleable don’t be shocked when someone treats you like a dumbass.

If you think someone correcting you is rude, don’t have such a fragile ego you can’t take being wrong.
That isn’t the analogy you think it is, and I already said elsewhere it’s birds belonging to the psittacine family. Don’t comment correcting someone on something a quick google searches will give you the answer to. There isn’t really an excuse for misinformation in the age of the internet.
Apparently people in the sub about animals don’t know what animals are, but parrots are any bird in the psittacine family. Cockatiels are parrots. Budgies are parrots. Cockatoos are parrots. Macaws are parrots. There’s dozens of other species that are also parrots. 

Think of it the same way you’d think of a golden retriever. Golden retrievers are all dogs but not all dogs are golden retrievers. Same thing here.
Cockatiels are parrots. What did you think parrots were? That’s like saying a golden retriever isn’t a dog, it’s a golden retriever.
Cockatiels are parrots. What did you think parrots were? That’s like saying a golden retriever isn’t a dog, it’s a golden retriever.
What exactly do you think a parrot is?
Yeah, it’s more understandable to get a fake Diamond than fake shoes. Lmao
Girl, just admit you fucked up and apologize. Stop trying to make him the bad guy here. It was you, all you and JUST you.
Probably because she’s drunk, it’s her bachelorette party and people have been known to cheat during them and an ex came up to her and some really monogamous people can get really “honest” with alcohol involved so things don’t look shady. I’ve definitely done this before and while I looking back know it can seem more sus, it really just came from drunk anxiety brain combined with “I don’t want to feel like I’m hiding something totally innocent from my fiancé”. Alcohol definitely impairs your cognitive skills. I wouldn’t read into it much unless you think something more serious happened.

I would definitely tell my partner if I ran into an ex and I would expect them to do the same. The alcohol likely just added a sense of urgency to her wanting you to know.
INFO: do you sincerely believe you’ll be happy for life with this man? If not, don’t get married.
I… mean…. If you can afford it sure, but at some point you kinda need to start advocating for yourself unless you’re really cool spending all this money. It’s okay to just say, “I’m sorry but I can’t afford that right now. I can do without the (gift/experience/whatever it is)”
Damn, I can’t believe I’ve lived long enough to become the prude. But yeah, of course your relationship is going to suffer? You’re asking for non-monogamy. I would assume most men out there aren’t going to be okay with it. Personally, you sound waaaay too immature for a serious relationship, let alone a long distance one. But, if you want to start making content again, you need to tell him and see if he’s okay with it. If he isn’t, you need to make a choice— him and monogamy or the content and being single.
It’s normal for your age, but my god are 21 year old males shitheads sometimes.
Answer with a yes or no: have you ever had sex with your step-mother?
Dude has about as strong a grip of sarcasm as he does on the meaning of the word emergency then.
INFO: are you telling me your sister decided she no longer wanted to get married but never communicated this to her fiancé and the father of her kids? Because if so, your sister is definitely an AH.
Ok if you think your relationship will be fine, both from your and his perspectives, then ask him to write up a lease to sign.
You’re better off moving out. It’s not going to do your relationship with him any favors by moving to such a transactional relationship. But he’s in his right to decide what he’ll allow in his own home. 

You’re 28. You can definitely start to move towards being an independent adult and living your life the way your want to.
I mean, it’ll shake out however you decide, but you have two options— move out or don’t have your girlfriend over.
You are aware that your smoking hurts a lot more people than you right? Third-hand smoke has been proven to be cancerous. You’re literally contributing to the death of not only you, people around you, but also the people who enter a space after you’ve left.
So four hours later you’re still arguing. How come you haven’t given us a list of everything you do and everything your wife does in caring for your home and your kids? Clearly you have the time.
The morals that marriage is a lifelong commitment you shouldn’t just make with people before you know who they are and before you’re willing to commit to working things out?

Tell me you don’t understand marriage without telling me you don’t understand marriage. 

People should consider what marriage means before getting married. That means both waiting until you know a person well enough to know there aren’t red flags hidden and it also means being willing to work through the shitty moments. If you can’t do it, don’t get married. Simple. Anyone, you apparently, who doesn’t see that isn’t really my problem. Enjoy your future divorce.
…. If they actually stopped ignoring red flags and putting up with bullshit they wouldn’t marry those people in the first place.
Again, if that’s your attitude *don’t get married*. I already made that clear, it’s not like everyone needs to get married. But people have stopped taking marriage seriously and that’s why divorce rates are so high. You want to be able to walk away at the first issue? Sure, go right ahead. Don’t get married then.
Legally and morally are different. Just because you can divorce someone for the color of their shirt doesn’t mean you should. If you think marriage is such a temporary commitment, don’t make it.
I mean….. yes if you just assumed he wanted kids that was incredibly presumptuous and foolish of you. Generally a 38 year old with no kids who WANTS kids will mention it. Especially as you’re now 35 and that’s generally the end of when most people start trying to conceive. It’s also somewhat reasonable for him to assume an older woman with kids who doesn’t mention wanting them also would be on the same page with not wanting anymore. 

I suppose realistically at this point you need to do some tough thinking and potentially get your MSH levels checked to get an idea on how easy it would be to conceive with someone else if that’s even an option, and if natural birth isn’t possible if you’re willing and able to pursue IVF or other means.
Might be difficult for her to see you treating another woman the way she wanted to be treated but clearly wasn’t. 

I’ve seen similar things with women who ended a relationship with someone who wouldn’t marry them when they find out the ex is getting married, even if the women are in new and fulfilling relationships and no longer have feelings for the ex. Rejection and feelings of inadequacy can remain long after the love is gone. 

That being said, she needs to handle her own shit and not bring it into your life. Set a clear boundary and if she can’t agree, time to put some distance between you and her and at custody swap you can send Sky in by herself and you can wait in the car to pick her up.
Color is meh to me, but the fit and length are actively bad. It looks very grandmother’s nightgown to me. Since you love the color, this would be a beautiful piece if you took in and shortened the waist and then hemmed it somewhere above your knee, whatever your preference.
I mean, probably says you prioritize being in a relationship rather than being comfortable, as if I were allergic to an animal that would be the sort of thing I would ask about on a first date and not have a second with anyone with a cat.
Who hurt you?
It’s not crazy! It’s totally understandable. If I may give you some advice my parents would always tell me, “If it’s meant to be, it’ll be, but never dull your shine for someone else”. You can leave and let him sort himself out. If he does, and the time is right, maybe you two will reconnect in the future, but if he wasn’t meant to be your future, you’ll move on and find that future. Every time I’ve been in a similar situation to yours, my mom especially would encourage me to remember that, “if god intends it, it’ll happen”. Now, I don’t know if you’re religious, but I do think you will end up where you’re meant to be. And if that’s with him, you’ll find your way back to one another when he is healthier, and if you ARENT meant to be (and honestly I don’t think you are) then you will be freeing yourself to find that path you’re meant to walk.
I know, apologies. I just would hate to see such a young and vibrant woman with a bright future ruin it because she’s willing to sacrifice herself for a man who would never do the same. You deserve much more than this.
NTA. If they need to crowdsource their wedding, they need to downsize their wedding. If they DONT need to crowdsource their wedding, you dont need to celebrate greedy ass people.
Eh, of all the things wrong with this dude, drinking problem doesn’t come to mind. If he really had a drinking problem, he likely wouldn’t feel compelled to hide it from his wife and kids, he’d just be drunk.
Well you’ve done the equivalent and then some in this post and all of your comments arguing already, so instead of trying to act like you’re too good for writing a 7 paragraph comment. Just do it, prove it. Actually give us the information so we can see everything you do that shows just how much you deserve that break. Once you do, everyone’s attitude will change and we’ll all see you deserve this break and your wife is asking too much of you. Trust me, it’s happened before. Everyone is calling you an AH so if you really think we’re wrong, answering this will make EVERYONE see what you see. 

The ONLY reason you would have for not is because you know damn well it would show just how little you do. So which is it, are you going to write out everything you do or are you admitting you do Jack shit and leave everything to your wife?
I mean…. NAH. She was extremely clear about not being able to handle you with short hair and you agreed. I guess you didn’t think that would be a dealbreaker, and it’s an odd dealbreaker to have, but that’s trauma for you. Personally I would see if you can have a compromise where your hair is a bit longer than it is now but still short ish. 

Or you can decide your journey is worth more to you than your marriage. That’s okay too. But you can’t have both. It’s either your wife feeling safe in your marriage or your hair short. I would personally not want my wife to feel unsafe over something as superficial as the length of my hair, but I also won’t call you an AH for changing your mind and wanting autonomy on how you look. This might just mean the relationship has run it’s course. It isn’t your responsibility or fault that she’s reacting like this, but that doesnt change the reality that she’s extremely triggered and a choice needs to be made here. 

Hopefully your wife is in therapy though, and can speak to them about this and see if she can work through her feelings in therapy.
Out of curiosity, why do you want to mend things with an addict who is just using you as a meal ticket? 

You don’t mean anything to him. You’re just a tool to survive right now. Maybe he once loved you, but his addiction has taken away all of his ability to develop a genuine relationship with you. You’re 25. You’d be, frankly, an idiot to sink your future investing in someone like this indefinitely. 

Cut your losses and save yourself.
Well. How about this. Walk me through a typical week. Be explicit. Go morning afternoon and evening. Walk us through what your wife does and what you do. Make sure you list every chore each of you does. Then we can ALL see exactly how “not true” it is that you don’t do shit.
Or you could offer one?
The rich and poor, sure. Better or worse? No. That’s often one or both people being a prick to the other. No one stays married forever and ISNT a prick to their partner at some point in time. If it’s abuse, obviously leave, but there’s a normal level of “married couples are inevitably going to be shitheads at some point. You can’t just walk away the first time it happens.”
The divorce happened several years before he posted and he’s still taking his kids on his time, so I don’t know if that’s a fair comment to make.
I don’t think this is abusive, which I think I made pretty clear. But I do think OP should NOT back down, as she’s already said she feels like maybe she should, and I also am simply telling her to be hyper aware of if there’s any additional red flags. 

I am also one of those people who doesn’t like everything to be called abuse. So, I did say “this itself does not mean he is an abuser” but it’s definitely how a lot of people say it starts, so she’s better off keeping this in the back of her mind and finding nooner red flags than ignoring this one and looking back 5 years from now and realizing it started here.
It’s up to you. Realistically, your high school girlfriend doesn’t last through college anyway. So, you can follow the normal path and break up once she leaves
Or break up now.
It takes people different times to know if they want to marry someone and marriage is a lifelong commitment. He could very well be telling the truth that he isn’t sure yet and he may be sure later. He also could be hiding a reason he doesn’t think he wants to marry you. You can try to have a conversation about it, he ultimately won’t tell you if he doesn’t want to. I wouldn’t ask if you already are fed up with waiting. And it’s okay if after 3 years you want someone who is sure. 

I would personally decide if you’re willing to wait for him to be sure or not. If you aren’t, everything else is irrelevant and it’s time to move on. If you’re willing to wait, you need to decide how long you’re willing to wait and then it’s time to sit down and talk to him. Ask him if there’s some concern in his mind that he is keeping to himself. If he says no, just tell him plainly, “I understand it takes some people time and I understand marriage is a huge commitment. I don’t want us to get married unless both of us are sure. But I’m going to be really upfront with you that if by x date (next year, 5th anniversary, 30th birthday whatever line it is for you) you’re still no closer to being sure about us, I can’t wait any longer. Marriage is important to me and while I want it to happen with you, I’m not going to wait around forever for you to feel the same way around me. I’m not going to bring it up further so I don’t pressure you into a decision one way or the other, but I want to set clear expectations so neither of us are blindsided in the future.”
Black. White looks cheap and see through.
It genuinely looks great! If you’re uncomfortable with the bottoms, I would suggest a swim skirt as the flared skirt will really flatter your curves!
He can talk to her and see what she wants to do, like a rational adult. Find a compromise and see if maybe the fact that they’re on two different continents despite being married is causing her to feel pretty unconnected with him and shes fixating on the wedding as a symbol of their life together. Who knows? But just because he can’t give her a wedding doesn’t mean he shouldn’t talk to her.
Yep. I mean I’m not saying everyone needs to get married, but if you see marriage as something that could and should end at the drop of the hat…. Don’t get married then? There’s not really a ton of benefits to marriage anymore and any of them can easily be achieved with a contract that can be unilaterally terminated so…. If you don’t see it as an actual serious commitment through good and bad times, don’t do it.
It…. Isn’t an excuse though? Are you trying to tell me you think OP *DID* cheat because something was wrong with Lauren? Because that’s kinda bullshit too.
You look amazing in this dress.
You want to stay because you don’t know anything different which is totally normal! But you’ll find much better and be way happier.
He’s getting his PhD still, and clearly can’t afford the wedding she wants so it’s highly unlikely he’s got much to worry about 😂
No. They make you look incredibly blocky. A low rise would look better.
Yeah, actually they kinda are marriage rules lol that’s the whole “richer or poor” “better or worse” “health and unhealthy” stuff you say when you get married. 

Like I said, if your rule is “any time you do something I don’t like, I’m done” don’t get married, seems pretty simple really. If you don’t see marriage as something worthy of doing the work to preserve, don’t do it. It’s a lifelong commitment. You want to be able to exit easily, there’s no reason someone NEEDS to get married.
Once you marry someone, you’re kinda obligated to at least try to work through issues unless it involves cheating or abuse. If you think you should just jump ship the moment someone says/does something you don’t like, you probably aren’t the type who should get married.

Sure, it will get harder if they buy a house and have kids together, but it isn’t going to fundamentally change at this point if they sit down and have a conversation or go to a few therapy sessions first.
They’re legally married, it isn’t exactly easy to just “move on” at this point.
They’re already legally married lol abandon ship probably isn’t the best advice. They should at the very least have a conversation about expectations of lifestyle and maybe some counseling sessions.
Is this the same girl you just started dating like a month ago? Because dude, cut your losses. You were also dating someone else just two months before this girl. Maybe take some time alone, you seem to be a serial monogamist.
Here’s the two most likely outcomes— you end things because you can see he isn’t equipped to handle dating someone with your impairments or you don’t end things and he inevitably gets frustrated and dumps you in a few weeks/months/years and then it hurts even more. Leaving now when it’s obvious you two aren’t a good match saves you the additional heartbreak that comes with being with someone even longer when things go south. Because at the heart of this is he simply doesn’t have the patience to have a partner with an impairment like this.
Honestly, I can see him being annoyed. Not many people like being constantly bumped into. However, that means he isn’t right for you. He can’t handle his space being invaded while he’s also stressed or irritated. It’s okay, but your discomfort is also 100% valid because even if it isn’t coming from a place of violence, it is coming from a place of “I cannot handle what it means to date you” and you deserve someone who can handle what it means to date you. You two just aren’t right for each other.

People on here have some ass-backwards high horse morals. The people saying you’re an AH are insane. If you didn’t buy it, someone else would have. Sure, you bought the bracelet because it gave you a bit of control over a situation where you don’t have much, but that doesn’t make you an AH. It makes you a 16 year old kid who has been tormented and oppressed by people who should’ve been family. Keep the bracelet. Say nothing. When you’ve moved out and can objectively assess how you feel, decide what you want to do. If you miraculously repair your relationship, you can always say you found a bracelet in a vintage shop and thought it looked familiar and wanted to give it to replace the previously lost bracelet. But there’s no benefit to telling them now that you have the bracelet.
Being petty to a racist who has tormented you for years by legally buying a bracelet that was legally sold to a pawn shop isn’t an AH move.
It isn’t normal, and yes, you need to leave. You have two children to take care of and this is no longer a safe environment for them. It’s time to find a friend or even contact a church to find someone to stay with, file for divorce and start dusting off the resume to find a job. You can even look for jobs at day care or a play center if you can’t afford/find child care. 

Your husband has decided for whatever reason he no longer wants to adult. Fine, no one likes to work, but you do not, should not and CANNOT stick around and let him put your children in danger. Understand? You’re a mom first and you need to act in their best interest right now and make sure they’re taken care of.
“I respect your opinions on pet care but you’ll need to respect my ability to make proper decisions about my own pet. If you can’t accept that we feel differently about this and don’t think I should be allowed to interact with my pet as I see fit, so long as I’m not causing bodily harm to her, maybe this isn’t going to work out. We need to be able to respect differences of opinion and you can’t expect me to just go along with everything you think. I am my own person with my own beliefs just like you.”
NAH. Her parents are right. A useful degree will provide a statistically better life for their daughter than a passion degree like history. You can be successful with a history degree, but you’re not successful *because* of the history degree a majority of the time. I’ve looked up the jobs you can do with a history degree and most of them can use but wouldn’t require the degree. 

I think it would be helpful to encourage niece to have a backup plan, maybe minor in something she can use if she changes her mind or isn’t finding success in history. But it’s also nice of you to support her passions. But life is just getting harder for people as time goes on and college degrees are getting less and less useful unless they’re in highly specialized fields. Spending a bunch of money on a passion degree without a strong plan for the future isn’t really advisable unless you have family money to fall back on, from an completely pragmatic perspective. You can still study what you love while also pursuing a more stable and prosperous career.
You should be extremely concerned, because while this could absolutely be your fiancé trying to do something nice and just totally fucking up, this is absolutely how and WHEN a lot of abusers show their colors. 

You’re planning your wedding. He thinks you’re trapped and figured you won’t leave. He starts out small, something that’s “a gift” for you, planning a honeymoon that will be a show of love. He’s using manipulative tactics to get you to agree and punishing you after you push back. The punishment is the biggest red flag here. 

He may have always treated you amazingly, but just keep in mind that no one who ends up in a toxic or otherwise abusive relationship *started* that way. It started out great, and then one day, something small happened that changed things. And they didn’t notice and went along with the pressure because they felt like they were wrong as their perfect partner had never reacted this way before! And then, once theyre really and truly trapped, the ugly truth shows itself. 

Just be extremely careful and aware moving forward. I’m NOT saying your fiancé is an abuser, but I am saying this is how it starts, so watch out for any other red flags and DO NOT back down. Seeing how he handles you firmly telling him “no absolutely not and you better walk the fuck back from the you don’t trust me language” will tell you everything you need to know on if this is a marriage that is even safe to proceed with. Good luck. Be careful, keep your eyes wide open.
Yeah I’m way more worried that this would set a precedent for “do you trust me?” To be used as a manipulation tactic to get OP to do things she doesn’t want to do or isn’t comfortable with in the future.
Yeah I meant it both ways. The post says they have a date night once a month due to funds, yet they’re both doing things separately multiple times a week. But also he says they don’t ever do expensive hoo-har because he doesn’t want to spend money in this climate. Which, is valid, don’t go into debt, but it doesn’t sound like this is “we have absolutely no money”, it sounds like “I’m prioritizing saving money over facilitating a long lasting and deep foundation to my relationship”. And in that case, it’s important to ask, is a few extra hundred dollars in savings worth a clearly deteriorating relationship with your OH? Because if this rut is kicked off by the lack of experiences together, which based on his comment to her, seems like the case, the few hundred dollars really MIGHT be the difference between her feeling happy and content in her relationship or feeling like he stopped trying to “court” her or to put effort into their romantic relationship as soon as they had a kid. 

I get wanting to save for your kid. I do, really, but it’s definitely cheaper to have one household than two, it’s cheaper to just take care of the relationship than pay for therapy once it’s on the brink of demise. Personally, I am of the mentality that I would rather have my partner than a few extra hundred dollars and I also WANT to have these memories with my partner.
Lol classic redditor purposefully and completely missing my point. No, I don’t. But if you hear your partner saying they feel you’re in a rut and don’t do anything to change things and bring a spark back, don’t be surprised if they fall out of love. Sweet gestures are a really great way of making someone feel loved. And guess what? Even a few hundred dollar dinners is WAY cheaper than marriage counseling will be if you do nothing. Until you’re on the brink of divorce.
It’s a fashion advice sub. And just an FYI, saying a cut isn’t flattering to someone’s figure is NOT a comment on their figure, it’s a comment on an article of clothing. She’s got a perfectly fine/really nice figure, it’s the dress that is puckering weirdly, which may be resolved by ironing it, like I suggested. 

Take the overly offended attitude elsewhere.
Definitely iron it, but the cut isn’t very flattering on your figure. It tapers in at the hips and emphasized your midsection.
What the fuck. Why would you encourage him to make it work with a cheater? The time for changes is done. Once cheating is involved it’s over. The other person made their choice.
Of course sexual incompatibility is a good enough reason to break up! You’re 20 years old. This is the time for you to go out, have a bunch of sex, figure out what you want in life, and then hopefully find it and settle down in a few years or a decade or whatever if that’s what you want. 

Please do NOT stay in a relationship that you aren’t fully and 100% intensely satisfied in when you’re so young. It gets worse as you get older and stay with people longer. It’s already wrong. It will not become right by staying. You should find a new place to stay once your lease is up and once you’ve signed a lease, sit her down and explain to her you don’t think the relationship is working long term and you’re moving out at the end of the lease. Give her enough time to find a place but not so much time that it becomes super awkward to live together. You should offer to sleep in the living room unless you have a 2 bd apartment. But you’re 20 so I highly doubt it. And do NOT renew your lease. Even if you (foolishly imo) decide not to break up with her, you should ask to move out.
I’ll say it, OP handled this like shit and if he wants to stay with this woman until his daughter DOES move out, he needs to hear his partner out. Ask her what she’s missing, what can add the spark back or offer some couple’s therapy. 

And “we don’t do that expensive hoo-har” sounds like a big part of the problem. I often ask myself “is saving a couple hundred dollars worth losing something else I really care about?” If the answer is no, spend the money. Buy a beautiful bouquet of roses once a month. Take her out to a really expensive restaurant, buy a little heart shaped necklace. There’s so many under $500 things you can do that are lavish and memorable and really show spontaneity and care.
NTA. Watching 4 children whos father is dying and 2 which you used to be a step father to is NOT a good idea. If anything happens with these kids, it’ll be on you. From a liability standpoint, watching 5 kids, including a newborn is NOT a smart idea. Stand firm and hey, even offer to take your son full time, “I’m sorry for what’s happening with (husband) but I am unable to take your other kids. I would be willing to take (my son) full time if that would make things easier for you to arrange child care for the other four, but that’s the extent I’m willing to go to help out. I suggest you look into getting a baby sitter who can take them on short notice, and I hope (husband) gets well soon.”

And FYI, if you want more time with your son, go petition the court to have full custody right now, citing the cancer and frequent hospital stays as the reason. Explain it would be better for everyone involved if your ex didn’t have to worry about another kid right now and if your son could have some stability and not be around such a heavy/depressing topic.
This also makes no sense. Like every single 28 year old male needs to be in a relationship? I know plenty who are and have been single for years.
NTA. You aren’t financially able to help them. If this fund is the only money you have, because it sounds like you live paycheck to paycheck, you’re unable to help them. It’s not as though there’s a few million in that account, it’s likely a few tens of thousands or maybe low 6 figures. Which is nice, sure, but that’s barely a down payment on a house nowadays. Being able to afford it financially means “I can pay for everything I want/need comfortably and STILL have tons of money left over that I will never even notice”. That is obviously not the case here.
They seem to already be dragging it out. OP posted 3 months ago about not being ready to move and settle down with G and have kids and get engaged, after *10 years together*!! If you’re not sure you want to marry someone after 10 years, man you don’t want to marry them. And she clearly wants these things. And yet, despite everyone telling him to break up then, he clearly didn’t. I hope OP gets his head out of his ass because he’s being incredibly selfish and destructive and potentially going to bring a very expensive life into this world that he clearly doesn’t want, with a woman that he clearly doesn’t like and isn’t committed to.
I have a few questions. 

-After 10 years together, why aren’t you two married? Do either of you want marriage?

-Do you even WANT to get over what she said? This relationship sounds really wrong for both of you. She said she’s disgusted with your body, that’s not the sort of thing you forget. 

-Did you mean what you said when you insulted her intelligence? Is this because she’s only interested in seemingly shallow hobbies like reality TV?

-Do YOU want kids? Because if YOU don’t want kids, where you would find a woman who wants kids after you break up with G, then DO NOT HAVE A CHILD WITH G. Kids needs to be a two yesses decision. And if it’s not a yes without the threat of a relationship dying over your head, it’s not a yes at all.
Fairly certain if he were thinking with the penis instead of the brain he would be out. Fertility treatments are definitely the least sexy thing a person can do and most of the time you actually aren’t having much if any sex during them.
Well, you can just say that straight up, “asking me to cut off my best friend because my BIL knowing decided to date her is controlling and isolating and I’m not tolerating this. If it were up to me, I was never comfortable with them dating in the first place, as that puts me in the middle way too much. I told you very clearly— I am not getting involved. If you make cutting off my best friend for doing nothing wrong your hill to die on, then we might as well start planning the funeral because I am NOT going to be pressured into playing this game. Relationships end. He knew she was my best friend. If he was unable to handle that fact, he should not have dated her. This is solely BIL’s cross to bear. They were together for 6 months and it’s clear he came off WAY too intensely and scared bf off, so of course she didn’t need very long to fully mourn their relationship. I hope I am making myself perfectly clear that I find the implication I cut my best friend off incredibly toxic and if given the choice, I am cutting off the toxic people in my life and right now, that is NOT best friend.”
You are very very very obviously NOT over the rejection. You need some serious therapy and get to the place where you can drop the rope. You’re running around trying to fix everyone’s problems, at the cost of yourself, because you are hoping this will finally make your blood family see you as important to them. Stop. They don’t. They are using you because you consistently begged them to let you be used by them for validation. 

If Zach doesn’t want to care for his dad, guess what? Your dad reaped what he sowed by neglecting his other kids. Do NOT take care of your father. Stop spending all of your money buying a ton of gifts. It isn’t getting the result you want. They don’t care about you, they only tangentially care about everything you’re giving them, but if you take that away, none of them will ever call you, except for maybe Rob. 

So please, get some therapy and become okay with having a waaaay more distant relationship with your blood family. They do not care about you and you jumping up and down throwing stuff at them is just telling them you’re desperate for their attention and love and the more they DONT give it to you, the more they can take advantage of you with love and affection dangling like a carrot on a stick in front of you. But they dont and never will. Stop doing so much for people who clearly will never return the favor.
One potential way is to call the non emergency police line and tell them what’s going on and ask if there’s anyway a cop can come over and facilitate the discussion where you ask the photos to be deleted and also to have it on record, as you’ll be dumping him afterwards and “are afraid for your safety”. They may not do it, but they also might. Make sure you mention this has all been done non-consensually. If you happen to know any police officers, you can also ask if they’ll do you a favor and do this as well, in uniform. 

If you’re able to get a cop to come, make sure to delete the photos from his recently deleted photos, and to also make sure they’re deleted from his iCloud. And then, at the end of it, make sure you ask the cop to put this on record, so if somehow he managed to keep any photos, if he ever distributes them, it’ll be a very clear case of revenge porn, as he is the only one with these photos and was told by a police officer to delete them.
NTA. This is like someone calling you an AH for calling the police because you were stabbed. This is WHY HOAs exist. You’re not an AH for calling the correct people. You didn’t call the HOA because the color of their house was the wrong shade of white. You called because they were causing both property damage and psychological damage by keeping you up at night. 


And just as an FYI— there’s almost no way that a 25’ bouncy castle was LEGAL either, you could’ve likely called the police too, as you need permits and safety people for something that large and it’s usually not allowed in residential areas PERIOD. A family friend does the carnivals in my area and the larger slides etc were all kiiiiinda illegal but they relied on the “it’s only for 4 hours so no one will really care or know” mentality.
Your husband is right. It’s time to completely cut all three of them off.
Sure, but that doesn’t happen in engineering. Literally the definition in most states is “make more than $~600/week and be in a job where an advanced degree is required”. This isn’t some weird field. Engineering is pretty universally known to be exempt. Stop trying to make this something it isn’t. She’s exempt. She needs to decide what she wants and if she’s cut out for a field where what she’s being offered is as good as it will ever realistically get. I’m done having this conversation. If you don’t believe me, do a quick google search. This is like the most easily verifiable information about labor laws out there.
Bruh. *read the fucking post*. She is exempt. She has clearly stated it. Stop trying to argue about something that is literally stated in the post as true. It’s coming off as extremely argumentative. Take the anti-work attitude to the anti-work subreddit.
It’s 50 hours, not 60, she started 3 months ago and this is her first job. 

I can assure you, in this instance, no, it’s almost 100% not a good career move to leave now. If she can do a year, that would be the least likely to impact her career and would be a good use of “job hopping”. Personally, most of the recruiters I know want at least 2 years, but 1 at least a year they will still interview a really good candidate and will definitely ask why the short tenure. No company wants to employ a brand new professional, train them, only for them to leave a few months or a year later. It’s just not worth it for them. 

And again, the company isn’t taking advantage of her, they’re paying her. They are legally NOT required to pay her. You do understand this, right? This is what the field entails. They’re giving her more than most employers would/do. If she genuinely can’t handle this reality, she’s simply not cut out to do engineering. Like I said, you can’t be a CPA and say you won’t work overtime during tax season. It’s just not how it works. You come off as someone who thinks things should work how you want, and don’t actually understand how the professional world actually operates.
It’s not iffy, I’m very familiar with the laws for engineers. They’re exempt. No overtime required, and OP has very explicitly stated this same thing in the post. This is how it is for engineers unless you do consulting work.
Honestly if OP is a woman, she should go through IVF and simply tell her partner if you don’t want kids, then we need to end things, but this is non-negotiable for me and I’m proceeding with it. 

I recognize this is a terrible idea in reality, but, if she’s a woman, she should take autonomy over her own desire to have children and make it happen.
Lmao you’re aware OP is 30 and would be INSTANTLY snapped up by another wonderful woman, right? It’s not as though his wife is his only chance at love. Sure, he’ll have no wife for a few years while he gets to know someone else, but he’s young, has a great job and wants a family, he’s a ton of women’s dream man right there as long as he takes care of himself and knows how to wash a dish. The idea that if he ends things he’d be alone is almost as absurd as the people who imply a woman’s only worth is to procreate.
OP is exempt, they legally are not required to pay her anything, and this is an issue she’d find in most any company in the electrics engineering field. She needs to be very realistic about what she wants her career path to be moving forward and take this info into consideration, because she’s definitely exempt and while a company that pays time and a half probably DOES exist, it may not be easy to find and get a job there, especially if she leaves her first job so soon. She’s only 23 and “paying your dues” is definitely necessary sometimes.
Yeah exactly. But OP is an electrical engineer and an exempt employee. Depending on if she’s a software vs a hardware side of EE, she could just need to accept the nature of the job, you work until a project is finished/a deadline is met in these fields a lot of the time. You get paid well for it, but sometimes that’s just the cost of the business, ya know? My partner was a software engineer and some weeks were really chill and other weeks when something was due or there was an issue, they’d be working 16-18 hour days every day for a few weeks. Made good money, but that’s just the nature of the industry. Make sure you can handle it before pursuing a career in that field.
Lmao OP needs to recognize getting paid for her time is more than she’s legally entitled to then and be happy.
Sure, but I’m also just stating that if she’s in a salaried professional position, she most likely legally is not entitled to overtime pay and in fact is getting MORE than the legally required payment. She needs to do research, absolutely, but a number of people don’t realize that a lot of occupations that make “good money” also aren’t entitled to any overtime pay. Now, that doesn’t mean *every single occupation* but that’s the whole “look it up, be aware you may not be entitled to what you’re asking” disclaimer I was giving.
You definitely can. I think you think I’m saying an employer can take someone from an hourly to salaried employee at will to avoid overtime but that’s not what I’m saying. I’m saying a company can choose to employee people either as a salary or hourly employee in a number of professional positions where in an hourly structure they would need to pay per hour worked but as a salaried employee it would be a flat rate, regardless of if you worked 40 or 50 hours. And yes, legally. This varies by state so it’s important to know your state’s labor laws, and it’s also important to ask the right questions and set clear expectations when accepting a position on hours expected, overtime etc. but it’s 1000000% an employers decision to hire people on either an hourly or salaried basis and then depending on the local laws, whether particular positions are entitled to overtime or not.
I mean, you can definitely decide what you want, but depending on your field that just isn’t an option you’ll have. There’s plenty of industries where if you’re unwilling to do what needs to be done to get a project done on time, you won’t survive in that industry. For instance, you can’t be a CPA and tell your firm that you are only going to work 40 hour weeks during tax season and expect to keep your job. You can’t tell the hospital that you’re not going to help out with a massive outbreak or accident or whatever it may be because you’ve worked 40 hours that week. If that isn’t for you, totally fair!! Just be realistic when choosing a career path then.

Don’t get taken advantage of, but also people do sometimes take it too far for the “principle” of things without understanding it just isn’t how it works in some fields.
Everyone handles trauma differently, but I have never heard of anyone, man or woman, to take selfies of themselves doing things to their rapist and looking happy while doing it. That sounds like he cheated on you and thinks you’re dumb enough to believe his story.
It’s unfortunate because OP is only 23 and she just started. It can definitely look poorly on her to already be searching for a new job.
Well, you absolutely can and many DO make employees salaried so as not to pay OT, but that’s on the employee to carefully weigh job expectations and compensation packages before accepting a position.
It depends on the state laws. In California, salaried professionals aren’t entitled to overtime pay. Doesn’t matter if you’re an entry level or management level. Individual employers can do whatever they want, but legally they don’t have to pay anything if you’re a salaried professional employee.
That actually isn’t how it works in the professional world usually. A number of states labor laws explicitly state professional/salaried employees aren’t entitled to ANY overtime pay, as in not even just “Normal time” but $0 for any extra hours worked. You usually are getting compensated well if you’re in a position that might require overtime (think if you work as a CPA or a surgeon) but it’s important to understand laws and payment structures vary and there’s definitely a LOT of professions and jobs where you may be required to work overtime for your job description but you are NOT legally entitled to compensation for it. This isn’t true in most hourly positions and lower skilled jobs like retail workers, but yeah. Just be aware of the labor laws in your state.
Yeah, can’t say telling the rest of her kids they can’t go have fun at a water park with their cousins because their sister thinks she’s fat is a GOOD way to help her body image issues. Knowing kids/siblings, they just might use that against the daughter in the future.
I think you’re going to drive yourself nuts trying to understand this. It’s simple. He wants a partner who is close to their family. You are not close to your (blood) family. He thought maybe he could accept it, and he’s realizing after 3 years he cannot. That’s the only thing you need to understand, and now it’s time to respect it and more importantly, start respecting *yourself* and stop trying to make it work with someone who doesn’t want to make it work.
No, I can’t. I am not him. You’d need to ask him. I can only give you perspective on “he is allowed to have any dealbreaker he wants and he isn’t wrong for having them”. I could guess maybe if he doesn’t have a close relationship he’s always wanted one and thus wants a partner who does have that big happy family, but you’d need to ask him.
Well, in asking him to be flexible, you are asking him not to care about what he cares about. And in him asking you to consider forgiving your abusive family, HE isn’t respecting your boundaries either. But that’s the thing, he cares about this regardless of if you think it’s a “valid” thing to care about, and there’s no fixing the fact that this is his hill to die on. Make your hill to die on finding a partner who treats your chosen family just as well as he treats his own.
You can’t ask me, because I’m not him. I don’t really care about family and in fact prefer a partner who isn’t very close to family. My whole point is just because you disagree with what he finds important doesn’t make it unimportant. That’s why we date, to find someone who we’re compatible with. 

If this is all true, you need to come to terms with the fact that you can’t give him what he wants and stop torturing yourself. You don’t deserve staying in a relationship with someone you’re clearly on such wildly different pages. You will find someone much better suited to you who treats you way better. Just like a close relationship with family may be his dealbreaker, you should make “wants me to forgive my family” a dealbreaker for you!
No, I’m not missing that. You see them as your family and I think that’s great, but he is very clearly meaning family as in “blood family”. And in that regard, you don’t have that. Your family is chosen, but he very specifically wants the family lineage, not just friends. And that’s okay too. I am a person who thinks family means very little, but even in my own perspective, I am able to recognize that I do not get to tell others what they should and shouldn’t think about family, and that’s something I think you need to recognize as well. 

For you, they are your family. For him, they’re your friends, not your family. And he wants someone who has a close relationship with their family, which is where they incompatibilities come into play. Both in your definitions of family, and the relationships he expects of them.
And I understand that, but chosen family and the family you grew up with and raised you aren’t the same, for him. That’s something you need to respect, just as much as YOUUU need someone who respects and is fine with you have a chosen family and not a blood family. That’s an incompatibility though, that’s not one person being right or wrong. You may be really hurt and you’re 100000% valid. In your story, HE is the wrong one and I get that, but from an objective vantage point, neither of you are the villains, you just want different lives and neither of you can give the other what you each deserve.
No they aren’t. That’s him communicating his doubts. People talk about things they think are incompatibilities all the time. He has never suggested she forgive her family, he’s only communicating about he doesn’t know if he can accept them not being in her life. I have had dozens of conversations over the years when dating with people like this. It was never pressure, it was “I’m struggling with this and am talking to my partner about it rather than blindsiding you”. I would ALWAYS take someone telling me “I’m reconsidering our relationship because of xyz” over just ending things for seemingly no reason. 

3 years in, OP needs to realize he obviously isn’t going to accept it and he’s obviously never treated her very seriously because deep down he knows he can’t start a life with her, but he isn’t pressuring her. Him communicating his feelings shouldn’t be villianized.
It isn’t wrong. It would be wrong of him to say “you need to forgive your family and be close to them for you and I to stay together” but it IS NOT wrong for him to say “you aren’t close with your family and that’s really important to me and regardless of if you have a really good reason, I don’t see a future with someone who isn’t close to their family”. Trying to change someone is wrong. Wanting something different from someone, no matter what it is, isn’t wrong. 

Based on your post, he isn’t trying to change you, he’s just saying you two are incompatible. And he ISNT wrong for that, no one is. The easy example to understand is disagreeing on kids— completely unacceptable behavior “I want kids and even though you don’t I’m not accepting that answer and will force you to have kids with me”. Completely acceptable behavior— “I want kids and even though you have really good reasons for not wanting them, this isn’t something I can compromise on. I think it’s better we find people we are both more compatible with.”

In both cases, everything else in the relationship can be fine, but having a big close family is very integral to the life your boyfriend wants. And realistically, he isn’t alone in that. This isn’t some foreign cult like desire. Is everyone you meet going to care? No, absolutely not. But plenty of people choose their partner based on if they can have the life they want with them or not, and that’s about EVERYTHING— kids, pets, financial goals, retirement, anything and everything you can think of, someone out there finds that thing REALLY important to them and will absolutely break up with any partner that doesn’t align well with them in that regard. 

So, please stop calling him wrong/unreasonable for having his own vision of his life. He’s entitled to that. Just like YOU are entitled to NOT keep toxic people in your life. Just like you may not want to date someone in the future who is extremely close to their family. These are all things we can, and frankly should, consider while dating. If you wouldn’t truly be happy making a life with someone, are you saying you should still stay because you “should” be happy with them? No, of course not.
But its not the appearance. If it were, he’d be pressuring OP to forgive her family. He isn’t. He’s saying he doesn’t think they have a future. He doesn’t want the appearance of family, he wants the actual close family. Why is everyone purposefully misunderstanding that?
I actually don’t see anywhere where he says OP should have a relationship with her family. He’s simply saying “regardless of if it’s for a good reason, I don’t want to marry someone who doesn’t have a good relationship with their family” which is fundamentally different. He’s saying OP and him will not work because she doesn’t have a relationship with her family and he isn’t going to change the future he wants because OP has a good reason. But guess what, that’s totally his right and there’s nothing wrong there. It sucks, but people don’t need to accept anything about you and he’s allowed to want any future he does and he isn’t wrong for finding someone who aligns with that. OP doesn’t. 

Now, OP sounds WAYYYYYY better off without this guy in her life as well, but he isn’t wrong for wanting a partner who has a strong relationship with their family.

It happens all the time though. If he wanted kids and you didn’t, that would similarly be throwing away your relationship for people he doesn’t know (yet). People have ideas of the futures that they want and are allowed to find a partner who meshes well with that future. He shouldn’t have to compromise on wanting a future where he and his wife can have all the in laws over for a bbq or whatever and you shouldn’t have to compromise on not allowing harmful relationships in your life. 

I understand it hurts, but your bf isn’t in the wrong here either, if he’s just saying you two aren’t compatible, and he isn’t insisting you mend your relationship with your family.
It honestly doesn’t. It just sounds like he knew they would never work out long term and so he never took the relationship very seriously.
Here’s the thing though, it actually ISNT an easy thing to work out. It’s a dealbreaker for him to not have a close relationship with both his and his partner’s family. Unless you’re telling me it’s easy because you’ll go and have a relationship with your family (please don’t!!), then there isn’t an easy fix at all. You’re at an impasse as much as you would be if he wanted kids and you didn’t. 

Telling someone “you shouldn’t care about the thing you care about” is NOT an appropriate way of working things out and it’s totally reasonable for him to want a partner that everyone can have this big huge family where everyone gets along. Its absolutely heartbreaking for you, as I understand how much it hurts to be judged for reasons outside of your control, but it’s 100% reasonable for someone to consider their partner’s family when deciding to marry someone. I personally wouldn’t marry someone with an exceptionally toxic family that they hadn’t cut out. Everyone has different lines. Unfortunately for him, his line is “I want my partner to have a good and close relationship with her family” and regardless of if YOU think that’s reasonable, he is fully entitled to that dealbreaker, and you need to recognize that you’re simply unable to provide that for him, much like if you didn’t want kids, you could never give him a son. 

I’m sorry for this, but it sounds like he isn’t that great of a boyfriend anyway, and you’d be much happier finding someone who accepts you, your past, and is happy with just your friends.
This is not the proper takeaway.
YTA. Don’t give expensive gifts if it has strings attached. Yes, expecting a hand written thank you note is a string. I guarantee you none of them give a shit about a $300 pen.
I don’t really think it’s healthy to imply a 21 year old should made huge decisions on their life trajectory based on a teenage sweetheart. When I was that age, my parents drilled into my head “make the decisions YOU want to make for YOUR future, never consider your partner. If it’s meant to be it will be and if it isn’t meant to be then you haven’t changed your life for someone you aren’t meant to be with”. And that’s 100% accurate. At 21, implying he’s somehow “wrong” for moving and following his life path because his girlfriend is elsewhere is shockingly naive and obtuse.
You uh, you know “exaggerating” is just a roundabout way of saying “I’m a liar and everyone already knows me as a liar, so shockingly they thought I was continuing to lie, because it made a good story”
In all fairness, it’s stupid to assume everyone is an exception to the most logical conclusion.
How about he goes with a family member or friend instead? He wants to go and has already put the deposit down. If he goes with someone else, it’ll only be $5k total, and then it won’t be a waste and you won’t need to fee terrible on your own vacation. Then he can go and find someone to go with him.
Yeah. I think overanalyzing the nuance of “is this just a 23 year old male who is uncomfortable with heavy topics and using humor to break the tensions” vs “is this person a covert abuser waiting to happen” isn’t worth it. Whatever the answer is, its perfectly clear that this guy isn’t giving OP what she needs to feel heard and to feel safe and at that point, trying to figure out the exact motives and reasoning behind the action just distract from dealing with the action itself, and dealing with it should just be washing her hands of the relationship and leaving.
Very normal, also very normal and necessary for OP to step in to explain the behavior while normal, is unacceptable. It’s how we learn and grow into hopefully functional adults!
INFO: how old are you? Because it’s pretty clear you’re at most 23 and have no actual understanding or experience with teenagers and young adult males who think once they turn 18 they no longer need to follow rules. The only thing being left out is people with actual life experience and knowledge of what teenagers are like weighing in. Everyone here saying “there’s something being left out no way an 18 year old would just be an AH for no reason!!!” Have no idea that all those times you thought you were justified in your anger at 18? Nah, just an AH. Don’t worry, you usually grow out of it.
Yeah I’m genuinely so over this trend of “there’s clearly more to the story you’re not telling me!” On posts. Like okay buuuut….. maybe just comment on what’s in the post/comments instead?
What exactly is the timeline here, because I’m confused why you’re posting now, this sounds like something you found out a long time ago?
A lot of people on here are very biased against men and also seem to think reasonable compromise in a relationship is a read flag. Which is simultaneously shocking and also not, given how immature a lot of people on Reddit seem to be.
Work comes first, but this wasn’t a choice of “working or gaming” it was a choice of “only working” or “getting to do both”. How do you come to the conclusion that he needs to let her work using his equipment rather than her just working on her laptop in the kitchen or bedroom? Anyone who works from home and has a laptop has used their laptop as a portable computer for work. That’s the whole point. She’s just unwilling to compromise or suffer the least bit of inconvenience.
NTA. Maybe it *was* as hard for your parents as it was for you (it wasn’t, but let’s just say maybe) THEY put themselves in that position, you had no choice in the matter. Why on earth would you subject your child to that same lack of autonomy over their situation?
Do NOT get a pet if you’re so weak willed to rehome them at the behest of a partner simply because they want you to. These are living creatures, not toys you can just shuffle around as is convenient.
Just tell them straight up, “yes I’m /absolutely/ leaving him for a better lifestyle! I deserve way more than a cheating, distant husband. This has nothing to do with money and everything to do with me knowing my worth. If (STBX) thinks that’s abandonment, then what does he think he has done all this time he’s been stepping out on our marriage?”
There’s nothing to indicate that. There’s no mention if OP wanted to live with her father, no mention of if he paid child support and no mention of if she asked and was turned down to moving in with her father. With the absence of any of that information, it can only be concluded that she moved out because she wanted to allow her mother to downsize at 18, not because she was “kicked out” and her step sister never did because they simply live different lives. It’s also not his kid. He doesn’t have unilateral decision making on kicking out the step sister. Obviously at 31, he’s okay with it, but let’s not act like her actual birth mother whose home it also is doesn’t have a say in allowing her daughter to live there.
Yeah, YTA. You shouldn’t resent your father or your step sister for having more than you. Do you really want to be a 31 year old still living at home? If you’re still harboring issues over this more than a decade later, it’s time for professional intervention. It isn’t normal and it’s hurting your own well being to be resentful over someone having something you didn’t have. Thief is the comparison of joy and you and your step sibling are different with different experiences. 

Why didn’t you spend any time with your father? Did he pay child support? Did you ever ask to move in with him? Maybe if he said no to you moving in with him after turning 18 I could understand some amount of resentment, but at some point you shouldn’t resent a 31 year old who still lives at home. Without any indication of your father very pointedly and directly telling you he wouldn’t give you further assistance/wouldn’t allow you to move in with him, you have no basis to resent him and need to understand that your situations are both different, and it is also her mother’s home and her mother likely has a large say in allowing your step sister to stay in the home for so long.
“The road to hell is paved with good intentions”. 

Just because you “didn’t intend to hurt her” does not change the fact that you did hurt her. Stop acting as though not meaning to means you didn’t hurt her. You hurt her. Start from that fact and figure out how to make up for it, if it’s even possible.
Seems like in trying to demand everything, you’ll end up with nothing.
So it’s a sin for you to live with the person you’re going to marry but not for him to live with someone he’s been dating a quarter of the time?


That math doesn’t add up.
I’ll also point out something— when you discovered what her job was, she had already started an only fans and the content was out there, forever. If her current partners have an issue with her career in the present tense, she can quit now and this will no longer be an issue. If the issue is she EVER was a sex worker though, no matter what you did in that moment at 18, she STILL WOULD HAVE BEEN a sex worker. For most people, it’s a binary issue “have you ever done _____”? And regardless of if you’d managed to get her to stop that day at 18, the answer would still be the same, yes. So your “supporting her” career choice or not supporting it would’ve had no impact on future relationship, especially if she has since quit, because what she will tell future partners is the same now as it would’ve been then, “when I was younger I did some sex work. I did it for xyz reasons, I regret it and I’m no longer doing it but I want to be upfront so if that’s a problem for you we don’t waste our time.”
There’s a difference between telling someone not to cook EVER and saying “don’t do something you know you’re terrible at as a present for your husband’s birthday”. You really have to know that they’re not the same, right?

If she wants to do that, have it be a random Tuesday or idk, practice until she can make something edible? It’s not really the thought that counts if the thought it “I’m not going to put any effort into getting good at this before giving you something I know you’ll hate but expect you to pretend to love it anyway”.
He hardly did it intentionally. It’s the same situation where someone seeing “can’t wait to have you inside me again” on their partner’s phone when cleaning up the bedroom isn’t snooping if they look at the text chain to discover an affair.
I mean it nicely, but he didn’t snoop. You knew he was in the room and you were within earshot if there was a break/lull in whatever he was listening to. Unless he has professional audio equipment, most headphones are FAR from 100% noise cancelling. He heard you talking about him and curiosity got the better of him. That’s just like when a woman sees an inappropriate text pop up on their partner’s phone and opens it to find them cheating. They’re not snooping or invading privacy in that case, and unfortunately, I don’t think he was invading your privacy here. 

This is sorta a situation of, “what did you expect would happen if you were talking about your partner in a less than ideal way with him within earshot?” This happens all the time where one person talks smack thinking someone isn’t within earshot and then they are. The added context of being in a therapy session really doesn’t change the lack of betrayal here. If anything, he’s likely feeling quite betrayed. Have you discussed any of these issues with him, or is this the first time he’s hearing you might have some doubts/be afraid of incompatibilities? 

I’m not trying to make you feel badly, we need therapy and safe outlets to work through our feelings/vent. But if you’re unable to do a session alone/away from someone you know, you really shouldn’t mention them. I can’t reasonably say a 24 year old dude who tried not to hear and then heard you talking about him unfavorably was betraying your privacy by listening in for 2 minutes and then deciding not to and to just talk to you about it instead. Relationships require communication and this does sound like a fair point of discussion in a relationship.
Having kids is a privilege, not a right, and it’s something that honestly with how overpopulated most of the world is, most people SHOULDNT have kids. They already had 3, there is no need for them to have had a 4th or 5th kid. Seems like a lot of people are acting like having as many kids as they want is a right and it simply is not.
Eh, I think it’s pretty callous to suggest they’re ONLY having kids because they want to fuck over OP. They probably DO want these kids. Plenty of people always dreamed of a large family. And I understand it can be frustrating to have a great job and still struggle to afford the basics but that’s their reality and many other’s reality. They need to make the decision to have kids based on their current situation and also based on if they can afford it should anything change. 

Just like OP should probably have a full time job because if her ex lost his job tomorrow, she’d either no longer get child support or get a significantly reduced amount. If her current income isn’t enough to at least mostly pay for expenses, that’s probably not ideal. Everyone needs to live within *their* means, not the means of others.
Idk if this is true everywhere or even anywhere, but I thought that child custody/child support court cases are typically (where possible) handled by the same judge because it prevents finding a judge to rule how you want and also because it ensures someone at least somewhat familiar with the details of you/your case will be able to make more consistent ruling as life situations change.
And if it happens that OP doesn’t have enough income for her expenses, she’ll need to figure it out. But there’s a good chance child support won’t end until 21
Idk, I would tell my boyfriend about being groomed, and her husband everything she’s ever done and not told him. And I’d add blackmailing her own sister on to that list.
Yeah. If everyone is just going to make up a narrative under the assumption the OP must not be telling the truth, then there’s no point to this sub anyway. Just make a judgement based on the actual information given, even if you personally don’t think that’s all the info.
Oooor….. they really do just hate Jim because they see it as a replacement for their father? I mean, to some extent, we need to take OP at face value. She’s the only person who was actually there. If there’s missing information, then obviously any advice here wouldn’t work regardless.
If the kids are happy with their dad, that’s all that matters, but I will challenge you that depending on the circumstance, cheating on a parent ABSOLUTELY can impact your ability to be a good father/mother. My parents both know very clearly that if either cheated on the other, even if it’s the parent I don’t really like getting cheated on, I will not forgive the offender and they would be dead to me. And I’m definitely not a rare case. 

But what your wife is doing is NOT the way. If the kids are happy to be with their dad, that’s all that matters. Cheating doesn’t have to impact your ability to be a good parent, but I just want to point out it 100% can.
Yeah it’s extremely hard to say. They very well may have had that conversation so I don’t want to absolve this man of accountability. Buuuuut, I’ve seen a number of men and women post on here about issues that arise because they assume they’re in an official relationship when the other person doesn’t agree. I can easily see this being a similar situation where he expected it to be maybe a week or so and now a few months in he’s decided he’s just not feeling it anymore and there’s no real commitment so he’s just letting it fade out.
I mean…. He did break up with you. Tell him he can pick “either you broke up with me and I didn’t cheat on you so drop it, or you DIDNT break up with me in which case I am breaking up with you now because I sure as hell am not staying with someone who thinks it’s at all acceptable to ghost their girlfriend for 3 months. Which is it? Because I’m not doing this bullshit. I didn’t cheat on you and if you think I really did cheat on you, then this relationship is done.”

And make him pick. Once he picks, don’t let him “unpick”. And frankly, I would leave anyway because this asshat actually thinks it’s okay to ghost someone for 3 months with no consequences? Fuck that. I would brea up with someone who didn’t answer for 48 hours (and I have, I’m not exaggerating here) with no warning or explanation, let alone 3 months.
Honestly the selfish bit is just not communicating about it. Though, I honestly suspect there’s a chance they aren’t actually bf/gf and this is another case of “assuming” what they are rather than having the explicit conversation. If so, he isn’t even really a jerk for just slow fading and losing interest. If I’m wrong and they did explicitly say “we are boyfriend/girlfriend and in a committed relationship”, then he is selfish for failing to communicate the relationship no longer working for him, but outside of that it’s no surprise he doesn’t want to invest a ton of time getting to know someone who he can’t even really get to know seeing as they really don’t get to see each other much.
Yeah. Or could have just said “I didn’t have patience back then to put up with teaching and didn’t want to give you a bad learning experience. It was because I wasn’t a good teacher to you, not because you were a bad student.”
I don’t think you CAN fix this. She doesn’t love you anymore and she doesn’t seem to be attracted to you either. You can’t make someone love you and you can’t make someone want to work on things. It sounds like she ended up with you because you “saved” her and then once she was finally back on her feet the love wasn’t there enough to survive all the misfortune in your post. 

Your post has an almost unbelievable series of bad events in it. If this really did all happen in the past two years, it’s honestly no surprise she no longer loves you. Losing your money, your jobs, depression, leaving her alone in a pregnancy, being so unwilling to help clean your house developed a fungal infection??? And even more “acts of bad luck” would probably kill most marriages that young. 

I get it hurts, but you’re both 24. You were married for only a year before she decided she wanted a divorce. It sounds like she recognizes she’s still young and would be happier in a different relationship and frankly, I agree with her. You would BOTH be better off divorcing, and you working on yourself and focusing on being the best father you can be and then making sure you’re in a place where you can handle a relationship again. 

Good luck, but you need to start mourning the relationship and give your wife a divorce if that’s what she wants. I would tell her, “if you want a divorce, you need to be the one to take steps and file because I want to work this out but I also recognize I can’t make you stay.”
It’s definitely normal when a man 10 years older than you and richer than you is trying to take you on luxury vacations 4 months in, yes. 

There’s a saying “be with a man for money, you earn every cent”. I’m not saying you were with him for money, but I am trying to illustrate that men who provide their partners with lots of money/financial support/luxury experiences do often expect exactly what your boyfriend did. They think money should be enough to earn them an obedient and supportive gf. 

Now, I firmly disagree, and it’s clear you two aren’t compatible with one another. Both of you should be glad you found out early. But beware in your next relationship that older, rich men typically aren’t paying for their younger girlfriend to go on crazy vacations right after meeting out of the goodness of their heart. Sometimes they do, this isn’t an “all men” statement, but it is something that happens. And if you don’t want it to happen, I’d stick to men closer in age to you and be more firm about equal contributions financially in the relationship so there isn’t anything to try to use as leverage against you.
You can love and be a good parent to your son without being this much of a doormat to your wife. Divorce her and go for split custody.
Dating at 30 isn’t much different than dating in your 20s. However dating at 40, 50 and so on after that long with one person is definitely not ideal, so use that info to stand strong in ending things now and moving on. End it, move out if you live together and just block her if she tries to convince you. She’s just asking for permission to cheat and that is ridiculous she thinks she can brow beat you into agreeing to that.
I mean….. it’s been two weeks and you’re 20. He honestly owes you nothing. Now, do I believe he really “forgot”? No, not really. Dude isn’t worth your time based on that alone, but in a straight up hook up situation, I don’t really see it as reasonable to expect them to read your mind (you clearly wanted him to come with you but that isn’t what you said) and you are expecting him to care about your well-being and honestly handle a potential pregnancy with more care than most people’s actual committed boyfriends would. 

If you don’t like this reality, don’t have unprotected sex with guys you aren’t in a relationship with. Otherwise, it’s not really fair to be upset that they aren’t handling things the way you think they should. It sucks for sure, and this guy isn’t anyone I’d want to have sex with, but I don’t see where this is anything out of the normal for a 20 year old male hooking up with someone for a couple of weeks.
I mean, I’d love to be a billionaire too, that doesn’t mean it’s going to happen. If you don’t trust someone, drunk or sober, they probably aren’t someone you shouldn’t date

It is weird and creepy. Just keep to “I’m not interested in younger men romantically”

You know how all the waaay older men with young women say “she’s the one who heavily perused me!!!”? Ok but you also agreed so….?
It is weird and creepy. Just keep to “I’m not interested in younger men romantically”
I will mention this could very easily be a rule put in place to explicitly exclude your kids without outright saying it. Just be prepared in that case to graciously now out from attending and say you won’t be able to make it. Don’t turn things into a fight. There’s likely a reason they are making the wedding difficult to attend and it’s likely so they can have excuses not to include those they don’t really want to be there.
I wouldn’t bring it up. The conversation isn’t going to make you feel better. You know how he really feels about you. He’s either going to lie to your face and beg for forgiveness, or even worse, he isn’t going to deny any of it and will confirm this is how he really feels about you. Regardless of what he says, you’re going to feel like shit. Instead, Leave with your head held high instead. Bright side, you don’t live together and haven’t merged lives. I get it’s scary to start over but it’s better to move on at 31 and find that person than have to start over at 41 after you’ve given him another 10 years to tear down your self esteem.
I mean, yeah actually I have. When you’re in that level of crisis you can make some big strides. Does that mean everything is totally fine after 11 days? No definitely not. But, you can definitely make enough progress in a few sessions to at a minimum know you both want to and are willing to work on things. I doubt they went to 2 sessions and stopped for good, it sounds like he’s just giving an update on “we are working things out and therapy has been helpful” which isn’t at all unbelievable.
Yes I understood that, but I’m saying you’d be surprised just how quickly someone who is now “free” to do something can suddenly have all sorts of outings lined up. She may not as well, but I’m saying don’t stay because you’re afraid she can’t socialize well. She clearly can if she wants to.
Did you do the right thing about what exactly? She broke up with you for being an alcoholic. You are a 28 year old dating a 21 year old. No, I don’t really think you did the right thing and I think she tried to encourage you to be a better person. But you can only change if you want to change and so I hope you want to and are able to change because at least at the beginning of your relationship, you sounded like a creepy alcoholic dude who went out with someone really young and are surprised they actually have some standards. Granted, her age is showing by not completely blocking you and moving on, but it’s no surprise a 21 year old doesn’t think an older alcoholic is really who she wants to spend time with.
She wants to keep being your friend because bullying you makes her feel good about herself. You’re the “undesirable” one of the two of you. If *you* cut *her* off, of course she’s going to be upset, because if someone like you doesn’t even like her, what does that say about her?

Now, I’m speaking in her perspective. You sound lovely and way too patient here, but it’s clear she only keeps you around because tearing you down and you tolerating it makes her feel that much bigger and better about herself. 

Yes, you should absolutely cut her off. I would simply tell her the next time she says anything even mildly passive aggressive, “I’ve tried hard not to say anything because at one point our friendship meant a lot to me, but I’m done being your punching bag and am done with our friendship. I don’t want to talk to you anymore and I hope you learn to treat your friends a lot better than you’ve treated me.”

And then block her. Just block her. Don’t even wait for the reply. Tell your parents before sending the message so they don’t let her in and make sure they support you in this. Block her on all socials. If you think she might be really petty, maybe wait for a reply for her to say some nasty shit to you, screenshot it for ammo if she spreads rumors about you and then block/mute her
At the end of the day, that’s really all you can do. You can’t fix her, you can only try to make sure someone who cares about her will try to look out for her. 

And idk man, seems like her socializing well is the problem here, so she’ll probably be more fine than you realize, once she actually is “allowed” to do as she pleases once she’s single.
Exactly! And I am sorry that you will need to go through this discomfort. If you’re able to, just remember that it will be better in time and lead to better things.
NAH. Being concerned about your kids safety is never something I will call someone an AH for. Much like a similar post, the only people who I think are maybe AH is the neighbors who spread around the info that this person was responsible, but they’re also allowed to be upset that their kid’s are losing out on a sweet tradition. Ultimately if she brings it up again I would just say, “I heard your concerns about your child’s safety and I would never put a parent in an uncomfortable position regarding something so serious. That being said, it isn’t up to me to decide how other parents are going to feel about their own children losing out on a tradition that the neighborhood has always really enjoyed. If you change your mind and understand this isn’t about luring kids into anything other than a joy of curiosity and exploration of nature, I’m happy to continue, but I’m not going to get involved in other’s being unhappy with you for this. We’re all adults and can manage our own relationships.”
Her friends are fine too. Just someone you trust who will look out for her if they see her getting worse. You aren’t trying to fix her, you’re just looking to tell someone you’ve noticed some things that are concerning and you want them to know in case they see it too so someone can be there for her. Don’t even ask them to get her help, just tell them to be on the lookout for any signs.
Hey, I totally get it. When I was your age I thought that relationship would be my one and only. It felt so amazing and like all my prayers were answered. And then, we grew up and who we were was no longer who we are and it was no longer right. I learned so much though, and you have too. Don’t lose those principles your grandfather taught you, just because something doesn’t work out doesn’t mean that the idea isn’t good. Life just has other plans sometimes. But you’ll find that person, maybe next week and maybe next year or the next decade, but you’ll find them and it’ll be worth it. Just remember that the heartbreak will be necessary to find that relationship you’re meant to be in.
Yeah this is definitely a case where having only one side of the story means any advice other than “talk about it” is probably not great. He says he feels like she’s prioritizing this friend over him, but she may feel like he doesn’t like when she does anything without him. It’s really impossible to know which person is being “reasonable” or if maybe they’re both being reasonable but they simply aren’t compatible. 

Regardless of the answer, I still maintain showing up when explicitly told not to come is never the answer unless you’re looking to end the relationship.
I would personally reach out to her family instead of her, if she’s genuinely suffering from mental health issues that are undiagnosed, she’s unlikely to be equipped to address them. If you’re close to anyone in her life, I’d just reach out to them right after you end things and say you’ve ended it for reasons you don’t want to get into but you still care for her and want what’s best for her and think she’s been showing some signs of some mental issues that you don’t want to go unaddressed if they persist/worsen.
And that’s a 100% understandable reaction. Personally I think there is a reason most relationships at 18 don’t last anyway. I know losing a relationship that’s lasted this long is still painful, but you deserve and will find someone who will not betray your trust like this. I wish you well. It will hurt, but know that good will come from this pain.
On the one hand, I think it’s pretty difficult to be fully committed to someone for life at 18. On the other hand, if she couldn’t be satisfied in her relationship just with you, she should’ve broken up with you. I think you need to ask yourself if you could move on and have a life with someone who did this to you. Do people change? Yeah, but that doesn’t mean she has yet and it doesn’t mean just because she’s said sorry you need to accept.
I honestly probably wouldn’t do this, they need to talk and resolve the issue. If I were the girlfriend in that situation, I’d feel like my boyfriend was jealous and controlling and couldn’t let me have a trip by myself. Im not saying that’s what OP would be doing at all but that is definitely how I would feel if I told my boyfriend I wanted to do this trip alone with a friend and he explicitly went behind my back to be in the same city at the same time.
I mean. Just cut contact and tell her before you will discuss anything with her, you want to submit a blood paternity test through the lab of YOUR choosing. Without that, retain a good lawyer in preparation for her to sue for child support. Do NOT contact her in anything other than writing and do NOT respond to anything unless it’s an agreement to take a paternity test.

But also, no offense, if you did get her pregnant, you deserve the consequences as unprotected sex with a friend you’re not attracted to and you KNOW has mental health issues is just plain stupid. You’re too old to be acting like that.
I mean, would you rather be “that girl” or “the girl who was so afraid of looking like that girl that she allowed her boyfriend to blatantly disrespect her and cheat on her for the entirety of their relationship instead”? Because honestly, it’s way worse to be the second one than the first. At least “that girl” has a shred of self-respect. But right now? You’re acting like you don’t even like yourself.
Idk, I wouldn’t be able to look at HER the same if she DIDNT give you the money. What is a marriage if your word to your partner means nothing?
If you’re already over her, what, 24-48 hours later? Yeah, it was definitely the right call.
He was on mushrooms, that’s pretty par for the course with drugs of that nature. It’s rather silly to try to diagnose someone on heavily mind altering substances with a serious mental illness from a Reddit post. That being said, sober or high, he doesn’t sound like a life partner and if that’s what OP is looking for, she’d be best served moving on.
That wasn’t in the post though I did see the comment you mentioned. OP has fertility issues and will likely need fertility treatments to conceive. Definitely still a risk, but not quite the same risk as would be those otherwise healthy having unprotected sex (which for a reference, is only about 30%). I kiiinda see what you’re saying, but given most pregnancies in the US are actually unplanned, I’m not fully sure that “doesn’t add up”. If anything, it totally checks out to me lol. It seems to me that bf loves OP a lot and *wants* to spend forever with her on an emotional level, hence being okay if they did conceive, but as of right now isn’t willing to completely and legally tie himself to her until he knows they’re on the same page. 

Child support for someone you’ve never married vs someone you are married to, own a home with etc. are definitely two very different “worst case scenario” financial situations, if I’m taking all emotion out of the situation, since I’m sure you’re thinking “if he’s willing to have a child with her why not be willing to marry her” and while I definitely personally agree with that thought process, know plenty of people who don’t.
Well…. He was with his ex since they were at the oldest 15, it isn’t really that surprising they didn’t get married, as they were likely around 23-24 when they broke up. I understand 10 years sounds like a lot, but once you actually consider the majority of their relationship if not all of it comprised of middle/high school-college, it’s not really a factor. 

And we definitely have enough info from OP’s biased perspective to see why someone wouldn’t want to marry her just yet. You can love someone like crazy and still be able to recognize that someone with terrible credit, poor spending habits and payday loans, all things OP readily admits to, isn’t someone to marry right away. Marriage is both an emotional and a logical decision and it definitely sounds like the logical part of the decision has entirely valid reasons to want to wait and make sure this isn’t a disaster waiting to happen, as differences in finances are the number one reason couples divorce.
Just remember your ability to get an appointment and other’s experiences aren’t going to be the same. This occurred during lockdown when everything was done online so options weren’t limited by location and zoom therapy opened up a lot of options for people that weren’t previously available. For example, I’ve never had to wait longer than 2 weeks for an appointment I’ve needed, new patient or old, therapy or any other doctor. But that doesn’t mean I would tell anyone else they didn’t try hard enough if they weren’t able to find an appointment as quickly. 

If your only reason for doubting the veracity of this story is the idea that someone was able to get a therapy appointment quickly and hire someone during a time where plenty of people weren’t able to work due to the lockdowns, I’d urge you to remember your experiences won’t be the same as everyone else’s.
Oooor… it’s really obvious OP was way too immature for marriage until very recently and he isn’t ready/willing to make a huge and lifelong commitment to someone who only recently had poor credit and payday loans?

Why does it always need to be the guy is lying to OP about wanting to get married and bullshitting her with his super valid concerns about proceeding?
I mean, your relationship isn’t serious, he’s said as much if he’s already planning who he’s going to fuck when you break up. He clearly isn’t very committed or interested in you if he’s already prepared for how he’ll get over your breakup and which friends he’ll find comfort inside, literally. Break up with him and you probably need to break up with that friend as well, because I don’t know how shitty of a person someone needs to be to sleep with their friend of 4 years FWB at a minimum, pseudo boyfriend more accurately. That’s a pure trash move from BOTH parties and most 22-23 year olds will know better than to behave like this, men and women.
I mean, now you’ve learned how your husband will treat your kid if/when you divorce him and he finds some other younger woman to start a family with. 

Red flag if ever I saw one.
At that point, just leave, otherwise it’s just an attention seeking endeavor, “please notice me withdrawing!!” rather than organically just matching the energy. It wouldn’t be noticeable otherwise and then you’re brought back to my initial comment. Easier said than done when you live together and if you’re at the point of needing to be petty to be heard, the relationship clearly isn’t working.
You moved and said no one you know is in your area. How is your ex a genuine concern, he wouldn’t know where you live?
Well, you have no idea what she’s in therapy for. This is clearly either an obvious crush on BIL and a bs sexist ploy to get close to him/have an affair, or genuine anxiety but that doesn’t mean that either have been adequately brought up in therapy. You can be in therapy for things and not be in therapy for “everything” or even “the right things”.
Sounds like she looked up the wine and saw the price for a case not a bottle, as a case of 12 is around £200 and figured you wouldn’t know the difference.
Ok well neither of you sound grown up enough to get married.
That’s probably much easier if you don’t live and have pets together like OP. At that point, it’s pretty difficult to pull back in any meaningful way without being seen as really petty.
You can be upset your girlfriend went to a con topless. That’s a pretty standard boundary for most people. But you don’t say you feel she crossed a line by being topless, you’re upset because she *embarrassed you because you don’t like how her body looks after beating cancer* and that’s what makes you TA.
It’s a small company, there likely is not HR.
Ok but I very much doubt she was overcompensating for the past 4.5 years, this has likely been an issue for at least a few years, no?
Talking about this issue is the start, but if you guys aren’t able to *actively resolve these issues* within the next 3 months, I would cancel the wedding. I would accelerate that timeline depending on when/if you need to cancel by a certain date to get refunds on whatever you can. 

Chances are, you aren’t able to resolve these issues. You would be EXTREMELY foolish to push forward into a marriage where resentment is already blooming, because even canceling an expensive wedding will be much cheaper than a divorce.
The fact that it’s taken you 5 years to even begin to question such a glaring and obvious incompatibility is mind numbing to me. 

This isn’t fixable. She isn’t going to suddenly going to start wanting sex as much as you do. You’re signing up for a lifetime of disappointment which seems unwise.
Yeah, I’m really not surprised that attraction is at the core of this. I’m sorry to kick you while you’re down, but in the absence of kids or seriously debilitating health issues, there are honestly few people out there who won’t start to lose attraction for such a massive change in appearance before marriage. Somehow everyone on Reddit claims to be that minority, and I’m sure most people wouldn’t *say* anything, but attraction and effort is also very important to a long lasting relationship, and you WILL find that. Like I said, there are plenty of people out there who really don’t care, and will find you beautiful at any weight or type of clothing. It’s now just time to find them :) good luck.
To be honest, I do not understand this. Your brother’s *30th milestone birthday* is the same night and you wanted to go as a couple and obviously were planning to attend, so how did this conversation of “am I invited?” And “I’ll get a sitter” even happen?

How was the conversation not, “it is my brother’s birthday that same night, you are either attending with me or you’re staying and watching the children, but going to a 21st birthday of a friend isn’t an option”? Like I just don’t get how you didn’t bring up your brother’s birthday and how you were just ready to ditch your brother’s birthday if you WERE invited to this person’s 21st?
Yeah, and it’s foolish to think “that will never happen” because of course as soon as you bank your life on “that won’t happen”, it does. Without fail.
Sadly doesn’t seem like he cares about losing OP too much, as he left the house even after Noelle told him to get lost, and didn’t deny it or try to work things out. All things considered though, OP is better off with him not fighting, because at least she’ll be able to leave much sooner and with much less pomp and circumstance.
Uhm, whoever that “they” is is an idiot, because it isn’t true. Alcohol isn’t a “truth serum” it just lowers your inhibitions, and sometimes, those inhibitions are all that’s stopping people from saying something absolutely wildly untrue but just pops into their head and sound good/funny/shocking.
A 45 lb weight gain in less than 2 years as an otherwise healthy (assuming here since nothing to indicate otherwise) 20 something year old is definitely really concerning honestly. Reddit hates to address it, but that would definitely put a strain on attraction for most people, the other obvious issues aside. That being said, not everyone and you deserve a partner who is attracted to you as you are now and loves you and wouldn’t leave you even if someone “better” came along.
Idek if this is about him being insecure so much as about him wanting to be able to do better than OP, and the reality is, things change in people’s lives *all the time* that open up previously unavailable dating options. People get rich, start to take skin care or fitness or eating healthy more seriously all the time. Health issues or fixes can completely change a person. Promotion at work? Lottery win? Inheritance or an investment that pays off? Some insecure 23 year old with daddy issues comes along?


As soon as that happens, OP is getting dumped. Immediately and remorselessly.
It isn’t about her, it’s about him. He pretty outright told you, “if a woman like her were interested in me, I wouldn’t be with you I would be with her”. He might “love” you, but if/when a woman in “her league” likes him, he’ll be the type who can’t resist. You really want to be one of those “my husband left me when I was pregnant with our second child for a woman 10 years younger than me” stories? Because he is the man who leaves his wife for a woman 10 years younger than him because he never thought he’d have a chance with the hot young woman and now that he does he’s willing to blow up his life for the chance.

He can nuke this relationship with his friend to the ground and it doesn’t matter because *she* isn’t the woman who will give him a chance. But someone someday probably will. And if you can’t trust your partner to turn down *any* woman, young old hot rich smart poor stupid etc., why are you with them?
You love who you thought he was, not who he is. Are you telling me you think so little of yourself to fall in love with someone whom you know is only with you because he thinks he can’t do any better? He thinks you’re fat, thinks you can’t cook and thinks he’s also poor and not worth a “better” woman. That’s…. Not what I look for in a dream man honesty
Do you… regret having your son? Because this definitely sounds like you regret having your son and can’t genuinely fathom someone *wanting* to be a parent as a #1 goal in life. Remember, people can want different things and if you keep up this attitude, your son is going to realize you clearly regret becoming a mother.
Probably because he loves his wife and also because regardless of how unhappy you are, not many people want to be the guy who divorced his wife after she beat cancer. You’d be surprised by how much guilt probably made him stay as long as he did.
A marriage is more than sex, but a marriage IS NOT more than any form of intimacy. With absolutely no form of intimacy and affection you aren’t married, you’re just legal roommates. Why have all of the liability for none of the benefits? That isn’t a partner at that point.
It isn’t just sex. It’s all form of love and intimacy. How can you expect a marriage to last if you’re unwilling/unable to do any of the things that actually make a marriage a marriage? They aren’t kissing, cuddling, pleasing each other or even hugging each other. No back massages or showers together or any form of intimacy. She isn’t willing to go to therapy with him and has made it clear she expects this to be permanent. She has made her choice and it’s a choice anyone would respect, but just because you respect someone’s choice doesn’t mean you need to accept it. 

Her choice affects him as well, and he’s allowed to decide that that’s not the life he signed up for. Stop acting as those refusing ALL forms of intimacy and affection AND being unwilling to work on or compromise about it is “just about sex”.
I mean…. Does she need to be worried about it? Because it’s a choice to remove all intimacy and romance from a marriage, and that’s a choice that was made separate from the lack of libido. If you remove everything that makes a marriage unique from a friendship/roommate, it’s unreasonable to expect someone to want to continue being in that marriage.

If OP’s wife wants OP to stick around in a marriage with no intimacy at all, that’s very different from libido issues and a lack of PIV.
I think you should just say this, “at this point, it isn’t about the cake, it’s about you 1. Saying you would do something, repeatedly, and then not following through 2. You not being able to handle being called out on not staying true to your word and 3. The fact that you can see clearly NOW that it is that important and you’ve shown no remorse or sense of accountability and haven’t even apologized or tried to make it up to me. This isn’t the kind of person I want to be with. I’m glad I found this out only 10 months in at least”. 

Because really, this isn’t the kind of person you want to be with.
While that’s fair enough, they definitely do upgrade only one person on the same reservation when it’s free upgrades, had it happen a number of times to me.
There’s a substantial difference between giving someone on your locator number an upgrade and a stranger though.
I get it, but yeah, relationships that go through so many bumps honestly aren’t stronger. Yes, you need to be able to work through issues, but relationships that constantly have bumps are just rocky, and eventually someone is going to decide they don’t want to deal with the rockiness forever. I think a lot of people in rocky and unstable relationships think they’re stronger because “well we’ve always worked though things before!” But I think most people outside of the relationship can see the opposite is really true, because people just don’t want to constantly be trying to work things out with someone as nauseam *forever*. 

If you’re constantly fighting with someone, even small spats but especially bigger spats, that almost always means that relationship isn’t right, at least not without something major changing.
I think the sad thing is people like that actually are often really loyal to the person they actually want, and end up getting left by those people, leading to them being in general super disrespectful of other’s time.
Honestly, I wouldn’t even say that. I would just say, “I realized I don’t see this being a long term thing and don’t want either of our time to be wasted so it’s best we part ways now rather than later.”

Why would you admit to knowing some pretty messed up info? Just say you don’t feel it anymore and make her think it’s because of her, not because of OP not being enough for her.
NTA. Just sit your parents down and say, “I am feeling like I don’t matter as much to you as Ana. Is this true?” Let them answer. Once they do say, “every year you treat me like a second class citizen giving me a 10 minute meal I don’t even really love to celebrate and giving everyone else the ability to choose whatever they want on their birthday. I am willing to compromise and give Ana our actual birthday, but do you really think that’s fair? Because I’m only 16 and I realize how blatantly unfair that is. Can we please as a family sit down and can you please listen to me expressing myself and come to a compromise?” Listen for their answer. If their answer isn’t “yes of course”, just say this, “I love you, which is why I’m being really honest with this. If you guys aren’t able to recognize the blatant favoritism and disrespect that’s going on, don’t be surprised if in a few years our relationship looks very different. If you guys aren’t willing to show all of your children the same love in the same ways, that’s going to really damage our relationship. And I’m not saying this as a bratty teenager, I’m saying this as your hurt daughter who doesn’t want to believe that her parents would be so calloused to not realize that a 16 year old still needs the same love and joy around her birthday even if she has a younger sister. I didn’t stop existing when Ana was born.”

Just be mature about it. Don’t yell or throw a tantrum. And remember. You’ll be 18 in a few years and can decide how much this truly affects the relationship with your parents then.
I.. don’t think one month is the standard either.
I know this is hard to hear but I don’t think this is as quick a switch up as you’re making it out to be. Sounds like there were a lot of issues throughout your relationship and a lot of incompatibilities. That’s not really a sudden problem. It’s a bit misleading and naive to tell yourself this is sudden, because even in your post, I can tell this was a long time coming as a stranger, and I didn’t live this relationship. You may benefit from being honest about the past 4 years to learn the signs of a doomed relationship, because I bet upon reflection, they will be there.
Tbh it’s very possible they got notice and disregarded it/missed it. I know I don’t read a lot of mail that looks like junk.
I mean…… just remember people really do find out about their cheating spouse this way.
I think it really depends on where you are and how diligent you are. A lot of times I think people are unfamiliar with how to find people to call, which results in everyone calling the top few results and leading to insane wait times and inevitably people give up after a number of “we have an appointment x months away”. But I’ve never had an issue getting an appointment when I needed one, it was only ever a question of “how many doctors would I need to call” to get one. I’m sure everyone’s experience is different though, but there are definitely more resources available than a lot of people realize unfortunately.
So, you aren’t saying she needs to include SIL, but the issue is you also aren’t saying “she DOESNT need to include her and frankly I do not want my wife to include someone who so deliberately excluded her from their own wedding”. 

Inaction is action here. You think just because you aren’t saying to include her you’re in the clear, but you aren’t you need to tell your family she DOESNT and SHOULDNT include her. Understand the difference?
Ok and to be fair, you know your fiancée DID feel excluded. You could’ve spoken about it to the brother you are “very very close to” but you didn’t. So yes, it IS YOUR (not “our”, YOUR) bad for for communicating this at the time two years ago, and now Lisa will learn actions have consequences, even if those actions are somewhat reasonable. 

Just explain to anyone who asks “if you didn’t feel comfortable having my wife in your wedding party, you can’t expect her to feel comfortable having you in hers. Just like we respected your decision to choose who to include in your wedding party and your wedding photos, you need to respect our decision. This isn’t up for discussion anymore. I am not going to allow my wife to feel uncomfortable about anything surrounding the happiest day of our lives. Are we clear?”

Time to be a big boy and stand up for your wife and your marriage. If you don’t, this is the sort of pattern that rots a marriage inside out. Take notes.
It’s the current standard of care for fractious cats in vet med. “easier said than done” really shouldn’t apply to doing your job properly. Not only that, but it’s pretty simple to have the vet just place the towel over the cats body that the tech can then secure with the bits of his arm/torso that are available. Sure, if there was one person doing this you might have a point, but not with two sets of hands available
There are definitely way better restraint methods that are meant to be used for fractious cats like this. For example: placing a towel over the cat’s face which will help to calm the cat and also prevent the cat from reading back to bite like that.
You mean…. Building a successful team DOESNT happen overnight? They actually *gasp* need *time* to bring everything together and dominate? 

I’m shocked. /s
Heads up, if you’re actually a doctor you need to be smart enough to tell the difference. Your wife has a genuine problem with the frequency and amount of your drinking. If you’re unwilling/unable to have a serious conversation about your alcohol consumption while you’re both sober, you probably aren’t making it to too many more anniversary celebrations. She’s getting fed up. This isn’t her humor, this is her genuine annoyance and frustration. You would be an utter fool not to see this for what it is and address your pretty clear problem.

Men your age are NOT getting wasted every Friday unless they’re alcoholics.
I mean, definitely depends. It wouldn’t surprise me if OP is an alcoholic. “I had another beer because that’s just what I do on a Friday night” despite being visibly drunk already sounds like binge drinking. And it sounds like something his wife isn’t okay with and probably even had a conversation with him about “please don’t embarrass me at our anniversary” or whatever wording it was, asking him NOT to get so drunk and she’s annoyed as she’s been putting up with it for so long.
Can confirm from experience. Anyone who says it won’t affect things and says it’ll still be a ‘friendship’ trip is lying. The only reason it won’t ‘affect’ OP’s trip is because the friend and her boyfriend will NEVER be around, which in and of itself completely ruins the point of the trip, unless OP wanted to be alone the whole time. Very much NOT worth. And ruined the friendship, I will add.
Yeah. This is a reminder that unless you get some mega asshole, people aren’t going to be commenting on this sort of thing. It’s all about if you’re comfortable enough to have that part of your body be seen.
Ignore her. If you really want a clear message sent, block her account. If ever you need to say anything, just say, “I have no interest in being friends with someone like you. I have way more respect for myself than to keep someone in my life who would purposefully flirt with my boyfriend in front of me just to prove a point. That says a lot and everything that it says is appalling. Stop contacting me.”
Yes, BUT they also (pretty commonly) get it when they themselves aren’t clean enough and bacteria from their butt gets into too close contact with their vagina during sex. Any UTI you get using a condom is likely due to your own hygiene rather than the covered condom. It definitely isn’t JUST men who can have poor hygiene and it’s important to recognize that maybe they are both in need of a good scrub for the other’s comfort. It’s never easy to bring up concerns so he may have a legitimate concern as well that he didn’t know how to tactfully bring up. 

They can/should BOTH be taking showers before sex.
Yeah, but I’m sure you immediately saw his reaction and apologized. Clearly that did not happen here.
Then you wouldn’t be saying “teehee idk” when your partner asks what you’ll do. You say “i took it so he’d leave me alone but I’ll delete it when we’re home”.
Lmao. Look, she can absolutely have a hotwife/cuck fetish and if her partner is on board like her ex obviously was, that’s totally cool. I’m not shaming two individuals who have fully consented to whatever in their relationship. But NO you aren’t “jealous” for having a problem with your girlfriend saying “I don’t know” what she’s going to do about the dude who wants to fuck her and she’s playing along with it. That’s like her trying to say you’re jealous for being mad she has another dude inside of her. There are some pretty well established boundaries within monogamous relationships that while it’s always best to discuss anyway, are “go without saying” rules and expectations. Not entertaining dudes who very clearly want to get in your pants is pretty bare min. 

Your girl has something wrong with her if she genuinely doesn’t see how without *express* consent from you playing this behavior, that it’s *just not okay*.
u/savevideo
I would honestly just say, “your attitude is atrocious. If I waited for you, you can wait for me. It was a few minutes. I’m extremely disappointed in you for trying to turn something good in my life about yourself. We need to talk about this because I’m absolutely not going to tolerate this sort of behavior, but I think it’s best we both take some space from each other to collect our thoughts so we can hopefully have a productive conversation about this because right now I’m having a hard time seeing how to move forward in a relationship with someone who can’t be happy when something good happens.”

Because this is either a habit of hers or this is the first time it’s happened and either way, you need to make it *crystal clear* that if she thinks this is okay, you two aren’t compatible. Why would you willingly stay with someone who would burst your bubble like this over *seven fucking minutes*? I’ve literally taken shits that last longer.
Did he actually not have sex with someone for 7 years? I’m honestly doubtful of that, because if it took him a few months to ask you to be exclusive, you were presumably having sex while not in a relationship. A guy who goes 7 years without sex doesn’t really do things that way…

I don’t know if you’re taking “didn’t date anyone for 7 years” to be the same as “didn’t have sex or see anyone at all for 7 years” because they aren’t quite the same. Now obviously if he explicitly said the words “you’re the first person I’ve slept with since my ex, 7 years ago” then ofc.
Also, to OP she feels the love has started growing since Nov. to him, it didn’t even start until they made things official, which was only a few months. It takes people awhile to fall in love sometimes, especially if it’s been 7 years since he last was. I assume he wasn’t celibate during that time, so it lends itself to the idea of “he isn’t one to fall in love easily or quickly”. 

OP, if you’re offended, I think you need to look inward and assess. You say I love you because you want someone to feel good, not because you want the emotional validation of hearing it back.
Well because believe it or not it actually doesn’t solve the problem to say “omg wow he suuuuucks!” If we want to be high school girls gossiping in the lunch room we’ll focus on the negative behavior, but if you’re actually trying to problem solve, you focus less on the actions of the past and more on the actions to do in the future to address the behavior. And in order the address it, OP needs to communicate how she’s feeling.
Well, it’s not really a family vacation. She specifically said to him, “I want to see this city and I want you to spend time with your teacher”. That can very reasonably be interpreted as two separate vacations that are going on at the same time, with obvious time spent together. But this isn’t the same thing as “a family vacation” where the only intent is to have fun together as a family. OP wants to see the city and in trying to make that happen, explicitly told her husband she wanted him to be able to spend time and hang out with a friend. Mind you, this is the first time they’ve ever met, and it’s presumably in a country that speaks the language husband has been learning. It’s completely understandable how meeting a friend for the first time you can get lost in the time and being exposed to a culture for the first time and being able to apply everything you’ve been working hard to learn could also just be so new and exciting for OP’s husband. 

Now, is it right what he’s doing? No. He’s married to a mother and he needs to understand that there are certain limitations with that. But, this isn’t a family vacation in the traditional sense and so it’s very easy to see how husband doesn’t understand OP would have a problem with him hanging out with his friend when he was explicitly told the purpose of the trip was so he could do so. So, COMMUNICATION is key, and no, not some condescending “cOmMuNiCaTioN” like that’s some fucking ridiculous concept. Actual, adult communication.
I have a feeling the fact that it’s NOT his daughter is playing a role. He rather obviously doesn’t really consider himself a father. And while I don’t think he should have to, he also is married to a mother and with that comes an understanding of there will be natural changes and limitations to what you can do on vacation. 

Going out past 10 pm only to go out again at 3 am and not be back till after 7 am is definitely one of those things you really can’t do.
Yeah, the longer she waits the more likely it’s completely over. I don’t see how a relationship recovers after this much time dead in the water honestly.  I had a friendship end pretty similarly and I was open to repairing it for like a few weeks and after they didn’t reach out, I was over it. When they finally DID reach out, I just ignored it.
Honestly given it’s been a few weeks since they’ve spoken, Allie may NOT be keeping OP in her life either. If OP wants to save that friendship, she needs to reach out and apologize and ask how she can best support Allie and respect her boundaries while doing so because if she doesn’t reach out, the relationship with Allie is done for.
Are you telling me that you’re happy now?
Idk, everyone says that, but they either don’t know the people around them or just have a selection bias, because if you are honest enough and live long enough, you realize that, like I said, 95% of the population says catty things to their close confidants and humans as a whole really are not immune from having crappy thoughts. It’s incredibly naive of people who claim “not meeee! Must be you!”

Hell, I can look at most peoples comment histories and see plenty of catty comments. The only difference is being able to at least acknowledge it.
Gently prodding for more details like the people asking for each of their exact salary? I gotta say, I side with him on that one. He’s asking for advice about a particular situation and attitude.
I mean, he said slightly and it’s negligible. At that point if you think negligible is 2x, nothing then you also just think nothing OP is saying is reliable, in which case advice is pointless. Some people aren’t comfortable sharing specific details on the internet for anonymity.

😂 imagine being so hungry for info on strangers you block someone for calling out how weird it is.
Uhuh…. That’s what everyone says. It’s like someone saying they don’t owe in the shower. It’s more likely they’re lying/in denial about it than they don’t actually pee in the shower. 

Most people don’t realize just how catty private conversations really are to an outsider.
Just tell her you’ll cover this month if she covers next. And if she puts up a fight just say, “if you don’t see the issue in your attitude we need to have a more serious conversation about our relationship in general because it’s not okay for you to expect me to cover the burden of your mistakes without so much as having a conversation or asking me about it. I’m not okay being with someone who thinks that’s okay, regardless of if this is over $30 or way more.”
Dude. Stop asking about OP’s personal salary info.
I think the issue is she said “I’m not paying this month because I already made my budget (kinda hard assed imo but I guess?) AND I’m not paying extra the month after either”. She’s basically saying “you NEED to pay for my fuck up and I’m not accepting ANY other answer”. Over $5 or $5k or $50k, that sort of attitude is *really bad* for any relationship.
Well, you also said you’ve only been dating a few months. You’d be surprised at how well people are at hiding their true nature for months and even years at a time. But, now you’ve seen a side to her, and while it’s possible she means what she said to you, more likely than not, she just doesn’t like confrontation and is spinning things to sound nicer to you now that you called her out. Either she is going to dump you, or you’re going to dump her, but there’s very little chance this person is ‘your person’. I’m sorry, I know it sucks to find out someone isn’t who you thought they are.
No offense as well, but it’s also really naive to think 95% of people DONT have a mean side in some regard. People are not known for being saints. If you had to show strangers your worst private conversation with your closest friends and families, we would ALL think every single person in this thread is vain, judgmental and shallow.
I mean….. the whole point of the post was centered around a superficial perception of worth, not surprising he would only bring up the direct comparisons that are relevant. Not only that, but if he actually spent half the post talking about all the reasons he likes her outside of on paper, you’d be saying he’s overcompensating and she’s not really that great. 

I think if you described your partner to a complete and utter stranger, most would say similar things. You’re not going to go on about “he gives the best head I’ve ever had” you’ll say things like “he’s smart, funny, handsome etc”

Yes you can. You can hide your name from the leaderboard and pull your account from the third party trackers.
Unless this happened yesterday, this person was clearly able to easily find an OB that DIDNT ask, so it can’t really be “standard practice” or else everyone would have asked her.
Yeah….. don’t expect this person to be your friend moving forward. I can’t imagine ever wanting someone who suggested getting rid of the baby I really wanted in my life just because THEY thought it was too soon.
That isn’t fair at all. She seems to just want an equal, and that’s going to be near impossible with someone 15 years older than her.
Are you actually shocked she was unhappy or are you just shocked she would actually leave? Because the fact that you’re shocked is the problem. She TOLD YOU what she needed and you ignored her. If you’re genuinely so emotionally stunted that you can have all that information and still “be shocked” that shows just how terrible of a partner you are. Every time you say “I’m just so shocked” makes you look that much worse. That’s like someone seeing a lit fire and then saying “they’re shocked” when it burns. Someone that dumb probably shows it in other ways as well, and for you, the issues definitely showed in other ways. So be honest, are you ACTUALLY shocked, or are you just shocked she would actually leave?
NTA, but most likely there’s a background there and you hit a nerve you didn’t know about. Let it go, I’m sure it doesn’t really have anything to do with you. I will say, I think it IS a bit personal after knowing someone less than 4 months to be, effectively, asking about if they had an in-depth conversation about marriage or if it was a surprise. I can understand how that might strike a nerve with some people. I’m sure you meant it pretty innocently though, so you’re not really an AH for that. I say NTA since if she does have a nerve to strike, probably shouldn’t be sharing things at work but, to each their own.
You…. Are just making crap up now. They met at a mutual hobby. You’re aware that it is genuinely possible to just get on with someone, right? Like holy hell are you deluded to act as though someone HAS to (yes, I am aware they often do, but to act as though that’s the ONLY option is insane) seek out some young woman and it isn’t genuinely possible for two adults to meet and hit it off and for age not to come up until later. Believe it or not, in the adult world, you don’t often say, “hi how are you, my name is blank and I am XX years old, how about you?” “Oh sorry, you’re too old for me to talk to”. They didn’t meet on a dating app. They met in the real world over shared interests. It’s mind numbing to me someone can be so bigoted to just blindly ignore all other possibilities because yes, often age gaps are bad. Do you think other stereotypes are okay to blindly follow too? (Heads up, they aren’t). 

The only dodgy behavior here is yours, because I’m not the one arguing to blindly judge a person and their intentions based solely on their age. Not only that, but you’re *infantilizing a fucking 28 year old soon to be nurse* do you have any idea how *disrespectful* that is to women in general? Just ludicrous.
Just reply, “I bought the ticket for my date. That was meant to be you, but clearly you had other plans, so I found a new date.”
I think ultimately, you just need to stop caring. Why are you walking on eggshells? You are legally 100% within your rights to do what you’re doing. He can’t complain about the noise you’re making. You’re legally allowed to use your apartment even with reasonable disruption to others. Most landlords can’t actually make rules like “no cooking/using laundry machine after 10 pm” because that infringes on your legal right to use your space you’re paying for. So just *stop caring*. So what if he bangs? Not your problem. You’re not doing anything wrong. Tune him out. Keep your door locked. If you need to report anything simply say to the landlord in writing, “the neighbor below me has been banging on the walls at all hours of the day in response to my normal living habits. I am not making any excessive noise and have taken every precaution to minimize my disruption to neighbors to what is reasonable while still allowing me to live in the space I’m paying for. I know I am not doing anything wrong here, so I am alerting you of the issue in case this escalated further and in case you’re able to speak with neighbor to understand that apartment building aren’t always completely silent and I’m legally entitled to walk to the bathroom if I wake up and need to pee.” But other than that *stop caring*.
Girl, real talk, if you think *two years of being miserable* and being 28 before you can even START to find a real partner is worth LESS than $3k, you need some therapy. 

This is SO worth $3k that I’d even say it’s worth going into credit card debt over. But, obviously if you can take a loan from family, a no/low interest balance transfer, find a cheaper place etc etc etc, do that first, but genuinely, your mental health and happiness is worth *so much more than $3k.* and if you’re already paying 70%+ of the rent, find a cheaper place and the money you’ll save from only needed to care for one adult will more than make up for it.
NTA. This isn’t the standard “my cousin doesn’t respect my serious relationship that is longer than he’s been dating his fiancée” you always see. (Where I’d probably say your gf would be valid in feeling hurt you left her behind as that’s a direct insult to your relationship). But, He is famous and presumably if he never gets privacy, somewhat significantly famous where paparazzi may be trying to snoop. Your girlfriend only wanting to come because of the experience (famous person, cool wedding) is *exactly* the kind of person your cousin is trying to avoid attending his wedding. No offense to your girlfriend, I get how she feels, but your cousin is allowed to want privacy in one of the most intimate milestones in his life and making sure only close friends and “immediate/actual” family is the best way to ensure that.
NTA. Sepsis has a 20-50% mortality rate that then increases by something like 5-7% *every hour* you go without treatment. It’s quite frankly one of the *worst* medical outcomes you can have short from a horrifyingly traumatic injury and some ultra aggressive cancers. Your BIL either hates your brother or is a massive idiot because chances are better than not that your brother ISNT fine and if he is, it’ll be it’s own little miracle, given he probably was ignoring the symptoms for a bit of time if he thought it was just a bad virus.
😂😂😂 that isn’t a lie, even in a court of law. Learn how the English language works better because those statements are 100% accurate and would hold up to any intelligent scrutiny. I’m done with this conversation now. Bye bye.
No…. It isn’t. It’s not a lie to not give everyone a play by play reenactment of every decision you’ve ever made. It’s not even a half truth. It’s just a truth. OP saw her on SM and figured they’d get along. Whether or not you agree, it’s definitely because they have mutual friends that OP came to that conclusion. OP would not have felt that way if it were just a complete and total stranger who happened to live in the same city. And again, definitely a small world because let’s do this with *actual* strangers. If I rolled up in LA and decided I liked (random influencer), I could swipe for months and never find them. That statement is plain and simple truth.

Remember, no one is entitled to every single thought you’ve ever had in the name of ‘integrity’. That’s foolish. Have a good day now!
You’re contradicting yourself. You’re essentially saying if it ever comes up, she should continue to lie about not knowing they had mutual friends rather than saying “I was a little embarrassed because I figured you had no idea who I was” if she asks about it, rather than being technically 100% truthful. If you advocate transparency, then there’d be nothing wrong with this, as it would technically be clearing up the only actual lie OP has told.
I certainly would never *bring it up* but you’d be surprised how many stupid conversations couples who are newly in love will have. It’s better to have a thought out way to frame things than just word vomiting because you’re flustered and caught off guard and coming off like the next Joe.
It’s not a lie. There is no mention of the temporality of those events, and to some extent, that is a large part of why OP figured they’d like her personality, SM is a shit reflection of who a person really is, but the fact that they had mutual friends lent a lot of credence to the conclusions OP was making. And it is a small world, or else OP’s plan would not have worked. 

Sure, it’s carefully curating the truth to give the best perspective on the situation, but there’s no lie, so there’s no concern of breach of integrity. I purposefully avoided any language that would indicate a temporal correlation between seeing her on SM and matching on the dating app to make sure that there wasn’t any lies.
Yes. For everyone out there, an ESA is a PET. That is legally (effectively) all they are. The ONLY luxuries having an ESA allows you is having them in no-pet housing and being able to fly with them on SOME airlines, and you need extensive paperwork. Outside of those two very specific and limited instances, they’re no different than any other dog out there. They can be forbidden from public spaces and do not have any other ‘protections’. They aren’t ‘working’ and thus the whole “do not pet a working dog” doesn’t apply. It is a crime to claim an ESA is a service animal, by the way. Two very different legal definitions. 

Now, you should always use caution when petting a dog you don’t know, as you don’t know if the dog will bite, but at that point, that’s FULLY the fault of the owner for not restraining their *pet* in public.
Sometimes it’s all in how you package things. “we matched and I realized I’d seen you in friend’s socials and I figured hey, if they fuck with you maybe I would too, and here we are. Crazy how it’s such a small world huh?” Sounds way better than “before you even knew I existed I decided we’d be a good couple so I downloaded all the apps because that makes my intentions the most clear and just swiped until I found you and hoped for the best, easy really now that I think about it”, doesn’t it?
The *only* thing I would EVER admit to is “I had seen you on SM before and seeing you on (whatever app) made me want to shoot my shot, small world huh?” and if she ever pressed just say, “nah I never thought about sliding into your DMs but I saw a cute girl who I knew my friends fucked with and figured hey, if they fuck with you I might too and here we are”. 

Makes it waaaaaay less stalkery than what your post implies.
Best of luck! Just remember, you and him vs the problem, he’s committed to being a team to figure this out. You guys got this!
There is the fourth issue of “you two are also incompatible for other reasons”. At some point, you may need to accept you two are two puzzle pieces from completely different sets that you keep trying to force together that were just never meant to. You don’t seem to have a lot of the necessary fundamentals for a long lasting relationship, and then on top of it there’s issues of trust and intimacy building up with it. There’s only so much good communication can fix, and you may need to take a good hard look and see how much of these issues are just who you each are and how you two don’t work together.
That honestly means that while the road ahead will be tough and filled with work, you two will likely figure this out. Try to hold onto that hope while you two are navigating the road ahead. It may get worse before it gets better because both of you two are clearly on wholly other planets right now. But he wants to try and you want to try. Both of you are willing to genuinely give therapy a try and communication can almost always be improved with hard work and honest self-reflection. In some ways, you two have already overcome the hardest obstacle— deciding to make it work.
Yike, I’m not trying to normalize it, no, but I am trying to say “don’t make a judgment strictly about a person’s age when if you eliminated the age their feelings would be totally valid”. Because his feelings are totally valid, the age gap isn’t the issue here. 

Look man, if you wanna be prejudiced against people, how about YOU say it with your whole chest, because otherwise, I’ll continue to look at the actual behavior of the individuals before making someone out to be predatory.
Don’t be too hard on yourself. Your future is so important and as much as it sucks this didn’t work out, there will be other guys out there. Your story isn’t uncommon at all. I did a similar degree and at the start, a lot of our class was in relationships and within that first year, unless the couple’s were already engaged/married, not many were able to survive the stress of being a full time professional student.
Not for anything, but that’s not really an accurate contextualization either. Most 28 year olds have an established career already. It’s a fully fledged adult and you have been at that point for a few years. 40 also isn’t really middle aged, and if it is, it’s only barely. You’re naturally trying to make her seem younger and him older, but at this point, the differences in their age are nowhere near that of a 20 and a 32 year old. And again, he isn’t AT ALL saying she can’t do anything outside of him. It’s just a simple fact that it’s REALLY HARD to make meaningful time for a partner when you’re doing a medical degree and working full time and still managing to work out and take care of yourself. Please stop trying to make this about his age. Almost any other 28 year old would have similar feelings here. It’s completely normal to feel this way in a relationship where your partner is either unable or unwilling to give adequate time to the relationship. I don’t understand why you’re trying to make this about some weird power dynamic when anyone who has gone through a professional degree like nursing, doctor, lawyer, knows that half of your class starts out in a relationship and by the end of that first year, a whole heck of a lot of them are newly single because they just can’t devote enough time to the relationship to make it work.
The age gap isn’t actually the problem. If anything, it’s OP that’s the problem as she really doesn’t have the time right now to properly maintain a relationship, and that’s why she totally made the right call in recognizing that and recognizing her partner was unhappy and it was unfair.
I…. Think you’re being way too heavily biased by the years they’re born. For once I don’t see this as an issue of age. Believe it or not adults partake in the same hobbies at all ages. So, Take age out of the question. If these two were the same age, you wouldn’t really be saying that, it’s completely normal for him to feel alone and unloved in a relationship where they see each other once a week, live a decent drive apart, and she’s going to school in a difficult program while working full time. That means she really doesn’t have a lot of time to give him, and frankly, very few people ARE okay with having a partner with so little time to spare, and who blatantly says “you aren’t as important to me as school/work”. Even if true (and I agree, prioritize school!) that is a statement that is going to sting and be really hard to maintain a positive and supportive relationship with someone. He isn’t demanding she drop out, he is just voicing his extremely valid feelings. It’s hard to imagine anyone WOULDNT feel abandoned and unloved in a relationship like OP is describing, and it’s understandable that he would struggle to be really supportive while also balancing his career and his own emotions about the relationship. OP certainly isn’t emotionally supporting her ex, so it’s not really hard to see why he wouldn’t be emotionally supporting her. 

Now, she’s not in the wrong. She needs to focus on school and build her career. But that also probably means she needs to do it while single until she actually has enough time to devote to a relationship, because just like she needs to spend a lot of time on school, you also need to spend a lot of time cultivating a loving and healthy relationship. She made the right choice to end things not because of his age, but because she doesn’t have the time and he was (rightfully) unhappy with the dynamic. It happens. OP handled things incredibly maturely, not surprising since she isn’t exactly young (and I say this because someone is saying he groomed her…, at 28).
You… may want to discuss a prenup if you haven’t already. You two still love each other and want to spend your lives together and she’s already looking to maximize her profit at your expense. God help you if you two ever DONT love each other, she’ll take you for everything you’re worth and then some. You may trust her now when you’re happy, but prenups plan for the messy end, not the happy beginning, so be forewarned.
Make sure you have a solid plan in place for where you will go and who will be there to support you first. Make sure all of your documents are out of the house and have an overnight bag ready to go and a place to stay before you broach the conversation. Have a friend who will be on standby in case you need them. He’s threatened self harm so if that doesn’t work he may become aggressive towards you. 

Then, you just wait until he’s home and hasn’t had a particularly bad day at work/school and say, “we need to talk about our relationship because I don’t see this working out long term. We have different views on sex and you have needs around intimacy I can’t meet, and I’m uncomfortable with the expectation physical intimacy needs to lead to sex or else you’ll be frustrated or unsatisfied. It’s better for both of us to find partners who are on the same page as us with our love languages. We need to figure out (who will move out, when, if you have bills that you share, whatever joint responsibilities you two have) because I think it’s time for us to part ways. I really do care about you, but this dynamic isn’t good for either of us.”

If he begins to beg, just say “I know this is really difficult and it’s difficult for me as well, but it’s clear that after 6 years together, we aren’t right for each other. I don’t want our fear of the unknown to keep us from actually finding a relationship where we can each have our needs met. Both of us deserve that, and my decision is made, I am not open to working on things anymore.”

If he threatens self-harm, “I’m sorry, I know this hurts. If you feel like you need support, I can contact your friends/family and let them know so you don’t have to go through this alone, and if you really do have suicidal ideation, then please speak to a therapist, because I don’t want anything bad to happen to you, but I cannot and will not be your emotional crutch anymore. I am happy to help you out with resources, but I’m not going to entertain any attempts to place the burden of your mental well-being on me. That isn’t fair to do to me.”
I’d probably have been nicer. His wife isn’t listening to him and now his best friend isn’t listening to him. If he has no outlet for these emotions, this is why people sometimes end up cheating that never thought they would. Hear him out. At the end of the day, losing a parent is traumatic but not a reason to give up on your relationship/stop living forever. Six months later is long enough that she needs to start at least acknowledging she needs to be working towards normalcy and intimacy in her marriage. Yes, she’s grieving, but she’s had that period of uninterrupted “she comes first no matter what” already. It’s done and now it’s time for “okay, how do we move forward and find the new normal?” It seems like she isn’t even willing to have that conversation with your friend, despite him being proactive and trying to communicate, which is a serious issue.
Apologies for being harsh, but I find ignoring things just because they aren’t nice to hear is how we end up in situations like yours. You knew he didn’t love you and stayed anyway because you were hoping you were wrong. It’s understandable, but remember the only one you’re hurting is yourself. 

You’re worthy of love, and you seem like a kind and genuine person, you can afford to be a little bit stingy with who you give your heart/body to. Use this as a learning experience for the signs of someone who doesn’t really love you and has poor intentions.
It’s 100% teenagers and other young adults who think they’ve learned how the world works by reading Reddit and fail to realize life outside of a computer operates *very* differently.  Don’t worry, they’ll learn eventually. At least, I hope.
Or more likely, it’s neither, but he’s also afraid to be alone so he can use OP for the emotional support until he finds someone he connects with physically and emotionally and then he leaves her. This is really just monkey-branching with more steps.
Yep. He’s waiting until he finds someone else he connects with more and once he does it’ll be “I’m sorry, it just happened. I didn’t mean for it to but I’m in love with her”.
So, obviously this guy sucks. He saw an easy lay and he took it. He took advantage of you and that isn’t okay. That being said, it’s common for 18 and 23 year olds to make stupid mistakes and engage in shitty behavior like this. It’s also common for one party to ‘mentally break up’ long before they come out and say it, so yeah, I understand what he means by saying he’s moved on already. It sucks. Be proud of yourself for asking the question and leaving once he was honest. It isn’t your fault he didn’t communicate. He’s young, he’s selfish, and it was easier to wait until he was over you and had someone else lined up than deal with being sad and alone. People get better as they get older, but also, plenty don’t. Unfortunately you’ll experience this again most likely. Just know, it’s because they’re emotionally immature, not because you did anything wrong. You were a young, vulnerable kid who fell for the wrong guy. It happens to the best of us. Let it hurt and it’ll be okay in the end.
That is literally thousands of dollars to do, $1500 the cheapest I’ve seen for an hour. He’s fallen on hard times and so that would be crazy stupid to do when his brother has a sports car. Not saying OP needs to agree, but ‘renting’ a sports car is insanely expensive and cost prohibitive.
Out of curiosity, if it’s once a month, is this the same rough time of month in relation to its proximity to your period? Because this may also be due to hormone fluctuations which doesn’t solve your issue, but may also help to 1. Combat it and 2. Open up the conversation better so he understands it’s akin to being extra nice to your gf that has a cold.
I’ll be clear now— be careful of the comments saying your husband is being ridiculous. He isn’t. It’s fair to want to compromise. It is unfair to continue to be mad at him after he immediately understood his mistake, apologized, took responsibility and attempted to find a solution. Let go of the anger/being upset and instead redirect to finding a feasible solution that both of you are happy with. It sounds like you plan to do this in a few days time. Awesome!

As far as your language, no I’m not trying to find any personal flaws in you, it seems you’re misreading things. I am simply pointing out a focus of your current dialogue is how you are feeling, and while I respect the idea you don’t want to speak for your husband, it’s coming off as the opposite, and to just be aware of this if it extends beyond this Reddit post. Remember to let him decide what HE thinks is feasible for himself. He may not be sleep deprived at all. I need 4-6 hours of sleep a night to function at full capacity and my partner needs 9-10. Everyone is different, so make sure to remember you thinking something isn’t feasible doesn’t make it true. The number of times I’ve had people tell me they didn’t think I could do something that I was already doing is immeasurable. 

At this point, I think our conversation has run it’s course, and I don’t want to waste anymore of your time as I think this is getting redundant on both our parts. Good luck and have a lovely rest of the day!
Well, 1. He’s allowed to make a mistake. He didn’t realize he was making a commitment of your time and apologized for that. At the end of the day he is human and you need to learn to let it go. 2. It’s not really your place to decide what is and isn’t a feasible option to him. Plenty of people absolutely work those hours and more, with no issue. 3. If he needs to be making phone calls, sunday also realistically wouldn’t work either, but there’s going to be a significant amount of admin work that DOESNT rely on phone calls. Unless they run a call center, the jobs they’re laying off aren’t 100% spent on the phone. He can take over some of those responsibilities. 4. I’m noticing a pretty heavy trend of “I think” and “I believe”. Remember, you are one half of your marriage and just because you don’t agree with something doesn’t mean you unilaterally get to make that call. 

I never said you took an extreme view, I meant the commenters on here take extreme views, and just remember that sometimes the echo chamber that is the comments section can be misleading to how things will play out in your actual relationship. 

It sounds like you’re open to compromise so hopefully you go into it remembering that your husband gets to decide what is and isn’t feasible for HIM and you get to decide what is and isn’t feasible for YOU. And also remember, people mess up in relationships. I get being upset, but he genuinely apologized and made it clear this was unintentional and wants to take steps to find a solution that works for both of you. Don’t harp on the “I’m upset you did the thing in the first place” and instead focus on “how are we going to find a solution that works better for both of us?” Solution oriented problem solving, which I’m sure an attorney will be beautifully prepared for! So, good luck :)
Yeah, I feel like it matters way less what everyone else thinks is normal and way more about “what does she think is normal?” (Having her ex in her and her family’s life) and “what are you comfortable with?” (Clearly you’re not comfortable with having the ex in your or your gf’s life). 

You are both entitled to your feelings, and someone else on Reddit agreeing or disagreeing, politely, means Jack shit. This isn’t our life. It’s yours and your gf’s life. You guys get to choose how you each want to live your lives. If the way you both pick isn’t compatible, then you two aren’t compatible and should end things. It seems like you aren’t comfortable with a girlfriend who has a relationship with an ex. That’s normal and valid. However, her relationship isn’t so abnormal that it would be fair to expect her to cut him out of her life. At this point the choices are “accept things or leave” but you also can’t FORCE yourself to accept things.
Like I said, there are still other compromises— I.e if he still wants to help, he’ll need to wake up 1-2 hours earlier and do the work then. That way, it’ll have little effect on your schedule/needing a nanny. 

As far as your opinion on the business, that’s fair to consider a long term solution with his parents and have them discuss when enough is enough as a condition of you giving him a bit of time on the weekends, but family isn’t simply boiled down to numbers. Even though to you it makes sense to let them just lose everything now because in your mind it’s an inevitability, that isn’t how your husband feels. It’s unwise to not at least make the attempt to compromise (i.e if he wants to do it, wake up an hour earlier and then he can do an hour or two at some point on Saturday/Sunday. Then, it’s him who is bearing the majority of the burden while you’re also being his life partner and supporting him/allowing him the ability to do what he feels obligated to do. He may be amenable to letting you talk him out of helping now, but that’s because he still thinks things will work out and he’s in ‘new dad mode’. If his parents are in financial ruin and facing homelessness, that could breed a lot of resentment and guilt. And at that point, you’ll no longer have any options for recourse other than hope he gets over it. 

Like I said, people on here will take very extreme views on how you should operate in a marriage and I mean, if that’s how you wanna be, it is your life, but it’s not usually the most conducive to a long term and healthy relationship. Good luck! I know this is a difficult situation to navigate, especially while pregnant.
Well…. Here’s the reality, as much as player’s mental health needs to be taken into consideration, if he isn’t able to perform, and there’s an alternative that CAN perform, he likely doesn’t get to make that choice. SEN upper management clearly wants results, as evidenced by Syyko being cut mid split, and they aren’t making decisions to spare the team’s feelings. This isn’t a field where you keep your job just because you’re well liked if you’re not performing well. It’s really unfortunate, but more than just Tenz’s desire to compete is at play here.

Hopefully the decision is mutual, because the alternative really sucks for TenZ and I’d love to see him thriving again, but is naive to act like him coming back or sitting out is strictly up to him.
Yeah, OP needs to understand this is who her boyfriend is. And, I mean… I guess he is allowed to be that way. He probably doesn’t have “bad” intentions, but he is intentionally trying to keep OP’s hopes low so they don’t get crushed and that’s not the sort of dynamic for most people. 

Dating is an audition process and it’s okay to say he isn’t fulfilling to role’s requirements well enough.
You should really just say, “how do you feel about marriage?” And go from there. Ask her when she wants to get married, if she’s ready to think about that with you. If she is, then say, “I want the actual ask to be a surprise, but I want you to love the ring. Will you go to a few jewelers with me so we can figure out what you like in a budget that will work?”
Out of curiosity, if he’s really that serious about it, why doesn’t he bring the admin work with him to his job and work on admin stuff while he eats his lunch? That’s 5 hours of work right there, and then he can wake up early and do 2 hours before you and baby wake up Sat. And Sun. That means he’s still able to help his family and you’re able to spend time together. 

No offense, but he’s allowed to have 8 hours of time to himself. Maybe not all in one chunk, but he can spread it out. He may need to give up a hobby of his. It isn’t fair of you to say he can’t help out his parents, and while he seems much better than I, I would be really really put off if my partner tried telling me I couldn’t spend a few hours a week helping out my parents to ensure they didn’t lose everything. I love my partner, but I wouldn’t just leave my parents out to dry like that either. There are definitely better compromises out there that you guys need to discuss.

People on here will downvote, but just be aware, they tend to be very extreme in their advice and rarely go for the more realistic and moderate routes that are required if you actually want a marriage to last.
Look, if she learns that trying stuff and ending up in the hospital means you visit her, she’ll keep doing it. If you DONT want her to do it again, you DONT visit her. You don’t call, you don’t respond, you don’t engage. At all. You leave it to her family and her medical professionals to get her the treatment she needs. Otherwise, she’ll just learn that if she hurts herself enough, you’ll come back.
I mean, unfortunately, plenty of women like OP who don’t think that’s a reason to leave so….. they unfortunately aren’t even wrong.
Yep, 130 is also not even considered a genius, it’s considered “gifted” and apparently in this case, it’s gifted in being a jerk.
Not to mention…. A 130 IQ isn’t high enough for Mensa acceptance on either testing scale and genius doesn’t start until like 150 so….. not only are they silly for thinking IQ is a good measure of intelligence, they are also incapable of accurately even googling the requirements for what they claim to be, which inevitably makes me doubt their claims.
The ones acting like he’s a predatory asshole. No, he’s just a regular entitled asshole.
Sure, that’s in 40 years. People are not talking about in the past 40 years. They’re referring to recently. The major demographic of Reddit, and most likely this sub, is significantly younger than “routinely flew 40 years ago to the extent of would know what the size of seats are like”. That source is nice, but largely irrelevant to the actual argument of “in recent years airlines are reducing passenger seat sizes.”
The comment that I was replying to was saying it was just about wanting to touch a woman though, so that’s the only point I was refuting, there’s absolutely no indication that’s what this was about and more just wanting the person who gave him more space sitting next to him.
Sure. But I really don’t think this is some creepy “he wanted to know the touch of a woman” situation.
This sub isn’t about “am I in the clear legally”, literally right in the rules. It’s about the morals of a situation. OP is giving her sister a HUGE financial advantage at any age, let alone a 19 year old single mom of twin infants. The sister needs to know her place and follow the simple rule OP has, or she’ll lose the *privilege* of a free townhouse with enough room for her and her kids, something she’ll quickly find will be virtually impossible for her to maintain otherwise. You make choices in life. It’s called being an adult. If OP really needs to, she can just evict the sister, so the aspect of “technically maybe a tenant” wouldn’t really matter all that long.
Found the person who doesn’t understand sarcasm without the /s
Idk man, three years in and he’s still this bad? You may love him, but he clearly doesnt reciprocate in the same ways. You do you, but weaponized incompetence would make my uterus shrivel up to dust.
It might also just be a natural consequence of “when you have less space you fill less space” much like a liquid only fills the container it’s in. It’s not so much “reigning it in” as much as “you can’t really be in a seat occupied by someone else”.
Eh, you would need to be clinically obese to not physically fit in economy seats. Believe it or not, airplanes cost hundreds of millions of dollars. They aren’t really making seats smaller (possibly certain airlines on replacement aircrafts might be) because most airplanes in commercial use are over a decade old, Americans are just getting bigger.
Don’t make baseless accusations. He wanted to be seated next to the smaller human being who wasn’t saying anything about being in her bubble rather than the equally giant man who physically prevented him from spreading out. It isn’t about gender, it’s about size.
For $35 it’s definitely not real leather, it’s polyester. Check the label to be sure. That being said, it looks awesome, so as long as you think the material and quality of construction is worth the price, the fit is awesome!
Ah, then yeah that’s always a possibility. However, they aren’t really violating the custody agreement. OP is just relying way too much on her ex husband and her ex husband is allowing it. Literally everyone here sucks. The AP for being an AP. The ex for cheating AND for disrespecting his new gf (to the surprise of no one) and OP for using her ex for emotional support and allowing her ex to do the same thing to the new woman as he did to her— namely, have one foot out the door.
I don’t really think OP’s exes current girlfriend can take OP’s ex to court to force him to respect his and OP’s custody arrangement. OP can take him to court. The ex can take OP to court, but the AP can’t do anything legally to make her boyfriend do anything with kids that aren’t hers.
Yeah, but at some point, you also need to remember you’re 33 and mom of the mother of two kids and she’s fueling with a 22 year old. Three years later, she needs to learn to let it go, move on and form her own support network that doesn’t include her cheating ex husband.
You also need couple’s counseling because this soon in, you’re in the honeymoon period and he’s still in “fixer” mode that comes with seeing the woman he’s madly in love with cry and be scared. When that wears off, and it WILL wear off, the disgust and anger will return and those feelings of what you did will resurface. Talk it out now, otherwise I can promise you in the next 5 years, this ends your relationship. People always act like they can forgive such huge breaches of trust and boundaries at first because they’re scared. And then once it fades, it’s never pretty. Dude sounds like he has a really good head on his shoulders, and frankly, you don’t deserve him with how you behaved, and even if you do manage to change, there’s still a chance that the damage will have been done. Take steps to minimize that risk. Good luck. Deal with your insecurities and need for your friends approval. And oh yeah, get better friends.
Ok, yes. Cute, no. But wear whatever feels best.
It could and it would be foolish to think you could actually treat them the same. Good on you for recognizing that not every person can be a parent to any kid.
When you said “doctors don’t hand out prescriptions for epi pens like stickers” and I mean, they obviously don’t literally, but definitely plenty out there will give an epi just in case of escalation. But that generalized statement was obviously based on the personal experience you shared in the next comment.
It’s almost like your personal experience doesn’t actually dictate how every other medical professional handles things
Ofc YTA. Your girlfriend wants her parents to know you aren’t using her/them and you basically refused to even give the *illusion* you aren’t using them. And now, your girlfriend is going to think you ARE using them, so congrats on fucking that one up so badly. 

She said “I want you to offer because I know he won’t accept and if he does accept, I’ll make up for it” and you laughed in her face as you refused. Don’t expect this relationship to last much longer.
Well, if you’re making way more than she does that her income becomes chump change, which is obviously the situation she WANTS to be in. But let’s be real, even the most beautiful of women can’t guarantee they’d find a man wealthy enough to sign up for that deal.
That definitely isn’t actually reasonable advice if she’s trying to work through the issue. At that point, you might as well just break up and find a man who has already had a vasectomy or is fine with getting one.

Believe it or not, real adults who are almost 40 and engaged don’t react well to “well if you’re not going to do as I say then no more sex!”
NTA. She was clearly trying to act like some queen bee in front of her other friends, and all you did was prove her point— she’s a sad little mean girl. The only thing she wasn’t expecting is not everyone wants to be friends with the sad little mean girl just because they’re pretty. Good for you.
Or, he didn’t check it for nuts because he wasn’t the one who ate it? It was on the passenger side and his mom brought the snacks. I personally don’t police what someone else is eating while I’m behind the wheel of a car, do you?
It sounds like his mom gave him a bunch of snacks and then his mother opened one and put the trash on the floor, and the husband hadn’t looked at the snacks. Either that, or that was the only almond one and MIL specifically had that for herself as she didn’t think it would effect OP. Husband cannot know something he hasn’t seen or didn’t eat has nuts in it.
NTA, obviously, but she isn’t going to pay it. You need to decide if you’re willing to go the legal route over this or if you’ll simply go NC over it until she agrees to pay. 

But I will promise you right now, if you don’t do either of those things and just accept her refusal to pay, she will get way worse because now you’ve embarrassed her AND let her get away with it.
Well, do you feel you want to proceed in a marriage knowing this is how he’ll handle conflict of his own making? Ultimately that’s the real question. Like I said, if this isn’t handled to your liking, I wouldn’t get married unless you also are okay with getting divorced, because this is the best your conflict resolution skills will ever be, a few years into marriage too many people forget to put their partner’s feelings into perspective.
Ask him why he lied to you and go from there. Don’t accuse him. Just say, “I found out you’re still going on Labor Day weekend. I’m really hurt you lied to me. Can you help me understand why you felt you needed to lie rather than just talk to me about things?”

If you two can’t talk this through, I personally would probably rethink getting married, unless you’re prepared to get divorced, because no healthy marriage lasts without healthy communication. In a way, this is a great test for if this is even a wedding worth having.
Bruh. You think a bunch of her friends in college should just go “borrow money to go and have fun”? That’s the most irresponsible shit I’ve seen here today.
I’m glad! You two seem to have a lovely marriage. It’s important to make sure the emotional intimacy doesn’t get replaced with fancy shoes or bags. I wish you two many more happy years together! Even though you’ve said things have largely blown over, you should have a discussion on boundaries. “Don’t delete messages” “if you want to offer something to someone who feel deserves it, let me know, we are a team and I want to share that with you” “don’t offer people gifts over $500 without discussing it with me” whatever it may be that you feel comfortable with, but I wouldn’t just dismiss this as “it’s blown over now so it’s all good” because like I said, this is often how it starts. Better to catch things and communicate early than be another heartbreak story. And good luck in all your future opportunities!
Sure, that’s the reason the law was written, but the law states “you don’t need to pay for merchandise sent to you” doesn’t translate to “it only applies if the company is TRYING to bill you for it”. I’m not even really arguing the legality of it, but I am saying that laws are often used in contexts other than the express context it was written for…. In fact that’s pretty much what being a lawyer in certain fields is all about, finding a way to argue why a law applies to you and expanding the interpretation of the penned words.

ETA: damn some of y’all do not understand that laws are in fact open to interpretation and that is why lawyers, judges and other LEO are required, otherwise a computer could just take everything over. Also didn’t make a claim about how this would play out one way or the other, just that this law specifically states “you don’t need to pay for merchandise sent to you that you didn’t order”. I’m not going to reply to anyone who thinks basic reading skills are mental gymnastics.
Well, doesn’t seem speculative, seems accurate. You said you’ve been together since high school, grew up poor, you are used to retail jobs so I presume the businesses you own are driven by him and you support/help him but aren’t the driving force, and you said he has insecurities about his appearance but at least now is a good looking, wealthy dude. 

This is generally speaking how “fairy tale romance ends with him trading me in for a woman half my age” stories begin. It’s easy to get sucked into something new and fresh and that feeling of being flattered by being wanted by someone seemingly unattainable. Now, I’m NOT saying he’s got bad intentions yet, but you probably need to be aware that this is a concern. Like I said, you guys should focus on reconnecting and making sure that your emotional bond is strong, the gifts are nice and all, but outside of material goods, make sure you two are in a good place and keeping the flame alive. Talk to someone about what are healthy boundaries and how you can praise those around you and be generous without crossing a line. Being with the same person for 30 years is HARD and requires a lot of active work to keep that love alive. He seems to love you, so I’m sure you’ll work it out, but I definitely wouldn’t ignore this.
Out of curiosity, is he extremely wealthy? Because… this definitely sounds like “looking for an upgrade” territory. You two probably could benefit from a trip to a couple’s therapist to discuss appropriate boundaries and how you two are feeling about each other in general and given the vibe I’m getting from the post, a romantic trip to reconnect.
Well, technically someone with your correct address on it and not a human beings name on it would qualify. Unless you think “loft on hold” is OP’s next door neighbor’s name
You got the ick. Once you catch it, you only cure it by breaking up and moving on.
It doesn’t typically and it shouldn’t. If you’re unwilling to share the actual life you’ve built with a person during marriage, don’t marry them. It’s fair to want to protect the assets given to you by family and assets you gained before the marriage, but if you are even worried about sharing the assets you’ll gain during the marriage, take that as a glaring sign that this isn’t the woman for you. A marriage is merging lives with someone. That includes finances.
Well, she’s 22 and just had a baby so…. She’s hormonal and emotionally immature. They’re not exactly a great combo, and I’d take a guess and say it wasn’t planned, so she’s also probably extremely confused on what the fuck she wants to do with her life now. If you can, reach out to the aunt. Make sure she has someone in her corner looking out for her. She either is struggling with PPD or she’s just another young and unprepared mom trying to figure things out and handling it poorly, but either way, you probably can’t fix her, so just make sure she has someone around her that is looking out for her.
Honestly fashionova has great jeans for curvy women.
Yikes…. So in your world a father can’t just be a good dad and a daughter’s preferred parent?
A judge wants both parents in a kids life, but I’m sure there is a solution in here where they ARE both in her life, just not in a weekly capacity. It’s pretty standard in these situations to spend the school year with the primary custodian and then breaks and summer with the other parent. The mom can fly up to see the daughter and the daughter can fly once a month. All that combined and that’s a significant amount of time between both parents, while still respecting what the daughter wants and without expecting her to fly by herself every single weekend.
Controversial, but NTA. Your daughter wanted to go with you. She’s 14, her opinion is going to heavily be taken into consideration even in a court. But it should be 1/month for a long weekend (she can afford to miss a day of school) and then she should spend breaks with her mom. She still needs to see her mother and get quality time with her, but you’re right, traveling by plane every week is ridiculous. Perhaps tell your ex she’s welcome to fly up as well to spend time with daughter.
You’re making excuses for him and keep focusing on the ex. The issue isn’t the ex. The issue is him and how he reacted to your hurt. And not for anything, but you’ve seen how he treated his ex who was his supposed love of his life, so why do you think you will end up any differently?

You won’t. That’s the answer. So, stop distracting yourself by focusing on the ex and start reflecting on how he is treating you.
The issue here isn’t actually that he called her the love of his life. The issue is 1. Why is he telling his girlfriend of a year a story of his ex of over a half decade? And 2. He responded to your hurt not with compassion and care but with an insult. 

That’s the issue. You’re not insecure. Any self-respecting person will question why someone YEARS later is speaking in present tense about their feelings for an ex. It’s just plain idiotic to not see how that isn’t a giant red flag. So, short of your boyfriend being an idiot, he’s doing so because he either does have feelings for her (eh, probably not if what you’re saying is true, even though I do doubt the veracity of that. 5 years NC and as SOON as he meets you she’s begging for him back? Eh, not that convinced.) OR he is unable to take accountability for his missteps and refuses to apologize for hurting you, his supposed “love of his life”. That’s the issue here. That’s what you need to be thinking about, your boyfriend called you insecure and ridiculous for having a valid concern that anyone with a brain would have. Frankly, you would be insecure if you DIDNT question him, because it would show you’d put up with such obvious bullshit.
NTA. The reality is, you saved M from staying another 5 years and not having a REAL engagement ring. You either got T to take his head out of his ass long enough to realize he can’t keep putting off this commitment and expecting M to stay, or you HAVENT gotten through to T and now M is realizing that this isn’t what she wants after this long with a man. Either way, you’re NTA and thank you for saying what M was very clearly thinking but was trying to convince herself she was crazy for. If she breaks up with T, it’s because of T, not you, and if anything, you saved M from a lifetime of unhappiness with T. Maybe next time T won’t assume he has unlimited time to string along women he loves. Or he actually proposes, either way, win win for everyone involved.
Idk man, I have to think you enabling him is part of why he’s never changed.
Idk what rich people you know, but every one I know has a substantial life insurance policy.
The more money a person has, the better and greater the insurance they tend to have. I dont know why you’d think someone with money WOULDNT have massive life insurance and other policies. It’s poor people with families who actually NEED the money that often have to forgo the backup plan.
…. Go reread the fourth paragraph of the post. It’s literally right there, in quotes and all.
I’d probably get your head out of your ass and realize material things don’t make someone a good grandparent and who you allow in your children’s life will have a HUGE impact on who they grow up to be. You know your parents aren’t good people, and aren’t good influences for your children. Why would you compromise your values and your kids upbringing just so they can have someone well off in their lives?
I am not. It literally says in the post the friend has said OP will change her mind on not wanting marriage or kids and will often use the exact words “when you’re a mom…” when talking to OP about her own pregnancy. That is NOT the kind of shit you do to your friend who 1. Doesn’t want kids 2. Has always supported you and 3. Is going through a FRESH breakup because of 1. Reread the post if that isn’t at all clear to you, but it is directly in the main post, I’m not making anything up or putting my own spin on anything.

NTA. Just tell the MOH, and anyone else who comes for you, “I have a medical condition. Sister can decide if me being a bridesmaid in an altered dress or me not being a bridesmaid at all will be the best option for her that is available, but I have a medical condition. Unfortunately, what she “wants” in a perfect world is no longer possible in THIS world where I have a medical condition. If sister has decided she’d rather her own family stand beside her than have a perfect photo, I’m still happy to get the dress altered so I can wear it, but those are sister’s only two options. Plans change. What was an option a few months ago no longer is. And that’s just a part of life.”
Generally when speaking your best friend who has done SO MUCH for you talking about her heartbreak and losing someone she cared about because she doesn’t want kids is NOT the time to start bullshit like “when you’re a mom…”. OP doesn’t want kids. She doesn’t need yet another person in her life who refuses to respect the fact that a woman’s worth isn’t solely dependent on their decision to carry a life in them.

Her best friend isn’t respecting her or her decisions about HER life and HER body. Yeah, that’s definitely not harsh, and frankly, I’d have been way harsher.
Eh, you can definitely see cellulite, but everyone has it. No matter how thin or fat I am, I have it. It’s just genetic, and even super models have it, they’re just better at hiding it. Like you said, nothing wrong with it though, since 99% of people have it, and all those “use this ONE trick to destroy cellulite for GOOD!” stuff you see is just a gimmick.
Yes, it does.
So…. You probably don’t want to come to terms with this, but your wife isn’t ‘over’ her ex because she doesn’t feel the same way about you as she did him. She’s with you because you didn’t leave her. Not because she’s head over heels in love with you. If she were head over heels in love with you the same way she was her ex, she’d have forgotten about him. That’s often how we really move on from those heartbreaking losses— we find the next person that makes us feel the same/even better. Sometimes we have relationships in between that we still mourn the ex and we say “oh we aren’t over him, we’re not ready to date anyone else, etc etc” and yeah, in part that is true, but also it’s true that generally you meet that person when you are ready that you’re just CRAZY about and suddenly, those dreams stop. The tears? You barely even remember why you were crying. You remember how much better off you are and how wrong that relationship was. 

But instead of moving on from you like would usually naturally do at 18 and FINDING that person, she clearly struggles with rejection, being alone and wanting to feel wanted so she stayed with you, and you WERE head over heels in love with her, so of course you’d never be the one to leave. She’s been shoving these feelings down for an eternity because she feels guilt over these feelings, but that’s what it comes down to. She just doesn’t feel the way about you as she does about her ex. And if you told her this, she’ll cry and she’ll beg you to stay because she’s never actually progressed beyond that 18 year old girl who can’t deal with rejection or being alone so she’ll cling to whoever is around and willing to give her that love, even if it isn’t actually the love she wants.
Pick anything you want then, you seem to think I’m specifically talking about anti-semitism and fail to understand what an analogy is. So, Pick cheaters. Cheaters don’t actively threaten your safety at all, but plenty of people will choose not to invite someone to their wedding because they cheated on their spouse and morally object to that behavior. That also is “their sex life and shouldn’t be any of your business”. That also “doesn’t have any actual affect on you” but you’d still agree someone is fully in their right to decide they are morally opposed to cheaters and don’t want them around them, right?

Because newsflash, they definitely have that right and newsflash, same thing applies here.
Why is the argument “his sex life has nothing to do with you” a reason he’s not allowed to disagree? Would you say the same if this was a person who cheated on their spouse of 10 years while pregnant and OP was saying “I don’t agree with your morals so I’m not inviting you because I don’t support cheaters”. Because it’s the same exact thing, that pertains to their sex life and doesn’t actually affect OP, but I can guarantee you everyone on here would say OP is NTA for not inviting the brother then. The reality is, people are ALLOWED to choose not to be around people who have different morals than them, even if YOU don’t agree with those morals. And yes, people are ALLOWED (and I would fully argue SHOULD) choose to uphold their values even if they don’t directly affect them. Like, why do you actually want that to be the standard? Because that’s like saying as a white person you’re an asshole for uninviting someone racists against whomever because well, you’re white so it doesn’t even affect you? But, the fuck? Of COURSE you should stand up for your values of not being racist. And in fact, if it WERE race being the issue here, everyone would be saying you NEED to stand up for your morals even if it doesn’t affect you, otherwise you’re being hypocritical. 

You can have different morals and views to OP about sexual freedom and still recognize that OP is allowed to have that view and not want to be around someone who acts like his brother just because they happen to share blood.
I mean, it’s completely fair and valid not to invite someone you don’t agree with their morals and life choices to your wedding. Let’s not act like just because YOU don’t agree with someone’s decision doesn’t mean it isn’t their right to make that decision. That’s like not inviting someone because they are anti-Semitic and you don’t approve of Nazis even though you yourself aren’t Jewish. It has no bearing on you and no impact on your life personally, but you’re still allowed to say “this isn’t behavior or choices I am okay or comfortable being around”. It’s really easy to agree that the people getting married have that right when it’s something you can clearly agree is wrong, isn’t it? But that’s the thing, *Everyone* has the right to make that choice, and yes, even people with views you don’t agree with. 

That being said, it’s definitely important to recognize that he won’t have a relationship with his brother, and much like OP can post about this on the internet, so can his brother, especially when he SENT A FREAKING LETTER!! and OP needs to accept that. However, for anyone saying “he’ll lose his brother with this behavior”, honestly, do you actually think he cares? It sounds like he’s pretty emphatically throwing the brother out, so I don’t think that statement is likely to affect OP at all.
He’s either asexual/on the asexual spectrum or he’s not attracted to you. Either way, no, I don’t think he comes around. If sexual compatibility is a dealbreaker for you, you should end the relationship sooner rather than later, because lying to yourself is only going to hurt you in the long run.
Well, fuck that guy then, he’s guy a boring old misogynistic hypocrite.
Where is that? I didn’t see that anywhere in the post/comments. If I missed it, and this isn’t a standard he’s also holding himself to, then fuck that guy. Regardless, end result is the same, he isn’t the person for OP.
Yeah, there is pretty much no part of a heathy, happy and functional relationship here. There’s no intimacy, no respect no trust and sounds like your feelings for him are very quickly waning. You can’t really tell me this is what you imagined in your husband, is it? If not, respect and love yourself in a way he is never going to and find that relationship.
I mean…. You can’t really trust a man who isn’t worth trusting unless you’re going to brow beat yourself into accepting being treated like trash….. is that really what you want to do to yourself? Because he isn’t worthy of being trusted. That’s why you don’t trust him.
I think you need some harsh truths. 

Yes, you need to give her space. If you refuse to give her the space she’s asking for, her feelings are going to very quickly succumb to the resentment that will quickly build. But in giving her that space? Most likely she’s going to feel relief. She’s going to feel the weight that is being in a relationship with a man like you lifted. And then, your relationship will truly be over. 

It’s hard, but I think you need to learn this. Being “grumpy” isn’t some cute personality quirk. It’s fucking annoying and not something anyone self-respecting wants in a life partner. No one wants to be with a man who acts like they don’t even *like* their partner. And I’ve been there, it sucks. And yeah, most likely her feelings for you are pretty done and dusted. Women try and try and try and once they get to the point where they’re telling you “they’re falling out of love and need space” 99% of the time, they ARE out of love with you already but just can’t admit it to you or themselves yet. You may need to genuinely feel this loss to understand that you don’t get to just suck for three years and THEN finally decide to see a problem with how you’re acting. You shouldn’t be putting loved ones through your tantrums. You’re 27. It’s time you grow up and learn to be a kind, respectful, patient person. And yes, that likely will mean doing it single for a long while and getting a therapist to work through things with you to make sure you don’t prematurely jump back into dating and someone who can hold you accountable to yourself.
Depends. How exactly did this come up? It’s been three years together. Did you ask some hypothetical or did he out of the blue just tell you he’s never going to let you see his phone? Because if this came up naturally in conversation, it probably means nothing and I’d just respect his feelings. If this came up unprompted out of nowhere, I’d be getting highly suspicious.
It sounds like he’s a virgin. He’s allowed to want to share that experience with his partner. However, if it’s a dealbreaker for him, and he’s said it is, then you need to walk away. You aren’t what he wants and it’s totally wrong of him to shame you for not being his perfect made to order bride. He’s a coward for not telling you this himself, but you need to move on. The right person will come along, who won’t care about your extremely limited past. But the reality is, this person DOES care and that’s okay, but it isn’t okay to stay with someone who doesn’t accept you as you are.
I mean, there are plenty of 25 year old virgins in religious circles, and even more still who just haven’t found that person or are waiting for personal reasons. I don’t think it’s really fair to say “he won’t find a Virgin” if that’s something important to him (it sounds like he himself is a virgin as well). However, he needs to recognize if he wants a Virgin and that’s an actual dealbreaker that he needs to share that ‘one and only’ experience with his partner, he needs to STOP dating someone who he clearly can’t have that with. It’s completely wrong to shame someone for not being who you want over something they can’t control. 

It’s like saying dating someone who is under 6’ tall is a dealbreaker and then continuing to go out with someone who is 5’6”. They aren’t going to grow and if that’s what you want in a partner, okay, that’s fine, but then don’t waste someone’s time who is clearly also looking for a serious partner.
You and your husband should go to counseling and you personally need some help to accept that your ILs will never accept you and will never like you. I get it’s hard, but you need to make peace with this fact so you can move forward. Your husband will also need to come to terms with how that will affect his family dynamic so he can make sure he’s okay with that (it very much sounds like he is). But you need to stop. They aren’t going to like you. It is what it is. It hurts, absolutely, but you need to get the idea of “if only I did XYZ they might finally like me!” They won’t. Unless you’re able to suddenly turn into a good Korean housewife, they’ll never like you. That’s okay. Your husband married you, not them, but you aren’t doing yourself or your marriage any favors by trying to get people who simply never will like you, to like you. Drop the rope. Live your life. Be happy. Stand up for yourself. Stop accepting hatred in your life.
Idk, the party was a lie, so sounds like the alcohol was merely a cover/in order to soothe the nerves she had about cheating.
You remind your brother her behavior isn’t normal, it isn’t healthy, and while you support him and will always be there for him, you aren’t going to enable toxic behavior from her and just remind him that you’re there for him if he realizes this isn’t what he wants in a relationship anymore.
Just remember, it may be his choice to put up with controlling, borderline abusive behavior in silence, but that doesn’t mean he gets to choose for you how you’ll react. It’s pretty clear he knows this is ridiculous and probably is putting up with it either because of the idea women can do no wrong/can’t control/abuse a man or because he thinks he can’t do better than this woman. Either way, it’s not your job to keep the peace in someone else’s toxic relationship.
Don’t feel badly that it affecting your finances was the final straw. Be so proud of yourself for even having that straw, because you know deep down you should’ve had a final straw LONG ago, and just be proud you’ve finally found it. And then stick to it. Because you’re right. He’s abusive and plain and simply NOT worth it.
It can both be true that he needs help and you can’t provide him the help he needs. You need to put yourself first, because he clearly always has and always will put himself first. You cannot thrive in this marriage. This marriage is literally killing you slowly. Pick you. You deserve it.
Perfect. Then I think you should send this or a similarly worded message to gracefully bow out while also directly saying “I understand you felt obligated to ask me and I am not comfortable with that, so I will be the fall guy” rather than going to route of making up a conflict. It’s to the point but it doesn’t make her feel like the bad guy as you’re saying YOU don’t feel comfortable being in such an intimate place with someone who clearly that intimacy isn’t there yet and that’s okay.
A year isn’t long at all, so I wouldn’t use “she’s never shown any behavior like this before!” As justification or an excuse. It’s super easy not to show your true colors for a year. You’re an older, established guy who owns a 3 story house dating a younger woman. I’m not calling you out on anything, but you really can’t expect much more from her, and you would be VERY foolish to continue dating someone who has shown you the ugly truth of herself the minute things didn’t go her way. 

And let me guess, you wouldn’t have her pay much if any rent, right? (You’re being taken for a ride).
Tbf, if he wasn’t a deadbeat dad, this would be completely normal dynamic for a kid and his father. You’re really telling me you never did anything with your parents and a friend or even with any of your friends growing up? Because I definitely did. The issue is still the fact that the father never sees his son, making it so the few times he DOES step up “precious father son time” but it shouldn’t be. It should just be another weekend together but this time his son wants to bring a friend.
Yeah, when your self esteem is this low, you’re going to sabotage any genuine attempts to lose weight as well because you feel you don’t deserve to look and feel good either. So you really need to deal with the self esteem before you can even lose the weight and keep it off.
Explain to me why you’d want a cheater and a hypocritical deadbeat dad as friends anyway? You are the company you keep OP, and neither of these people are winners. Tell Adam, and if that ruins the friendships with everyone, then good riddance.
The brother dropped out of high school and refused to get a job. Presumably, it’s because he thought now that he was 18, he could do what he wanted and what he wanted to do was nothing. While I don’t agree with his parents giving him 3 days (bare minimum of 30 days like you would a tenant seems like the bare minimum here), I do think it’s fair for his parents to have the attitude of “if you think because you’re 18 you can make the adult decision to drop out of high school and not listen to anything we have to say, then you can also live like an adult and be on your own”. While uncommon, it does happen and it happened to my sibling before where they expected to just stay at home all day doing nothing because they’re an adult and also having mommy and daddy do everything for them still. Not every parent will enable that behavior even a little.
Talk to your husband first and make sure he has your back. Once you know that he is on your side, just send a text message, “SIL, while I’m honored that you would’ve thought to include me in your special day, I don’t feel comfortable being included in such an intimate part of your day simply because I’m your brother’s wife. I would love to be there as your guest, but I need to step down as bridesmaid. If there’s anything I can do from afar, please let me know, as I want this day to be very special for you.”

If stepping down is going to start WW3 with your husband and his family, it’s probably better to just tell her you’re busy/can’t make it to any smaller events and just suck it up for the wedding day. This isn’t really that unusual of a situation and as uncomfy as it is, if this isn’t your hill to die on and your husband/his family won’t be supportive, it’s probably not worth it to make this your hill to die on.
Not to doubt your relationship seeing as you’re already pregnant, but next time, you should BOTH wait a decent period of time before introducing your partners to your kid. You need to make sure you guys know and are comfortable with who your new partners are and after 7 and 8 months, it really doesn’t seem like enough time has passed for either of them to be taking on any sort of parental role or going on trips or things like that. Moving on takes time. Rushing it can lead to some really crappy outcomes. It’s harder when you have a kid, but her well being and safety needs to come before either of your desires to have a new happy family.
Let yourself be sad. Cry if you need to. Do something to get your mind off her, even if that means having less ‘work’ time, it’ll be better to have 18 hours of good work time than 40 hours of horrible work time. So make sure to take care of yourself one night too. You can’t just shove the feelings down and expect to move on overnight. You will make it through the course. I know it feels like the end of the world if you don’t do great on one assignment, but I can tell you I have had my fair share of crappy weeks and I survived multiple top technical programs in the world. It won’t affect anything in your life in the grand scheme of things even if you need to take a few days to take care of yourself before sitting down to work on your final projects. Do your best. You will make it through.
The only unreasonable bit is you trying to force yourself to be okay in a marriage where your partner doesn’t pull his own weight AND can’t be arsed to spend time with you. You deserve and can get way better.
His poor wife holy shit.  


Look, here’s the reality. He’s built up an idea of who you will be as his partner in his head, and that idea is likely very different from who you actually are. This man is successful and going to divorce his wife for you, only to discover the real you isn’t actually as “good” as he imagined in his head. I’m sure you’re lovely, but you’re real and human. You two both clearly know from experience that marriages and real life are hard and even though you go into things loving a person, that doesn’t mean it’ll work out. And now that he has all these unrealistic ideas of what being with you is like, and he realizes that’s not the case, it’ll end ugly.
Your boyfriend is blaming OCD on what is him being an abusive asshole. You can’t “turn it off” on command. If you could, OCD wouldn’t be a disorder. Perhaps he genuinely has OCD, but the actual behaviors caused by his OCD would still remain. Everything that he “turned off” in the past week is who he is. It isn’t a disorder. That’s an excuse. Flat out and plainly, it was bullshit meant to get you to accept poor treatment from him. 

He lied to you. He is abusive. He doesn’t trust you. He is both unwilling and unable to change. I understand it’s scary to be without someone you’ve spent so long with and have shared so much with, but 3 years is nothing in the grand scheme of forever. You will meet someone you will be with much longer than him. And instead of having a pervasive theme of lies abuse and fear, you’ll *feel happiness*. And you’ll wonder why the hell you stayed with such a crappy partner for so long and why you put up with such obvious bullshit for so long, when you could’ve had “this” (a happy and loving relationship) all this time. 

This is the end of a chapter. It’s okay to grieve. But put down the horror story and pick up a romance novel with someone else, or hell, even just yourself.
You misread the story. The last time the kids looked at the box was 6 years ago. The half brother has asked to look at the box, but this isn’t a situation where the kids are constantly stealing this box. He just Carrie’s it everywhere and a 5 year old is naturally curious. The insider information I have is being even somewhat familiar with how a 15 year old boy acts towards siblings. They aren’t exactly nice. Siblings are viscous to each other at times. Then add in “lost mom” and “blended family” it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see this is a normal teenage boy acting out. But that doesn’t mean that it’s not OP and his father’s job to teach him that you need to learn patience and cruelly lashing out isn’t okay.
You need to stop being so forgiving. You’re being a pushover. Your wife is turning into the equivalent of a red-pilled tater tot, as the internet likes to call them. For the sake of your children and society at large, you NEED to start pushing back on this WAY harder than you are. You’re operating as though what she is doing isn’t tantamount to racism or homophobia. I take it you wouldn’t tolerate that attitude, so why are you tolerating an attitude that is propagating hatred against men when you’re raising two little boys?

Stop giving her a pass on her hatred, prejudice and bigotry just because she’s a woman. That in and of itself is sexist. Hold her to the same standard you would hold a man who told his wife that she needs to take care of all chores, childrearing, be a sex slave who never says no to any sex act and never speaks unless spoken to. Hold her to the same standard you would if a *man* dared to in public try to humiliate and shame his wife who is doing everything like she did to you. 

I get that you think you’re being “pro-women” but you don’t be “pro-women” by being “anti-man”. This isn’t behavior you should be tolerating because you’re afraid to be coming off as controlling/sexist/whatever it is that you’re clearly afraid of seeming, because this behavior is truly abhorrent and I can’t imagine a man as progressive as you are genuinely believing this attitude should be okay for ANYONE of ANY GENDER.
Sit him down and tell him, “you’ve been going too far with the criticism lately. I’m not okay with it. From now on, you either need to learn to keep your opinions of how you want things done to yourself, or you need to be prepared to do it your way by yourself. The next time something like what happened last night at dinner happens again, I am stopping what I’m doing, regardless of where I am in the process and you will be fully taking over. I will not be putting things away. I will not be cleaning up anything. I need you to understand loud and clear just how serious I am about this NOT continuing. If there’s something that bothers you so deeply that you want to just take over from now on, now is the chance to tell me. Are we on the same page?”

If he gets at all angry, walk away and say, “this is what I mean. I’m leaving the conversation until you can continue this like an adult in a healthy relationship. If you can’t figure out how to have a conversation without belittling me, then this relationship isn’t going to work out. Find me once you’ve decided.” And leave. Go read a book. Go for a walk, take a bath, whatever it is that you want, but show him that you mean business because right now, he plain and simply doesn’t respect you. You need to demand respect and make it clear that if he doesn’t start respecting you, you ARE prepared to walk away.
Out of curiosity, if your husband is the one who is all “don’t disagree with anyone” unhealthy bottle stuff in crap… have you ever tried telling him not to speak to you that way? I mean, that’s his preferred method of communication after all… unless there’s some hidden hierarchy you’re not addressing where “as the man of the household you’re meant to follow him” vibes going on?
Of course women are allowed to speak? It’s not about her gender at all. Try not to make things that aren’t about gender about gender. It’s about “the person who DID bring it up did so with no intention to actually change the relationship at all”. She basically dangled a relationship carrot in front of OP who was eagerly awaiting the moment they would become official (which idk why he didn’t bring it up himself since he clearly wanted it), only for her to say “aaaactually, I’m still fucking and plan to continue to fuck other dudes”. 

You really gunna tell me that isn’t humiliating? Unless she’s denser than a bag of rocks, she knows damn well what “soooooo, what are we?” On a romantic dinner out implies. It is meant to progress the relationship forward, not to literally say, “hey, I just want to make sure you’re clear that this isn’t going anywhere and I also won’t stop seeing other people”. She raised up OP’s hopes, waited to make sure that he was happy about the offer of something more, only to assure him that wasn’t at all what she wanted or planned to do. That’s about as humiliating as it gets in terms of rejection in a situationship.
Wait until it actually is truth before you’re patting yourself on the back there, bud. One bad map does not months of mediocre tape make. Sure, if he is consistently on the bottom of the leaderboard you may have a point, but you also have no way of knowing yet if he won’t drop 30 every map next week.
It’s an unhealthy behavior to develop of staying in a relationship only because you or he loves the other. Love isn’t enough, and you should always base your decision on whether to continue a relationship based on how your partner is treating you in the moment. Not in the past, and not how you want him to treat you in the future.  You’ll save yourself from a LOT of toxic and crappy relationships if you remember those two rules.
Unfortunately, if Rachel thought finding a man with a family to provide for her kids was so important to her, she should not have married your father. She needs to either accept the (incredibly sad and I entirely sympathize with her and her kids) reality that they just don’t have any family outside of their parents/half siblings or she needs to divorce your father and go find a man who has family who will accept non-bio kids with open arms. It sucks, but this is the family she chose to marry into and you’re under no obligation to cater to her wishes. This is just like someone complaining about their crazy in-laws and trying to get them to change/cut them out of their lives. Adults need to realize you don’t just marry the man, you’re marrying the family. If you aren’t happy enough with the TOTAL PACKAGE as it is, you don’t proceed with the marriage, just like you don’t marry a man for their potential, you marry them for who they are.

And let this be a life lesson for you too, you’re marrying a man, but also you’re marrying into a family, and you need to consider those dynamics when evaluating if this is a something you will be happy in forever.
Definitely remain NC. The fact that SHE brought it up even knowing she didn’t want exclusivity is pretty humiliating.  That being said, don’t wait for the woman to bring it up next time, when you’re ready, you should be bringing it up. I can only assume it’s insecurity/fear and that’s also probably not an attractive trait. 

If it were me, even if I DID want a serious relationship, I would quickly lose interest/recalibrate my feelings if after 5 months this conversation wasn’t brought up, just an FYI.
Not in this day and age.
I’m going to be honest, it’s decently fucked up she would bring up the “what are we talk” while actually NOT wanting anything to change about your relationship and in fact NOT wanting exclusivity. It almost feels as though she knew you thought you two were heading towards exclusivity and felt extremely guilty about seeing and sleeping with other people and was attempting to clear her conscience. Take this as a sign she isn’t ready or worth another serious thought and cut your losses. Definitely remain NC because it’s very clear she doesn’t want a relationship and the fact that she would so callously mess with your feelings by asking you “what are we?” While fully knowing she didn’t want you to BE anything, is just not worth any more time.
Yeah, definitely don’t invest your time money and effort into a woman who’s shown you she’s only looking for someone to provide for her and benefit her. She wants a one sided relationship and that can’t last forever. Once things get hard, the relationship will fall apart, and if you marry her while being an executive, she may show you just how self-centered she really is and take you for all you’re worth. It’s a really common story.
I don’t think it’s unfair, I think both (50/50 and proportional) are valid payment schemes, but you do need to decide what works best for you/your values and *stick to it*. If she was always down for 50/50 then I’d say that’s just as fair even though she’s getting more free money now. But, it’s pretty clear her values aren’t “we are equal partners—50/50” or “we should each be contributing equal parts relative to our skills— proportional to income”. Her values are quite simply “I expect the man to take care of me”. Which, is also a fair enough desire, but OP needs to understand her partner’s values and decide if that’s the role he wants to fill, not every man does, and that’s okay.
I honestly do think they both cheated, emotional affairs ARE affairs, and he said he accused her of one during their marriage, and then they’re married within a year of the divorce… that definitely screams emotional affair.

He cheated as well, so at that point it’s clear you two both moved on from one another, but I’m not sure how anyone can see the facts and the timeline and NOT think that there were mutual feelings involved long before the divorce was signed. Otherwise, you just don’t get married within a year to your ex husband’s best friend.
If she can’t afford to move out, then you assess how insane you think she’ll be in the breakup. If she’ll be mature, you ride it out, maybe one of you sleeps on the couch. If you think she’ll handle it poorly, you get a new apartment and you ride it out for the 6 months left on your lease, or whatever it is, and a few weeks before move in, you tell her. That’s pretty much your only option. She clearly did SOMETHING before you two lived together, so she can figure someone out after too. 

Moving forward, don’t move in with people you’ve known less time than some of the food in your fridge.
Some people think it makes themselves sound bad ass rather than weak. She obviously isn’t 100% sure if Steve really did have feelings for Daisy or not, so I take it as the human equivalent of puffing yourself up in the face of danger so hopefully the predator will run away.
People on Reddit like to encourage others to do what will entertain strangers the most, but this is your actual life you are living. Don’t blow something up with someone you love because a bunch of strangers on the internet have nothing better to do than encourage more people to be miserable with them.
Thanks fam. Guess I’m the ass, carry on 😂
Did you…. Mean to reply to this comment? Because it makes no sense and makes you sound like a pompous ass in context.
He would be correct if you decide to stay. Love yourself more than that!
Here’s what you reply to every single person, “if standing up against the disrespect of the relationship with the woman I plan to spend my life with is something small to you that you think I should get over, then god bless your marriage because no relationship will ever last with that attitude. I will protect my relationship and back up the woman I love before I will anyone else.”
You seem to be making excuses for her. This is a thing people do to defend themselves. No one wants to admit “they weren’t enough” for their partner. No one wants to admit they had a bad judge of character when they committed to someone. But look, it’s okay to make mistakes. Good people fall for bad ones all the time, but your fiancé has shown you a lot of flaws. 1. She won’t communicate with you when she’s feeling down and has unaddressed needs in the relationship. 2. She won’t turn down the attention of another guy in at least some circumstances. 3. Your fiancé is of so low class to get with a married man. 4. Your fiancé doesn’t respect you enough to come clean before you gave up a lucrative career and your future for her. She should’ve told you then so you could make an informed decision. She’s trying to trap you. 5. Your fiancé didn’t even tell you because she finally realize just how fucked up this is, she only told you because someone else made her feel guilty about it. 6. You’re with a woman so good at lying to you she can carry on a whole other relationship for months and you’ll be none the wiser, and lie to your face for YEARS and you’ll be none the wiser. 


Now all this REALLY taken into consideration, are you going to tell me you can lay next to this woman every day for the rest of your life and feel peace? If not, it’s time to call off the wedding.
Have you ever met a 15 year old boy with any form of siblings? They can be viscous. It’s almost like Redditors don’t understand what teenagers are like form an objective perspective— siblings say crap like this all the time without any trauma.
I don’t think they ARE asking him. He’s just saying it, the daughters told OP that he said it out of nowhere, and according to OP the one step sister who showed interest was told 6 years ago to knock it off. It genuinely reads like the 15 year old is going through normal 15 year old growing pains combined with grieving his mom and being in a mixed family and just lashing out and those around him and saying something he knows will hurt, but I don’t actually see anywhere where anyone is even remotely provoking him, unless you’re going to count *the five year old* asking to take a look and at that point, it’s time for both parents to step in and address the fact that he needs to have some patience for a five year old.

This is somewhat normal for teenagers, even without all the stressors in his life, siblings can say some awful stuff to each other, but that’s when it’s time for the parents to step in as the adults and guide their growing humans in the right direction.
Girl…… why are you trying so hard to lie to yourself? He’s already doing a good enough job for you, you can’t BOTH disrespect yourself this much.
Nothing he said is really wrong though…. You come into a good amount of money, the smart move is pay off any interest accruing debt and invest in something else to grow your money.
No one has tried to get their hands on it. The step siblings haven’t tried touching it since OP was married, six years ago, and his half brother Alec is a 5 year old, and asked to take a *look*. Believe it or not but a 15 year old does need to learn some patience for his 5 year old brother. It’s bad parenting to act like his attitude is at all acceptable.
Depends, is your long term goal to be in a place where you two can be friends, or is your long term goal to both be in a place to fully move on with your lives without one another in it? If this was taken as the end, no, I wouldn’t. If the goal was to get space to get over the relationship so you two could maintain a friendship indefinitely, something as simple as, “No need to reply but I hope you have a nice birthday!” Would probably be fine. More likely than not though, one or both of you wanted this to simply be the end.
I don’t think this is actually meant to convey the idea of what he would do in an emergency, it’s meant to bluntly and hurtfully convey the idea that his step/half siblings mean nothing to him, and he’s doing so by conveying that even a lifeless (though important) object means more to him than them. And that sort of needless cruelty from a 15 year old, repeatedly, to a 5, 9 and 11 year old is definitely the sort of thing you CAN and SHOULD step in to address.
If you are afraid of there being a time limit, it’s pointless to even give it one last try. He’s essentially telling you, “we need to figure this out, because I’m at the end of my rope and I don’t want to leave, but I will have to”. If you can’t get it together, quickly, call it now. This probably is hurting him a lot, guys are also capable of leaving someone they love that it isn’t working with. Just because he’s told you this doesn’t mean he’s manipulating you, it means he’s trying to get you to care that you’ll lose him. 

Unfortunately, at this point, unless there’s a miracle involved, you two are unlikely going to be able to just stop and fix things. But it is possible if you’re both willing to try and put in the work.
Also a reminder it isn’t all or nothing. He can say, “I can’t pay for everything, but I want to help you out, I can pay $5-10k/year towards your tuition, which I will pay directly to the school” or whatever amount he decides depending on what tuition is like in his country. If she freaks out, he knows she’s just looking for a free ride. If she’s grateful, then maybe they can have at least some semblance of a relationship.
You’ll get nowhere if you don’t accept the fact that your husband isn’t loyal, doesn’t prioritize you and would frankly rather be with someone else. I get denial is strong, but the only person who suffers from your stubbornness is you, not him. He gets two women fighting for him, someone to put his bills, keep his home, still have plenty of sex and feel no guilt because at this point, you are well aware of who he is and are choosing to stay, that’s essentially you saying “I’m okay with this” in his mind.
You’re definitely giving him way too much credit. He needs to say the words “(assistant), you’re crossing professional boundaries right now. You need to stop behaving like this, it’s unprofessional and not okay.” The fact that he’s never shut her down is a problem, and it isn’t remedied by you simply being sure he won’t cheat on you. He needs to be ready willing and able to actually tell this woman her behavior is entirely unprofessional and whatever her feelings for him are or are not, she needs to learn what it means to be someone’s assistance in a place of work.
It would be an incredible overreaction if this were the first time an issue with money has come up, but it isn’t. They’ve been clashing about their views on money ever since, and perhaps even before, they pooled their money. This isn’t just one example of spending money without discussing it, it’s a pattern of disregarding OP’s wishes, failing to communicate, stonewalling, and mismanaging money. The problem is people are human. We aren’t endless wells of patience that never run out. After months/potentially years of trying to get his gf on board with discussing finances and having a plan and her NEVER taking his concerns seriously or even hearing him out, he’s used up all of his patience on maintaining the status quo that it’s all gone for anything beyond that. And while it can definitely be fixed, it’s hard and it takes both people realizing they’re BOTH going about things the wrong way and seriously changes all around will be needed to fix the gap and resentment that’s formed.
All of those concern two babies born to the same generation though, this isn’t stealing a baby name, this is simply using a name. And if you really wanted to use the analogy, the “baby name” in this case is hope and the SIL would be the one “stealing” it by trying to make it so OP can’t use it.
I think they’re acting as though it’s so distant because OP said she and her brother have a strained relationship, so it isn’t like they’re meeting up for weekly family dinners where they’ll realistically always be getting confused. It’s more like having to worry about it during thanksgiving/Christmas and even then, that’s probably not every year if they celebrate with OP’s family as well, so it amounts to the same level of ‘inconvenience’ as you’d have if you shared a name with a distant cousin.
The point is OP would only be changing the name to appease SIL, but if ever her and her partner break up/divorce, she’d have changed her daughter’s name for someone who was no longer her concern, so her priority should be honoring HER family rather than respecting SIL.
I’m not moving any goal post. Everyone else is, and they’re moving it down. The bare minimum for ‘not in poverty’ is being able to afford a roof over your head and food on the table. Bare minimum for middle class is being able to provide ‘enough of a roof over your head’ and ‘good food’ and the occasional take out and maybe saving for a vacation. Bare minimum for upper middle class is being able to afford a nice car, a nice home, and having savings for retirement/education/rainy day. Bare minimum for “rich” is having an excess of wealth that can freely be spent on luxury goods and not having to worry about the costs of any education. Things like luxury cars, private/exclusive vacations, mansion/McMansions, having the closet of designer clothes, newest devices, buying your kids houses etc. are common place and not a concern for those who are rich. And yes, the dollar sign it takes to be “rich” has drastically increased, but no, the goal post for what being rich “means” hasn’t.
She said it’ll affect the relationship with her brother, not the kid. They already don’t have a good relationship though, so idk why she thinks they’d prioritize an already crappy relationship over that of the mother of the baby getting to honor her great grandmother. 

Realistically speaking, regardless of the name, she wasn’t going to be very present in the baby’s life anyway, as as it stands she’s barely in her brother’s life. Most people don’t suddenly invest into the lives of a kid to a person they barely talk to. She thinks that statement bears any weight, but frankly, it makes her argument worse, not better, as it just illustrates how little they lose by ignoring her wishes and how much they gain.
2 years older, she’s 22 and dying of stage 4 cancer. I get it’s “an adult” but i stand by my point.
Yeah. The price of kids and a good education in the US is no joke. And if you’re making that much money, you really aren’t getting much if any help for the costs. I had scholarships and it still ended up being that much. I’m in a great place in life, don’t get me wrong, but it takes a lot of money to raise kids in an “ideal” fashion. People can of course make it work with way less, but anyone who grew up poor can attest it’s better to grow up with more than less.
Well, the way I see it, “rich” should be a higher standard of living than what everyone should be capable of. Not having to live paycheck to paycheck, affording retirement, vacations and at least somewhat of a college fund are all things I think everyone should be able to comfortably achieve. You’d need to go significantly above and beyond that basic standard of living to me to be considered “rich” which I see specifically as an EXCESS of wealth, not just “enough”.
She’s practically a child dying of stage 4 cancer. To some extent, you can’t expect her to be rolling in money for a wedding.
You’re aware your dad is effectively trying to replace you with his daughters and to pretend like those are the kids he had with his late wife, right? I don’t mean to put a damper here, but that would really make me rethink having any form of close relationship with him.
Someone that insecure doesn’t accept that answer. They keep pressing until they get *something* to fixate on.
Yes it’s a relative term. But it’s one that implies luxury. It isn’t actually a luxury to have a comfortable life. I understand societal factors make it so that IS something most for without, but it shouldn’t be. The standard is “able to live a comfortable life”. The problem is so few of us are able to, but the standard for what we should be able to achieve didn’t suddenly decline just because it got harder to achieve.

I know what it’s like not to have those savings, but that still doesn’t change the fact that being able to comfortably achieve a bare minimum doesn’t mean you’re rich. It means you’re middle-upper middle class depending on if maybe there are some luxuries or if everything is fairly average.
That they are. People are severely underestimating just how much more money it takes to go from “nice life” to “amazing life” when you also have multiple kids and even intend to pay for half of their education, if grad school might be on the table. Mine was in the mid-high 6 figures all said and done and that was just me.
So middle class is defined as up to the top 83% of earners. If we said upper middle class is the next 10% of earners (supported by 14% of people reporting they are upper middle class), that would be just over $300k of income being up to ‘upper middle class’. Middle class and upper middle class are not the same, and upper middle class is beyond the middle class. It allows for things like retiring early, paying part of your kids education, and nice day to day lives, but it is hardly “rich”. It’s just that unfortunately so many people do without what should be way easier to attain.
Upper middle class is a shockingly uncommon level of wealth, yes, and that’s because of how much you need to earn to achieve it. You’re supporting my point— 300k with multiple kids and a plan to retire early puts you in the upper middle class, not rich.

And for reference, I am referring to actual upstate New York, as in close to the Canadian border, for anonymity. I’m not referring to Westchester, or any area nearby. Like I said, you’d be surprised.
No, middle class isn’t defined on what you earn, it’s defined on your lifestyle. That’s why more people live in poverty than the bottom (let’s just say) 10% of income earners. It works both ways. Unfortunately, there are more people in the lower bracket than the higher, but that is exactly why people say “the middle class has largely been eliminated”. If it WERE just by your earnings, definitionally, there would ALWAYS be a middle class that never grows nor shrinks, but it’s clear most people agree that that’s not the case. It’s just the unfortunately what it takes to actually be middle-middle-class in this country is insane now, but the two while related are different.
Not at all, but being comfortable and not having to worry about your bills and being able to enjoy life DOESNT mean you’re rich, it means you’re middle- upper middle class. Just because the middle class has larger lot been wiped out due to a lot of societal factors people are discussing doesn’t change the fact that that IS middle class. It just feels like it shouldn’t because that’s now the top 5-10% of the country, but just like you wouldn’t call someone who lives paycheck to paycheck and can’t afford a big enough house for their kids or save for retirement ‘solidly middle-middle upper class’ just because they’re in the 50% of American incomes, you wouldn’t call someone living what is a ‘upper middle class lifestyle’ “rich” just because of the percentile of income. They’re two different concepts people are misunderstanding. 

Poverty/low/middle/upper/rich has to do with lifestyle, not percentile. And that’s why way more people live in poverty than those in the bottom 10% of income earners in the US. It works both ways.
Yeah, i think a lot of people here are considering rich to be “doesn’t need to worry about money for the minimums”, but it definitely is way more than that. I’d describe “can afford a nice home, nice cars, fill the retirement funds, college funds, vacation funds and savings” as upper middle class at best. Rich is “tons of luxury goods, the $1 million dollar closet, vacations that cost tens of thousands of dollars and you don’t even need to really save for it, way more than just a nice life”.
Everyone I knew who made 250k-450k even in upstate NY was still upper middle class. Money doesn’t go as far as you think when it comes to being “rich”. In order to be rich that’s more than “has a nice house, nice car and can pay for their kids school and vacations every year”. Which after taxes, that’s around the lifestyle we’re talking about in most places except the rural. That’s ~150k in disposable income after taxes and then you’d need to pay your mortgage, your cars, retirement, health insurance (which can be well over $10k/pp a year), put away money for multiple kid’s college, pay for their necessities, food, etc. it definitely adds up. And once all that is said and done? You’re definitely comfortable, but you’re definitely not “rich”. Rich is way less than the top 1% in the US. I know that it’s hard for most to understand because they would feel ‘rich’ with that much money, but that’s right up until you have that much and realize how money doesn’t really go that far when you’re talking about living a luxurious lifestyle, which is definitely a necessity if we’re talking about considering someone rich.
Rich is more than just can comfortably pay bills and afford vacations.
True, but you’re also making the assumption that just because people survive on less means this is enough to make someone “rich”. 300k still makes them upper middle class when you factor in savings, the cost of kids, taxes, college funds, retirement funds. 

People define their wealth based on the lifestyle they can afford and I can promise they’re living an upper middle class life, at best. 300k even in San Fran isn’t enough to have a mansion and eat at nobu every day. It may be enough to not worry about your bills, but I’d argue that’s middle class, not being rich.
He was directly asked a question about it, he didn’t complain, she’s just one of the most insecure women out there and was looking for some reason to hate herself. Part of this definitely falls into “she needs therapy for the insecurity otherwise she’ll ruin any relationship she’s in”.
You can simply contact the police. It’s your home. He legally actually *cant* lock you out. The police will escort you personally while you collect your belongings. Be sure to mention the fact that he’s been abusive in the past and you’re afraid of him escalating if you try to get your belongings back.
Also, I do want to remind you, just because *your* contractions were false, doesn’t mean hers will be. By assuming her experiences will be the same as yours, you may be obfuscating a serious health concern that she SHOULD go to the hospital for. You mean well, but you aren’t a doctor, and having 1 pregnancy gives you about as much insight into what might be going on with HER pregnancy medically as a man would have, and that is to say “almost nothing”. You can sympathize with her discomfort, but keep your assumptions on her medical status to yourself.
I think the real question is did he actually stalk you to fabricate your relationship or was that text message just a joke that he sent to friends after he happened to meet you by chance? Because I’ve definitely had moments like that happen (where I’ve talked to my friends about something but never actually meant it and then it happened by chance and I joke about making it happen even though I didn’t, though nothing quite like this). 

I can see this being just a series of bad coincidences, but if you feel like this man even a bit fabricated your meeting, run far and run fast because that’s some YOU level of stalking and obsession.
Yeah, no. Casual restaurants that are sit down dinner for an average of $12/entree don’t operate that way, at all.
I’d probably get divorce papers drawn up and get a plan for a new bedroom being set up and once he inevitably goes to cost her, move everything out from your room and into the new space for yourself (get a lock!) and just leave the house and have the papers sitting on the bed and a note saying, “I’m aware of how you feel about (woman). I am not going to be second place in my own marriage. Whatever you wish to happen between you two, you’re now free to explore.”

And then I would leave for a hotel/spa for a night just to make him wonder where you are and also to avoid the immediate reaction he’s bound to have.
And it’s pretty shitty that OP and her sibling are putting her brother in a position to need to make that call. Either way, he needs to be unfair to one of his kids. Unless everyone is trying to imply if you don’t share blood you can’t consider someone your child?
Yeah, it’s pretty terrible of OP and aunt, imo, to put their own sibling in the position of choosing between ensuring his bio daughter’s future and staying by his chosen family. I still think it’s their money to do with as they please, but I personally would go with “my brother has two kids. If I can’t treat them equally, I won’t treat them”. Especially if step-niece doesn’t have a bio dad in her life and sees brother as her father figure. But, I understand their choice as well.
Perhaps he didn’t mature, he just thought you’d changed enough to put up with it. This may not be your forever relationship OP. And that’s okay. We grow from high school.
I mean, if you don’t want to see him again, don’t, but I will say as you’re describing it, that doesn’t sound implausible for him to also have had that experience. Dad jokes aren’t exactly copy righted and sitting by the TV making a dumb sex joke to your kid sounds like the sort of thing hundreds if not thousands of teens could talk about.

I didn’t say I don’t know any sibling who choose to, I know plenty. I just said, none who are *required* to. College/school is still “on” the parents, not the siblings, even if the siblings choose to save up, which I will point out they made sure to do so quietly as this is the first time the fund was mentioned to the parents.
I mean…. Niece isn’t the family’s obligation either, no. I’ve never heard of it being on the siblings to pay for high school/college for someone else’s kids. That in mind, they already aren’t responsible for but are choosing to provide for niece. That kindness can extend only as far as they wish. In fact, it’s only because it’s siblings with no obligation that this is okay, otherwise I’d argue if after 10 years you’re unable to treat both of his kids like HIS kids, regardless of blood, that’s wrong.
Well because he is clearly at a minimum her emotional AP/best friend.
Well you see, OP is acting as though no one will ever be good enough for her little baby boy. She seems to have a pattern of ostracizing her son’s partners and subtly trying to make them feel less than.
Yeah, and good for her for respecting herself enough not to put up with that crap and good for her fiancé/the son to love her enough to stand up to his mom. His mom is giving off major “no woman but me is good enough for my son!!” Vibes which is a major ick factor
Then start acting like one, because you’re acting like a misogynist with a Jocasta complex towards your son.
This is a troll? Because you are very clearly not a bot account.
Just because the weed itself may not pose a threat, that’s foolish to think someone who got incredibly and unexpectedly high as a kid wouldn’t be in any danger. Being intoxicated always poses a risk for accidents.
I think they don’t mean it literally, as if there’s no active mods, the subreddit will be shut down, it’s against Reddit policy to have an unmoderated subreddit.
It honestly sounds like you’ve decided it can’t work and are looking for a reason it doesn’t. If that’s how you feel, leave. If you don’t like this truth, get some therapy. But this is definitely an internal issue you need to resolve. If you’re unwilling to actually put in the effort here and stop just defaulting to “see look?? It’s not getting better!” Then there’s no point wasting either of your time.
NTA. Just reply back, “hey dude, I didn’t drink more than a fifth of a bottle, so I’m pretty sure my share is covered by the groceries I brought for everyone. If you want I can send over an extra $10 but I don’t want to start a habit of paying for what I didn’t use.”
Presumably this is student housing where this sort of switching of apartments is common and accepted by the landlord. While not how most ‘adult’ apartment complexes are run, it’s pretty common practice in college towns.
Make a choice. You made vows. Do they actually mean something to you or is it just words you said? The grass is greener where you water it. If you actually believe marriage means something, you go NC. And start focusing on your wife and your marriage. Communication, compromise and couples therapy if you can afford it. That’s the only acceptable answer.
He makes you a worse version of yourself. Why would you stagnate yourself for three years only to stay in a relationship with someone who brings out the worst in you?

No. Work on yourself, heal, move on. If you two are right for each other, you’ll run into one another in the future. But do not plan for it. Tell him you’re not going to wait for him, as it’s clear you two aren’t right for each other as you are.
Why are you throwing and paying for a baby shower for your friend and giving her no hard budget to follow? Unless I’m sorely mistaken on how baby showers work, that’s not normal.
This goes in the face of what a lot of people say, but this is also one of those rare times when you really shouldn’t communicate to death about this. If you need to have one more convo where you two both agree you were both asking for trouble and you will both try to move forward, then sure. But at the end of the day, you asked the question. If you can’t handle the answer, that’s a you problem, not a him problem, and beating this conversation to death is only going to serve to kill your relationship even more. Stop talking about it after the next conversation. Either the pain will subside in which case awesome, learn your lesson. Or it won’t, in which case, that sucks, but you’ve learned your lesson on how asking stupid questions can ruin a good thing, and then both of you should go your separate ways.
I’m all for employees not immediately being fired for the smallest of mistakes but I also wish we as a society could move away from the idea that you should be paid for not doing any work. And I mean this for the common office worker and the ridiculously overpaid executive that just golfs all day. Earn your money. It isn’t that hard.
You keep saying “I understand if it’s because of my tardiness” and then proceed to *not* understand that she’s cutting you because of the tardiness and because you are stressing her out and trying to make things about yourself and your feelings rather than trying to make things easier for her, which is what being a bridesmaid is actually about. 

Accept the fact that you messed up and aren’t in a position to adequately fulfill the role of a bridesmaid and gracefully apologize to her. “I’m sorry that I made your wedding about me. That was wrong. I get why you would be less stressed without worrying about me in the bridal party. I’m still excited to see you get married and I hope you can forgive me because I don’t want my bullheadedness to ruin our friendship.”

Because if you don’t accept your mistakes and you decide not to go, you’ll lose this friendship and it will be because you’re unable to put your friend’s feelings on her wedding day before your own. YTA. A large one. If I were your friend, I’d be glad if you didn’t go so I could quietly bow out of a friendship with such a selfish person.
Not only that, but I’m pretty sure OP is the mean girl. The bride said “please just accept my decision and let’s move on, I know that’s hard for you to do” which says pretty much everything about who OP is as a friend. 

And that’s before you factor in that the bride correctly calls out OP for only caring about herself and not the bride’s stress, and claims that the bride brought up being late as a reason even though it was actually OP that straight up asked if it was because of being late to the bridal shower, when in reality it was three times during one weekend, one time 2 hours late, one time 4 hours late and who knows how late she was to the third event. She even needed a “plan to get her to show up early to the wedding” with someone, which means it’s not just “feeling off” but a general lack of respect for anyone other than herself. She also kept saying she’d understand if it’s because of how late she was, but then also proceeds to text paragraphs about how hurt she is, make half a dozen Reddit posts with varying levels of information included to obfuscate her wrongdoings AND even flat out denies being late in one of the posts as saying “the bride is making it up”. 

OP, you need to do some deep reflection here, because you’re misrepresenting things HEAVILY and someone who can’t take accountability and blames others isn’t a good friend or frankly, a good person. You said you would understand if she’s cutting you for being late and she obviously cut you for being late, so tell her you understand and are still happy she even wants you at her wedding, because if it were me, I would be glad you were debating not going so I didn’t have to figure out how to polite ghost you.
That’s fair. The few times I’ve ever “needed” to sob I wore myself out within like 10 minutes. Maybe 30 if I’m assuming I grossly am miscalculating the time, but I couldn’t even physically imagine sobbing/screaming for 90+ minutes and still being able to effectively breathe at that point. I get stuffed up and a migraine so quickly when I cry.
Also remember if you’re basically preparing for them to be unhappy either way, might as well wait and enjoy the peace while you can. It’s not like they’ll be happy if you tell them early, you’re just making yourself unhappy all that much sooner.
And in that same strain, plenty of addicts need to cope by completely and totally removing their vice from their life. If OP has moved forward through moving on, it may be true that regardless of the amount of progress made ‘now’ that this friend needs to always remain ‘in the past’. Much like you would never tell a Coke addict they can probably handle having Coke in their life again, it may be a similar situation here. It’s okay to have limitations. It doesn’t mean you aren’t reformed.
Eh, it isn’t fair to think people can say “that’s enough” with emotions, but you definitely can control if you’re sobbing/screaming vs just crying uncontrollably and maybe heavy breathing. I’ve had those days where I can’t stop crying for hours at a time, but silently.
NTA, but also, you may be shooting yourself in the foot here. What does your lease say, are you responsible for the rent unless she finds someone else to takeover? Because if you’re on the lease it’s still your responsibility regardless of if you live there or not.
I mean, yeah, personally if my partner was considering ending our relationship because of issues, especially something legitimate that I’ve been doing, I absolutely want to know! Who the heck would genuinely say they’d actually prefer to be left in the dark and give up the ability to save their marriage just because they’re afraid of a hard conversation?

Pretty much everyone ever that I have known who was blindsided wishes their partner would’ve just said when they were starting to think of leaving so it could be fixed.
Good. Actual communication can overcome way more relationship issues than people give credit to.
Ok…. So talk to her about that. You don’t see the blatant hypocrisy in your statement? You’re just as guilty of the same things she is. You’re trying to leave her in the dark over a huge thought you’re having rather than just telling her what you’re thinking. Stop that. Be better.
Yeah, if you’re that bothered you’re *updating your Facebook status in the bathroom*, my comment stands. OP was bothered enough to take action. If they’re that easily bothered, they aren’t compatible with small office culture. Unless you’re in a mega corporation, generally small offices WILL have talks like this, especially since it’s incredibly benign to say something along the lines of “thank god he was looking out for my husband”. It isn’t exactly a controversial statement. Even atheists often use that sort of language.
That isn’t really true. If you can’t handle having or even hearing any sort of conversation that isn’t strictly about work and nothing else, not even something as meaningful as a cancer scare, then you need to go work in a giant conglomerate where coworkers aren’t actually meant to be people and are just meant to be cogs in the machine. Everywhere else though, coworkers are often some form of friends, even if it’s only during work.
Believe it or not but it isn’t u professional to have a discussion about a coworker you have a relationship with. It isn’t like they were trying to convert OP, they were simply discussing their experiences and how they felt lucky/looked out for that their husband’s mass was found early.
Maybe a pea coat or a trench would give you what you’re looking for but can still have a fitted waist to give you some shape.
It may just be the dress you have underneath, but this doesn’t work for me. You look like you’re drowning in so much fabric.
Or even just don’t put glasses on the floor…. There’s obviously a side table right nearby. I’m not sure why this is even a habit at all, let alone the act of leaving them. The issue isn’t really her forgetting the glass out, because she does all the chores and people are allowed to forget things once in awhile, but also just…. Don’t put your glass on the floor and then when you forget it out it’ll be on the table and not a tripping hazard?
Or…. He just got fed up and she refused to take any form of accountability and just shifted blame so he decided to leave? I’m not saying either of them are totally at fault, but let’s also not act like either of them is totally blameless either. I’d say it’s way more okay to have a half cup of coffee next to the laptop if you’re working in the living room than it is to leave a glass of water as a tripping hazard in the direct foot path of people in the house.
If you’re in the wrong for anything, it’s that you’re not taking it badly *enough*. That’s just how bad it is what he said.
As much as it was obvious he wasn’t performing to standard today, I also want to remind people he is a real human being and likely is worried about more than just this match with everything going on with Kyedae, and to keep the flaming to a minimum. It isn’t going to help him improve, and it honestly can’t feel good for him to hear people shitting on him. Everyone has bad days, and even if you think he’s inconsistent, it could be due to his entire world turning upside down within the past month.
Ok OP, you need to realize there is no saving the kids. It sucks, but both of their parents are literal nazis. The kids either will or won’t take after their parents, but unless you’re going to do away with the Nazi father (which do not, I’m trying to simply illustrate you need to accept the kids will turn out how they are destined to turn out) then you need to accept that the kids got fucked with their parents. 

Reach out to the kids when they’re older if you’re so inclined to protect them, but at this point, you can’t do anything. You need to just accept tank your cousin is now and stand up for your values.
A little late is definitely 15 minutes, not over an hour. I would definitely be more than a little annoyed if someone showed up to a meal over an hour late without explicitly stating that. There’s almost no restaurant I’ve ever been to where an hour and 15 minutes in, I haven’t gotten AND eaten my food already. At that point, honestly just don’t come if you’re going to be that late, as it defeats the whole purpose of going out for food, especially if it was just brunch and not like brunch and shopping or something else afterwards. 

That being said, the friends still fucked up and glad they took responsibility for it.
I’m proud of you. You’ve come to this decision a lot easier than most would/have. It isn’t fixable, and it’s ultimately a waste of time that you could spend with someone who actually loves you to even try to fix this. Just make arrangements for a divorce lawyer (and you should legally be allowed to use your joint money to pay, but check on your area) and serve him with papers. Make sure to keep a friend or some family in the loop and have an emergency “crash on the couch” arrangement if you really need just in case. If you’re able to, start applying for jobs or disability or some form of income. 

And if he suddenly starts with “I want to make this work” then you can simply reply, “if you were ever interested in being a good husband you should’ve done that from the beginning, not once I’ve decided I’ve had enough.”
Is there anyone with knowledge who can explain to me how an arranged marriage can happen where the groom and his entire family hate the bride and her family? Because I still find that part so confusing.
You should speak to a professional. There’s a lot of things that could be going on, and you’re right. If you don’t solve this you’ll end up either unhappy, alone, or both. A therapist will help if you’re willing to put in the work.
Has he actually said that though? Because devils advocate in me thinks there’s a chance he also just might have work. You still don’t need to go ofc.
Also consider that you’re violating your ex by showing someone else a sex tape of her, with her face in full view. Personally that would be my bigger issue, as now I’d be terrified of any nudes or videos we’d taken/sent being something you either have or might share. 

Delete everything you have of any other woman on your phone. Tell her you understand that this was a violation on multiple levels of *multiple people* and you understand you were a fool and you’ve gotten your ass handed to you and are never going to do something like that again. And then don’t. Because holy shit your poor ex.
1. You’re assuming he doesn’t want kids and knew he never wanted them. That isn’t actually stated. 2. He’s allowed to change his mind. He’s allowed to withdraw consent. Everyone is. It’s crazy to argue that because she’ll lose out on something that his consent no longer should matter. Imagine making that argument for a woman? It’s gross. Same thing here. Morally, he can just as easily get a sperm donor or do IVF with a sperm donor and implant that embryo.
Well, the problem is you didn’t tell him because you were afraid of him wanting your money. You now know it’s not a fear, it’s reality. You do sound naive, because you are failing to realize even if you could’ve worked through the issues before, you can’t and shouldn’t work through “my boyfriend is a gold digger or potential financial abuser interested in taking or controlling my money.”
Sure, maybe she can’t (but to be clear, there’s nothing saying she can’t sue and win for the cost of IVF) but the answer isn’t to take any another person’s consent in creating a life that doesn’t yet exist.
Which is why I said *regardless of the legal aspect, morally he should be given the right to withdraw consent*.
Well, remember that you’ve made these changes for yourself and your marriage, not to be praised.
It fell off in the house and you noticed within 30 minutes. Text him and ask for help looking when he comes home. At the end of the day, if your partner is upset over a one time accident, that says more about him than you. 

That being said, just a tip, whenever I put on jewelry with a clasp, the first thing I do is give it a little tug to make sure it’s really on properly and not just appearing to be secured. Necklaces can be clasped just the wrong way where they stay on but once you tug it, it slipped out of the clasp. Good habit to form to minimize unfortunate accidents, but at the end of the day it’s still just an unfortunate accident.
To be honest, I never understood people who say “don’t accuse someone because for all you know they’re using the condoms for masturbation!”

That’s pretty uncommon, and frankly, if that’s the case, as long as you don’t accuse someone like a maniac, they’ll simply respond to the accusation with the real reason. Be aware that *maybe* there are other reasons, but that’s like someone saying all hooves are zebras. Unless you live in Africa, those hooves are horses 99.9999% of the time.
Ok well, unfortunately, your mistake had a pretty direct hand in turning this dude into a misogynist. You can “want” whatever, that doesn’t change the reality. You’re dating a misogynist and not only that, but you’re dating a man who RIGHTFULLY resent the woman who allowed him to be bullied when he was less attractive and never stood up for him. You aren’t going to overcome this. If you’re embarrassed to be with him, you’d better cut your losses, because quite frankly, you being in his life is part of the problem, because you’re a direct confirmation of everything that’s fueling him— people treating him better as soon as he got attractive.
Just to say, even if you’re legally in the clear, morally you should allow this man autonomy over his own progeny. I understand there is a cost associated with either getting a sperm donor or doing IVF with someone else, but please do not take away his consent to bring his child into the world. Men and women should be allowed this right. Sue him for the cost of the IVF and even what it would cost to do it again with a sperm donor, but don’t bring a child he’s clearly stated he doesn’t want into the world against his consent.
NTA. But moving forward, upon ordering, ask for separate checks. Not only does that make things way easier for the waiter, it makes it clear to Lyn/her boyfriend that whatever they order is fully on them. 

It’s best to learn ways of dealing with difficult people in a way that isn’t directly confronting them. It’s unclear if you actually said to the waiter “I want separate checks so I don’t pay for the other couple” but if you did, probably best to just address things as I suggested instead, because passive aggressive and snide remarks about your girlfriend’s best friend in front of said best friend without ever saying trying anything else is also not the most mature way of handling things, and is bound to rub your gf the wrong way, regardless of how in the right you are.
Hey, it’s clear you’re in denial, but you don’t need to apologize to us. The only one who suffers here is you. Just remember that.
Are you his first girlfriend? I’m going to assume you are, or at least you’re the first girlfriend to want to have physical intimacy (kissing, hugging, sex etc) and he asked you out unaware that he wouldn’t like it. But he doesn’t and he’s probably really unsure why himself. I would say more likely than not, this has to do more with him, his feelings, his identity and his journey than it has anything to do with you. I understand that sucks, but I would very gracefully break up with him. Just send him a text, “It feels like we’re friends not in a relationship. I think it would be better for us to just be friends from now on.”
Well, if you want the real talk. Maybe you won’t ever be absolutely sure. And in that case, don’t ever get married. Marriage isn’t something you should take lightly, and frankly, much like children, I believe plenty of people out there simply will never be fit for marriage. If you can’t do it right, don’t do it. Not when your decisions can have such huge effect on the lives of others, both in the person you would be marrying while unsure and of the kids you may have with her.
I’d probably speak to a therapist, as it sounds like you’re struggling with empathy.
Well, sounds like even if you could trust him before in the past, you’re no longer able to trust him now, as you’ve caught him in multiple lies. 

He’s turning into an addict and a liar, and when you combined that with the fact that 1. He has additional traits you don’t like and don’t seem to have touched upon here and 2. You’re on Reddit asking strangers if you should break up means this:

This isn’t the life you want for yourself, and you know that this is the life you WILL have if you stay. It sucks, because you love so much about him and you wish you could just make him into that perfect person you have in your head, but he isn’t. And as time goes on it’s becoming harder and harder for you to convince yourself he’s close enough to being that person. It’s true that no one is perfect and we all fight and have flaws, but the reality is this isn’t working and it probably hasn’t *really* worked in a lot longer than you want to admit. But the longer you stay, the longer it’ll take to not only get over this relationship, but also to find the person who doesn’t make you feel this way. Not only that, but staying with someone like this is only going to leave you with issues that make you a worse partner in the future. 

All in all, he may want to stop, but you can’t keep waiting around for him to stop. Even without the drugs, probably if you were honest with yourself this wasn’t a man that you’d want to stay with even if you didn’t love him.
I’m not sure how much this really means, if the next most watched game without 4 of the most popular female streamers playing in it was less than 10k viewers.
I also think he’s probably putting the blame on the cat when he should be looking at himself. 

u/ImpossibleSign6754 if you are noticing your wife is relying more on *a cat* than her own husband for emotional support, instead of trying to get rid of the cat, start asking yourself why *you* aren’t the one giving her the emotional support. More likely than not, you’re not actually “there” for your wife, so of course she’s going to rely on the cat who is.
You should just tell her, “I’m happy to pay for you, but anything your sister wants how about you cover yourself, good compromise?”
They definitely left because they were homophobic, not because they were blindsided. You can be surprised someone has two fathers but if you’re not homophobic your first thought will definitely not be to “get up and leave with absolutely no explanation”. If for no other reason than because you know how homophobic it looks and generally wouldn’t want to come off as such. I could maybe see this being a topic of conversation after dinner, but no semi-tolerant person storms off like that, without even saying anything to the effect of “wow. I feel like you were purposefully hiding something from me, i feel like you may be hiding other things and I don’t think it’s a good idea for us to have a dinner right now”
Ok but here’s the issue. If the money is just meant to be passed along, generation to generation, no one ever is going to use it, right? If that’s the case, 1. The kids shouldn’t be upset as it wouldn’t have been money they intended to use and 2. That’s foolish because hoarding money so you can say you have it but never actually doing anything with it is part of the reason there’s so much wealth disparity in the world. 

Money should be spent! Responsibly, of course. But him enjoying the rest of his life and making sure he’s able to care for himself is WHY the money exists. If his kids don’t want him to rely on them, then they shouldn’t rely on him to give a full inheritance. Independence goes both ways.
Gunna be honest, BOTH of you sound toxic and are trying to hide behind “jokes and quick wit” when the reality is you are both just bitter and bad partners. You probably aren’t good for each other, because and especially, neither of you seem ready to be with *anyone*. You can’t control him, but you can control yourself. Do some self-reflection and work to undo the unhealthy behaviors you’re forming so you can find and keep a partner who will also not treat you like shit.


I’m also going to add, never once have I looked down into my cup and seen anything looking back at me. While insulting your family is *so far out of line I can’t even begin* I also can’t say I wouldn’t also be disgusted if my partner was drinking from a straw with crap growing in it.
Maybe tell her it’s clear this is becoming an issue and you want to discuss this constructively before it causes permanent damage to your marriage, so you’ve booked an appointment with a couple’s therapist.
If you can’t do that, are you prepared to be the one putting in 100% of the effort again? Because those are the options. He likes you *because* you dote on and borderline worship him. If you stop doing those things, he isn’t going to chase after you. It sucks, but that’s the reality. Pick whatever you perceive as the lesser of two evils. 


But just remember, as much as you feel like you ‘can’t do it’, you can. And the sooner you start, the sooner you realize “wow, how did I ever think losing him was that hard?”
Don’t make yourself miserable because you’re afraid of your family thinking less of you. It’s okay to make mistakes. It’s okay to want the best from those you love. But it isn’t okay to be miserable because you’re afraid of *potential* judgement. Your family may just be happy you’re finally rid of him, so don’t stay because you’re afraid of what others will think if you leave.
I would maybe consider that you also aren’t who you think you are either. I’m not saying this was your fault, but you show a shocking lack of awareness of what I’d consider the basic status of both your relationship and partner’s general life. It’s very possible this is all your partner’s doing, but I’d probably guess you could also do some work on yourself so you can be a better partner in a future relationship with a woman who hopefully will deserve that trust.
I like the pants, but the top throws off your proportions. You have a wider waist and smaller chest, so you probably want a top that creates a more flared illusion. Sweetheart necklines or even a ruffled top would help to even out your proportions a bit.
Well, he clearly thought she loved him more than she loved herself. 

The unfortunate thing is for at least three years, he was right. Men and women need to remember that if you aren’t your own priority, you’re doing something wrong (within reason, please don’t be self-absorbed, just know your worth!)
Yeah, especially since presumably she was dating the ex-fiancé for some length of time, meaning this could’ve potentially gone down only a few months before they met.
It’s definitely better for JJ. OOP’s husband thinks JJ is immature for not having a boyfriend. That’s not the kind of energy I would want in my life, everything else not even considered.
Not really, saying “we need to start working on this and making progress because I know this is an issue I can’t live with forever, but I’m still willing to work on it now” is different than an ultimatum which is effectively “make this dramatic change *right now* or we’re done”
Honestly, to answer your question, yeah I do think you’d be a monster to issue an ultimatum of ‘let me cheat or I’ll leave you.’ Instead, tell him, “I can’t stay in a relationship without intimacy. We either need to work on this together, or we need to reevaluate our marriage because this isn’t working for me”. If he offers an open relationship, then sure, but to *coerce* him into an open marriage? Nah fam. If you’re unhappy, you leave, you don’t do that.
Honestly I think this fit will come down more to your size than your height. It looks good because of her figure.
Did you ever pause and think maybe your son doesn’t respect you two because you dole out a harsher punishment for speaking out against racism than the racism itself? 

I’d say no offense, but I actually mean offense when I say: if you *arent* racist, get your shit together because you’re coming off very racist right now. Just in the “I have a black friend of course I’m not racist!!” Kind of way that 21st century racists all seem to thrive. People seem to think refusing to use a slur means you aren’t racist and trust me, it’s a lot more complicated than that.
Most likely because you understand that actions have consequences and anyone can push things too far. She likely thought after 5 years, they were essentially one, so even if he didn’t like what she was doing he wouldn’t stop it. Which, is a bold choice.
If she’s lucky, 50k/ year at 27 with no working history and no info on what her degree would be a godsend.
It never ceases to amaze me how someone can so confidently refuse to compromise because they firmly believe they hold all the power and so quickly backtrack when they realize they’ll lose everything over being unwilling to lose anything.
You should *really* only use force as a last resort. You should try bribes/masking before you resort to shoving the pill down their throat.
I don’t recommend this, but at least in your head, say, “there may be many women who would ask for less, but there are also many men who will give so much more.”

You deserve better.
Yeah. I’m so so so sorry that this is happening to you, but it’s very clear that he thinks you’re trapped now. There is *no* changing him. And given everything you’ve just told me, I think it’s most likely he will both cheat *and* turn physical. 

Make a decision without him. I understand this is hard to come to terms with, so if it takes you time to come to the decision, that’s okay. But if you decide to leave him, and I would *seriously* consider it, make sure you have everything lined up and never mention a word to him. You may need to ask family for help, friends, make new accounts, whatever it takes to ensure he doesn’t find out. You’re honestly, very likely in danger right now. Secrecy is your best friend. Be careful, OP. If you need resources, I can link you to someone who will be able to help more than me.
I also think the title is misleading. She isn’t actually saying Maria can’t be vegan, but she’s saying that Maria needs to stop demanding “specialty vegan” items like fake meat, fake cheese, fake butter etc. If she’s vegan on principle, good for her, but she needs to decide between a plain old salad/pasta with tofu or going hungry because it’s ridiculous to expect everyone else starve and get inadequate nutrition just so Maria can have the ‘fancy’ vegan foods.
Make sure to check the reviews, I always raise an eyebrow at ‘affordable’ dresses that require decent construction to look good. Would suck to waste a couple hundred on a dress that ended up looking cheap
The reality is, your husband wants a traditional wife. He wants a woman who’s sole existence is to serve him and his family. Your role is to cook for him, take care of him, bear and rear as many or as few kids as he desires and put up with whatever he wants. He makes a bunch of money and he feels as though that’s his right as not only a man, but a *successful* man. 

I get everyone on Reddit telling you not to tolerate it, and you shouldn’t, but you need to be *hyper* realistic about the situation you’re in. He isn’t going to change. There is no point in trying to convince him. If you try to change him, one of two (I guess three) things is going to happen, he will leave you, cheat on you, or become violent. He’s already become angry with you for beginning to challenge him, so do not doubt the possibility that he will become physical. 

You need to simply decide if your and his views on what a marriage should be are compatible, and they very well may not be. But if this isn’t what you want, you need to make plans to leave, not plans to stand up for him. Otherwise, you may be in physical danger, or at a minimum left in a situation with no plan. He may become vengeful in a divorce and do everything he can to take everything from you and leave you with even less than you came into the marriage with. I can’t impress upon you that the choices are either accept the marriage he wants, or *do not say anything until you’re in a position to quickly and safely leave*.
You’d be very wise to involve your father not only for your sister’s safety, but for your boyfriend’s safety. You need to tell anyone and everyone what your sister is doing, and make it clear this isn’t consensual, and protect your boyfriend, because this is how false accusations usually arise. Your sister may not take the rejection well, seeing as any semi sane individual *wouldn’t tell her sister she’s going to pursue her boyfriend of 4 years* so you’re already dealing with someone who isn’t all there when it comes to following social norms. Be careful and protect yourself and your boyfriend. The sooner someone can step in and knock some sense into her, the better.
As much as I understand you don’t think it’s “weaponized incompetence”, it is definitely still “incompetence”. I have never ruined a single dinner, timer or not, *because I am paying attention to the meal*, I would never walk away from a kitchen appliance that’s turned on. I have never messed up a load of laundry like that *because I always check to make sure to fully check, hands inside the machine, that it is empty, before and after a load of laundry. I’ve never had any furniture, TVs, or anything of the sort break on me *because I test to make sure things are installed properly after I finish.* He can’t prevent the actions of others. The late drivers and rear end accidents aren’t him. But, you’re allowing him to blame way more than he should on this nebulous “I’m cursed” idea, when the reality is, he simply isn’t going through life intelligently. Especially because if you know you’re that unlucky, you’ll learn quickly ways around it. You two have been together years and perhaps even live together. If you’re eating the same food, the fact that you don’t get food poisoning and he does probably means he isn’t using good food hygiene for the food only he’s eating, as bacteria doesn’t selectively decide to attack him and leave you alone. 

This is a classic example of “one crappy encounter happens, two is unlucky. Is every encounter sucks, the problem is you, not them”. I get it. You love him. You want to believe this person you love is totally helpless to do anything to stop this unfortunate string of events, but he isn’t. Until and unless he understands that he’s allowing himself to a victim more than he needs (and why, given he seems so predisposed to the inevitable?) and takes steps to course correct, you’d be fully within your right to leave someone who doesn’t understand something so basic as *don’t leave cooking food unattended* that I learned that when I was 8 years old and started cooking.
Probably didn’t see the context of he was sleeping on an air mattress in someone else’s room. I was initially thinking he was the AH for making a big deal over $200, but given he doesn’t even get an actual place to stay, yeah, it’s time to put the foot down imo.
It’s probably an overreaction to say “quit him” but I agree OP needs to simply put her foot down, “I am not quitting my Etsy store. If the time comes where I need to go back to being a waitress, I will, but being a waitress is a dead end job, and one I can get at any time, with any resume. I am going to put my focus where I am happy and making more money, until that changes. I understand your concerns, so if my business starts to fail, I’ll definitely figure something else out, but you do not get to unilaterally tell me to quit my business, especially not to go back to waitressing of all jobs. It’s utter ridiculous of you to suggest such a foolish business move.”
It likely doesn’t take much luck if you A. Come from a rich family or B. Have the mother of the child do all of the child care while you focus on school and then your career. The kids were all by the same woman it seems. You have no idea if that woman was well off or what, but it’s definitely possible.
People seem very unaware that in the franchised/ascension league teams are no longer free to make changes whenever they want. But yes, the rosters are as they are, unless there is some ‘emergency transfer’ allowed by riot, which would only be for extenuating circumstances. This is a good thing for the scene overall though, as rosters that just make a change after any bad performance are going to perform worse than the teams that work at chemistry and accept that the path to success is rarely ever straight up.
To me, that’s hard to say. He might, absolutely. But he just as easily might not. There’s 5 teams currently, and will be 6 teams by next year. I’m sure changes will be made to franchised teams, no doubt, but it’s a combination of “depends on what his salary and geographic requirements are” combined with what the scene looks like by then. A lot can happen in a year. In fact, yay went from relatively unknown to dominant superstar in less than a year. There is nothing to stop that happening again, to someone else and based on the trajectory of the scene thus far, I actually bet it does happen again. The issue is when there’s only 30 franchised players, and only *5-6* slots for *your* particular role, it probably isn’t a great risk to take saying “eh, I’ll just take a year off and come back later” because frankly, you may not have that option. Yay has a very particular role he fills with a very particular play style he excels in, and he does it well, but when you’re the best in a niche field, you need prominence to ensure relevance and that doesn’t happen in a world where he doesn’t compete and rarely streams, I mean he hasn’t even updated his twitch to remove C9 from the about tab. And frankly, unless yay has a backup plan for his career lined up, that isn’t a risk I’d personally want to take when we’re talking about his actual livelihood here. It may not be as glamorous as he would want, but it definitely beats becoming/staying unemployed.
Well, I think people on here in the comments have knee jerk reactions as a result of the people in the posts ignoring numerous red flags. The problem is, they see where the red flags *tend* (not always of course) lead, and as a result have a hairpin trigger on convincing people to expect more for themselves and stop ignoring such blatant issues. 

However if the people on here were always really intuned with how much these red flags can turn into relationship Enders, and instead only ever came here for advice on “I messed up, I forgot my wife’s birthday how do I make it up to her?” Or “my partner and I disagree on how to handle xyz how do we come to an agreement?” People would probably be a lot less likely to jump to “this relationship is unhealthy”. You see the issue? 

Instead, this guy is recognizing the dynamic is unhealthy right away and opting out, which is the smarter way to go about dating. It means that when the issues do arise, they tend to be manageable issues and with someone who hopefully, will be able and willing to work on those issues with you.
Yay wins because he won’t be knocked out of the competitive scene for a year. Ranked is terrible for practicing for pro play, and being out of practice with scrims, meta and competitive performances could really hurt him in the long run. Valorant is a game where recency plays a huge role in your value, and in a year of franchising with no yay and however many other new/upcoming players dominating? He could find himself with no prospects again. Definitely yay has an incentive to be playing and be showing the world he is still very much a top performer compared to all the other talent out there. And he does that by competing, not by sitting and playing ranked.
Well, believe it or not, most likely the getting all up in his over his eye color had to do with his race. Her brother getting hostile/aggressive could be taken as borderline abusive, and OP’s lack of either a warning about her family’s behavior nor any attempt to run interference or set boundaries/stand up for him show an unhealthy dynamic that can easily turn toxic. 

It’s not silly for someone to see the red flags for what they are right away and not wait for the ‘silly’ to turn ‘unbearable’. In fact, if everyone acted the way this guy did, people would both be happier in general, and also those who refuse to make changes in their lives that would protect their SO would be forced to, because they’d just keep ending up alone otherwise.
Yes and no. Anger will consume you if you let it. Learning emotional maturity is learning how to not allow your emotions to rule you, and often part of that is learning how to, since you seem to like frozen, let things go. So, while yes, it’s a nuanced topic, moving on from something does often involve choosing and actively working on *not* allowing those emotions to control you anymore. Sure, if you think about it, you might still feel those things, but it’s semantics to make the argument about whether or not active or passive feelings of anger are still being angry about something. In short, yes, being an adult means you need to be able to choose when to *actively* feel emotions vs. accepting that you do feel a certain way about something but refusing to allow that emotion to control your life. The attitude of “she should remain angry forever” is frankly unhealthy and lacks any sort of emotional maturity. 

She can be angry, but she ultimately needs to decide if she’s going to let that anger rule her life or not. And yes, most adults are 100% capable of *choosing* not to be so angry about something anymore. If you’re unable to, consider you may not have adequate emotional control. 

Imo, it isn’t worth it for her to remain angry, because the ring was given to her cousin without conditions and regardless of its alterations, OP wasn’t given the ring so there is no additional loss to her as already the ring wasn’t and wouldn’t be hers. It sucks, she can mourn the loss of a beautiful ring, get it remade for her if she so chooses now free of guilt.
Well, people can actively to choose to move on from a situation they’re hurt about. The point of the comment is a very pragmatic one— either make this a hill to die on and cause familial tensions or accept that what’s done is done, it was technically given to her without conditions of keeping it as is, and as much as it hurts, that hurt can remain a personal one. 

Forgiveness is often a choice someone actively makes, not one that simply happens, and it’s one that is often made not for the person being forgiven, but for themselves. Yes, it’s hard, but part of being an adult is being able to *manage* your emotions. That doesn’t mean to just get rid of them, but you should be able to manage them enough to be able to move forward.
Even the ~20-30 lbs tvs of today could definitely kill a toddler if it fell the wrong way. That poor child, but thank god OOP lives in a country with strong intervention for at risk children.
I assume the most likely reason for his overreaction was he may be unaware pancada has said he finds playing smokes boring, despite being really good at it. And thus assumed this was being done against his best interest. My guess? This was brought up and syyko is enabling pancada in a way even loud wasn’t able/didn’t want to.
And against any medical practice policies that you wouldn’t be horrified to go to. Even most fast food restaurants say you can’t wear a ring if it’ll risk tearing your gloves, yet OP thinks a *cardiologist* should have worse hygiene than a Burger King.

I mean if you really want to be real, the problem is she accepts it.
Unless I missed something, I think ultimately the friend simply isn’t going to attend, OP didn’t say anything to me that came off as trying to force her to attend without Hans, just that she can’t attend with him, as it would make it so the mother of the groom wouldn’t feel comfortable attending her own son’s wedding.
Right, and as long as OP isn’t forcing the friend to come without the dog and accepts the friend simply will be unable to attend, all is well. But it’s completely fair for OP to say, “I fully understand you can’t be without Hans, unfortunately, my MIL is uncomfortable around even the most well behaved dogs due to her own trauma. As much as I would love to have you there, I won’t ask either of you to be uncomfortable. Can we celebrate together, the four of us, you me Hans and groom on our own?”
In public, yes, 100000%. But this isn’t public, this is a private event where she isn’t required to attend. If she doesn’t feel comfortable going without her service animal, she shouldn’t! But to act as though her being able to attend comes before making sure her husband can have *his mom at his own wedding* is also an odd take. I for one, would *really* be second guessing a marriage where my STBW made it so my mother wouldn’t attend my wedding.
She is NTA for ensuring her *husband’s mother* feels comfortable at her wedding over her friend. However, unfortunately this means the friend should simply not go to the wedding. It’s unfortunate, but the friend is not *required* to go to the wedding, and her presence isn’t a priority compared to her husband’s mother.
Uhm, yeah, actually, your post aside, it can 100000% be rude to tell someone something objectively true. For example: “you look really fat in that dress” can both be objectively true and rude af to say to someone. Even your tone can take something from being not rude to rude (like I’d say your attitude was). For example: “hey, I’d prefer to go to the movies alone if that’s okay, but we can have dinner after!” Vs. “Really? You can’t possibly think I’d want to go to the movies with you, I’m going alone.” It’s true you don’t want to go with that person, but the first is polite and the second is rude.
No, you may feel you have to move now because you’d prefer to run alone if the option is there, but definitely understand that that’s a choice you’re making not being force to make, and you can make that choice silently. If you feel uncomfortable, fine, but no one else needs to hear why you’re moving, just move.
She most definitely accosted him. You can feel she was justified in doing so and therefore isn’t an AH for it, but she was 100% accosting him for using the treadmill next to her.
In the future, don’t say anything, just silently move to another treadmill. On the off chance that this guy has unrelated reasons for using that particular machine, it prevents you from acting rude, and even if he did want to impose on you, moving without the confrontation will just annoy him. And keep you safer. 


I would say if he made a complaint, as is, you’d be partially in the wrong, as he does have a right to use the equipment, regardless of if there are other machines free, without you acting like he was doing something wrong. And guys like that are definitely the type to make a complaint, so it’s better to just get up and move rather than confront. It either wasn’t on purpose in which case confronting him is an AH move, or it WAS on purpose and you’ll convey the message loud and clear without ever having to interact. Win win!
Why not just have your sister text her and see if it goes through on her end? That’s a pretty surefire way to know if she’s blocked you.
That is not true at all. That was true in the peak of covid, which is no longer really a concern. It’s a tourist economy. The lack of tourism is hurting a number of the locals, and the ask was strictly because the hospital infrastructure isn’t equipped to handle large influxes of inpatient care, and being an island in the middle of the ocean, alternatives for those who need it is effectively impossible.
It’s ~30%, not 50. There’s 14 guests + OP/groom (and I assume they’ll have a slightly nicer setup for themselves as it’ll double as a honeymoon). So 21/16 = 1.3125 (an ~30% increase if you assume OP/groom don’t splurge on themselves and if you assume a linear ppp, which most likely she’d do a double bed and couch setup for the sister and family, making it less than other guests which are presumably primarily couples). 


Doesn’t change it, the flights alone on a last minute trip to Hawaii are nuts, and why spend that much money you 1. Don’t have/didn’t plan on and 2. On someone who really isn’t there to celebrate your relationship, just wants a free trip.
“I’m sorry for not inviting you. I figured since you said no due to time away from work and difficulty handling the long travel time with the kids that a longer and harder to get to location would be the opposite of easier for you guys, but I’d still love to have you! If you’re able to join, I can send you the flight and hotel details, unfortunately you will need to cover your travel/accommodations, as the plans I made were based on those who RSVP’d yes only and we’ve already used our budget. If you can’t spend the money or the time due to it being your busy season, I more than understand and hopefully we can get together once things settle down for us both more. If you need to think about it, no worries, just be sure to let me know by (whatever date you want) so I can make sure to get extra tickets for the activities I planned.”
Your boss’s success compared to his boss’s doesn’t have anything to do with the idea that your potential ex may try to sabotage your career.
You can also give him some benefit of the doubt, especially because you still come to the same conclusion— if he’s being caused such deep emotional distress that he’s ask you to quit your job, after seeing just how low you were at one point, that means you are just as unhealthy for him as he is for you. At that point, even if he’s being totally genuine in his feelings, the conclusion is the same. “I love you, and I don’t want to keep hurting you. But if it’ll take me quitting my career for you to not be hurt, unfortunately at this point, it’s for the best we part ways. We both have our demons and it seems like they can’t play nice with each other. I’m not giving up my job. But I also will not stick around and trigger you either. Please get some therapy, it’s a life changer. If our paths cross one day and we’re both in a place to lift one another up, maybe things will be different. But for now, I think I should move out so you can focus on yourself and your well being.”
I hope it isn’t true, but that was my thought as well. Either that, or I’m unfortunately guessing he probably isn’t the cleanest person to live with, because I would definitely notice and clean up any blood left on the floor, regardless, but especially if caused by something I was ashamed of.
I have no agenda. And a number of OOP’s comments have been deleted/removed and show a very different side of OOP. He was attacking anyone who disagreed with him, insulting them and doubling down on the idea that family should come first. After being criticized by multiple people, it seems his attitude has softened significantly, which is good, but multiple people on a number of threads have said the same thing— the repeated use of the language “blood family should come first” and calling an obvious abuse victim “spineless” doesn’t sit right with many people. The point is the repeated context in which it was used felt less like “you shouldn’t allow yourself to be manipulated” and more like “you should simply side with family because we’re blood and were here first”, including in the first few comments that were made on this thread. Thankfully, OOP has admitted the wording was wrong and emotions were high, but I stand by my statement both generally and in the way many felt it was being used in this context, and understand you likely didn’t see many of OOP’s earlier comments in this thread as he appeared to be deleting them when they weren’t well received.
Fair, always is dangerous language. However, I believe that when you take a marriage vow, you need to be prepared to make that person and family you make together your priority, over your blood family.
I stand by what I say, fully. It IS disgusting to say you think blood family should be the priority. It’s completely fair to say you think *his* values, which clearly his fiancée was in direct opposition to, should be his priority, but how you phrased it, is something I disagree with extensively. I fully stand by that. Don’t double down on the context, as that only implies you *do* think blood family takes precedence over a life partner, which when that life partner is actually in alliance with you, is 100% a disgusting statement.

Quite honestly? You honestly seemed to have an air of blaming your brother for not sticking with you simply on principle, without recognizing the complexities of abuse and that makes can still be victim to toxic relationships. I’m sorry that you’re upset I take issue with that, but I do.
That’s good you recognize that a (healthy) partner should always come before blood family. The way you wrote that post definitely indicates otherwise. I’m glad your brother was able to see reason and get out of an unhealthy relationship!
As much as OOP was right that this woman wasn’t right for his/her brother, I’m surprised no one has pointed out the idea that “blood family should always be the priority over your fiancée” no matter what is also a disgusting view. Assuming you and your future life partner are aligned in values, you should 100% always pick your life partner over blood family. The idea that your sibling should be a priority over a life partner in cases OTHER than such extreme hatred, isolation and abuse is horrendous, and based on how many times OOP brought up the idea of “he should stand by his blood family” makes me feel like this isn’t ‘extenuating circumstance’ and OOP just believes this is what you do. I hope OOP changes their mind before getting into a LTR if they’re interested in them, because my heart hurts for all the people out there in unhappy marriages because their partners hold them in second place to mommy/daddy/whoever else in the name of ‘family’.
Sure, but that will probably become apparently relatively quickly and can be addressed then. As long as you’re not depriving your child of any form of food for months, seems like a fine strategy to at least try.
I read this as crows initially and had to zoom in in order to definitely say, “those definitely are not crows”.
I mean, realistically speaking that’s because if a partner was going to negatively talk about body count, it’s going to be towards a female. I would be more surprised if I saw someone judging a man for sleeping with 100 girls in college, quite honestly.
Generally speaking it gets around when you’re all friends in college.
You should probably read again. I said this isn’t a legal issue *specifically where it pertains to her lying and saying he raped her*. I never said sexual assault isn’t illegal. I was specifically replying to the idea he should report it to the police for fear of her flipping the narrative.
He honestly isn’t working that much, yes, it’s a lot, but plenty of people do it. The real issue is he’s leaving for work at or around 12 pm, if a 12-13 hour day has him home at almost 2 am. Depending on her work hours, that means they probably never see each other. He needs to get his hours in check and start working WAYYY earlier so that him and his wife can share meals together. But honestly? I have no sympathy for someone who expects his wife to work ~30 hours a week, do all the chores and then stay up past midnight to have a home cooked meal ready for him in the middle of the night. 

This would be a totally different story if he was getting up at 5 AM and getting home at 7-9 pm and expecting her to cook something quick or have take out or whatever, but these timeframes are totally unreasonable and unnecessary.
To be honest, the part everyone seems to be overlooking is if he’s coming home at 1:30 am after a 12-13 hour day, that means he’s leaving for work at ~noon. He needs to start going into work at 6-7 am and getting home at a normal hour so it’s reasonable to expect a meal ready for him. But it’s ludicrous to be going into work that late, staying that long, and still expecting your wife to stay up past midnight to then cook.

If he were coming home even at 9 pm, I would be fully on his side. Coming home at almost 2 am? Fuck no.
I’m not saying it isn’t, I’m just saying this isn’t a legal issue re: she could lie and say he raped her. No sex happened. In the US, actual rapists with evidence go free. But you can’t have evidence of what didn’t happen, and unfortunately, even though he was sexually assaulted, male victims have even less chance of legal success than female victims. However, filing the report will at least substantiate OP’s experience even if no consequences befall her. 

And like I said, if OP’s girlfriend doesn’t believe him, even after he has gone to her multiple times, then he’s learned a valuable lesson about how she prioritizes him so he can GTFO.
She could, but since OP was smart and went to GF about this before, it’s consistent. This won’t be a legal issue, sex never happened. He got a BJ, and without any evidence of any sex, let alone non-consensual sex, OP really doesn’t need to worry about a rape charge, not in the US at least. If his GF doesn’t believe him, ultimately, it’s better for him to know she isn’t someone who will have his back and he can leave.
The staff didn’t side with her. And there’s nothing about anyone else agreeing. It was simply, “she had an attitude, I had one back, the staff told us we were both able to use the equipment as we wished”. Unless you see information not I’m the OP, but how you’re portraying it is very different than how the OP portrays things.
You do seem to be dragging your feet a bit on the legal side of things. Just to warn you, that could seriously hurt you in the long run. Just be careful.
I mean, if communication is important to you, I wouldn’t stay with someone who doesn’t communicate. I get it sucks, but that just isn’t who she is. You should love someone for who they are, not who you want them to be.
Yes I agree, but also recognize that there are some people who take undue offense to what most would consider normal, so as much as it may depend on him, recognize that it doesn’t *all* depend on him. This is so much an issue where women assume the worst of guys in the gym where it’s a growing trend on TikTok for girls to film and watch for anyone who glances at them, just to start a fight. It’s entirely possible that she may have also just assumed he was staring at her when he wasn’t. I’m not really speculating who was doing what, because there’s ultimately no way to know, except that even if he were standing too close for her preference, in a gym environment (or really any), if you come at someone with an attitude like she did, you should expect an attitude in return. It really isn’t an abnormal social interaction.
Even if you regret it in the future, you can mourn him then. There’s no reason or expectation that mourning a life can ONLY occur at a funeral with people to watch you grieve. If you don’t want to go now, don’t, and when/if that ever changes, decide how you want to remember him then.
Let him blame you. At the end of the day, if him blaming you is what it takes for *you* to find a bigger better relationship FAR away from a cheater like him, that’s a small price to pay.
I mean, I don’t necessarily think it’s sincere but I am saying that if you immediate attack anyone even *trying* they will stop trying.
That’s fair enough! I will say, I take it you were probably a bit more polite than it seems the woman in the story was, but you’re totally entitled to your opinions and experiences. I think to me, OP’s answer seems a bit more normal, as I get the impression the woman also had an attitude to start, and you tend to get what you give. So, I don’t really find OP an AH for responding to an attitude with an attitude. But I’m glad you haven’t had that experience.
No, she said she was convinced her intentions were good and realized they weren’t, and her actions came from a place of judgment which was wrong.
Yeah…. It is glaring obvious who does and doesn’t go to the gym in this thread. To the surprise of no one, most people on AITA clearly are not avid gym goers.
Out of curiosity, do you go to a busy gym? Because you’re totally entitled to your opinion, but it’s 100% normal, expected and required in a busy gym to stand close enough to a desired piece of equipment that as soon as the person gets up from their set, they can move up and take the equipment, otherwise someone *will* take your place. This comes down to if the woman isn’t comfortable with that sort of environment, that’s totally fair, but she probably needs to go either at a less busy time or a smaller gym.

Also, I’m not trying to attack you, I’m just curious if you’re familiar with this sort of environment because I can see how someone who isn’t familiar with busy gym etiquette may get to your conclusion.
Tbf, if everyone in the thread is mischaracterizing his actions as something they clearly weren’t, he can provide clarification. People are out here acting like he was standing over glaring heavily and making tut tut noises while pointing at his watch, when this sounds like completely normal gym interactions, from someone who actually goes to a gym. Heads up, gyms are filled with adrenaline and testosterone and women and men tend to be a bit testier than usual. Women often assume that everyone is leering at them and tend to want space and no one looking at them and men often just want the person they’re waiting on to get out of the way so they can do their set. It sometimes leads to snarky interactions, and it’s not that deep.
They didn’t, actually. They said they understood where OP was coming from, but she’s allowed to do whatever exercise wherever she wants. That’s actually the opposite of saying he’s out of line. That’s retail worker speak for, “I fully agree with you but this is my job and I need to not get in trouble”.
And? Believe it or not, you’re allowed to *silently* judge people. He didn’t say anything. Stop acting like you can police someone’s *thought*. That’s some Orwellian bullshit right there.
…. You’re gunna decide a person is an asshole for a silent thought? Dude. That’s just unreasonable. The woman spoke to OP first and told them to go away. Pretty sure OP isn’t the AH here.
I mean, she has a point though, as far as “I was a giant flaming asshole and now I realize it” goes, she got further than a lot of people ever do. None of these comments recognize that though. I’d probably caution people, at least in their real life, to be kinder to people who have any form of self-reflection. Because the fact that this person STILL got piles of hate for acknowledging they messed up just makes people never want to acknowledge their flaws. To some extent, she cannot undo what she did, she can only reflect on her previous actions and try to learn from it in the future. If we actually want the world to be a better place and for people to *want* to be better, we all need to encourage people for trying. That doesn’t mean forgive their previous mistakes, but endlessly hating on someone even when they’re trying to reflect on their behavior isn’t the answer.
Yeah. And then, you realize really quickly someone who really loves you wouldn’t hold you back. And they’d probably move with you, given he has nothing tying him to where he is. I get how it feels, but take it from an old curmudgeon like me, you realize a lot of the things you were so sure of at 18, just aren’t true by the time you’re 25. And then again when you’re 35. You’ll find someone who loves you so much, you never find yourself posting on Reddit about how they’ve made you feel guilty for achieving greatness.

I’ve lost loves before that felt like I would’ve died without them, but I’m still here. And in the end, I now realize those loves were there to teach me something and prepare me to be the person I was meant to, rather than to accompany me in the journey. But you’ll find that person, I promise. The road may be bumpy but it’ll be worth it.
I think you should just be honest. “I’m going to (great school). You can either come with me, or you can stay, but I am going. If this is where our paths diverge, I can honestly say I loved every minute, but I am not giving up on this dream. I understand if you aren’t ready for this step, but I am.”

I was in a similar situation many years ago. I have no regrets, and I’d pick my education every single time. My parents always said, “if it’s meant to be, it’ll work out and if it wasn’t meant to be, it isn’t worth sacrificing your future for”.
Does he have a therapist knowledgeable in addiction? If not, that should be the first step.
Sounds like she figured after 3 years marriage should be the next logical step but she realized that wasn’t what she actually wanted. It could be someone else, it could be she wasn’t ready, it could just be that you two aren’t right for each other. It doesn’t mean you were a bad partner or there’s anything wrong with you, but not everyone is meant to marry each other. Be happy she realized and finally told you before the wedding rather than after. And I’m glad you’re okay.
Sometimes just the threat of it would be enough to get someone to back down.
Well, it would probably be easier to trust if you waited to trust until someone has proven they are worth it, ya know? Then you wouldn’t constantly be having dudes breaking it. You’d just be weeding out the bad eggs, without feeling like it’s a person affront.
Like I said before, a person who when angry responds in a way to cause pain isn’t marriage material. You should aim for someone who even when angry is able to come at a conflict from a place of love.
You have time! Take a breather. Moving forward, table any serious discussion of marriage, engagement, moving in etc until you feel like you actually know a person and there aren’t any massive flags thrown out. If this is about a rush to the aisle, you’ll end up there a lot quicker, and only once, if you take your time and make sure it’s right the first time.
Plenty of McDonalds are 24 hours. Still weird, but possible explanation as to why no one checked.
Girl. You’re a doormat. Stop believing what this ‘therapist’ has to say and get your own therapist to work on your issues because you’re about to be a mom and you need to work on your spine unless you want to get completely run over by the two kids you’re about to have to raise on your own.
As soon as you realize he doesn’t actually care about your feelings, he only cares about his, you should stop caring about how much you love him, because that’s meaningless to him.
Fair enough. Good luck. You seem to have a habit of rushing into situationships with men before you actually know if they’re worth the time investment. I’d recommend slowing down and not jumping in head first with any guy who shows interest.
I do have to ask, how many men are you dating and why are you talking about marriage to a man you aren’t even faithful to? You made a post 4 days ago that you’ve since deleted about a wealthy, older Indian man wanting to date you and you were considering it expect he was married before. I feel like you’re going through something, but none of the information you’re giving is actually honest, as there’s a common theme of “you wanted to be the first” wife.
It’s ok to admit you can’t move past it. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. *never* stay in a relationship with a person who when angry will say something just to hurt you. That isn’t who you commit to a lifetime with. It shows they’re vindictive and cruel and neither are traits you need in a partner. I’ve been angry before. Really angry. I have never said to a person whom I intended to continue dating anything that I felt would hurt them just because I wanted to hurt them.
You should both recognize you’re career oriented and neither of you should give up your career goals for the other, but those goals are in direct contradiction. Geographic incompatibility is a real thing, and residency is long, hard and time consuming. If you think long distance relationships don’t work, let me tell you, relationships in residency also don’t usually work. If you combined long distance and residency, it’s a whole other beast to tackle. If you already have doubts, it ain’t worth it to invest another 2-3 years just to find out what you already know.
You’re in your final year of uni. When do you graduate? Are you done in may/June? If so, hold off until you graduate. It’ll give you time to plan and get the logistics sorted. Start applying for jobs now. Either where you are or back home where your family is. Go to your universities career department to get in contact with alumni. Message recruiters on LinkedIn, this all works WAY better than blindly applying. Network. Network. Network. Use being a student to your advantage. There is no easier time to get a job than now. 


As for how to get where you’re going, do you have a driver’s license? If so, rent a car to get where you’re going. You can possibly take your bird on a train. Cover the bird during travel and get a travel cage that can fit either at your feet or on the seat next to you. Be realistic about how much it costs to transport things— it may be cheaper to replace items than ship them. I moved cross country twice in a very short period of time and the only thing I transported was clothing. Everything else was bought as cheap as possible and given to friends when I left. Vacuum bags are your best friend for getting as much as you can in your bags/car. 

If you don’t have a license but do have family willing to house you, pay for a ticket for them to fly out and then rent the car to transport you and your stuff. In the meantime, you need some income. Look into on campus jobs, the dining hall, library, cafes, tutor centers, etc. all should have flexible hours and be okay with you working 5-15 hours a week for some pocket change. Save every penny. Work as much as you’re able. 

Focus on 1. Getting a part time job, on campus if possible. 2. Getting a permanent job, network network network!!! 3. Talking to family to see if they can help you and how 4. Looking into how much it will cost to get where you need to go. The further you have to travel the more it will be, and ultimately make sure you don’t try to take a bunch of stuff that will be cheap to replace but expensive to transport.
I’m going to go against the grain, but I would be uncomfortable if my partner went out in clothing like that. Personally, nips showing for me are a no go and it’s pretty clear there were some nips showing. It’s your body, you are 100% in your right to do *whatever* you want, but he’s also allowed to be uncomfortable with it. After 5 years together, I’d personally expect my opinion to matter a bit to my partner. I think you probably should decide if this is the hill to die on, and if it is, go forth, but I wouldn’t think wearing a shirt with no bra/undershirt or jacket or anything is worth making my partner feel as though you’re looking for other men’s attention. I think you’re NTA, but I get where he’s coming from. You clearly don’t need to be with a guy who is uncomfortable with clothing like that though, either. Ultimately may just be an incompatibility in your views.
INFO: do you actually have a choice? Because based on your description, you’re third in line, after your grandparents and your aunts, to get the land. Unfortunately, if this is the case, speak to a lawyer BEFORE responding, because legally, this might be the best you’re actually going to get. That doesn’t make it right, but you should get this info before deciding how to proceed, because if you don’t have leverage here legally, you’re going to need to proceed accordingly. It honestly sounds like your family is legally entitled to take 100% of your inheritance if they’re so inclined and you wouldn’t have any recourse. If you irk them, they may go this route.
I’m fairly certain she isn’t using an account with a $120 balance in it to provide the cash to close. Last I checked, you need *a lot* more than that to even get approved for a mortgage and so there’s obviously another account somewhere.
Again, I do not. You seem not to realize that Apple has embedded software in the photos app that *changes the video attributes* when you copy a file. This is exactly what was discussed by professionals and exactly why I said, unless it’s an original, the metadata is useless. Have a good day now.
Again, that is incorrect. Like I said, this was key information in a public trial last year where multiple professionals said copying a file does *not* save that *exact* information (date, time, location, etc) on iPhones. Unless a file is the original, the metadata isn’t usable. I’m not going to argue any further. I will take the expert’s opinion over a random redditor.
Looks super cute, but needs a fun belt or even a flannel tied around the waist. As it is, it’s missing something, but it definitely works.
I do, you’re referring to the date with which a video was physically taken, i.e the day that OP’s gf was having sex. If the video isn’t the original, which would track in her story, the metadata wouldn’t be in tact. Granted, I believe you can tell if the video is an original if you’re a forensic technician, but laymen are unable to tell what you’re trying to say the metadata will say. 

Copying a file alters the metadata. Simple as that. And like I said before, I’ll take a paid professional with a decade of experience and tons of lauded credentials saying this in a court of law over some rando on Reddit contradicting it.
This was a key point in a very public trial that involved forensic metadata experts, and these were the conclusions they all drew— if the files weren’t original, the metadata would not be intact. I’ll go with their expert opinion over yours, thanks.

ETA: this was JD v AH, where the fact that metadata *couldnt* be verified in copied files is what hurt her. On top of everything else, but that’s not relevant here.
I think you missed the point. Is she able to financially bring the same as you do in the relationship? Is she willing to have an even financial split? Or is she looking for someone to take care of her? What do you want? Do you want an equal partner or are you okay with being with someone who you need to care for?
What sources are you using? Because while it’s true that often these are compromises made in relationships at your age, they are by *no means* necessary to find a relationship, so long as and especially if you’re willing to wait until you find someone who feels the same way as you. In fact, you have a lot of the conclusions it takes people another decade or so to come to, so good for you realizing this so soon!

I will remind you that even with a healthy mindset, relationships can fail, but that doesn’t mean the relationships weren’t worth it or didn’t teach you anything, so while you should properly vet women before committing to them, try to loosen up on the ‘disgust’ because things not working out, being what you thought, and all of this is a big pet of growing up, and somewhere along the way, it’s likely that exactly what you want in a partner will change and evolve as a result of these experiences, and that’s a good thing. Growth and experience isn’t a bad thing, just remember that regardless of what happens, if you can learn something from it, it was worth it.
That’s only if the file is original, otherwise the metadata would show when the copy was created. Ultimately, he either trusts her or he doesn’t, and I would understand him not being able to trust her.
I’ve definitely had this happen, if all you’re referring to is the date it says when you click on the video. Sometimes it’s smart enough to know when the photo/video was actually created and other times it just is whatever the date I saved the video/photo.
Funny, because I expect it will go exactly as she expects. Sex work is a hard line for a lot of people. And he’s conservative, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out more likely than not, he’s not going to marry someone who was a sugar baby. It sucks, but 1. This is why it’s important to choose someone who have values compatible with you and your life. And 2. The sugar daddy has her number. It’s clear that he isn’t above searching her up. As soon as he realizes she’s married, it’ll come out. And it’s way better for her to get broken up with now, 2 years and no commitments in, rather than divorced in a few years when there’s a house marriage and kids on the line. 


We all make choices in life. As much as I believe people can change, sometimes those choices will always have consequences. But it’s better to be with someone who accepts everything about you rather than be with someone who you know would leave you if they knew the real you. Like you said, “I knew if I told you, you would have left,” shows just how selfish a person really is, and frankly, means they probably haven’t REALLY changed as much as they tell themselves.
If it helps, tell yourself you’re also going this for her. She needs to be able to sort out her relationship issues without you in the picture, and it’s clear that unfortunately you’re a stressor. 

And you get the added bonus of doing this for you too because no one deserves to be harassed or name called. And remember. This *isnt* your fault.
Okay, but stop explaining it and justifying it. This is what he’s going to do. He wants to live with his mom and he wants you, at 23 years old, to support his mom and him. Remember, easier to leave a momma’s boy than divorce one. He’s a momma’s boy. You aren’t going to change that. He isn’t ever going to pick you over her. This is the reality. Instead of wasting all of your energy justifying, explaining and defending what you know, spend your energy figuring out what you actually want to do. Is this a life you want? You’re on Reddit looking for advice, so clearly some part of you is fed up. I would be honest with yourself if you really think this dude is worth a lifetime of being second place. You got together at 15-17. I’ll let you in on a little secret— the guys you’ll find now, as a fully independent woman with the world at her feet, will be a million times better than the guy you found when limited to your math and English lit classroom. You’re in the prime of your life at the ideal age to find a way better partner, both on paper and in how he treats you. Know your worth.
For both of your sake, walk away now. You still love her, so maybe your relationship will heal, but if you keep letting her in your life, the friendship will sour even more than it has. Not only will your presence bring up some obviously repressed issues in their relationship, but the chances are someone is going to say something unrecoverable. Neither of them is ready to deal with the fact that dude isn’t straight. Take a step back. If you love her, let her sort her relationship, as you’re clearly putting strain on it. If you love yourself, take a step back, because you’ve been groped and harassed *repeatedly* and you don’t deserve that. You do not ever need to accept someone making you feel unsafe. I wish you luck, I hope she realizes how shitty she’s being, but do not stick around, as if you do, you’ll always be the scapegoat. I speak from experience, walking away is the best thing for everyone involved.
Keep in mind, (and I’m not defending her at all), she needs to come to terms with her boyfriend being predatory, unfaithful, and at least partially, a different orientation. She’s probably struggling with the reality of what she just witnessed actually means and thinks it’s easier to blame you than deal with things. 

This isn’t right. This isn’t your fault. You need to drop her, because this isn’t right, but maybe in the future, she’ll get her head out of her ass and apologize. Because every one of us, including her, knows that you’re telling the truth and you’re not making a mountain out of a molehill, she’s just hoping SHE can make a molehill out of a mountain, because she doesn’t want to accept her relationship is over. It’s up to you if you ever want to entertain a friendship ever again, no one blame you if you don’t, but it’s pretty clear she’s heavy in denial.
This is your life. You only have one. It is yours to do with as you please. If you want to stay, stay, if this is who you really want to spend your life with, that’s a choice you can make. But remember, no one else should have any say in your life because at the end of the day, YOU need to live your life, no one else. This guy cheated on you. Call a spade a spade. He lied to you, fucked other people, manipulated you and got others around you to manipulate you too. 

Stop saying ‘he technically did nothing wrong’. He did. He knows it, and you know it. If he didn’t do anything wrong, are you telling me lying isn’t wrong? Because he lied to you every day he told you you were the only one. It’s foolish to keep writing things off. If he’s still unwilling to say, “I lied. I knew what I was doing was wrong and I lied because I knew you’d leave otherwise” then there’s nothing to even save.
To be fair, OP seems to have things confused, it wouldn’t be her leaving if she crosses the boundary, it’ll be him leaving. It seems like he’s making baseless threats and she knows it. Hopefully OP is prepared to actually walk away. Otherwise, he’s setting himself up for a *very* dark future.
Well, actually plenty of nutritionists do advocate for intermittent fasting, so the idea that her skipping breakfast means she doesn’t understand balanced eating is also absurd. It’s actually a rather old take that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and now there’s a much better understanding that nutrition isn’t a one size fits all and what works for some might not work for others. 

That being said, yes, they cook together and she said she monitored the calories and was still gaining weight, given that she ruled out medical concerns, it would lend itself to ‘he may be doing something while you aren’t look’. Unfortunately, there have been a few posts of feeders who have purposefully made special condiments with huge amounts of calories to stealthily add to their partner’s meals. Not saying I *really* think that’s what’s happening here, but I am saying I don’t think OP has all the info here.
While I understand what you’re saying, she DID minutely track her calories, so she clearly does understand just how many calories are in what she’s eating, as nowadays people use an app where you just look up the item and amount. And even while tracking, she wasn’t losing weight, which would indicate he may have been doing something to her food while she wasn’t looking.
Arranged marriages across continents is just plain risky. I understand your faith/culture, but speak to a match maker or at the very least, limit yourself to people you can actually meet in real life. 

The nature of an arranged/accelerated marriage like you’re discussing is going to lead to people ditching you as soon as they think they may have a chance at an even slightly better prospect, which realistically, that’s my guess what happened.
That’s probably unlikely to be an option. He has no leverage, his dad can pretty easily say, “marry her before you start the next year or I won’t pay tuition”.
Do so with the primary goal of “you aren’t giving up your children and you aren’t allowing them to move anywhere far away”. I assume that especially being well off, half a house and half your savings account isn’t worth losing your 4 kids, right? Because ultimately, she’s never getting child support if she has more money and you have your kids half the time, so telling you she won’t ask for child support is just emotional manipulation at that point, because it wouldn’t be something she would get anyway, as you DONT want her to have primary/full custody.
Just a heads up, there are a lot of people who actually stay with someone they know will be vindictive if they break up *because* they’re afraid, in the back of their head, of facing the vindictive ex and figure it’s easier to deal with whatever the relationship brings.
Yes, but she specifically said she was looking forward to them cooking together more often, not him cooking for her, so you’d generally think that that means she can see what he’s doing and if she’s an athlete she would understand that “shit ton of butter means shit ton of calories”.

I totally understand most people don’t understand how many calories are in fats like butter, but I would expect more from someone who says she eats healthy and is an athlete of a decade.
Well, elaborate on the conversation. Be blunt, “we met when I was getting out of a sexless marriage. I’m afraid this is a sign our marriage is taking the same direction. I hope I’m wrong, but as my husband, its both of our responsibility to discuss this as a couple. If you’re stressed, we need to work on things together, because I am not prepared to stay in a relationship where excuses run rampant and I feel tossed to the side. I’m happy to work with you, but this is something we actually need to talk about.”
You two weren’t married. He didn’t commit to stay through thick and thin. You both committed some acts that would warrant the other ending the relationship. Name calling is a pretty fast relationship killer, and you  said you have a pattern of name-calling. Now, that isn’t to say he was an amazing partner, he also wasn’t, but just because you stayed in a shitty relationship doesn’t mean he is under any obligation to. I think people get this twisted idea of “if I stay when you suck, you need to stay when i suck,” but no. Putting up with bullshit doesn’t buy you the ability to also act like that. 

You two clearly never had a fantastic foundation for a relationship and that might be because the two of you don’t mesh well, or it might be because that’s just how he treats the woman he’s with. Either way, as much as it hurts, be thankful, because this wasn’t the right guy for you, and it’s pretty obvious you weren’t going to end it. He bit the bullet for you both and did what everyone else can see was the right call. It sounds like he honestly never liked you very much and you always put up with less than you wanted because you thought you could convince him to change for you. Heads up, if you tie your self worth into being able to convince shitty men to treat you better ‘because you’re worth it’, you’ll always be disappointed. Get your own therapist, learn to love yourself outside of how a man treats you, and then reflect on what you want in a relationship and find someone who is *naturally* like that. As soon as you need to *convince* someone you’re worth being treated well, THEY aren’t worth your time.
There are definitely other issues going on here. You sound like you may have some body image issues and he may sound like he’s doing something to your food. I would recommend you proceed with caution, because while I don’t want to tell you what’s going on, I get a weird feeling you are missing something here. Both of your reactions just feel…. Off.
You probably need to just send a message saying, “It’s pretty clear you either don’t want or aren’t ready for a relationship with me anymore, so I just wanted to make sure we’re both on the same page this is over and I wish you the best.”
Yeah, personally I’d make it ‘whenever the lease it up’.
Oh 100% agree. I said elsewhere, if them growing apart wasn’t enough to ruin the marriage, his actions and behavior surely will.
That information isn’t included in the post, so we can’t really tell. Maybe there is and maybe there isn’t. Perhaps she has other views where she believes tattoos are unclean, or against her faith or she just doesn’t like the look of them. Perhaps her OCD would manifest in another way where having a mark on her may trigger her in other ways. Perhaps she’s afraid of needles or has a clotting disorder or a million other things that we can’t know, but presumably all her loved ones would know. I’m not saying that any of this is the case, but I’m just posing scenarios where it would be legitimate to intervene in someone making a decision fueled by mental illness, that wouldn’t necessarily be included in a Reddit post. 

All this to say, sometimes if everyone with first hand knowledge of a situation, including a medical professional, is in agreement, there’s a chance that they have more informations than we do. I’ll say this, if *I* were going to make a permanent decision I usually wouldn’t make and my loved ones knew that and knew I was going through a mental health crisis, I would want them to intervene. Everyone else can feel differently, but I would personally rather not make a permanent mistake if someone around me could stop that.
Usually 1 of 2 things. Either the person knows you’re not right for them deep down but is also afraid to be alone or “hurt you”, but once forced to be alone, actually finds “the one” and immediately realizes they’ve found what was missing all this time prompting them to take the plunge they always dragged their feet on before. Or, sometimes, you have to learn the hard way. It isn’t that the person loved you any less or didn’t genuinely want to be with you, it’s just that they really thought they had time. They didn’t really see what the big deal was, and figured you agree that as long as it happens ‘eventually’ it’s all good. But as soon as they’re reminded that ‘love’ isn’t enough and actually women are willing to leave without that commitment, as soon as they find someone they feel that same way about, they don’t want to lose it again, so they act fast.
I don’t necessarily disagree, but her therapist is presumably more educated than you about mental illness and OCD and advised her against getting the tattoo because she clearly felt there was ample evidence of it being fueled by the OCD. To some extent, if it WASNT fueled by OCD, it wouldn’t make a difference if she got it on her 5th, 6th, or any other memorable date. It would really just matter that she’s permanently honouring her mother.

This is a classic case of commenters assuming that the poster has just as much information as they do, rather than having WAY more information, including the opinion of a medical professional specifically trained and informed of OP’s gf’s mental health and her current state of mind.
Lmao what the fuck? You’re not immature for just *wanting* to get married. That’s absurd.
You know what’s even more of a special kind of stupid? Thinking that your boyfriend who makes the same as you and has more assets than you actually would be with you for your money. It’s pretty obviously a joke, and the fact that she can’t realize SHE is the one with less money in the relationship so obviously he isn’t with her for money, just goes to show that she isn’t ready for a serious relationship yet.
Well, most notably, “she thinks I’m with her for her money” and then “we make the same as one another and I have more assets than she does”. Like fam, this is NOT a woman to start a life with. You have kids. You need someone stable and trustworthy, not a woman looking to bail any time you make a joke, a joke, that anyone smart enough to be a fucking doctor should realize is a joke. You literally have more money than her.
You can emigrate to another country then, as it seems yours doesn’t really care about people’s actual happiness. Either that, or be unhappy. It seems like you get the choice of being unhappy and rich or unhappy and poor.
It doesn’t matter. I hate people who act like someone needs to justify why they want something. She’s allowed to just want to be married. She doesn’t need to explain it. No one needs to explain why they want kids or get married or have a monogamous relationship. You’re allowed to just want that. And you’re allowed to end an otherwise great relationship with someone who doesn’t.
I understand, I hope you don’t think I was implying you would cheat, but understand insecurity is a hell of a thing. That being said, your weight is definitely not the only thing different about you. You said yourself, you’ve made a lot of big changes in the past few years. It’s disingenuous to act like the only change is your weight. Not only will that many changes come with a natural shift in your personality, you also said you two no longer have a big thing in common, your love for games, and more likely than not, if you’re gymming that much, the way you spend your free time has also changed significantly. Perhaps you no longer enjoy the same foods or restaurants you once did (you would almost need to, or else you wouldn’t have lost so much weight), maybe you like to go hiking whereas before you two would watch a movie instead. I get it’s hard for you to see how much you changed, because to you, you’re still “you”, but as someone who has had their partner undertake huge changes like you’re describing, I can promise you, it’s WAY more than just your weight. You’re practically a new person, and that can be scary for him, and he also may not feel like you two are on the same page anymore. 

Like I said in a previous comment, just because you think everything is fine and you don’t care about how different you two are now, doesn’t mean HE doesn’t care. And based on everything you’re saying, it’s clear he cares.
Time to put on your big girl pants and say the scary thing, “I know you haven’t given it much thought, but after 4 years, you need to start. I’m not willing to wait as long as you’re saying you want before marriage is even on the table to discuss. You need to think long and hard NOW about if you want to marry me, because the option isn’t going to be on the table forever, and it’s not even going to be on the table for another year. I’m sorry to put you in a difficult spot, but this is a dealbreaker for me. If four years isn’t enough time for you to be sure, then no amount of time will be, and I’m not willing to wait any longer to find that out. I love you, and I want us to be together, but I love me more. I know what I want in life and I won’t be a girlfriend for a decade. It’s just not something I have any interest in.”
The thing is you don’t need to know the details of their relationship. Not everyone wants to be a girlfriend for 6-7+ years. It’s the same thing as one person wanting kids and another not. Even if the rest of the relationship is everything you ever hoped you’d find, this is a deal breaker.

And that’s before factoring in there’s no way to know if he really will ever marry her or is just kicking the can down the road, like so many men do, and why so many women are not willing to be a girlfriend for 6-7+ years.
Yeah. I mean I think it’s easy for us to sit from our chair and tell OP to leave, but I agree. If she wants to feel like she gave him a chance, she needs to be brutally honest with him too, “that timeline doesn’t work for me. If you don’t see yourself getting engaged or married for a few years. We need to part ways. I want a relationship that is working towards marriage and if after 4 years, that isn’t a step you’re willing to take with me yet, I’m not willing to wait until you are. You need to think about if this is really how you feel, because if so, we need to be having a very different conversation.”
I honestly think everyone acting like he took advantage of her is making too big of an assumption. More likely than not, he got someone who he felt comfortable with, and now is afraid that she’s gotten hot and successful and will want to ‘upgrade’ her partner. It’s pretty common, from both men AND women and isn’t as malicious or intentional as people think. It’s just that some people aren’t able to handle jealousy and insecurity and purposefully choose a partner that doesn’t flare that insecurity, and aren’t prepared for such a huge shake up. 

That, combined with “I stayed by my partner when they were fat/poor/no body/etc. and then they became hot/rich/famous etc and the first thing they did was leave me for someone they met at the gym/work/wherever” is way more common than people want to admit. Do I think that’s OP? No, not at all. But it’s silly to pretend that exactly what this guy is afraid of isn’t something that happens all the time. It happens so often that it’s a running troupe of people in professions like doctors, lawyers, tech, and professional sports.
I think you are being naive, yes. Because the reality is, he’s making these comments because you’ve already grown apart. For you, maybe you don’t care. But for him, it seems he cares. He wants a woman who shares the same hobbies with him, who is lower maintenance and doesn’t care about how she looks or making a ton of money. I’m not saying this to criticize you, strong independent women are amazing and we need more of them in this world, but not everyone wants a gym rat “girl boss” TM. Some people want a ‘cozy gamer’. And that isn’t you anymore. And that’s okay, but it’s naive to act like if you think it’s fine, so does he. And clearly, he doesn’t think it’s fine. He clearly feels like he’s already lost the woman he fell in love with. Do not change for him, please. You should always be who you feel most comfortable being, but you also may need to come to terms with the fact that you’ve begun to walk different paths that no longer cross.
Maybe don’t focus too much on him wanting someone to control, because that might not really be true. More likely, he thought had a sweet, chubby, introverted gamer girl he wasn’t worried about losing and now you’re independent, making more money than him, you’ve gotten hot and probably have more male attention from dudes who never would’ve looked at you before, and let’s be real, you’ve become an entirely different person than you were when you met. He likely feels like he can’t compete with the sort of guys you can get now. 

How he’s handling it isn’t cool, and it’s controlling, but it’s also probably coming from a place of fear and desperation/panic, that he’s about to lose you. The sad thing is, if the fact that you two are now completely different people wasn’t going to ruin your relationship, how he’s acting now certainly will. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, but also, the reality is, you grew up and he didn’t. And that’s okay, but you two don’t seem to be compatible anymore.
Honestly I thought it was him making fun of how everyone in the sub jumps to insane conclusions…. Boy was I wrong.
If it makes you feel better, it wasn’t you who self-sabotaged your marriage. It’s pretty clear that something was very wrong in your marriage long before you ever said that. As a happily married and monogamous man doesn’t voraciously message everyone he knows looking for a hookup the second his wife indicates she *might* be okay with it. A respectful husband doesn’t ignore his wife communicating she ISNT okay with it. There were issues in your marriage that perhaps you were aware of or more likely weren’t prepared to actually face, but the marriage was over a LONG time before you ever brought up another woman. Forgive yourself, but also recognize you can’t keep pretending this marriage is functional. It isn’t now, and it wasn’t before. End it and set yourself free.

Lmao of course we’re not 100% accurate, but you said it yourself, he was jerking you around. Why do you suddenly think that’s going to change? 

I’ve read your other comments, you’re either looking for a fight because you’re upset this dude is ghosting, or you’re a troll, because you haven’t responded to a single comment genuinely looking for an objective viewpoint. You’re just trying to argue, which just makes me think if you’re actually a real person really going through this? Dude has probably realized 10 year younger tang isn’t worth crazy. If you’re a real person, just recognize how batshit you must come off in real life, if after 4 comments on the internet pretty much any man on here would be running from you. Good luck. I do hope you’re a troll, because otherwise you’re in for a very sad life if you don’t grow up, and fast.
Yeah, you don’t respect yourself, why wouldn’t he beg you to move in? You demand nothing of him, let him do whatever he wants, never ask for more and here you are, left alone at home, while he goes and hangs out with the family who degrades you, that he apparently doesn’t even care enough about you to *talk* about you in front of them, and you still want to plan elaborate and thoughtful birthday celebrations and get him a cake. It makes total sense why a person like him would *drool* over finding a woman who can’t even demand she be a part of his birthday celebration. You think he would actually want a woman who calls him out on his shit? Of course not!

Be honest with yourself, how much more do you let him get away with?
Elaborate what you mean? And what you got mad about? 

Overall, he may not have been ignoring you then, but you also probably never said “I’m done” either, so it may be a bit different this time.
He read it because leaving someone on read sends a pretty clear message of “I saw what you said, I want you to know that I saw what you said and I want you to know that I am intentionally choosing not to reply to you”. 

In short, he isn’t interested. Why did you get mad at him? Perhaps you were right and this guy isn’t right for you, so all in all, it’s probably a win for you both. I’m the future, just be a bit more careful when you tell someone you’re done. If you aren’t prepared to mean it, it’s probably not a great idea to say it. Rarely do people play well into that sort of hot and cold.
Maybe you’ve learned some valuable lessons. Don’t start things with roommates, and if this is a trend, maybe you’re moving too fast in your relationships and progressing too intensely with the wrong sort of guy. You’ll heal, but it’ll take time. Don’t worry about breaking down. You’re human, and that’s a beautiful thing. You aren’t meant to be a robot.
Well, just remember, there is no waiting it out. Nothing will ever change until you do. If you’d realized this 4-5 years ago, you could’ve been married and successful by now. But don’t fret, the second best time to make a change is now. And thankfully, you still have time for that.

Stop being complacent in your own life. You have a choice here. Don’t forget you do have power in your own life. You aren’t helpless.
But remember, that is a choice you are *actively* making. You can just as easily and quickly *stop* being a doormat. As much as you don’t want to say anything “because you’re scared, and it’ll hurt” or whatever other bullshit you keep telling yourself, if you really asked yourself, are you not already alone in your own marriage? Are you not causing yourself pain every day knowing your wife wants another man’s affection, wondering if/when she’ll cheat on you too?

People often overlook the chronic pain they invite upon themselves because they think an acute pain will be worse, but trust me, it isn’t. I’d rather have a broken arm that will heal than deal with lupus every day until I die.
Good. You’ve spent the past decade gaslighting yourself into ignoring or brushing off hundreds of red flags. Second guess everything and see your life and your marriage for what it really is, not what you want it to be. That way, you can start to see just how much better you deserve, and how much better you can get. Stop allowing yourself to be the backup.
I mean, really the only think you can be sure of is you’re being a doormat and of course your wife isn’t going to respect you, you don’t even respect yourself. You’re worth more than this man. You have to know that.
How can you lose something you never actually had?

She never actually picked you, she just did enough to fool you into thinking she had. I don’t even see my actual friends from college as much as you seem to have this guy in your lives, that’s a bit weird, don’t you think?
Here’s to hoping he just doesn’t care. As much as some do care, the vast majority really don’t. Enjoy your newfound freedom!
Well, because it’s decently obvious by the “let’s just figure things out as housemates rather than as a couple” that he sees it as a relationship-breaker because she’s basically said as much? How else would you take that comment?
That…. Is not what the joke implies. Not even close.
I’m going to be honest. Everyone in this story is a few years too old to be making such shitty decisions. ESH, because at the end of the day, who you’re friends with also reflects on you, and it’s pretty abysmal that even after all this, YOU weren’t the one to pull the plug here on the friendship, she was. 

Having fun and partying is great and all, but it’s practically asking for some dark shit to befall one of you by inviting multiple complete strangers into your hotel room in the middle of the night from the sidewalk in Manhattan during a huge holiday. If this is commonplace for you or your friends, and based on your tone, it appears to be, you need to *really* self-reflect and see if this is where you think you should be at 25 years old.
No, I just don’t feel the need to engage with victim blamers.
Lmao so if you think the wife is abusive it’s cool to just blame the victim (the father) of her abuse? Got it. Yeah, bye now.
I’d probably only ever see yelling as appropriate if someone is in actual danger or about to do something really destructive and you need to get their attention NOW. I can also see people yelling at one another if extremely angry/fed up about a lot of issues in their relationship that they’re just at the end of their rope for, but in that example, I’d probably say that either the person yelling has issues themselves OR the person yelling is only doing so because they don’t love themselves enough to walk away and instead think yelling will get through to an otherwise toxic partner. 


I’ll go out on a limb and say your partner has anger issues though, but regardless of if you or he is the problem (and it’s him, it isn’t you), this isn’t a healthy relationship.
Fiancée, thankfully. She won’t need to worry about a divorce, all she needs to do is separate finances and figure things out like housemates instead of a couple, which, conveniently is exactly what she’s doing, and I’m sure we can all guess exactly why.
I think the point is unless you think he should be abusive, he ultimately isn’t in a position to “allow” his wife to do anything, his wife is going to do what his wife is going to do, she’s her own person. Just like OP is his own person and he can’t force him to return home or forgive his sister. See the issue? You’re acting as though the father can just snap his fingers and force everyone to fall in line to his will, but that’s not how people work. His wife and the other kids are all independent people capable of their own decisions and actions. They’ll act as they see fit and it’s up to the people around them to react how they see fit. The only very loose way to “not allow his wife to treat OP that way” would be by saying if she keeps it up, he’s divorcing her. 

And now we’re back to the beginning sentiment, “it’s unfair and unrealistic to expect this man to throw away his marriage and his relationship with his two other kids, who actually live close to him, to support OP’s beliefs, who not only isn’t cutting off his father, but also lives across the country anyway.”
Idk. If I were you I’d probably just say, “I know why you beat up _____. Thank you. But please don’t do it again, I don’t want assholes like that to ever take anything else from me again.” And then just give him a big hug.
Hey, I agree, fully. I’m just saying when it comes to the father, I understand why he isn’t taking such a hard and fast approach. Now, I think cheaters and wrong and I think the mom isn’t handling things well at all, but those two things are a bit unrelated.
His mom told him that, not his father. I agree the mom sucks for how she’s acting, I’m just saying, it makes sense that the dude isn’t going to ruin his marriage and relationship with all his other kids when 1. OP isn’t cutting him off and 2. OP is across the country, everyone else is right there. Real life is more complicated than Reddit acts.
You should be able to get someone to do it for $500-1k at most.
Where do you see the dad putting himself in the middle by doing anything other than existing? Again, this is *his daughter*. It’s ridiculous to expect him to throw away his marriage and his relationship with all of his other kids because you think that it’s not completely normal for parents to be way more forgiving than you would be to their own *child’s* mistakes. 

I repeat. The world is NOT as black and white as you seem to think it is, and we do NOT have all the information here to know any of the details of why everyone feels how they feel on this matter.
She insinuated she does want kids, so not sure why either of those should factor in. If she wants kids, it’s better to be with someone with a child than someone with undiagnosed and seemingly severe mental illness.
Eh. I don’t really think it’s fair to expect people to entirely blow up their marriage and their relationship with the rest of their kids to support the beliefs of someone else. Yeah, I think cheaters suck. But that’s also his daughter. It makes sense that even when your kid messes up, you aren’t going to immediately exile them. The world isn’t as black and white as Reddit acts like it is.
It really isn’t. I’ve found partners at many ages. You probably just aren’t looking in an effective place
Instead of relying on apps, join classes or workout groups with interests you have so you meet someone naturally
I mean, it’s not actually that hard. You’re just being defeatist because it scares you to be alone for a year or so, but that’s perfectly normal. Be you 25 35 or 45. It takes time to find a good partner.
Honestly? The mom of whoever called overstepped. I’d get it if a day had passed, but that’s really overkill for an adult woman a few hours with no contact.
Just be prepared for your dad to turn the invite down. He’s right, you’re putting him in a no-win situation and more likely than not, he’s going to avoid pissing off his wife and kids that live close to him. You’re far away, it’s way less hassle to turn you down than pick a fight with everyone near by. I just want to prepare you for the most likely outcome.
You should probably speak to a lawyer familiar with this. You should start by getting a survey of your land so you know exactly what is “yours” and what isn’t. Get up property line markers. It shouldn’t cost more than $1k for the surveyor and marking everything out with physical markers. You’re going to need a lawyer to know how to best indicate anyone past “this” point is officially trespassing, because like everyone said, you’re taking on a huge liability and also putting yourself in a position where your land could be seized by the local government as you’ve allowed public access. I know you’re very pregnant, but this needs to take priority, because the last thing you want is to be recovering from birth and trying to figure out how to be a mom and then you’re getting sued because someone on an ATV died hitting a low hanging branch and the parents blame you for not trimming the trees. Or a million other examples, that have actually happened and the property owners WERE held liable for. Your husband can hopefully take on some of the burden of sorting this, as it will likely be a good amount of logistical sorting, but it’ll be cheaper in the long run, especially if this is meant to be your forever home. Put up signs at the entry points for now, take photos and get a lawyer ASAP.
I’m just going to pop in here to remind everyone that a person with PPP has an approximately 4-5% chance of either committing infanticide or suicide. Yes, there is an elevated risk, and yes, these women absolutely need professional help, do not treat women with this condition as ticking time bombs, though.
You were in a previously abusive relationship so you think as long as he isn’t abusive, he’s great. But that’s not true. You may need some therapy to reset what you should want in a man, because this isn’t it. 

‘Not abusive’ isn’t even the bare minimum of being a half decent guy, and it seems like that’s really all you have as your standard right now. Understandable, but love yourself more than that. Aim higher. Stop going for dudes with no ambition.
Hey. Women can have big feet too.
Because if you’re in an accident where enough force/friction is generated to pull off your shoes, it’s just statistically more likely that that same force was lethal.
If you don’t leave, just tell him, “you need to be more careful. If this happens again, I’m breaking up with you. Immediately. I do not give a shit if it’s an accident or not. If you’re so incapable of controlling your d*ckk you can’t keep it from sodomizing me, I have 0 interest continuing our relationship. Am I crystal clear?”

And if it happens again, then you leave.
All that matters is it makes you feel good!
I don’t think dresses like this look good on anyone, personally. It’s too shapeless and is reminiscent of a trash bag to me. But, fashion should always be more about how you feel than what others think, imo.
You’re never an AH for fighting for your kids. Never. The sooner you learn that, the better a father you’ll be.
Just for some actual facts, as worms aren’t something parents tend to discuss at daycare… 20-30% of preschool/primary school aged children will have a threadworm infection. So, definitely common enough that it isn’t a surefire sign of neglect, but not so common that the parents shouldn’t be taking steps to prevent.
Because it’s not *him* forbidding her access to basic hygiene. It’s just nature of *being a parent to a newborn*. You’d have to make the argument an infant is the abusive one as that’s who is technically preventing the SIL from showering regularly, which is entirely ridiculous as a concept. Until you actually have a kid, you clearly are ignorant to the fact that even two present and active parents will often not have time to shower for 2 days. It isn’t the husband directly saying “I forbid you from showering” which yeah, is abusive. It’s “I have a newborn and my husband isnt being a present dad and I don’t want to leave my kid alone or take him in the shower with me”. They’re fundamentally different. I’m not going to argue with someone who has clearly never had a newborn or had the lowest maintenance newborn ever to know that it’s just plain *normal and expected* that when you have a newborn, you just plain aren’t going to shower every day. Hell, I don’t have a newborn and I’m so busy with normal adulting tasks that I have often gone 2 days without a shower. No one is abusing me. It’s just ridiculous to conflate “I don’t have time to do X” with “someone is FORCING ME not to do X”. So yeah, even by your definition, this IS NOT ABUSE. 

I am not going to argue about this further, because it’s clear you don’t understand how common it is to be too busy to shower every day when you have a newborn. It’s not a sign of abuse. It’s just a sign of being a parent.
You probably need to stop considering him your husband. He said pretty clearly he no longer views you as a wife, you’re just the woman who gave birth to his kid. You need to understand you have absolutely no leverage here and your husband hasn’t divorced you yet simply because it would put his daughter through more trauma than she needs right now, but you aren’t an equal partner. You’re on probation and if you don’t start acting like it, don’t be surprised if he realizes you’re trying to traumatize your daughter more by forcing her to be a puppet than he will traumatize her by putting her through a messy custody battle.
OP, nicely, but understand what your husband is really saying. He’s saying this: “if you ever want to see your daughter, you’re going to do everything exactly on my terms, otherwise I WILL go through a court battle to completely strip you of the right to see your daughter. I don’t want to, but if you force me to, I will.”  Know you’re place, and right now, your place is egg donor, not mother. You need to EARN the right to call yourself her mom.
Sure, but none of that is abuse. That’s just ‘not meeting your needs as a partner’. That isn’t abuse. Again, that’s “being a bad partner”. The two are VERY different and a lot of people conflate the two. Bad partner? Yes. Bad dad? Probably. Abusive? Nothing here indicates that.
He was working. Regardless of the rest, it isn’t abusive to tell your partner to take a screaming infant and guest out of the room you’re working in. Look, I agree he’s a crappy father/partner, but the bottom line is nothing here is *actually* abuse. It’s just being a shitty partner. 

He isn’t keeping her unwashed or sleep deprived. Being a new, borderline single mom is what’s keeping her unwashed and sleep deprived. And for those who don’t understand how parenthood works— even two fully attentive parents will likely end up unwashed and sleep deprived in the first year of parenthood. It’s just what happens. It’s not abuse, it’s not neglect. It’s what you sign up for when you have a kid. Yeah, she’s doing more than she should, but that’s different from abuse.
Neglecting the child, yes. Neglecting the needs of your partner, especially while you’re working like the guy was in this story? No. You’re just a poor partner, at worst. Believe it or not, she’s a fully grown adult and capable of taking care of herself and isn’t fully reliant on a man like an infant may be for care. Abuse is definitely the wrong word here, with the information presented. Please stop pushing for such a strong word to be watered down. That only hurts actual abuse victims in the long run. Again, not all “bad” partners are “abusive” partners. He’s a bad partner, no info indicating he’s an abusive one.
Did I miss anything actually funny happening? Looks like he just walked by them carefully.
She’s 23. She’s dating a 37 year old. How reliable do you *really* think *either* of them are going to be at caring for 2 young kids? She’s going to be stuck in the hotel room earning her free vacation. There isn’t much other reason 37 year olds date 23 year olds. And they certainly don’t do it because said 23 year old is ‘practically a mom” whatever the fuck that means.
No…. It isn’t weird at all. Have you ever had a newborn? Sometimes you’re so desperate for adult interaction you’ll hold up the mailman. That’s not a sign of abuse, that’s a sign of parenthood. Especially parenthood with a rather absent partner.
At the end of the day, that was his decision not to actually pursue any means of getting the money back. If he/your step sis we’re unwilling to even *try* to get the money back from the actual person who stole it, they’ve pretty much lost the right to even *ask* anyone else to provide it.
I think jumping to ‘clearly an abuser’ because he’s a bad partner is a stretch. He’s a bad partner and bad father, for sure. But this is another example of “bad person =/= *abusive* person*
Hey, also depends on the kind of partner you’re trying to attract too.
Hopefully this has revealed to you a truth about your husband you’ll stop ignoring, as based on your previous comments, this behavior/side of him is nothing new. What example are you setting for your son by tolerating this behavior?
You probably need to think about the grander scheme of your marriage when you find a place to stay, because this doesn’t sound like a good place for you at all.
Understood is in quotes, so OP clearly doesn’t actually feel like he understands. You can say you understand and still not actually take the action required to back that up. The likely fact is in order to change the agreement, his dad may need to go to court, and his mom may not let him go so easily. If his dad isn’t willing to deal with that/simply isn’t willing to be OP’s full time guardian, understanding or not, OP is 14 years old and really doesn’t have much of a choice on where he lives.

Which sucks, but he’s 14. He can’t just “move out”.
Is that actually an option though? OP’s father called him selfish, so perhaps he won’t let him move in full time. Not only that, it may require a custody battle for that to actually happen, if the mom wanted to put up a fight about it.
If you do consider her a friend, I’d send in a text message so you have this in writing if she goes off the deep end something you the effect of, “hey (name), I’m sorry I made you feel worse in an already tough time for you. I’m happy to help you out, but I need to be clear about a few things, I have no interest in you romantically or sexually, I consider you a friend and nothing more. I want to be really clear that you don’t have to worry about my having any ulterior motives because that simply isn’t how I see you and I’m not comfortable with you implying otherwise while you’re living at my place. That being said, while I’m happy to give you a place to crash while you get back on your feet, I am also not comfortable fully supporting you. You’ll need to take care of food and anything else you need on your own. If you haven’t been paid in 5 weeks, that’s illegal and you need to talk your boss or file a complaint, but I’m sure I’m not the only person in your support network so if you need to, you’ll need to lean on more than just me. I’ve been busy lately, so I’m going to continue taking advantage of part of my compensation at work, since the food is better than anything I can cook, but you’re more than welcome to stock the fridge with whatever you want and I won’t take any of it. If you feel uncomfortable staying with me for whatever reason, please don’t feel obligated and be upset if you want to stay with someone else, but if you do plan to stay, moving forward we need to be clear on boundaries— I don’t want any implications I’m trying to get with you and you need to start providing the basics for yourself. I’m only here to give you a place to stay, nothing more.”
Fam. Stop resenting him and start resenting yourself because you’re the problem here. You ten respecting yourself at all. This man has no loyalty to you. Stop spending time on someone who has told you he isn’t loyal.
I’m pretty sure he meant you don’t get paid every day, not that you don’t get paid when the company tells you.
Hey, ultimately that might be what ends up happening! But I think people sometimes underestimate how difficult it is to connect with ‘that one person’ who fits all the criteria, especially as a 32 year old new father. If he doesn’t even have time to hang out with existing friends alone, it’s pretty unlikely he will have time to find and vet random people who are okay with hanging out with a baby, especially because, unfortunately, there is a higher chance of someone (any gender) biting at the gambit to hang out with a man with an infant potentially being not suitable to have around said infant. 

We like to say that you should wait around and not take shit and only surround yourselves with the people who are perfectly suited for you, but if that’s your attitude, you also need to be prepared to simply end up alone. Which when you’re a new dad, newly in your 30s (which is definitely a shock for plenty of people, myself included, it sucked no longer being in your 20s and “old”) and lost touch with a lot of old friends, being alone can be *really* isolating and isn’t actually as healthy advice as you think. 

TL;DR— yes, the advice of ‘find friends who are okay with being a dad’ is great. But it fails to consider just how hard that process often is when you’re a brand new dad.
I am assuming $500 is a LOT less than a hotel wouldve cost for the time you stayed. 

In light of that, I’d probably say something to the effect of, “The full day sounds awesome! I am really sorry, but right now I only have enough room in our savings for the half day, that’s my fault for not specifying. I’m hoping we get a second income source within the next few months (or else we’re really going to need to figure out some different moves) and if you’re willing to wait for our thanks until we have a steady income I’d be happy to set up the full day but otherwise, if you do want the full day and are willing to pay the difference I can send over a gift card for the amount and let you decide if you would like to upgrade! Just let me know, I’m really thankful you let us stay with you and want to make sure you know how grateful I am.”
A completely normal and healthy one lmao. Believe it or not, it’s an extremely unhealthy mentality to have that close family should leave each other high and dry for what amounts to no really good reason. Reddit is actually pretty toxic in the other direction with “family owes you NOTHING and expect to do everything 100% on your own or else you’re a toxic failure”. We have family for a reason, and quite frankly? It’s an extremely Eurocentric view that many cultures would have a serious issue with. Family helps family, family shows up for family, and honestly? Outside of Reddit/extenuating circumstances, if your family can’t rely on you to follow through, that says more about you than your family. 

Again, if this were an issue, should’ve been raised when he was asked to be the best man. The brother is going to be close enough where if anything happens, he’ll just be able to leave, it’s a local wedding. He leaves them alone for work, he can leave them alone to be the best man he agreed to.
Yeah, you generally speaking do get to expect your brother who agreed to be your best man at your child free wedding follows through. He absolutely can decide not to, but the brother is the asshole, not OP. It’s fine to not expect family to bend over backwards and set themselves on fire to keep you warm, but Reddit has gone way too far in the opposite direction. Family does owe family some grace, especially if no abuse, or other factors are at play. These are normal siblings. The brother would 10000% be an asshole for dropping out because he can’t be away from his wife and kid for half a day, especially when *he agreed knowing it was a child free wedding and likely knowing the intimate details of WHY it’s childfree*.
Most OG influencers actually worked as well. You can be serious about something and still understand you also can’t leech off other people. I mean hell, Johnny Depp only became an actor because he wanted to finance his music career.
He’s OP’s best man. Presumably he was aware of the no child wedding for a long time. He would absolutely be an AH to back out of a commitment made understanding the rules of the commitment just because he’s being held to those rules. Not only would he be an AH to OP, he’s also be being an AH to his kid, as our society is by and large moving away from tolerating overgrown toddlers and momma’s boys.
Correct, but as I said, look at things from *Kate’s* perspective. How would she know that Jamie wanted OP there so he could propose? She couldn’t. All she saw was Jamie begging for OP to attend his birthday party, and with all the other info she had, that’s definitely going to breed insecurity in most people. Jealousy is a human emotion, and as much as it would be nice to tell her to get over it, I see why she felt the way she did.
I mean….. not really? Look at literally every female celebrity ever. They were hot before and they’re hot now… honestly I’d argue most looked better without the surgery. Its definitely not accurate to say ‘hotter’ more likely it’s just ‘different’. It’s all about self perception sometimes. 

And yeah, but also, if she looked how she did but was a horrid person, she wouldn’t be with him either, so it isn’t just looks. Attraction is important, but it’s not everything. I’m sure she knows that. It’s different if she thought that’s the only reason her husband is with her of course.
Before you dig yourself into too deep of a hole, she said she’s struggled with this even as a teen, meaning the surgery isn’t what made her “the hot one”. She always was, she just had surgery to make herself feel better about how she looked, but clearly she’s always been beautiful to everyone around her even without the surgery. And that, friends, is body dysmorphia in a nutshell.
It probably doesn’t help that Jamie and OP DO have so much more than just him finding her attractive. They’re really good friends, to the point where he was begging OP to rearrange her schedule to be at the party. I’m not saying he’s in love with her, at all, but from the perspective of Kate, I understand where the insecurities lie. You can’t just write it off as physical attraction in the moment and nothing more, they have an emotional bond as well. Now, I know well enough that you can be friends with someone and not want to marry them, but putting yourself in Kate’s shoes it can be hard to say that confidently. I feel for OP though, it sucks to lose friends for something you can’t control.
Fair enough. You date enough people, unfortunately you’ll encounter plenty of toxic ones. Definitely do not make this right though, she either needs to come to her senses (which I suspect she will at some point, especially if you don’t chase after her) or she won’t, in which case you can decide if that’s really the sort of trait you want in a partner. Good luck! You did nothing wrong though, btw. Never lend money you aren’t willing to lose.
Nah, 24 is definitely an age where it’s fair to expect a person be mature and responsibly by. She’s been out of college for 2-3 years at this point. She isn’t a freshman in college. That’s definitely not normal behavior even for a 24 year old.
That isn’t really true. Plenty of people are willing to bail their partners out. Now, are they obligated to? No, but don’t imply that asking your partner for any financial help automatically is unhealthy.
Yeah, and a reminder of “your friends should understand if you can’t contribute $1k dinners. You’re an awesome person, and a true friend will be happy to have your company, and whatever it is you can contribute that’s in your budget”. I had a lot of friends way wealthier than me at that age. There was never an expectation I had to ‘keep up’.
Well, dresses, makeup, the bachelorette party, spa day, there’s lots of things you could contribute that would be around that much.
Tbf, if you have a pattern of ending up with immature women, it’s possible that regardless of the age, you’re being attracted by traits that go hand in hand with this sort of immaturity.
I…. Am pretty sure a lot of 24 year olds are significantly more mature than this, especially ones who have educations/jobs and friends are getting married.
…. Why would he offer to pay for a night out he wasn’t even at?? I get we freak at age gaps, but 24 and 32 are both adults that are at approximately the same life stage. This isn’t about age as much about 1. Don’t lend money you’re not willing to lose and 2. Always check your bank account.
So, I want to address both sides of this. The first is your friend lied to you and that’s definitely problematic. I don’t really think testing people is ever a great tactic. That said, he’s a friend not a lover and you don’t necessarily need to be able to have the same level of trust in a friend as you would your wife. So, if you decide to keep being friends with him after this, simply make sure you do so with caution and a modicum of distance put between you two on anything of importance. I understand that may be controversial, but 1. It’s difficult to make friends once you’re older and have a family and 2. If all of us are honest, we have or at least have had plenty of friends that were good to go to lunch or a concert with but you would never call if you needed a place to stay or something huge. 

Now, onto his side of things. He’s a 29 year old male. Yes, there are some dudes who will be fine going on a stroller walk, but the reality is, most guys aren’t. Hell, I’d probably guess most dudes with kids wouldn’t even want to do that as a hang out. They’re going to want to have fun, go to a bar, watch a game, play pool or whatever that activity is. I’m not saying it’s going to involve drugs or blacking out, but you probably also need to understand that in order to maintain friendships, you need to retain your identity as (ok_still179) FIRST and loving father second. A lot of women also struggle with this balance so don’t be alarmed or feel weird about it. Make sure you’re taking time to go and just be you with your friends and make sure you’re not making you and your infant a package deal. Most single 20s guys just aren’t going to want a kid involved, and I definitely empathize. It may mean it’s a few months till you and your wife find that balance, so just ask for some patience, but remember that the balance is important to find, especially if realistically, you want to be able to maintain friendships.
She said she sold it at a profit. But…. So? It’s an investment. Are you telling me you should sell your stocks at what you paid for it even if they’re worth double? That’s just stupid.
That…. Is what happens when you’re the waitress at a table. You come back multiple times.
Ok. If that’s what you mean, then I understand that that’s fair to expect once ownership has changed hands.
You’re aware that you only deem OP an AH because you want the brother to be able to continue to take advantage, right? Because an eviction would’ve been inevitable unless you think he should’ve been allowed to take advantage as nauseam. And at that point, the difference between OP serving him with an eviction and the new owner is it’s way harder to pressure a stranger than family. So, why do you really think the eviction is an AH move?

Genuinely asking btw, because I get what people are saying but I don’t think they realize what that really would mean.
Fair enough. But no, and I think a lot of people are really not understanding it’s extremely common that rented apartments don’t have top of the line “run your shower max temp for hours at a time” water heaters that would be required for 5-6 people to get hot showers. I mean hell, my old apartment I alone couldn’t take a shower longer than 15 minutes without getting cold water. That’s just usually how it is when you rent. You don’t get unlimited hot water. You have to plan your showers. You deal with it.
A quick Common sense search also tells you 3 is a lot less than 6-12.
It’s very obvious you think renting a home is the same as owning, and it simply is not. When you finally do own a home, maybe you’ll understand. Until then, don’t comment on what you clearly don’t understand.
That’s simply not true. If that were actually true, developers, builders, property managers, etc would NEVER go bankrupt, but they 100% do. That would mean these people never get sued, never had to evict anyone, never have any damages ot gone a month without rent. There’s absolutely a risk. Just because someone is typically smart enough not to overextend themselves to the point where they can’t float the additional costs does not mean there is no risk. It just shows your ignorance on the costs involved in running a business and owning a home to think there isn’t. If there was NO risk, everyone would be a landlord, but they aren’t. Why? Because there’s risk.
