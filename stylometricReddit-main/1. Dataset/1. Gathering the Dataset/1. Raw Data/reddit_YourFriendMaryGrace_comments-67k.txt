You should be doing what makes you feel good and he should love you as you are. It’s weird that he’s mad about this. If he likes seeing you dressed up that’s cool, but he should give you a chance to get dressed up for something that makes sense like a nice dinner. Not football lol. I’m sorry.
One night stands might not be a good idea for you. Personally I’m demisexual so I only feel sexual attraction if I also feel a deep emotional connection, so I never do random hookups bc I know it’s unhealthy for me emotionally. Not saying it’s the same for you, but it’s clear that you are having very strong feelings towards someone who doesn’t feel the same way. You can’t change how he feels, you can only try and move forward and avoid this situation in the future.
Right? I’m kind of astonished that the words trophy, violent and blackmails are all being used to describe the same person.
You are capable of having a healthy happy relationship even if it didn’t work out for your mom. She probably means well but she’s misguided in thinking that all marriages end horribly lol. You have to live your own life and make the choices that are right for you.
A lot of manipulative people will try and keep the upper hand by always making you feel like you’ve messed up and you need to make it right. The fact that he packed up and left over this is so extreme I’m embarrassed for him lol. He’s not trying to believe you that you mean no harm because it benefits him to act like you’re the bad guy. You’re gonna lose your mind if you try and make it work with him.
RUN!!! No amount of beauty is worth being physically abused and manipulated over. She’ll only get worse. I promise you you’ll be 10X happier with someone who is sane, loving and would never dream of hurting you on purpose.
“I don’t feel like it’s that simple for this long of a relationship.” It kinda is though. Whether you’ve been together for a month or a decade, the fact that his family does not support your relationship and not only excludes you, but actively tries to replace you, is a huge problem. Clearly he’s not able to make them cut it out completely and respect your relationship together. He’s trying to toe the line between pleasing you and them, but that’s not possible because they’re opposed to you being around at all. 

I know it’s hard, but please consider if this is what you want for your future. Because they won’t change, and it will be a continual source of tension and hurt.
Exactly. I had an ex boyfriend who used this exact method to try and warm me up to abuse. Repeatedly caused pain and then act like he meant no harm, and I was overreacting by not liking it. He will escalate it as much as he can, OP. And in any case, if a partner sees you setting boundaries as a problem you gotta go.
I absolutely know how you feel. I’m working through multiple heartbreak traumas as well and it’s difficult, but worth it. For me personally, it’s been really helpful to just stop dating completely for the time being and focus on my healing. You’ll know when you’re ready to get back out there:) hugs!
Can you please give some examples of him needling, poking the bear? It’s hard to get a read on the situation without more context. If you feel yourself getting angry do you walk away from the conversation to cool off?
Yes that is very manipulative for sure. That’s emotional abuse on top of the physical abuse! I’m very glad you got away from him. Now you know to walk away at the first sign of someone not respecting your boundaries. Because if they’ll do it once they’ll do it again, worse and worse. Big hugs to you. I’m proud of you for getting away and learning from it:)
I’m so sorry this happened to you. I’m concerned that you feel bad about threatening to punch him in that scenario. Please know that if you’re ever in that situation again, you NEED to do what you need to do to get away. Punch him in the face, balls, whatever you can. Your friend is the one who’s fake af if she’s taking his side. Keep them and people like them out of your life.
That’s really sad for her:( I’m so glad she’s in therapy. Her innocence was taken away at a very young age due to that exposure and she needs support. Be a listening ear, empathize with her and be supportive of her going to therapy and working through the trauma. Healing is very much possible and it sounds like she’s doing what she can.
It sounds like she’s testing the waters looking for a replacement for her actual boyfriend. Unless that’s what you want, I’d definitely let her know that you need her to back off.
Try and pace yourself. Breakups are traumatizing and it can take a long time to recover and really start thinking clearly again. There’s nothing wrong with having feelings, but I’d advice against acting on them or even trying to sort out what you’re feeling towards her until you’ve had a few months to heal from the break up.
You’re allowed to feel how you feel. Porn is highly addictive and he may have a problem. If that’s a deal breaker for you, that’s completely fine and nothing you should feel bad about. Talk to him about it and see how he responds. Don’t feel bad about how you feel or try and pretend to be cool with it if you’re not.
Yeah, and I’m sure that was difficult to deal with since you’re only trying to help. Try and keep in mind that ED is a form of addiction so just like with any addict, when they feel like their addiction is being threatened they will lash out, even at the people who are trying to help. It’s tough and my heart goes out to you 💕
Personally, the mundane daily life stuff from the ancient past *is* the most interesting to me. I’m not that interested in battles or notable events but I love looking at ancient hair and makeup products, restaurants, home decor etc.
It sounds like he felt cornered and accused. Next time .. Try and use more empathetic language like “I love the both of you very much, and your health and well being is important to me. Please know that if you ever need support with your ED or anything else, now or in the future, I’d like to help.” 

They are adults and they have to make their own decisions, so there’s only so much you can do. I’m sorry.
Oh my. /u/sqitten has given you some solid advice that I agree with, please take it to heart. The next step with people like her is usually gaslighting, making you feel confused and crazy for having a problem with her behavior. So please try to keep a clear head and get some outside support as soon as possible.
That scares me so much to know that people are being actively shamed for showing empathy. Empathy is like the #1 ingredient to a healthy society. Lack of empathy indicates a seriously emotionally unintelligent person. If that becomes the ideal we’re screwed.
Whaaa? Familiarize yourself with DARVO. Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. That’s what she’s doing. There’s nothing misogynistic about standing up for yourself and not wanting to be called names. Does she do this with issues you try to address?
I am so very sorry that you lost your brother and father. That’s an enormous trauma and its very understandable that it’s affecting your relationships. Are you in therapy? I think you touched on something very important when you said “it’s the same thing I say to myself most of the time”. We can only give to others the amount of love and empathy that we give to ourselves. If you’re telling yourself that you shouldn’t complain about “little” problems, you won’t be able to empathize with other’s problems either. Pain comes in all shapes and sizes. You’re allowed to feel upset about things, even if they seem small compared to the tragedy you’ve experienced. And other people are too. Try and find compassion for yourself and it will get easier to show compassion to your friends. 

Please give yourself a hug from me, and feel free to reach out any time. I care 💕
I’m afraid that can’t be your problem. He has to want to change, make solid efforts to do so, and find support along the way. As it stands, you’re enabling him, which is the last thing he needs. I don’t want to sound harsh because I know you’re confused and caught up in all this, but you HAVE to kick him out and let him hit rock bottom out of your sight. For your own sake and his.
You’re welcome!! And please do. I sure benefited from support when I was going through it and I’m happy to help how I can 💕
The real nightmare is wasting even more years of your life trying fix someone who’s broken wayyy beyond your ability to repair. I understand. I’m 38 and had to walk away from a narcissist almost exactly a year ago. It was SO hard. But by the third month of being no contact I was healed enough that when he found an excuse to reach out, I felt nothing but anger lol. Now I don’t miss him at all and my only regret is sticking around for as long as I did. I’m still single which I thought would be miserable but I’m so much happier than I was in that relationship. But going no contact was essential to being able to move on. You have to start there. Good luck and feel free to reach out if you need support.
Do you not have access to the internet at home? I’m confused why you feel the need to just be more cautious rather than just.. stop doing it. Being careful about who’s looking doesn’t guarantee you won’t get caught again. You said yourself they monitor it and can look at the history. Just stop lol
Educate yourself on narcissistic behavior and reading other people’s experiences. They all operate from the same playbook and get you hooked on the on again, off again cycle. It can be very addicting and you will lose your mind if you keep letting her come back. Also research “anxious attachment” and codependent attachment. I’m guessing you’re somewhere on the spectrum of anxiously attached which makes it much more difficult to let go of people. But you have to, friend. She will not change, she will only continue to drain you of all the love and care and energy that you could be giving to someone who can return it. 

Blocking her is absolutely essential because by now she knows exactly how to rope you back in with the smallest interaction.
You absolutely did the right thing by telling her that it’s not a good time to rush into things. Whether she wants to admit it or not, she’s still in a state of emotional distress and can’t possibly make clear headed decisions at this point. Ideally you wouldn’t have kissed and cuddled her, but it’s done now so all you can do is not do it again anytime soon. To be honest it sounds like this could get messy very quickly with her living with you and being unwilling to accept that you want to take things slowly.
I mean, yes she snitched, but you gotta stop looking at inappropriate things on the school computers. You will get caught again eventually and it’s not worth it.
Coming back to add, congrats on getting sober and pulling your life together again. That takes enormous strength and I’m proud of you:) now BOOT him! lol
Oh my bad, I’m not sure why I thought it was! It sounds like she might not even be aware of why she’s getting triggered. But even if she is aware, the fact that she won’t communicate her issue is all the more reason to try and not let it affect you too much. At any age, but at your age especially, relationships are about learning and growing and getting to know yourself better. Don’t let her weirdness throw you off and make you overthink something that’s making you happy.
That’s odd. I wonder if deep down she’s feeling sad/weird about the fact that you’re in your first relationship and just trying to slow it down for her own comfort. At 4 months it’s perfectly normal to talk every day. You could try asking her if she’s got any concerns, but at the end of the day only you can decide what’s best for you in this relationship.
I hope OP sees this. I feel so bad for him:(
Well regardless, she’s definitely into you and I think you should ask her to hang out sometime:)
Absolutely do not keep him around. Kick him out, change the locks, and never speak to him again. He ruined your life once and he’ll do it again. Narcissistic people almost always have an addiction of some kind and they will bleed you dry of your time, energy, and money for as long as you let them. Who cares that he’s attractive? I promise you you’d be a billion times better off with a healthy, happy partner who is less attractive than this mess of a person. Do NOT fool yourself into thinking you can help him or that you’re his best chance to self-improvement. Narcissists love it when you think you’re the super special person that can save them because it incentives you to keep trying. He’s not going to change no matter what you do.
It sounds like it’s way too early for either of you to really know how you feel besides that you like each other and want to see where it goes. So I’m not sure what your question is.
From what you’ve shared here she’s 100% into you. She was probably hoping for more than just “what” when she said she’d kiss you, so she took it back. If she’s shy then you’re probably gonna have to make the next move.
Aww man, my heart goes out to you friend. I can tell that you take things very seriously when it comes to how you behave and treat others. You are NOT a horrible person, by any means. Your intentions were misguided, but honorable. 

I think you already know this, but your definition of love is very skewed. Love is not about putting your own needs and feelings aside and suffering in silence. Not at all. In fact, you can only love others to the degree that you love yourself. I gather that it might be challenging for you as you tend to intellectualize more than you feel, but try to really offer yourself as much love and respect and forgiveness as you can throughout all this. You’ve already been self-harming by way of ignoring your own needs. Don’t double down on it by shaming yourself for the fallout. If you can get into therapy I think it would be really helpful. And definitely try reading some books on healthy relationships so you have a better understanding about what it means to be a good partner.
I would highly recommend you stop talking to your ex for a long, long time. You don’t owe her anything. And being in contact is only going to confuse you and make it more difficult to move on, enjoy life and make your own decisions.
Which is impossible to do in this case because *she* doesn’t even know who she is or how she’s going to be. Just because she’s advanced in her career doesn’t mean she’s advanced on a personal level. That can only happen through time and experience. You seem like a smart guy, I think you already know you need to let this go.
Right, not to mention the inherent power imbalance of you having so much more life experience and time to get settled. Even if you’re actively trying to make it “even” and be fair, it won’t be. And your kids deserve for you to have a partner that is all-in for them, which it certainly sounds like she isn’t in a place to be.
Just the fact that she’s looking to settle down because it’s what her family wants is enough to show you that she still has a ton of growing up and self-discovery to do. Her brain won’t be done developing for another 5 years buddy. Leave her alone for both of your sake.
You can tell her that you aren’t ready to try and work on your relationship at this time without closing the door on the future possibility of that. The dissolution of her family was very traumatizing for her I’m sure, and we can’t always help what triggers us. That’s not to say that she was right or fair for how she acted at all, just that she may not have been in a very stable emotional/mental place at the time. Give yourself as much time as you need to enjoy your life without the drama, and if you find yourself missing her and wanting to work on it, reach out.  If and when you do decide to talk to her, be honest about how you felt and how it affected you. If she’s unwilling to acknowledge that she was hurtful, it’s probably best to move on. Good luck. Lifelong friends are very special but remember to look after yourself first :)
You’re welcome!! I’m proud of you:) It’s definitely a process, and I’m still learning alongside you. It’s sad because our natural tendency to be empathetic and helpful and tolerant deserves to be treasured, not taken advantage of. I’m hoping for really lovely, healthy future partners for the both of us!
I have also attracted my fair share of abusive/stalkery types! They are almost always attracted to people-pleasers because they know that if they push you in just the right way, you’ll give them what they want. Build up your confidence and your ability to say NO. Decide before you even meet someone exactly what your boundaries are, and stick with them. The more you know yourself and find your inner strength, the more you’ll repel people like that. And going forward, limit your interactions with your ex to essential work business only.
You’re welcome! I hope the conversation goes well:)
Aww man, I’m glad you’re at least a little more comfortable but still.. that sucks! Don’t let the fact that your mom is paying for everything keep you from being upfront about your needs. And having a bed is a pretty basic need! If she really cares about you having a nice time that’s the least she can do! And congrats on the wedding:)
I am so sorry you’re going through this. I don’t know of course, but it’s possible he could have attachment issues. Read up on avoidant attachment, specifically. But regardless of the reason, which you may never know for sure, allow yourself plenty of time to grieve the loss of what you had and what you hoped you could have together. You’re in the hardest part right now and it will get easier, I promise. I went through something similar and had to learn the hard way to pace myself in relationships, because it really does take time to learn how another person operates on a deep level. I think that as you heal and grow from this, it will get easier to vet future partners and give yourself some time to feel it out before falling too deep. There are people out there who will love you just as deeply as you love them, I promise.
Another thought, if you are able to you could go ahead and go find a couch or something in the house, and that will kickstart the conversation in the morning when she finds you no longer on the boat.
Oh my. You have every right to be annoyed! You’re the one being celebrated, you shouldn’t be sleeping on the floor lol. I’m sorry babe. It sounds like it’s too late to switch it up tonight but in the morning I would tell her that you were really uncomfortable and will need an actual bed for the remainder of the trip. If you think she might be argumentative or weird about it then bring it up in the group so that others can help you figure something out.
It’s kind of you to not want to hurt her feelings, but for the future please know that it’s perfectly normal and reasonable to tell your partner “it makes me uncomfortable to hear about your past partners and experiences.” I certainly don’t want to hear about my partners past lol. If you don’t see a future with her then I think the sooner you get it over with and tell her, the better. And I wouldn’t advise continuing with the business plan either, as that could get messy very quickly.
Definitely bring it up if it’s bothering you! There’s a whole range of possibilities, he could just be feeling a little down and it’s affecting his communication style. He could have avoidant attachment issues and you guys getting closer triggered him. Etc. Try to open up communication and see what he says. If you can’t get a straight answer from him or he says nothings wrong but then continues to be distant, it’s probably time to walk away. Good luck:)
💕🙈 that makes my day, thank you love!!!!
Ahhhh!! Thank you so much!!! I’ve been thinking of it like a portal so looking at it through your eyes as a sun or moon adds a whole new perspective and I love it 💕☀️🌖
/u/artisticnoob both those comparisons are making my day, thank you guys!! 💕🥰💕
That means so much to me, thank you!!
Love this!!! 💕🦜
Gorgeous! Love the title, too 💙
Thank you so much!! 💕🥰
Thank you so much!! 💕💕💕
[here’s a video showing a bit of my process:)](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRq28X6T/)
I love your style!
Thank you! 💕💕
Love the background colors!
Oops, meant to write 4ft tall cardboard! Not 5ft. Anyway here’s a video of my process:) [https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRqYLr1X/](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRqYLr1X/)
Yes! I use brushes occasionally but I find that painting with my hands really helps me loosen up and stop overthinking everything:)
I’m glad it found you and you replied, it’s really nice to know it’s not just me!! I have an Aries stellium too lol. We neeeeed the excitement!
I have an Aries Mars so I act like I have no sense whatsoever
Oh my goodness, this made me cry so much!!! Wow wow wow I am so proud of you and happy for you and thankful to hear that you’re doing so well <3 you have unbelievable strength and power to have made it through everything you’ve been through. I knew you could do it <3 thank you so much for this message, it means the world to know that it helped you. I’m always in your corner and here for you any time!
I have a Capricorn moon so I feel bad for myself that I don’t know how to feel. 


^Well that was way too accurate.
No problem:) good luck to both of you guys!
Absolutely. Just the fact that you already kinda talked about it (even if it was just joking) really helps. My ex and I would joke about staying friends no matter what, too:) and we have. You might need some time to adjust and reset as individuals, but just continue to be respectful and supportive of each other and you’ll be good.
I love this so so much oh my goodness 😍💕
I’m so very sorry you went through that, especially so many times. Its a heartbreak I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. And yes we do need much better resources for helping people cope, and less stigma around talking about it because it’s so common but so rarely discussed.
I mean, yes of course that’s a bizarre and disturbing thing to do, but people dealing with extreme trauma/tragedy don’t always react in logical, or “appropriate” ways. I had a miscarriage at 12 weeks and the grief of that alone made me kinda crazy for a while. Not to mention after childbirth there’s a massive hormonal change and a bunch of other stuff that’s challenging even when you have a healthy baby. Idk.. I just think it’s way too simplistic to write it off as simply wanting attention or caring about getting likes too much or whatever. And I feel bad for her to go through all that, and then be dragged down further bc she coped in a really weird way.
Oh I love these!! The meat one is so gross but so relatable lol.. something about being slightly high gets me super in touch with my intuition. Sometimes I end up doing what seems like completely random shit but then I end up understanding the reason why I felt compelled to do it after the fact. Nothing as crazy as that though, usually just stuff like feeling the need to reach out to a friend and it turns out they just got bad news or something.
Whoa that’s pretty cool.. did it seem unusually big to you at the time? Or only in retrospect after that nap? Like did it go from normal to big and then back to normal, or just “normal” and then way smaller? I don’t know if that makes sense but I tried :)
I’d love to hear some of your experiences if you feel like sharing!
I wish I had:( for some reason I had the feeling like I shouldn’t go in there. I’m not sure if it was actually a bad idea or just a fear of the unknown but I couldn’t bring myself to crawl in. And then it was gone.
This is my favorite one, and I totally believe you! I think kids have an ability to peer into dimensions that for whatever reason get harder to see as adults. My story isn’t as cool as yours but when I was a kid I looked into a pile of pillows that were kind of stacked together in a tunnel shape, but somehow the tunnel went on and on like hundreds of times longer than the pillows themselves. I walked away and walked back to look again and it was just back to being a normal stack of pillows.
Yes or like we want to be their new BFF when actually we’re just being genuinely friendly but not like we want to be like *friend* friends. That’s the only downside of the placement imo. Accidentally leading people on!
Just curious, do you feel like that in real life? Trying to figure out the best direction to take and keep ending up in the wrong places?
I would say that the guilt and shame of killing the dog probably factored into the situation a lot. But regardless, please do not think that all women are like this. I have spent the last 3 years trying to help my boyfriend open up, cry, rage, whatever he needs to process his feelings. Every bit of progress he’s made has been so incredibly rewarding and brought us closer together. The only way I’d weed him out as a mate is if he stopped working on expressing his feelings and started trying to be all stoic again. As a partner it’s exhausting and isolating always having to wonder what your mate is really feeling. 

If you end up with another person who can’t handle seeing you cry, weed HER out and don’t look back. You do not deserve that sexist bullshit.
I’m sure there’s a lot of additional factors like that, but from what I understand the tradition stems from the days where talking about “women’s problems” like periods, menopause, etc were taboo and so miscarriage was supposed to be kept quiet. But if someone wants to tell their friends and family early on, it’s easy enough to say that it’s still early and they should wait a few months before making any purchases.
I actually wish the whole “don’t tell anyone too early” notion would go away, too. Losing your pregnancy, even if you have only been pregnant for a few weeks, can be so incredibly sad. And if you haven’t told anyone then you’re either alone in that pain, or having to tell people that you need support from that you were pregnant, and now you’re not. Of course some people would rather be alone in that process regardless, and if that’s how they feel there’s nothing wrong at all with keeping it quiet. I just wish there wasn’t a stigma around announcing “too early”. It kind of creates a social isolation around anyone grieving before that 12 week mark.
It makes me glad to see someone else talking about the Just World Fallacy. I used to post about it online like a reverse evangelist all the time bc I think it’s so important for people to understand that this way of thinking is prevalent and insidious. Even non-religious people do it without realizing it, either to avoid having to empathize or to make themselves feel like if they just do everything “right”, they’ll be safe.
I’m curious about the micro-dose. My life has been changed in other ways due to a standard amount of it on separate 3 occasions over 2 years. Was it a one time thing, and did you go into it with the intention of facing your addictions?

Edit: also, congrats on your accomplishment, really encouraging to hear your progress:)
I have a theory that the rest of your chart plays into what kind of connections you’ll enjoy, which is a little too complicated for an app to take into consideration. For example my Venus is in Aries so I kinda like it when things are “exciting” AKA complicated lol. So for me, a Delicate or Complex bond is stimulating and fun but an Extraordinary or Powerful bond can be boring. Like it’s *too* easy.
What did the tire look like?
Ahh same here!! I guess it’s been about 2 or 3 weeks for me that I’ve obsessing over my jaw muscles bc something just felt off. I kept trying different massage techniques to make it feel normal again. This is really interesting. 

Did you feel it when our ribs changed?
You sound like a really good person. Your mama is lucky to have you 💕
That’s beautiful. It seems like most souls tend to reincarnate within the same family. I bet he’s been really looking forward to seeing you guys again!! 💕💕💕
First of all I’m very sorry for your loss 💕 That’s really cool about the dream, and I firmly believe that the women in a family line are super tuned in to the energy of new babies. When I was pregnant with my kids I didn’t want to know the gender until they were born. But me, my mom and my grandmother were completely positive I was having a girl, and I was. Same thing with my next baby, we knew it was a boy and he was!
Pluto! [Here’s a pic of my chart, feel free to ask any questions! ](https://ibb.co/J2kjvZ6)
I have those two in my second house. I tend to have a lot of money or none lol.
How did it work out, if you don’t mind sharing?
This hurt my heart to read :,( I love people who dress however makes them happy and I hate to think of her being made to feel bad about her awesome, quirky self.
Thank you so much <3 I’m okay, I’m thankful that my dog’s life was so full and happy, and that she had such a peaceful ending. And there are positives to being single and not having an elderly dog to tend to any more, such as being more free and independent, traveling. etc. So it’s really hard to cope with all at once, but I’m trying to think of it as a new chapter, with gratitude.
In my 9th house. On the night of the lunar eclipse I told my boyfriend (for the billionth time) that we needed to start doing some very things differently because I just wasn’t happy in our relationship, and he said he’d work on it but he didn’t, so on June 8th I broke things off. Then later that night my sweet little dog’s health took a serious turn for the worse, and I had to put her down on the morning of the eclipse. I’ve had her with me for 14 years. She was a Gemini Sun and Sagittarius moon. I’m heartbroken.

It’s amazing you were able to recognize the pain you were causing and turn it around. Especially after everything you went through yourself. Just commenting to say I’m proud of you:) and don’t give up on your brother closest in age, it may take time but if he’s able to heal on his own he may come around to the idea of a closer relationship with you.
Happy birthday!!
That’s a good life skill to have.
Did you get to play with them?
So it was entrapment! What a bastard.
Aww that’s a good one. My little boy is 4 years old now and I always wonder what random stuff he’ll remember:)
lol and of all the beverages you could have chosen to spit out, you went with the one most likely to stain the carpet.
Aww.. those early childhood accomplishments are the best!
How did that turn out?
I have a vivid memory of standing in my cousin’s yard, staring at a tree.
I’m not a Christian, but /u/AnotherReaderofStuff is right, the Bible does say that, although it’s in Matthew not Revelation. Start on verse 34 of [Jesus’ sermon in Matthew 25](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3fsearch=Matthew%2b25&version=NIV&interface=amp). He’s saying that if you didn’t take care of the poor, imprisoned, etc while you were on earth you don’t get a spot in heaven.
Wow that’s really cool. Would you mind sharing what sort of meaningless thoughts and views you saw yourself having as a teen? I feel like I waste a lot of energy on meaningless thoughts now as an adult but I’m trying to improve. 

Thanks for sharing, I hope the despair goes away completely soon and that you find more and more warmth and happiness in your life:)
Yeah it’s a different song but it’s a similar vibe to The Beach Boys so I’m thinking OP might have just mis-remembered slightly.
Are you thinking of [this one? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/kepohv/back_in_the_beforefore_times/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
That’s a real gift, I have it too with some close friends. For example once I started spontaneously crying while I was in the shower, and I had no idea why. I wasn’t even sad. But my friend’s name came to mind immediately after so I texted him and sure enough he’d just had a heartbreaking thing happen to him. I think it’s possible our brains are silently communicating with each other in ways we can’t observe with current technology, and some may just have stronger communication links than others. Whatever it is I’m glad you guys found each other:)
Thank you:)
You should give it a go! There’s some great ones on YouTube you could try, people seem to have a lot of success with [this one. ](https://youtu.be/YxXZhRNd-Cs) I totally get being wary, but it seems like the subconscious has a mechanism of sorts that will only allow you to see what you can handle. I tried many times before I saw anything, and when I finally did I understood why I hadn’t been able to see it before. I actually [participated in a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/pastlives/comments/lnlkie/911_past_life/go1gv0j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) about this recently if you’re interested. It seems to be a somewhat common experience.
It’s.. it’s complicated lol. But I love him very much. When I saw him in the glass thing I looked at him for a long time and then I understood that he’d be hurting a lot in this life. Then I understood a second thing that made me agree to him being my dad. Unfortunately I don’t remember at all what that second thing was. But I assume it’s something that I’m not supposed to remember, just learn over time?
Oh wow! I’ll have to check it out, thank you for telling me:)
I did a past life regression once where I saw myself choosing my parents. I was sat in front of a giant clear glass with a gold frame that had pictures of all the options, and I could kind of flip through them like turning pages in a book but with my mind. I was flipping through them thinking Nope, nope, nope.. because I felt nothing when I looked at the couple. Until I got to my parents, and I totally freaked out with excitement because I recognized my mom’s soul from having what felt like thousands of happy lifetimes together. I said “SHE could be my MOM?! Yes yes yes” and then I looked at my dad and didn’t recognize him at all, but understood they were a package deal. There’s more details but yeah, it was very interesting.
Oh interesting.. my little boy always called water by what sounded like “whoa”. I’m curious now if that sound matches the word for water in another language.
Oh wow.. I love this 💕 thank you for sharing
Theoretically though, if a conscious (or soul, if you prefer) doesn’t need a living brain and body to operate from then one could exist in a plant, animal, maybe even a drop of rain or just floating in space.
22 is an incredibly powerful number in numerology, it’s considered by many to be the most powerful “Master Number”. Really cool that you have a significant astrological event on that date. I can’t tell you what to expect but I wish you the best:)
Adderall starts trying to make the bed while you’re still in it.
You’re awesome, thank you for saying that! I sure want to be a good mother.. she deserves it:) Re: my big 3 yes I absolutely feel pulled in many directions a lot! Today my Pisces sun just wants to meditate, feel my feelings, read Tarot cards and sit with my crystals, while my Libra rising wants to shop for new nail polish and hang out with my boyfriend. Meanwhile my Cap moon is telling me that all of the above is a luxury and I shouldn’t “indulge” until my house is spotless and I’ve researched some investments.
Bless you, this is all so helpful and encouraging and helps me understand what’s going on in her brilliant little head. Going from distraught to cracking jokes is sooo her. It’s nice to know that isn’t unusual. And I absolutely *love* the idea of turning the process of talking about her feelings into a game itself, I think she’d really enjoy that, and it would help create a more positive association with emotional processing bc right now I think she wants to but then feels like it is too boring lol. She’s a great reader but she’s not writing fast enough yet to keep up with all she wants to say, so maybe I can create another little game for that, where she can tell me what she’s thinking and I write it down for her. 

I’m a Pisces sun, Capricorn moon and Libra rising. My only Gemini placement is my Chiron, but I do have my moon and Neptune in the third house.
Look up “attachment styles” and specifically “anxious attachment”. I have this and it’s a struggle, but being aware of it is hugely helpful.
This is such lovely and helpful advice. I can’t thank you enough! Definitely sounds like my little fairy. She even says “No one understands me” sometimes which makes my heart ache. I have another question if you don’t mind.. a lot of times when she’s feeling things deeply and lashing out, I take her to a private place and give her space to talk about what she’s feeling. She often says that first she wants to play some word games, like coming up with a word for each letter of the alphabet (sooo Gemini!) and I do. But then it can be almost impossible to get her to actually start talking about her feelings. She’ll just keep suggesting other games. I guess what I’m trying to figure out is if playing games is actually helping her or is she just avoiding processing her feelings?
My 6 year old daughter has the same big 3 as you. If you have any parenting advice pls share.
My lifetime before this one I was “human” in terms of how I felt, like my sense of individuality and my emotions. But I looked more like a cheetah or leopard on two legs. I could run and climb really, really fast. The planet I lived on was completely peaceful, so much so that I found it almost boring. I spent most of my time on a small space craft doing missions with my friends, who were giant blue lobster looking guys. We all communicated telepathically. I remember more details about my job than anything else. Unfortunately I don’t remember anything about my childhood, and I don’t remember there being anything like what we would call a couple or a family, so I wonder how babies were even made there. Wish I could remember more, maybe someday.
Yeah those memories were rough, they were so much worse than I would have guessed. As for who he is in this life, the TV show is still on the air and he’s still on it, so I have some idea of what he’s like in this lifetime. It seems like he’s still got some anger issues, but he’s come a loooooong way, that’s for sure. I haven’t tried to contact him, I’m afraid I’d just sound like a deranged fan lol. But I’m okay with not meeting him in this life, I feel like we reincarnate with the people who we’re meant to learn from in each life, so if there’s anything to be gained by us meeting it’ll happen on it’s own.

And it’s a pleasure talking with you too! Thank you for sharing your story. I was in high school when 9/11 happened and it was all so shocking and tragic. It’s oddly comforting to think of the victims living new lives, and the things that happened to them being a distant memory. But I’m so very sorry that happened to you, and I hope you get the answers you seek.
Not the person you’re responding to but I’ve had experience with not being ready to remember certain things. Years ago I used to watch this TV show with a C-list celebrity that isn’t very interesting on his own, but watching him made me feel *deeply* angry but also kind of.. aroused? I’m not someone who easily forms emotional attachments to celebrities so this was really confusing bc the feelings were just so irrationally strong. I did at least half a dozen past life regressions and never saw anything about him. Then years later, after I had done a lot of work on personal stuff that was affecting me in *this* life, a flood of memories came back while I was meditating that pretty much answered all my questions. I won’t get into the details but basically he was my uncle in a past life and he was horrible to me, but I had a Stockholm syndrome type of affection for him nonetheless. I saw the horrific things he did to me and yeah.. I was definitely not ready to see that back when I first started trying. 

The reasons you’re not able to see it might be different, but like /u/redseaaquamarine said you’ll see it when you’re ready. And it’ll probably make sense to you then why you couldn’t see it before.
Aries!
Scorpio
Leo
I’m up for almost anything but prefer that it be exciting or novel in some way. I feel a little awkward being romantic in the traditional sense, so flowers, chocolate, etc is definitely not a requirement.
This is great advice, thank you so much:)
Thank you!
Aries
Wow that’s interesting. I found myself reflecting on some events that I experienced in Feb 2018 just this morning. Do you happen to have any more info?
My son is a Scorpio Sun and rising, Leo moon. He’s only 4 years old though. Any advice you may have for me as a parent would be appreciated:)
How long do you cook for?
I’m close.. Pisces Sun, Cap moon and Libra rising. I’m your slightly more approachable sibling ;)
Not that it matters but what the hell is the context of that? Like, who’s children? Immigrant’s? Liberal’s? Just random kids?
No problem.. [this one ](https://mauihawaiitheworld.wordpress.com/2016/11/20/future-predictions-when-saturn-conjuncts-pluto-in-2020/?fbclid=IwAR3sNkwi8sbXaEZizeXuL_L15RqmbOvMKjeaBmcJZcV1eVcgAgT1F2KrXnY) from 2016 is good because it recaps the historic events that followed previous, similar conjunctions like the ones had last year.
It depends on what you’re looking at studying. There’s different areas of focus, like personal astrology (your own/someone else’s birth chart), synastry (how two people’s charts interact with each other), which is used for relationships. Mundane astrology is used to predict events, and tbh I’m not educated enough on the methods to help with a recommendation.
I usually look at similar themes in my real life. Houses/apts often represent the dreamer’s own mind. So in this case, it might be about wanting to make some changes in yourself but feeling like you’re going from bad to worse, mentally. Just an example but hopefully helps:)
There’s a lot of old (like, years old) astrology articles saying that 2020 would be a globally historic shitshow. We had a whole lot of these types of conjunctions over the past year and we’re not done. The newspaper style horoscopes and stuff are definitely BS but actual astrology, the type that is ancient and takes years to learn, is really very interesting.
I really like em.. I think the Pisces/Cap combo balance each other out nicely, and the Libra rising gives me a nice, approachable vibe.
Libra rising
Yayyy! How do you feel about the combo?
Hey we’re almost twins:) I have Libra rising.
I couldn’t get into the clinical trials so I did a kind of DIY version on my own. But [here’s](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/08/14/746614170/mdma-aka-ecstasy-shows-promise-as-a-ptsd-treatment) a good rundown on how they do it. I had a friend sit with me and I’m so thankful, I’d love to pay it forward so if you need someone to sit with you, I’d be very glad to help via Zoom or something.
I still struggle at times with intimacy, but I’ve come a loooong way. Regular therapy helped a lot, as well as using MDMA (aka Molly) in a therapeutic setting. I can go into more details about that if you’re interested. For me, the biggest hurdle was admitting to myself that I needed help processing it and healing.
That’s so awful, and so fucked up of your friends to respond that way. I’m so sorry. There’s nothing lucky about having your bodily autonomy violated, no matter what the violator looks like. To suggest otherwise is a gross, ignorant lack of empathy and understanding. It took me 13 years to tell anyone what happened to me because I was so afraid of not being believed. So my heart really, really goes out to you, knowing how much not being believed just adds to the trauma of it all.
I believe you and I’m so sorry that happened to you. Please don’t think that because you didn’t force her off that you are to blame in any way. Response to trauma is automatic and we don’t really get to consciously choose between fight, flight and freeze. I froze when I was coerced into sexual abuse as a teen and for a long time I felt shame about it. But I shouldn’t, and neither should you.
Could be a past life memory.
I have a few questions that would help with interpretation.. who’s house is it? Are you in the same house every time or does it change? What about the locations.. are you in the living room, basement, etc? Are there any patterns in which part of the house the attackers come through?
Where is your GlowWorm now?
Seems like there’s quite a few of us. I hope it’s symbolic, like of an era in a spiritual sense! Also.. funny sync that you responded to me just now bc I was literally just thinking about you! You wrote me some very kind encouraging words during a rough patch a few years ago and I’m forever thankful 🥲
Weird, my boyfriend and I both had vivid dreams last night. In his dream he lost his job and his house burned down. In my dream my house was being torn apart an apocalyptic storm and my son was terribly injured.
They’re in the very late degrees of Capricorn right now, and by the 21st of this month they’ll be in Aquarius.
What are you listening to?
Same here. I miss being able to look at the houses!
I’m sorry. When you say everybody else, who do you mean?
Hey congrats! I got off mine about 3 years ago and I’m so glad I did. I learned that the meds were putting a damper on my positive feels too, not just the negative ones. So while I might have some moments once in a while of feeling much sadder than I would on meds, I also get to experience a lot more excitement, love, happiness, etc. every day.  BTW I highly recommend taking St. John’s Wort herbal supplements If you can. They’re cheap, OTC, non-addictive,  and as effective as some SSRIs at curbing depression. 

Anyway, what’s a song you’ve listened to lately?
What’s the weirdest food order you’ve ever gotten?
Well the fact you skate tells me that you aren’t too lazy to move your body, you know how to get back up when you fall,  and you like to learn new things. Keep it up:) You can apply the same energy to other things now and in the future.
Well maybe you just haven’t found out what makes you feel alive yet. School is great but it’s not everything, and failing definitely doesn’t make you a loser. What do you do when you’re not being productive?
What makes you think you’re a loser?
I see, I don’t know if it will require a harness or not then, but maybe. Is that something that you’re worried about?
Gah. That’s messed up!! I wonder if there’s any kind of loans for stuff like this that would have lower payments? I’m uninsured right now and thankfully my health is good but yeah.. it’s scary how fast medical debt can pile up here in the states. 

And you’re welcome. I’m always here if you want to chat or vent or just need some encouragement. You’ll see the other side of this someday and in the meantime, be kind to yourself 💕
I’m so sorry for everything you’re going through. That’s a lot. Why do you have to come up with the money in just two days?
I’m sorry this happened to you. That’s awful. You deserve better people in your life, and I hope you find them:)
I’m not sure. There’s different types of buses, but usually they don’t have harnesses.
I relate to this.. I was raised in an uber-conservative environment (I literally only knew of two people in my hometown who were openly liberal lol) and it wasn’t until my mid-twenties that I felt safe expressing just how different my views are now. If I can offer some advice, when you do start talking about it, be as calm and as humble as you can. I’m *amazed* how open minded people can be when they don’t feel like they have to defend themselves. Using phrases like “I was surprised to learn..” or “something I’ve been thinking about lately..” really helps. I think it will also help a LOT that you are interested in doing things differently, and what you would like to see in a new political party. The whole Democrats vs Republicans thing is so toxic and it gets people all worked up. But by approaching it from a neutral perspective and making it about new ideas, you can really help people open their mind. Even if they don’t admit it to you:)
Are you trying to decide whether you want to try it?
lol I get that. What part of history are you learning about rn?
I hope you enjoy the new program. I’m sure it will be a cool and safe experience:)
Do the people around you know that you no longer agree with those views, or are you keeping it quiet for now? If they know, how did they respond?
What’s one thing you’d change about your life right now, if you could?
I’m afraid have massively different perspectives on this, my friend. I can see how you feel I’m being obtuse, because you seem obtuse from my perspective. But we’re not, we’re just on very different pages, and that’s okay. You are fully entitled to your perspective and I wish you well 💕
They could share that wealth to an enormously powerful, beneficial extent if they chose to, but they choose not to. If you’re a part of my company, supply chain, whatever, and you help me earn 20 dollars, and then I keep $19.99 for myself, and gift you with a penny, I have generated wealth for you. Doesn’t mean I am a great person doing great things for you. I’m a selfish dick capitalizing off your work and reaping the benefits.
They are not generating immense wealth for anybody but themselves and their shareholders. Instead of murdering a dozen or so people, serial killer style, they are in possession of millions of wage slaves who must grind away for decades just to hopefully have food, shelter and healthcare. That is not productive use in my book, not at all.
Of course! And btw I think the story of your friend giving you the crystal is so cool. Those spiritually intuitive kinda friends are a blessing 🤗
I don’t think it’s idiotic at all:) I think it’s really cool that they’ll share those placements, and I bet they will have a lot of understanding for each other as they grow up.
I was curious too so I found [this.](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/13/us/nixon-dropping-protection-by-secret-service.html) TL;DR he said he wanted to save the government money by hiring his own security team.
As others have already mentioned, that’s not a good astrology app. But in addition I think they have some kind of listening capability built-in because their “Do and Don’t” keywords have been way too “accurate” for me more than once. When I was redecorating my front porch I got “Front Porch” as a Do for the day. Another time I was asking my boyfriend if we had any parchment paper and “Parchment” was one of my Dos the next day. That’s not astrology that’s spying lol.
I have the same theory. The whole Jesus as Messiah storyline is remarkably similar to much older mythological origin stories, including the Virgin birth and coming back from the dead. And it’s Paul who flipped all the stuff Jesus said about helping the poor on its head and said instead “If a man doesn’t work, he shouldn’t eat.” Actually, Paul flipped just about everything Jesus said around and Christians believe what Paul says Jesus .. uh .. *meant to say* far more than they believe what Jesus actually said. Christianity is 100% a religion of Paul. Jesus the man would have wanted nothing to do with it.
Taxpayers are already footing the bill for their being arrested, sentenced, jailed, on probation, etc. Treating it as an addiction rather than a crime might very well end up being cheaper, and actually help people. But we will see. Agree with/u/2MuckingFuch that this will serve as a good test run either way.
I like you. You’re smart. I think the Democratic Party has utterly failed to address the most important issues facing Americans, and frankly I’m not convinced those at the top level care one bit. Except for Bernie of course. They’d rather go hog wild combatting fringe issues and demonizing anybody who supports Trump than look at themselves critically. In 2016 I wrote a mildly critical comment about Hillary on a liberal site and got nasty, hateful messages for WEEKS. And I even said in my comment that I do not at all support Trump. There’s this self-righteous, fuck everybody who disagrees attitude among Democrats that is gonna be the death of them if they don’t change. I’m like you, still figuring out my politics, but socialism seems to be the best way forward for us IMO. But like /u/api is saying, we have to start by putting up a candidate who will earnestly address the very legitimate concerns of the American heartland. And stop being so damn unwelcoming to anyone who isn’t already on “our” side. 

At the end of the day, humans just want to feel like they’re safe and cared for. Trump obviously makes people feel that way, and while I don’t understand why, I do understand how the left makes them feel unsafe and unwelcome.
Definitely look into [wing chun!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Chun) According to legend it was created by a woman, which is pretty cool. I’m a small person as well and I don’t like violence, so the approach of training primarily to disable/escape from attackers appealed to me:)
I wish more people understood this.
I really hope you’re right, my friend.
Conservatives say it’s all Soros, Liberals say it’s all Koch Bros and/or Putin. I think the truth is probably all of the above and much more. We’re merely puppets on the string of the super wealthy, being manipulated into turning on each other so we don’t look up and realize we’re all being swindled by the same forces. Anybody who thinks the billionaires on “their side” are actually on their side are painfully naive. It’s an illusion. If we united as a people we’d be too powerful for their absolute greed to continue going unchecked as it has been for decades. And that’s their worst nightmare.
I really, truly think that this Civil War narrative is being pushed into the conversations of both sides by an outside source. There’s major world powers that would have a lot to gain by Americans being so divided against each other. I have dear loved ones on both sides and nobody I know IRL wants bloodshed. Online though I see it brought up more and more by both sides equally, and both sides seem convinced that they have no choice because the other side is already planning on it. I dunno, maybe I’m paranoid but it all just feels very ... orchestrated.
For sure! Then again it could just as well be about anger you’re actually feeling towards him, but it’s just being illustrated in a satirical and over-the-top kinda way:) Dreamland is a very symbolic and metaphorical place, and the details matter. For example the computer keyboard, the sloppy food.. they both mean something specific about something in your life that is or has made you feel pretty strongly. The computer keyboard might mean that this is a dream about anger you’re feeling specifically in regards your communications with the outside world? Or perhaps while working from home? The sloppy food might mean you’re feeling disgust, too. I’m just spitballing but you get the idea:) 

Hope it’s ok that I said all that! I just get excited about dreams lol
Love your style!
I help people interpret their dreams as a hobby and I might be able to shed a little light.. quite often the people we see in our dreams aren’t playing the part of themselves. They often represent a different side of yourself that you identify in them. For example, I have a very spiritual side but I also have a very logical, reasoning side. I have a friend (Darion) who is pretty dismissive of anything spiritual, metaphysical, etc. When I’ve had moments of feeling conflicted about these two sides of myself, they’re often followed by dreams of me and Darion being on bad terms, even though we’re getting along fine. So I see it as Darion representing my logical side, and my subconscious mind trying to tell a story that calls attention to this disconnected “person” within me. 

Just something to consider in case it’s helpful:)

WARNING:praw:It appears that you are using PRAW in an asynchronous environment.

See https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/multiple_instances.html#discord-bots-and-asynchronous-environments for more info.

I have the same placement:) I think it is playing out for me like this.. the Scorpio south node means that my past lives, and my past in this life, tends to be filled with drama, power struggles, abuse of some kind, and money problems. I feel my mission is to find peace, stability and prosperity in this life and basically stop expecting/co-creating chaos. I think this tumultuous time period we’re in with the virus and worldwide political issues is such a good opportunity to be a port in the storm, so to speak. The inspiring thing about this placement is that if you believe in past lives, you can bet that you have already been through just about everything a person can go through, and you’re still here. You’re stronger for it, and you can handle anything. Its okay to just relax and enjoy life, and lean into those lovely Taurean traits like gardening, enjoying good food, and indulging all your senses.
Absolutely. My BFF/ex-husband and I have had a lot of lives together, I think. It sounds so cheesy but the first night we spent together we didn’t even fool around, just stared into each other’s eyes and felt completely at home. I didn’t even believe in past lives at the time yet I felt like I’d finally found him. Now 15 years later he’s still the only person I can just look into their eyes forever and never feel uncomfortable. We’re divorced but we are still as close as ever. We’ve both done past life regressions and seen lives we’ve had together, usually as a couple or just dear friends.

I have another friend that I feel, for some reason, was my son in a past life. I’ve also had the experience of simply locking eyes with a stranger and thinking “I know them” like an instant love and familiarity, and it always makes me wonder if it’s a loved one from another lifetime.
You need to be able to heal and process and release trauma before those experiences become helpful, IMO. I’ve dealt with everything from sexual abuse to homelessness and for a long time it did weaken me. But years (and a lot of psychedelics, therapy, yoga, etc) later I feel pretty damn powerful. I think that “what doesn’t kill you ..” saying does a disservice in the same way that calling cancer patients “fighters” does. It gives the impression that if you don’t possess a superhuman ability to immediately bounce back to better than before you’re somehow deficient. The focus should be on healing and transmuting and being supported *until* you start to feel stronger. 

I’m here for you if you ever want to chat ❤️
My Cap moon is in the 4th house and cleaning my home makes 95% of my bad feelings feel better. For a little while.
I have a Pisces sun, but a Cap moon and 4 Aries placements. I still come across as gentle to most people. At first;)
There’s a lot of interpretations but generally I just take it as a sign I’m on the right path:) I would look into numerology if you’re interested in learning more about the particular energy numbers carry. You can even generate a free reading online based on your name and birthdate.
It really does, thank you! She’s amazing and I love the way her clever little mind works, and I just want to support her the best I can 💕
That sounds just like my 6 year old Gemini sun/moon daughter:) Any parenting advice for me? Especially when it comes to the tantrums?
To be fair.. A lot of things have happened this year that we wouldn’t have thought would happen in a million years. It’s kind of the theme.
That’s what I hope for at this point.
Those are great placements IMO.. having your moon and ascendant in the same sign helps because people’s first impression of you is better aligned with your inner self. Descendant signs can often represent your shadow side, parts of yourself that are underdeveloped. But having it the same sign as your sun means those traits are much more inherent in you.
Amazing, I have the same placement of Chiron and related to all of this. I started unintentionally having spiritual/metaphysical experiences at a very young age that didn’t jive with the religion of my family and community. It was difficult enough just to process those experiences alone, and trying to explain them was impossible (and socially risky) so I kept quiet. I’m still figuring out how to share my thoughts and feelings about things without sounding crazy lol.
I feel the same way about my Pisces sun/Cap moon! Thankful to have both bc I can see myself being extremely lazy or a workaholic with just one or the other lol.
If the relationship is no longer healthy and the parents can’t get along, they already have an unstable family unit. Plenty of people grow up to wish their parents had just divorced rather than stay together, arguing and being passive aggressive all the time.
The 29th degree sun year is said to be a time of preparation for the changes to come when your progressed sun changes signs. Mine changes from Aries to Taurus next year and I am kind of feeling that energy. Like I’m getting ready for something.
If he knew anything about true astrology he’d know that summing someone up based on their sun sign is ridiculous. Unfortunately there will always be people who have a prejudice against certain signs, but that’s life. You Geminis are awesome:) And he sounds like a terrible friend lol.
I feel like it’s safe to say they hardly ever use it that way. This is their time to plot and scheme amongst themselves, safe from the people’s expectations and opinions getting in the way.
Really rough, but ultimately it was all necessary for me to transform into a much more authentic version of myself.
Yes I hear what you’re saying, and I co-sign your petition for everyone to stop with the gun waving!
Right.. I’m referring to OP’s comment about his real life interactions: “The ones that know we’re not racist were there last night and people with open minds were willing to hear us out and have conversations with us”

And saying that I don’t think it’s fair to dismiss what he’s saying about his real life experience and intentions just because it sounds like something trolls say.
It’s crazy and honestly it scares me. I’m reminded of that Noam Chomsky quote all the time lately.. 


“The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.”
I’m sorry but that’s a stretch. Billions of people converse every day lol.. you can’t attribute everything that is said and done in the real world to divisive online lingo. Personally I prefer to engage in good faith and if it doesn’t work out, I move on.
Why? Are we really at the point where wanting to have a conversation is suspicious? If so then we’re completely screwed because exchanging ideas and perspectives is crucial for peace.
Woah that’s crazy! My first name in this life is similar to a name I’ve had before, but dying in an alley and being reborn as “Ali” is wild. I hope remembering how tough you had it before has helped you release any guilt about having it good in this life:) You deserve all the best, Ali!!
Yes I’ve done it many times.. probably at least a dozen times lol but it’s only worked twice. In total I’ve seen 4 of my past lives. One through regular meditation, one through a guided meditation like this, one was in a dream I had after a psychedelic trip, and the most vivid and recent one I’ve been remembering since I was a little girl.
That’s funny, I almost asked you if you have any fears related to big cities or alleyways! Honestly it’s really great to hear that you’ve had a good life this time. Your story was very sad and it sounds like you/she more than deserved a break this go ‘round!
Do you have any experiences or feelings in this life that might be influenced by hers? I’m always interested in the parallels, like I’ve had a lifelong determination to only have sex with people who truly appreciate me as a person. And then in one of my past life regressions I saw myself as a woman who had really low self-esteem and let herself be used by a bazillion different guys bc she thought being sexy was her only valuable quality:(
Magician 🎩 and I relate to the description. Very cool thanks for sharing!
That’s really heartbreaking, I’m sorry <3
Well I’m 35 years old and I’m embodying my Libra rising more than ever so don’t hold your breath;)
Wow this is my boyfriend’s placement. If you don’t mind me asking were you bullied (or just generally made to feel small) by a parent?
Weird, I didn’t sleep at all last night and my 3yo was awake until like 3am. My 6yo woke up about 4am and never went back to sleep.
No problem! I’m still fairly new myself. Browsing this sub, plus reading birth and synastry charts of people I know then looking up the placements and aspects that interest me have been my best learning tools.
It’s giving you the option of which astrological method you’d like to use. Placidius and Whole Sign are probably the most commonly used ones around here. Personally I prefer Whole Sign. You can search those terms in this sub for a lot more info.
Did you guys get more than a one time relief payment of $1200, months ago?
Damn. I’m so sorry you’re going through all this 💕
Another fireball checking in:) I have Mars, Mercury and Venus in Aries, also Lilith. Do you mean that Mars is in your third house in your natal chart, or transit? Natal placements tell you how those energies will most clearly manifest in your life as a whole. Transit charts (ie where Mars is in your chart right now) will tell you how you’re currently being affected.
Is it in your 6th house in your birth chart? Or do you mean that’s your current Mars transit? My natal Mars is Aries in the 7th house, but right now it’s transiting my 6th house. I am feeling super motivated in my health and wellness routines, and getting a lot of things done that I’ve been putting off.
Well that’s awesome, you’ve already laid out a foundation for some really helpful stuff:) Definitely give MDMA a go if you can get your hands on some quality stuff. If you need someone available to talk to during your trip I’d be really happy to help, DM me!
I think you already know this, but start by putting dating wayyy on the back burner until you’re in a better relationship with yourself. This woman was able to use you because you don’t yet fully believe you deserve to be treated as an equal. As for what to do, expect some trial and error and be open to trying a lot of different things. I *highly* recommend beginning a meditation practice because over time you will learn to detach yourself from your thoughts rather than letting them run the show. And negative self-image is the product of negative thoughts about yourself run wild. It sounds like you have a lot of emotional trauma with regards to women and being in society in general so therapy can help you work through a lot of things. Using psychedelics like MDMA with the intention of revisiting/healing negative experiences has been life-changing for me, but of course you should do your research and proceed with caution etc etc. Also work on building healthy platonic relationships. It’s much easier to get sucked into an unhealthy romantic relationship when you don’t have a solid friend or two you can lean on for support and honest feedback. 

I’m sorry this happened to you, and I hope you keep working on yourself and your mindset because there really are great people out there who will treat you as well as you treat them:)
I worked in the (tiny) backstage of a 105 year theatre before I got laid off due to not being able to have shows anymore. I don’t know for sure because testing wasn’t really available in my area at the time but I think I had the virus already. Working with internationally traveling performers and crew every day in tight quarters is challenging even without this particular virus, idk if I can do that lifestyle again.
It kinda blew my mind how people were celebrating it, like I can understand being happy to see liberal media go down if you aren’t at all liberal but.. how could it not even cross their minds it what an awful precedent it was setting?
Yeah, Hulk Hogan vs Gawker and I’m still sad about it. Gawker could be hella trashy but they had some really great journalists too and were one of the very few mainstream media companies left that were not owned by a billionaire.
My dad is a retired doctor and has been in a remarkable number of situations where he has been able to help people off the clock, via witnessing car accidents, people having heart attacks on planes and at a gas station. I don’t know what it is either but I like to think the universe has a way of putting brave and helpful people like you guys where they’re needed sometimes.
What is the factor?
Not his literal house though, he said “my fathers house” meaning the temple. People had basically turned the temple into a money-making scheme and Jesus was extremely not okay with that. Thus the table flipping and such.
Because Paul the Opportunist came along and claimed to be miraculously converted from the guy who loved dragging Jesus’s followers to be stoned to the guy who was given special permission to tell everyone what Jesus *really* meant to say. He proceeded to write tons and tons of letters that he claimed were the word of God to the point that more than half of the New Testament is just Paul blabbering on urging people to be judgmental, saying stuff completely opposite of what Jesus taught. And modern Christianity is entirely based on Paul’s teaching, not Jesus.

Gosh I have a bunch of these and I do think some might be actual alternate timelines playing out, like my dream self pops over to experience it for a little while. There’s a huge, open-air church that looks like a remodeled/expanded version of the church I grew up in. I am no longer religious and I don’t go to church, but in these dreams it seems I’m still trying to play along and it’s very lonely, disempowered feeling. 

But the most frequent ones happened around 2012/2013 and they were scary. The world was a dangerous, lawless place and my ex husband (we were still married at the time though) and I had to be extremely careful about leaving our apartment bc there were so many violent people everywhere. But every time i was there, I knew that apartment complex, parking lot, etc like the back of my hand even though it doesn’t exist in my life here. 

 I really like to help people interpret their dreams because I have a gift for reading the metaphorical language of dreams, but these types of dreams are just *so different* in the way they feel and the content is so un-dreamlike... That when I have them I don’t even try to interpret them anymore. I just assume I went timeline hopping again lol.
I read somewhere that the Draconic NN is set to Aries because of the idea that ultimately we’re all on a solo soul mission of some kind, and Aries represents that energy. Personally I resonate with my Draconic chart, in some ways more so than my birth chart, but I’m not educated enough on it to speak to its validity.
You don’t have to do anything really except be mindful of your thoughts and feelings. If you feel anger, frustration, anxiety, whatever lean into it enough to see what’s really under there. We all have shadows and trauma and stuff weighing us down. But remember that this is the energy of rebirth, too. Releasing the old makes room for the new. I like to do some symbolic things too, like during the day I will clean my house really well, get rid of some clutter, and at night I’ll take a long bath or shower. Idk .. just something about getting my environment and myself super clean while thinking about releasing and cleansing stuff that my old self went through really feels good. 

You can google rituals and stuff but I suggest trying different things and seeing what feels good and helpful to you, just remember to keep directing your mind
I’m a Pisces, so I can’t do anything about it myself.

lol my Capricorn moon strongly disagrees.
Ooo I’d be interested in reading this if you have a link:)
I’m a Capricorn moon, my mom is a Virgo moon and she had me when she was 25yo. She is a Cancer Sun and I think that’s a combo that led to difficulty expressing her emotions in a healthy way but she’s improved a lot. I had my first born (Gemini moon) when I was 29 and my second child (Leo moon) 2.5 years later.
I think so, I feel like I relate to my Draconic chart more now than I would have if I’d seen it at a younger age. But I think a lot of it depends on the soul’s evolution and intention for this incarnation. Maybe we take on the natal chart characteristics we’ll need for this leg of the journey, and for some people more than others that may mean a drastic change in how they operate compared to their draconian chart. For example my ex’s Draconic chart has a ton of Capricorn and Virgo placements, which is baffling because he hardly has a drop of those energies in his birth chart or personality lol. But his north node is in Gemini so it kind of makes sense, like if he came into this life with a Cap/Virgo heavy chart it’d be that much harder for him to embrace the free, curious, excitable Gemini qualities he’s meant to embrace this go-round.
Is it really that bad? I have toe thumbs and I try to tell myself it’s okay but I don’t feel like it’s okay.
Pisces being lazy. My Capricorn moon almost completely cancels out my ability to be lazy, unless my chores are done and I’m at somebody else’s house where I’m not distracted by other things I could be getting done.
When I was really little I was so gentle and looooved helping people to the point where my older brothers friends would take advantage of my kindness, asking me to go get them water or whatever, stuff they could have easily done for themselves, and I’d do it. One of my earliest memories of getting really pissed off is from when I was in first grade and my brothers friend told me to go get him something and I realized I was getting walked on and said NO! After that I was a lot less helpful for a few years lol, and I’ve been quite wary of being taken advantage of ever since. It’s funny looking back because that’s the year I turned into a little Aries. I’m moving into Taurus next year:)
I was just thinking about this last night! My boyfriend has some troublesome aspects like Pluto square Venus and I have a lot of 7th house Aries placements, from what he’s told me about his younger self I don’t think we would have gotten along very well at all if we were the same age and we’d dated in our twenties. He’s fifteen years older than me though so he has been working through a lot of relationship stuff since before I was even dating age. He’s also a Leo but by progressions he’s a Virgo which I love.
I have Venus, Mars, Lilith and Mercury all in Aries in the 7th house and I endorse this comment!
Libra rising 25 degrees:)
I have Mars in Aries. Best was with fellow fire Mars people. 🧨
I’m a cap moon and I have learned to embrace my rather mechanical, structured approach to processing emotions. I think it can actually be very helpful for working out problems with others or for helping people sort out their own feelings, because the analytical skills I have for it help me break issues down to the root cause, see how different feelings are interconnected, etc.
Part of Fortune is where you can find success. So if it’s in Capricorn in the 7th house, maybe you find success by working hard alongside your significant other or a business partner. 

Chiron is where you’re wounded but can ultimately help others heal. For example mine is in Gemini in the 9th house and boy oh boy does that resonate, I was raised with a very strong religious doctrine (9th house stuff) but from a young age was having my own spiritual experiences that didn’t jive with what I was being taught. So talking about my own beliefs, sharing what I learned on my own (Gemini stuff) was a liability that would have led to being told that I was wrong, a sinner, etc. which honestly still hurts all these years later. I think part of my purpose is to be brave enough to share, and in doing so help others feel free of religious constraints. 

Lilith is a little more varied in interpretation. Some people say it’s the part of you that society rejects, or a part of your life where you embrace darkness. I would look at different articles about your specific placement of Lilith and see what feels applicable.
How did you determine which fated events were indicated by them? By looking at transits or was it the symbology of the placements making it clear?
Internet word for “Small”
You’d rather die than live without compliments.
That’s crazy! I have both the sun and Saturn trine my MC. What about you? And yes I’m definitely used to making changes in my life. Some of the things I’ve been through just in the past year I never anticipated happening to me, like a divorce. Sometimes I think that might be part of my growth process.. learning how to be stable and consistent and enjoy life despite (seemingly) never being able to be sure what’ll happen next.
Yay! How do you feel about your sun/moon combo? I like it because I think the Cap moon helps me stay grounded in reality and keeps the stereotypical Pisces laziness under control. But sometimes it feels like my feelings are overly filtered out because I wanna analyze them to death before I share them.
Well I definitely relate to my Scorpio south node. I’m oddly comfortable with crisis, darkness, and the idea of just “burning it all down.” About 7 years ago I gave away almost everything I owned and drove out to the desert with no plan except to start over. This was before I discovered astrology, ha ha and it was right before my Saturn return. But I can see how it reflected both nodes, kind of a south node reaction with north node intentions. My MC is in Cancer, so that combined with my NN sign/house.. I’m wondering if my calling is (at least in part) to be a source of comfort and stability in other people’s time of crisis.

What about you?
I have NN in Taurus in the 8th house, which honestly feels kind of contradictory. I can imagine that I’m meant to focus on Taurean qualities like stability, comfort, follow-through, and generally just enjoying life. But the 8th house would seem to be the opposite of a lot of that.
I’m a Pisces sun, Capricorn moon and Libra rising. We should be friends:)
Did you also feel a Libra rising-esque fear of displeasing other people by admitting that you’re told that you’re pretty? Because I did and still do!
Libra rising and I think I am pretty in a very conventional sort of way. None of my facial features stand out as exceptionally good or bad, I just have good symmetry I guess. I’m clumsy but that always surprises people once they notice because I’m told I *seem* like I’d be very graceful lol. I’m 5’4” and weigh about 115lbs, so fairly petite. I think most of this is aligned with the standard Libra rising description, except for my height as I’ve read they tend to be taller than average.
Okay, I’m not arguing with your data as I’ve yet to see it myself. I’m just saying that your phrasing gives the impression that being gay is unfortunate and even if you don’t care about hurting people’s feelings, I think you’ll get a more productive discussion out of this post if you share what you’ve been researching in a more neutral, less negative light.
Saturn just entered my 5th house like 2 weeks ago so my experience is very limited BUT I feel the sudden urge to buckle down and complete a short film I started/abandoned two years ago. Whereas new creative ideas aren’t really coming to me. I’ve also been doing a lot of reflecting about what I really *need* in a romantic relationship, and what I’m really willing to contribute. Another thing, I think it’s interesting timing that I’m stuck with my children almost 24/7 right now because it’s made me more aware of what they individually need from me as their mom, and a lot of it seems to involve me being more structured, planning ahead better, etc.

Hopefully you get some more responses. I’m very interested in reading about this from people who have been through it.
Can you give some examples? Might want to change your wording too lol, I think I get what you mean but saying “risk of...” sounds like being gay is a disease or something
I assume she means Venus in Aries, maybe Venus in Scorpio too if going by traditional rulerships.
Depends on what you need us to be 😩
What’s your rising sign? I’m a Libra rising, Venus in Aries and my style is similar 👯‍♀️
What country do you live in?
Check out /r/precognition this is a lot more common than you might expect:)
Happy birthday!
Same here and I was terrified to grow up. I cried a LOT when I was getting ready to turn 13 because I felt like I was gonna be a teen and not a kid anymore. Now I’m 35 and I guess I’ve accepted it but if I could be someone’s kid forever I would lol.
Listen to “Take a Walk on the Wild Side” first then listen to “Can I Kick It” and you can’t possibly miss it.
And a tiger saw a man.
That’s funny, I had the same recurring dream as a newlywed! I think sometimes our brains just run through “alternate path” scenarios via dreams, and your emotions in the dream help you feel what making different choices might have felt like.
You can’t be serious lmao. These are babies. When I was this age I told my babysitter I was gonna cut off her head. I wasn’t a future murderer, just a little kid copying what I heard Disney villains say. If you wanna predict adult personalities based on tiny children’s behavior you’d have to come to the conclusion that they’re all gonna be psychopaths.
That’d be great, thank you!
Trying to avoid unnecessary trips the grocery store plus having way more time than usual to spend in my back yard definitely has me veggie gardening!
Wish they’d reverse it. Turning churches into homes, even temporarily, would do a lot more to help the sick and the poor .. you know, the people Jesus said to look after.
No I’m kind of the opposite of that, if they seem uninterested I lose interest too.
Capricorn moon in the 4th house. I’m cleaning and organizing the shit out of my home and putting together a homeschool plan for my kindergarten and preschool age children.
Hold On by Alabama Shakes
Mine also! Happy birthday, birthday twins 🎂

Edit: omg a slice of pi award! And our bdays are on pi day! This is the best ever thank you /u/poky23 I love you 💕🥧💕
The article is wrong, it was actually a single dad banana. He’s still married but separated while he and his wife try and work out their differences.
Congrats on your new baby boy! I’m sorry you won’t have visitors (extra sets of hands really help with those newborns!) but I hope you two enjoy lots of happy, healthy snuggle time 💕
I’m here if you wanna talk:)
I don’t know if you’ve ever been miserably sick with the flu before but posting on Reddit was probably the last thing on everyone’s mind. And regardless of whether or not the commenters here had COVID-19 (maybe we did, maybe we didn’t) it’s not at all surprising, statistically, that out of over a million subscribers, half a dozen or so people would have had their worst flu ever in the past few months. Statistically it probably happened to *way* more than half a dozen. Doesn’t make us liars, just unlucky.
Yeah. Just lifting a cup of water felt like a physical feat at the time.

I was too out of it to post anything, I honestly for the first time understood how otherwise healthy people could die from the flu.. but I think I wrote some texts about how at one point my fever reached 104 and I was sleeping so hard, I wouldn’t have even woken up to take medication if my ex hadn’t stayed over to keep watch on me and  our kids and checked my forehead in the middle of the night. 

Edit: oh and I have texts that I sent to my dad (a doctor) about how to watch for pneumonia bc my kiddos breathing was sounding wheezy.
Interesting. I definitely had the worst flu of my life in December and my children caught it, and both had some difficulty breathing for a few days. Maybe a dumb question but.. Would that give us immunity now if it was indeed the same thing?
Alright well I hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend lola
Asking about specific placements isn’t allowed here for some reason:( its okay on /r/astrologymemes and /r/AskAtrologers though if you wanna repost this!
I think you might find [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/btz4ns/most_cap_moons_and_some_sag_moons_yes_you_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and comments really helpful!
Ahhh, yeah that makes sense. I think Pisces can be a very childlike placement if it’s not balanced out with some strong earth or fire signs. I have a lot of Aries, which helps, and without it I’d probably be looking for guidance all the time in an effort to feel grounded.
That’s interesting. I have Mars and Venus in Aries both in the 7th house which makes me a little relationship-crazy lol. I’ve had to teach myself to be picky about who I date because if I’m not careful I’ll stick with people who aren’t actually good for me. He has a lot of first house placements which do make him a little self-focused but he’s definitely a relationship person (his Venus is in 7th as well) and it’s actually been good for me to be with someone who has his own stuff going on because my Pisces tendency to get lost in people is kind of kept at bay. I’m more able to remember/focus on my goals and personal activities as opposed to other relationships where I got so wrapped up in someone that I lost touch with myself. All that to say, Pisces relationships might work better for you if she’s able to accept your individuality and let it encourage her to focus on her own as well.
I’d say trust your gut feeling pretty much regardless of placements:)
I’m so sorry for your loss, you’re a good sibling 💕
You have a lot of signs, and often times the sun sign is less relevant to the personality than others. For example I’m a Pisces, but I have a shit ton of Aries in my chart and it shows lol. So a lot of the classic Pisces descriptions (lazy, reserved, a pushover) don’t describe me at all. Put your info in [a birth chart calculator](https://horoscopes.astro-seek.com/#birthchart) and you’ll get a lot more insight into yourself:)
Yes, I have a bowl shaped chart and it’s said that people with this shape often feel incomplete, as though the “missing” half of the chart is felt but not entirely accessible. I only started studying astrology last year, but looking back at the charts of people I’ve dated, I see now that I have definitely been drawn to guys with heavy Taurus, Gemini, Leo, and Virgo placements. Maybe in part because they’re bringing some of those energies to the table that I don’t have a lot of on my own.
Definitely. This has been going on for quite a few years. Think how many apps you have and how many of them could easily be listening with your permission per the terms and conditions.
I love the 8th house.. its nothing to be scared of, honestly. Yes it deals with death but also rebirth, transformation, contracts, secrets, sex, etc. If it makes you feel any better, my 50 year old boyfriend has some of these placements and he’s one of the most well-adjusted and lucky mfers I know lol. He does have quite a fascination with horror movies though:)
My Saturn return was god awful, although in hindsight of course I can see how myself and my life is much better because of those trials. I’m at the end of my Sade Sati and it’s been really rough and just as life-changing but not nearly as heartbreaking as the stuff I went through with Saturn return.
The flight attendant said “I want this lady off my flight” and then the woman started apologizing, saying she was really stressed out, etc.
No worries I was actually responding to /u/nettlepunk about his Capricorn date:)

But re: your post, I’m dating a Leo guy and I’d say your best bet is just hype him up with genuine compliments often and carry on like it never happened. Next time something embarrassing happens to you maybe tell him about it for laughs so he remembers embarrassing things happen to everyone!
I’m a Pisces and I listened to Under the Bridge obsessively in high school so I could feel ALL the feels!
I really want to know what happened now
I love this. Decoding my toddler’s mystery phrases is one of my favorite things about having a toddler lol. I felt like a genius when I finally figured out “boocoos” was Blue’s Clues, “Lykeen” was Lightening McQueen, etc.
He looks unwell but someone showed me[this clip of him dancing with little kids](https://youtu.be/FUHlDlL_LbY) and it’s pretty damn cute so I’m pulling for him
I can definitely understand taking issue with him as a psychiatrist proposing that conclusion but he is far from the only one. The CIA did some [fascinating research](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf) on the topic of consciousness, that particular link is a rather dense read but it’s really fun to ponder all the potential implications if you’re into that kinda thing.
First of all thanks for engaging in convo with me respectfully. Secondly I’m not looking to convince you or anyone to believe one way or the other:) I do want to say though that a lot of the children remembered random people who the parents couldn’t have known about, and in some cases they recalled correct details that were not publicly available information. Also, for his consciousness theories he rely on theories of quantum physics/ quantum mechanics theories which is not the same as pseudoscience.  But I acknowledge that the birthmarks could be coincidence, some kids remembered incorrect details, etc. 

Again, believe what feels right to you and be as skeptical as feels right to you! I’m open to the idea of reincarnation but mostly in the camp of “who the fuck can ever really know how this crazy universe works.”
That’s a depressing yet empowering thought lol. On the one hand I don’t wanna be a bug but on the other hand now I feel like a badass for making it to the mammal level at least once. Fuck yeah, I’m a mammal!!
Lotta possibilities, like maybe their past lives were on other planets. Or maybe not everyone is reincarnated. Or maybe our consciousness spends time elsewhere before returning to a physical body so there’s not “extra” people right now, just a lot more here at one time than usual.

Edit: could also be that we reincarnate as creatures sometimes. If so I would like to be a bear next time because annual hibernation sounds awesome
I think you’d enjoy reading [Dr Jim Tucker’s](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_B._Tucker)  research. He’s a actually continuing another U. of Virginia School of Medicine psychiatrist/researcher’s work (Dr Ian Stevenson) so their combined collection of data from children who have past life memories spans decades. Most children lose these memories by age 7 or so. They’ve matched soooo many children’s memories with real life people it’s nuts. Interestingly most often the remembered deaths are traumatic or sudden in nature so lil suicide baby in the meme fits right in lol
Just let him go. I definitely understand the need for closure but some people just aren’t willing to have the conversation and he’s pretty clearly unwilling. You deserve to be with someone who wants to be with you, so put your focus on that, and try not to take it personally. Lots of great people out there will want exactly what you have to offer:)
Dreams of having a baby are usually to do with “birthing” a project, or a part of yourself, something like that. Similarly, a miscarriage dream can be about something that you maybe planned on or started working on that ended for whatever reason. But you were happy about it, so if there’s something you started/ended around 2 months ago that you feel good about it ending, it’s likely symbolizing that rather than an actual miscarriage. 

Dream interpretation is tricky with strangers because you don’t have any idea what’s going on in the dreamer’s life and feelings that may be symbolized, but hopefully that helps you get started:)
Whenever you’re “listening” you’re really just quietly wondering how long until you can talk about yourself some more.
Aww yay! No problem, I’m so glad it was helpful! Best of luck to you and your boyfriend! 🥰💕
I see what you mean now, thank you for clarifying. And you’re right, I don’t disagree. I just wanted to point out that there are more legit options than say, Co-Star, for example. And for someone like me (and presumably OP) who still has a lot to learn it’s kind of nice to have something simple to start with.
Not all astrology apps are social media based, and some of them are remarkably in-depth. TimePassages has over 70 aspects just for my birth chart, with most of the descriptions being multiple paragraphs long. Including less known aspects like bi-quintile, and asteroids like Juno. Their synastry is just as in-depth, but you do have to pay for the individual additional charts.
You sound a lot like me and my boyfriend! I’m a Pisces sun, Cap moon and he’s a Leo, Sag moon. It’s been about a year for us as well and we are really compatible. If you can get the app TimePassages, and pay 99 cents for his chart, you’ll be able to use their “compare charts” feature which is awesome. The most thorough and accurate synastry reading I’ve found. It spelled out what makes us compatible really well, and even explains the challenges in a helpful, hopeful way.
Heyyy you have the same placements as my little 3 year old boy:) Got any parenting advice for me?
If you can find out his birthdate you can find out his moon sign, Venus, north node and more which will be far more helpful than going by the sun sign alone. I’m a Pisces with a Leo boyfriend and those two signs are supposedly incompatible, but it’s a really lovely relationship.
For lent I’m giving up a little bit of work to work on my life. 

Not a bad idea actually.
Nodal returns, squares and reverses never miss me lol. You can read the timing and descriptions [here.](https://www.tdjacobs.com/2018/07/22/nodal-returns-squares-and-reverse-returns/)
I grew up in America but this one makes me sad too, I feel like humans are meant to live in community and sharing, taking care of each other but instead we isolate ourselves and just schedule time to not be alone once in a while.
I’m a Pisces with a Leo boyfriend. Sometimes our love languages aren’t exactly aligned, like he loves spoiling me with gifts and taking me to nice restaurants and stuff, which is very appreciated, but I’d be just as happy smoking a bowl whilst wearing jammies and talking about our childhoods lol. I’m a very affirming person though which works well with his need for praise:) And I love his physically affectionate nature. Our senses of humor are pretty compatible, too. I think if I’d met him earlier in my life I wouldn’t have appreciated our differences nearly as much as I do now. It took a long time for me to realize that being super similar to my partner doesn’t actually work out too well for me.  

Edit: another interesting thing is that according to the synestry of some other placements we have.. we should be butting heads a lot and having to reign in our tempers. But I have never had such a peaceful, gentle relationship before, and when we do have issues we’re able to talk a them out in a really empathetic and loving way. Which again may come down to having met at the right time
What was your experience like with this combo? I’m a Pisces and my baby daddy is an Aries. We have a 5 year old Gemini and a 3 year old Scorpio.  I like to think our parenting styles provide a well-rounded balance but I don’t know.
Pluto and Saturn making squares, oppositions and sextiles to practically everything in my chart lol. Basically the last two years have been an unending journey watching of everything I used to think would never change.. changing. Including my marriage (got divorced this past summer). Doing my best to sit with the uncertainty of it all and trust that greater fulfillment and self-realization are on the other side.
Aww lol they were giggling so much as they signed it I wondered if they were writing crazy stuff but I guess they were just happy to be signing it:) Thank you!
Thank you!
This was sad but I enjoyed reading the details. Thank you for sharing. If you don’t mind sharing, how do you feel about relationships in your current life?
At a theater where artists are allowed to sign the walls backstage. A bunch of teenage performers [wrote this](https://imgur.com/a/dVGvPId)  and I’d love to know what it says 😊
Mr Rogers for Pisces. Sensitive, gentle guy who lived to make people feel loved and empathized with. He had a 29* Pisces sun, with moon, mercury, and Venus in Pisces too lol.
Wow, TIL! Never really looked into these before but I just looked it up, and  my life has definitely shifted dramatically right on schedule with these returns/reverse returns.
No idea, we lived there for 3 years and never heard anything like that before or after.

So very grateful for any input at all. I can offer Dream interpretation in return!
This happened to me and my ex one time, when we were the only ones in the house. Two really loud knocks on the bathroom door.
The only place I have Gemini is my Chiron but feel like I relate to Gemini the most of any sign.
Could be, my partner’s north node is my sun sign and we have the Rare and Exceptional pattern. It specifically says that being together supports the person *he’s* becoming.
I’m a Cap moon/Pisces sun and I feel things very strongly, but I won’t reveal my feelings until I’m ready, which isn’t often, and I can only talk about my feelings to like ... 3 people. And even then it’s usually after I’ve ruminated over it and tried to feel better on my own for a long time.
I set mine for desired  nap length + approx how long I think it will take me to fall asleep + 10 minutes (because it always takes me longer than I think it will).
I can relate as I have a Pisces sun/Cap moon. But I’m learning to appreciate the beauty of being able to deeply empathize with people without getting swept up in whatever is going on with them. And that I can have my head in the clouds and my feet on the ground at the same time:)
I would definitely pass on the message, even if anonymously like /u/subfootlover suggested. Who knows, maybe this message could spur an awakening in her that would lead her to change her ways.
In my experience, you’ll only remember the things you’re ready to see. I had a deeply uncomfortable feeling of dislike, almost hatred, for a (very) minor celebrity on a show I used to watch, even though I had no conscious or logical reason why. Years later I’d mostly forgotten about him, but then I started thinking about him again at random times and feeling so uncomfortable. I tried past life regressions many times before eventually seeing flashes of a life in which he was my horrifically abusive uncle. Now of course that was not a fun thing to relive, but it was actually really helpful for me in working through some issues I had around sex and relationships with men. But if I’d remembered all that earlier I don’t think I would have been ready. What’s interesting too is that I no longer feel that anger or dislike of him anymore at all .. I actually find it comforting that he’s evolved over his lifetimes and is now, as far as I can tell, a good guy. We’ve probably all been horrible people in the past, so whatever you learn from it, know that it doesn’t define you now:)
I’m so sorry this happened to your girlfriend. She’s really lucky to have you in her corner.
I think a lot of people are intimidated by those who march to the beat of their own drum because they’re unconsciously forced to confront their own conformity. Like, we’re all incredibly unique at heart but when fitting in is your priority you suppress your own unique qualities, and then resent the people who are able to let theirs show. I hope that makes sense, it’s something I’ve thought about a lot as I’ve dealt with it in my own way. 

Keep doing you, you sound awesome:)

I got caught in that cycle for a while when I was young. I didn’t have enough self-respect to leave him but I had enough strength not to do what he said. Of course it’s shitty but some people just repeating what they see normalized and haven’t learned how much better and different a relationship can be.
 My brain went to the same place and I liked it.
I have Taurus in my 8th house, as well as Ceres in Taurus in the 8th.
What confuses me is that my north node is Taurus in the 8th house, and the descriptions of having a Taurus NN is basically the opposite of the 8th house NN description. Am I supposed to be embracing comfort and stability or learning to live without it?
I’m so sorry you lost your son ❤️❤️❤️
Reading/r/pastlives might make you feel better
My Venus is in Aries and I’ve never related to the “falls in and out of love quickly” thing. If I commit to someone it’s because I’m hoping it lasts forever. My Venus is retrograde though so that may have some impact.
Aww! Well needless to say I’m a big Sag moon fan 🥰And yeah the needing space thing took some getting used to because I felt rejected at first. But that didn’t stop me, because my Aries Venus/Mars loves the chase lol. Just curious but have you ever lived with a partner before and how do you handle your need for alone time ?
My two most significant relationships (including my ex who I was with for 12 years) have been with guys who had a Sag moon in the 1st house. From my perspective their common themes are loyalty and a deep, deep need for autonomy and freedom. Also both have a very fun-loving nature.
I love you! I can tell just by looking at you that you’re a kind person, and I bet you’re fun to hang out with, too. Keep being awesome, the world needs more people like you!
I'll believe you! You might enjoy checking out /r/precognition
That's so weird, but I've read similar stories before so you're not alone!
What time was it before you blinked vs after?
That's so beautiful!
No prob, I'm glad it was helpful! The collective unconscious fascinates me too! I started learning about it when I was studying dream interpretation and how our subconscious minds use similar themes (water = emotions, for example) in dreams to illustrate our deeper feelings. I think that, and probably many other influences (numerical, astrological, etc) probably play a big role in these types of person-to-person "coincidences" which aren't actually coincidental at all:)
Take your kiddos with you! I drove mine to randomly generated spot in the middle of a suburban neighborhood and there were like... 10 deer ambling around. It was wild and they loved it. Never know what you might see!
I don't have an explanation but I'd say definitely keep in touch with him. You can keep it light and casual and see where it goes.. Maybe you've found each other for a reason. If nothing else you know you've got a kindred spirit out there and that's always a blessing in itself:)
If it's a metaphorical dream.. He probably represents a part of yourself that you'd like to get reacquainted with, or there's something about him that you'd like to be more like. Think about his qualities and if there's anything about him you particularly admired. Could also be a glimpse into an alternate timeline:)
As a late-nights working mom of a 3 and 5 year old "quiet time" is vital to my sanity lol. Just having even fifteen minutes or so to myself really helps me regroup and keep going.
... What did she keep in there?

Good morning you sexy beast.
Maybe but I'm glad you did! I think I the way I worded that question was a little more bleak than I intended, and I agree with you. I'm still healing but it's a process of getting happier and happier:)  And a lot of my healing has happened through metaphorical dreams like these, because they help me identify what I'm feeling on an unconscious level, which is why your question caught my eye. Thank you for the thoughtful response.
Do you also feel like you went through hard times that dramatically decreased your capacity for joy to this day? Because that's where I think my shitty Disney World dreams come from.
I have recurring locations, but what happens there varies. There's a ridiculously large, mostly empty church that I wander around in sometimes. A post-apocalyptic Disney World where everything is shitty and unsafe but it's the best we can do.
I only date people who are mature enough to value the content of someone's character over the color of their skin.
One of the past life memories I have is of being a woman who died in the 1960s, with no spiritual/religious beliefs at all. I floated above my hospital bed and just kind of hovered there for a long time before I realized that I wasn't obligated to stay in the room with my body lol. After that I zipped around the world and saw things I'd always wanted to see, like the Eiffel tower, before eventually making my way up to the clouds and beyond to start the between-lives process. Which is a long way of saying that I think some souls need time to process the experience of not having a body, or they simply aren't ready to cross over because of fear, or the feeling of unfinished business in this realm, and that's probably where a lot of "ghost" sightings come from.

Edit: I don't attribute *all* spiritual entities to this sort of thing, though. I think energy, good and bad, can manifest in this realm all kinds of ways. And there's probably an untold number of extra-dimensional beings passing through at any given time that we can't fully perceive on this planet.

P.s. I was raised Christian as well. Welcome to the wonderful world of following your own path, wherever it may take you:)
A shuttle cock for bad mitten sounds like the title of a whimsical porn written by a children’s book author.
My boyfriend has never said "I love you" to me, even though I've said it to him many times. He's incredibly kind and affectionate and generous and thoughtful which makes me * feel* loved. But not hearing it is really starting to hurt.
I wrote about mine [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/7kcsq5/i_feel_like_i_was_healed_of_some_inherited_trauma/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
I went to school with someone who is getting fairly well known as a comedian. A few people found her annoying but most people, including me, thought she was funny. I guess it's still a little surprising just because so few people actually make it in the entertainment industry and she did it.
I think the idea that anyone can be a "bad" dancer is silly.. Just move your body in whatever way feels good to you, whether alone or with people! Those who make fun probably just wish they were brave enough to dance:)
It's never too late to turn things around, Geraldo.
I said no one of either gender should be forced into killing /being killed.. Didn't expect  that to be an offensive statement.
How about the kind of equality where no one of either gender gets forced into killing/being killed on behalf of some rich dudes.
My moon is in Capricorn and I feel like I'm good at stepping up to the plate for other people. Not so much for myself lol. Definitely feel guilty about my irresponsibility on a daily basis, but guilt doesn't seem to motivate me so I'm trying to be more self-affirming.
Yes! Been getting a normal amount of sleep at night yet feeling desperate for naps and caffeine just to get through the day. Way more dreams than usual, too.
[This article](https://grahamhancock.com/tellingerm1/) is really fascinating to me, they talk extensively about the pole shift and estimate the number of smaller circular structures similar to this one to be in the millions. But for more in-depth reading you might find [this](https://books.google.com/books?id=OY3lDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT78&lpg=PT78&dq=great+Zimbabwe+ruins+devil+built+it&source=bl&ots=AC0ZnInfRu&sig=ACfU3U3IMie9yQOwQR9Ce3etT7vrzS48Zw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwib54Gur-bmAhUJXc0KHdTDD-I4ChDoATAGegQIBBAB#v=onepage&q&f=false) and [this.](https://books.google.com/books?id=48hvDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA174&lpg=PA174&dq=great+Zimbabwe+ruins+magnetic+pole+shift&source=bl&ots=uNZUFtdb2e&sig=ACfU3U2pJuGBgNvEgYws-MyUkokGi33lsQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjAhbfHr-bmAhXRWc0KHbk_ApUQ6AEwGHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false) interesting. English explorers who "discovered" the ruins in the late 1800s found it inhabited as is illustrated in the picture I linked above, and documented some of the things locals said about it.
I think it would be super awkward at first, and yes painful for a while. But personally I believe the vast majority of people are really good at heart, and so much of the pain we cause each other is really because we ourselves are confused, afraid and hurting. And that telepathy would ultimately bring us closer together in a new way because we'd be able to feel the pain that's causing people to act the way they do, and maybe even inherently understand the source of their pain. And the feeling of being understood and empathized with would change people's lives for the better. I think there'd still be factions, but it would be a much more massive, yet simpler two-sided one of good vs evil instead of the every-man-for-himself sort of world we live in now. But I'm just speculating, of course.
Thanks for reading:) I have had mixed results sharing this with people in real life so it's nice to be able to talk about it and not feel like I'm coming across as crazy, haha. It's weird. I feel a deep sense of tragedy and loss looking at pictures of the ruins. And if really it was an accident that shifted the poles and caused us to lose telepathy, that really would be a great tragedy. To be able to communicate and empathize seamlessly and effortlessly and then suddenly everything changes for everybody in an instant and nobody understands why. Misunderstandings, uncertainty about people's motivations, and so much more would be a problem for the first time, and our resulting sense of being alone in the world would be so painful to experience all at once. And if that is what happened, it makes sense that there would be factions and people would start splitting up into tribes and inventing their own way of communicating, like in the story of the Tower of Babel.

Edit: another interesting thing about these ruins is that they've discovered hundreds of much smaller versions of it covering a wide area around it, as though the people who built it were experimenting and working their way up to the big one. And it doesn't make sense as a fortress, or city walls, or a place for livestock, or really any of the things we associate with ancient human lifestyles.
I have past life memories, and by far the most vivid one is of being shown the footprint of a massive structure and understanding something similar to what you're saying. Except the languages came to exist because of a sudden loss of telepathic abilities. As a child I would see the shape of this structure's footprint everywhere.. In clouds, popcorn ceilings, the floral pattern of my bedding, and it drove me crazy because I couldn't put into words what it was and how I recognized it. Then a few years ago I ran across [this image of the footprint of the Great Zimbabwe Ruins ](https://images.app.goo.gl/9AsrW5cpC3D13do98) and it stopped me in my tracks because it's the exact same shape I've remembered my whole life. Then I started reading more about the legends surrounding it and it sounds an awful lot like the Tower of Babel. There's even theories about it being some sort of natural energy producing mechanism that was just too big and too powerful and the people who built it ended up accidentally shifting the magnetic poles, which could indeed affect the way our brain "computers" link up. Anyway I could go on and on but it's a fascinating rabbit hole to fall down, for sure.

As you grow and evolve, you'll take on characteristics of the sign following your natal sun. For example, I'm a Pisces sun, and I still have many of those characteristics, but I've been a (progressed) Aries sun since childhood. And I relate to that because I had to learn to be more independent and assertive than the typical Pisces at a young age.
Who always has their DMs open if you need someone to talk to?
Not at all. Everyone needs to feel wanted and loved. I hope you find someone who appreciates you for you really soon :)
Speaking with kindness, hearing them out and acknowledging their feelings/perspective even if I disagree, and sharing my own feelings/perspective without insisting that my way of thinking about it is the only correct way. Basically I make every effort to have a polite discussion rather than an argument and by doing so I find that it's far more likely to go my way. And even if we stay on different pages, the relationship can usually carry on just fine.
I am!
Happy birthday!
Just call it a leg injury and reduce your recovery time by two weeks!
I love you
Aww thank you very much for saying that my man, I hope you have a great day too 😊
You're awesome, thank you for chatting with me about this. I agree with you that the media is pushing it pretty hard, and as someone who has  almost zero trust in the media I do have to question why. But at the end of the day I think it's a good thing for kids to feel free to explore the world around them without having to deal with all the cultural input they'll be dealing with the rest of their lives.. And if this kind of thing helps parents feel better about it/not read into it too much, I think that's great. 

Anyway thanks again, it says a lot about you that you'd earnestly consider the other side and be willing to change your way of looking at it. The world would be a much better place if more people were brave enough to do that. I have to work on it myself all the time.
I've read all your comments here and I'm not a fan of arguing. I'd like to understand your side. I don't get it yet but I'm trying. It seems you're okay with your son consciously choosing to dress as a "woman" once he's old enough to understand that what he's wearing will be perceived as feminine, and good for you.. I think that's great. What I don't understand is why you're not okay with a little dude playing dress up *before* he's old enough to have picked up on all the cultural/gendered associations. Isn't that inherently more pure in intention? It's like you want to teach him it's not okay but then be cool about it if he does it anyway, which (in my personal opinion) is kinda sad because then he'll only be able to express himself with the knowledge that he's going against what his parents have taught him is acceptable. 

I have a transgender friend who still gets emotional talking about the time as a child when they said they wanted to wear a waitress costume and their parents laughed at them and said no, that's for girls. It was the beginning of a 20 year long, shame-ridden hide out in the closet until they were finally able to even think about expressing their femininity again, and they still aren't close with their parents. Statistically the odds that one of my kids will be transgender, gay, etc is low but regardless, I'd so much rather be supportive of them wearing what they like than set up a precedent where they feel like they have to audit their choices based on my personal feelings. As long as they're safe and not hurting anybody I don't see any reason to get picky.
If a little boy wants to wear a dress it's got nothing to do with their sexuality and everything to do with wanting to look like a character they enjoy. My 3 year old boy likes to put my makeup on sometimes.. Bc mommy does it and it's colorful sparkly shit that can go on your face, all of which appeals to his toddler sensibilities. Assuming that makes him gay/trans/whatever would be idiotic.
I hear you on the first point but you can't just lock your door and keep sleeping when your kids wake up early. Unless they're old enough to be unsupervised, which takes years.

I walked through my apartment complex after a light rain and the sidewalk was covered in snails. Just... So many snails. It freaked me out but I kept on walking, until I crunched one. At which point I screamed and took off running, crunching snails and screaming all the way home.

Well done, Linda and Michael! Amicably co-parenting with your ex can be challenging, but the rewards are so worth the effort.
Pattern
I am! My day job I work with artists but not doing art myself. But I've been painting for a few years and sell them sometimes. Ultimately I want to be a filmmaker too! I'm learning how to animate, and I'd like to make short films. What about you?
Oh thank you, that made me smile:) And you're welcome.. Please feel free to reach out any time you have a dream you'd like some help figuring out. Of course you're the best interpreter of your dreams because you're living the experiences that lead up to having them, but it always seems to help me having someone read/hear mine and tell me what sticks out to them. I used to have chronic nightmares as well, and learning how to understand what my brain was trying to sort out/tell me made a huge difference. I also usually Google the setting and such for common interpretations which helps. Like last night I had a dream that took place in a stadium, and I was on a computer trying to animate. I read that dreaming you're in a stadium can mean that you are trying to be more assertive and put yourself out there more, which sure enough is what I'm trying to do with my art, so it makes sense.
Interesting, I'm a Pisces sun, cap moon and an INFJ. Makes sense since INFJ are known for their empathetic yet emotionally reserved ways.
Oh yeah I know, but it still might be relevant since the description of the metaphor (strangulation = stifled emotions, aggression) kinda fits with your description of the dog having to be kept in the garden due to being aggressive with certain people. I'm sorry it made you feel horrible.. Bad dreams can be really upsetting. I would interpret that as your mind's way of telling you that whatever the dog represents, be it stifling your emotions or something else, it's a valuable part of yourself that you should protect. No part of ourselves are ever really "killed" forever, they just get pushed back or forgotten but they're still there and you can nurture them. 

It might be worth a try to ask yourself what the dog represents before going to bed tonight. I do that sometimes and will get a new dream that illustrates it differently.
Hmm that's interesting.. I googled the meaning of dreams about strangulation and this came up: 

*In dreams the feeling of being strangled suggests a deliberate act of suppression. Strangulation suggests a violent act of suppression. Emotionally, our more violent, aggressive side may not allow us to act appropriately in certain situations. ... To dream of strangling someone is an attempt to stifle our own emotions.*

Maybe something in your life has made you feel like you were too aggressive, or said too much, or like you had to stifle your emotional responses? That might explain why your brain chose that dog, specifically for this dream.
Possibly, but that someone could also be you. The subconscious usually creates a character for each part of yourself that it wants to illustrate, so sometimes you are all the elements of the dream. Do you remember any more details, like how the dog was killed? How would you describe your cousin's dog's personality IRL?
Animals often represent a vulnerable part of yourself. It might help to think about it metaphorically, and whether you might feel like you've lost a part of your personality
Mars in Aries here too and same.
I'm a Pisces woman with a Leo man. I like our differences for the most part. The biggest hurdle probably had to do with his Sag moon though. He doesn't like to talk about feelings until there's a problem and I could talk about feelings all day lol. But I've learned to appreciate his "love language" of making fun plans and helping me with stuff instead of expecting him to express it my way.
Happy birthday! 🎈
If you look in the "shared experiences" section of a particular pattern, some of the comments may tell you what it's based on. A lot of things seem to be based on the Rising sign/MC.
Is your Rahu different from the north node? My western north node is in Taurus but if I do a Vedic chart I get Aries Rahu.
Me:)
Here's what it's like for me personally: 

The cons: Too much of my self esteem is tied up in feeling accomplished. I have an emotion and then I immediately feel compelled to ignore it, categorize it, explain it away, or feel bad for feeling it in the first place lol. I rarely get comfortable just ... feeling. I spend a lot more energy thinking about what I "should" and "shouldn't" feel. 

The pros:  It overrides a lot of the less helpful Pisces sun traits like laziness, lack of boundless, and so on. Also makes me popular with employers as I have a very overpowering urge to work hard. Edit to add: I like to think that as I continue to learn how to accept and integrate what I'm feeling, it will be even more of an asset. I hope I can learn to use my Pisces empathy and my Libra social skills, combined with Cap moon stoic side to be a port in the storm for others.
Thanks so much, and btw if you're ever interested in reading professionally I'd love to be a client. Just read your Kim post and its fascinating!

Well you sound like a good parent to me, and I appreciate that we were able to chat about our different perspectives without it turning into a pointless fight:) All the best to you and your family 💕
Wanting to wear someone else's clothes sure sounds like creatively experimenting to me. Obviously we'll have to agree to disagree here and that's fine. But my belief is at least partially formed by experiences like when I sat across the table from a gay friend of mine last year and held his hand as he cried about the time when he was 4 years old and his conservative, manly man dad made him feel ashamed for wanting to buy a Barbie. He's 30 years old and that shit still hurts. Another friend who is trans has memories of being laughed at by his parents for wanting to wear a waitress costume. These parents didn't raise manlier boys by censoring their interests/experimentation.. They raised boys who grew up to feel like their true selves weren't good enough for their parents.

I'm not saying you'd do these things, just explaining why I don't want to be the person who makes my kids feel bad about experimenting and liking what they like. They'll get plenty of that from the rest of the world, and when that happens, I've got their back.
I get you, I was just responding to the other person's question of why not. And I get your reason for saying no in your case. But yes I'd let him wear his sister's clothes to school if that's what he wanted to do and she didn't mind. He's only 3 but he's worn her shirt with the hearts on it out and about before. Lil homie just really likes hearts! As long as they're safe and not hurting anybody I try and let them figure out what they like without putting my personal feelings and bias in the mix.
I have kids and I let my son wear his sister's pajamas lol. They're the same size and she doesn't mind. He likes them so yeah.. Why not?
I think it's all pretty much done by AI. Like they have certain plug-in phrases for planet/sign/house/aspects and the robots then string sentences together based on your transits. For example my moon is in Capricorn in the 4th house, and my Venus is in Aries in the 7th house, so when there's a transit happening with my moon and Venus it might say something like "Explore what happens when you allow your sturdy emotional connection with home and family to recharge your energy for significant relationships." Sometimes it's eerily helpful and accurate, sometimes it's just word salad:)
Kids will be petty no matter what you do, though. I'd rather teach my kids to express themselves in spite of the occasional negative feedback than teach them to try and fit in. My 3 year old son likes fire trucks and digging in the dirt and stuff but he also likes having his nails painted different colors. He studies his options carefully and usually picks specific colors for specific fingers. It's cute. But if later on he stops wanting to do it I'll be cool with it.. I think there's a balance between encouraging them to be themselves and forcing them to buck the trend all the time. I hope I get it right but I'm far from the perfect parent.
That's so awesome! You're definitely not alone:) I wasn't feeling well and didn't have the best experience last night in particular but generally I find the days before, during and after a new moon and full moon to be extra beneficial for that kind of inner healing.
Libra rising with a lot of Aries and Scorpio. I'm petite, like 5'3" and 110lbs. Dark, curly hair which I usually have as a pixie cut or a kind of mop top lol. Big brown eyes, small nose. Often told I look like a fairy.
Libra rising, and this moon is transiting my 8th house. Also my north node is Taurus in the 8th house. I'm thinking about my future a lot, what will truly make me feel happy and comfortable. I'm also feeling a strong urge to examine my inner self and what my actual wants/needs are vs what I feel like I *should* want/need. My moon is in Capricorn so I don't often get the urge to just let myself feel what I feel. Riding the wave while I can:)
Full moons are great for releasing. Think about yourself as a cup and the feeling of heaviness as a symptom of being too "full." What behaviors, fears, thought patterns, etc are you ready to release?

Edit: the moon is in Taurus, so you can work with the energy of this specific full moon by also thinking about your five senses and indulging in pleasure. Take a long bath, eat something yummy, listen to beautiful music, etc.
No worries at all, just wanted to offer:) I bet you'll find the perfect deck in no time! I don't use tarot myself but I've enjoyed getting readings so if you ever want to practice on someone lemme know!
Well they say your first deck should be given to you:) If you're comfortable sharing a mailing address with me, send me a PM. I'd love to gift you a deck from Amazon! If not, no worries.. I've seen them in stores that sell games, and any crystal or magick shop should have them.
That's so cool.. You gotta do it! Keep me posted if you have time:)
Second house is in Scorpio, with Saturn in Scorpio and Uranus in Sagittarius there as well. I don't know what I'm good at but it sure isn't making/keeping money. Interestingly my South Node is in Scorpio in the 2nd house (using whole sign) so it seems I should be able to overcome this? But idk.. I'm still pretty new to astrology.
It's cool you had this dream so close to today's date of 11/11:) I typically read dreams metaphorically but this one might be worth looking into literally.. Get yourself some tarot cards and learn how to read! Even if it's just for fun.
I'm so sorry for your loss. I hope things look up for you as the days go by. Be patient with yourself.. I'm sure you know this but the grieving process takes time.  I'm always here for you if you want to chat ❤️
I have the exact same placements and disposition!
That's sounds about right! The circumstances of my childhood made me feel like I had to be very stoic and cheerful, especially around my mom. She's in a much better place now and our relationship is good, so I forget how much that probably still affects me subconsciously.
I think of Cancer like a mama bear. Looks very cuddly and sweet, likes to hibernate, but holy shit don't mess with her or her loved ones. I'm mostly basing this on my own mama bear, who is a lovely, very badass Cancer, and my Cancer granddad who was the same way. I'm a Pisces sun with a lot of Scorpio and while I have some great qualities from those placements, sometimes I think they're less practical/helpful in the outside world than Cancer qualities.
Oh that's really interesting. My south node is in Scorpio and my life came crashing down at age 27 .. I went full Scorpio lol and basically expedited the burn-it-down process myself so I could move on to rebuilding. And I had a pretty major epiphany that could be called a spiritual awakening. It was a rough time in my life but I'm thankful for it now. Everything I lost was just stuff I'd built trying to please or impress other people.
Oh man I totally do that lol. For me it's usually because something I've been ignoring/suppressing with various distraction tactics has suddenly bubbled up to the surface and I can't get it out of my mind. And because I don't like to talk about my feelings until I've had time to process them alone, I end up sitting there unable to pretend nothing is wrong, and unable to talk about what *is* wrong. It's awkward.

Edit: you can help by not forcing them to talk about it, just let them know you're there if they want to talk :)
Capricorn moon. I was just reading about it this placement this morning actually, bc I'm 34 and I still don't understand my own emotions very well!
I'd say that it applies to my current career in a sense. My midheaven is in Cancer and I work with a lot of emotionally sensitive people. A nurturing personality isn't required for my job, but it sure helps. Ultimately I'd like to be an artist full-time, and I can see how my art might take on some Cancer-like qualities eventually. Right now it's very Scorpio though.
Wow that's awesome, I can't think of a more appropriate profession based on your sun/rising. Empathetic yet very comfortable with death!
Re: the bowl shape, I find it confusing because some of the information I read seemed to indicate that the best way to move forward in life would be to work counterclockwise, starting with the first empty area, which would be Taurus/8th house. Others seemed to be saying that sorting out the Saturn/Scorpio 2nd house stuff would be the biggest factor. 

Re: the Aries at 29 degrees in the 7th house, I feel confused about what it means.. I got married too young and I still struggle with the balance between being myself and going for what I want vs truly merging with another person. And my north node is in the 7th house so I feel like this is important to figure out. Edit: I forgot that I used Whole Sign for this chart, which puts my north node in the 8th house. 

And finally.. My progressed sun hits 29 degrees in Aries next March, which feels significant. [Here's a pic of my progressed chart for that date.](https://imgur.com/a/C4oOMFO) In case it's helpful.

Any help or insight, suggestions, etc with any of the above would be *hugely* appreciated 🤗
Go for it I like to learn 🤓
What charity?
Why should I move my backpack off the one empty seat left on the bus when you're capable of standing? Why should I not be a murderer? We all do *a lot* of things because it's the right thing to do. Why do you want the people who run companies to be an exception so bad?
I'm glad you mentioned infrastructure because it's a great example of what I'm saying. Pipelayers provide an incredibly valuable service and the work is difficult AF. Starting pay is about $24,000 a year. Does that seem fair to you?
Yeah it would be dumb because bench pressing cars has no value. Getting the food I ordered in mere minutes does. And just because people aren't properly compensated for doing difficult work doesn't mean they shouldn't be.
If you have a dog capable of standing up for hours at a time in a hot kitchen, keeping track of multiple orders at a time, busting ass to collect /bag each order in well under 5 minutes, interacting with customers (many of whom are unpleasant), working with computer systems/cash registers and making correct change you should get that dog a TV show. 

I'll never understand why people think working at McDonald's is easy. I get tired just watching them.
Because the white car ended up on top of the red truck that tried to pull it out of the water. I think.
I'm no expert but I think that's more of a synastry question. Specifically where you have placements in each other's 5th house, maybe 4th house too.
Go to astro seek or horoscope yourself websites and make a birth chart using that info:)
Lol my 5 year old has been a demanding lil punk all morning. I was just telling her that she should try being positive and encouraging more often if she wants people to care enough to cooperate with her. This video couldn't have come at a better time.
The night I met my boyfriend, he had an astounding number of conjunctions happening with his natal Venus. And his north node was parallel his sun sign, which is kinda cool because his north node *is* my sun sign.
Mars in Aries, 7th house
I think just about everybody does that in one way or another.
Driving in a dream usually symbolizes the way your life is going. So the fact that you're the one driving and nothing scary happens is a great sign, probably indicates that you feel in control of your life. People who are stressed about life circumstances often dream they're driving a car with no brakes, for example. It being your dad's car probably symbolizes having to do some things your dad's way, or with his permission, which makes sense given your age. Just my perspective.. Take it with a grain of salt:)
Oh that's interesting.. Sometimes I think I might be projecting and it's actually me that keeps us from talking about stuff lol. I feel self conscious because my circumstances at present are keeping us from being able to progress. At any rate it's nice to hear that Sag moons are capable of getting excited about commitment :) The stereotype is so bleak when it comes to Sags and commitment!
My boyfriend has the same placements and this describes him to a T! I'm curious though.. How do you feel about talking about the future with regards to relationships? He's a Sag moon/asc so maybe that plays into it but he'll talk my ear off about nearly everything * but * the relationship. Even though all the other things he says and does point to him being as committed if not more so than me.
Hahaha that's a perfect nickname! I'm a Pisces sun so we probably have a lot of the same tendencies! I have dreams where I'm leading a goth girl army whose weapon of choice is literal fireflies.. Flies that zoom into buildings and burst into flames. Then another part of me, dressed in white, swoops in and saves the people I like. So clearly there's a subconscious conflict within me between wanting to help everyone and wanting to watch it all burn to the ground lol
I'm a Libra rising with Pluto in Scorpio in the 1st house. I make a very cheerful, feminine first impression and then people seem surprised when I'm *very* comfortable with the dark/sexual/taboo sides of life. I also have very dark brown eyes.
It's 6 people standing with their arms in the air. Look at the black space between the women's legs as tall skinny women in a dress and the vulva is a neck/head. Once you see them you'll see two men in between them and men on the far left and right sides.
I have co-star and use it as a quick reference point sometimes, but astroseek is a lot more detailed, and will give you more information. Such as your North and South nodes which (imo) are some of the most helpful things to know about yourself! But I definitely recommend supplementing your knowledge by Googling stuff, no app or website really covers everything. Time Passages is another great app btw!
Google "Venus in Aries" and read some articles. Then Google "Venus in the 5th house" and read some more. The combination of what you read will give you a fuller picture.

Edit: astroseek gives birth charts that include interpretation of both house and sign, but it's usually a very brief description.
From what I can tell it can cause people to be extremely cautious about entering a relationship or even having sex. I was in my 20s before I had sex and in my 30s before I had sex with someone else. From what I understand, that's not uncommon with Venus retrograde people. I really like sex, I'd just rather be celibate than be intimate with someone I don't feel a strong connection with. [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/d9ccww/anyone_have_a_partner_with_natal_venus_retrograde/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) might be helpful.
*Science is not a belief system; it does not rely on hopes and dreams.*

I completely agree with you, which is why I'm sharing scientific research with you instead of my hopes and dreams. I have no idea whether or not Pluto, or the apparent "retrograde"  of planets, etc affects us. Neither do you. But thanks to decades of research, we *can* say with mathematical certainty that the cycles of the moon, as well as some of the inner planets, do in fact affect us. I don't think you were expecting that, so you're pretending like I'm linking you to pictures of voodoo dolls burning in sage piles rather than engaging with what I've actually written. 

I also agree with you that clinging to beliefs is anti-science, which is why it's disappointing to see you clinging to your belief that planets have no effect on us, despite being shown hard data indicating that some of them do. I linked you to properly, scientifically conducted research on the topic of planetary effects on humans, hoping to have a cordial, science-based discussion.  It seems you're more interested in being insulting (i'm not insulted, but it feels like you want me to be), and arguing against a meme that I'm in no way trying to defend, so I don't really know how to engage with you now. Arguing on the internet just isn't my thing, but lemme know if you ever feel like discussing research and the implications of the results.

 Btw I checked out your music and you're very talented. I also work in film, and I used to live in Ocean Beach:)
If you believe in science, and I suspect that you do, then approach this scientifically and see if the evidence supports your hypothesis. You stated earlier that the planets, moon, etc do not affect personality, life experiences, etc. Conveniently, this is by definition a null hypothesis, which means that nearly all the research [found here](https://www.astrologer.com/studies) applies to your hypothesis. Statistically significant (meaning that, mathematically speaking, the correlations cannot be attributed to random chance)  evidence rejects this null hypothesis. Which, as scientific research usually does, brings up a whole slew of new questions! You've already listed some really great ones in the comment I'm replying to now. Which is why it's a bummer to see you close by re-stating your belief that it's all silly and nonsensical, rather than examining the evidence and seeking the answers to your own questions. Asking questions and examining the evidence is the best approach we humans have for learning about our universe. The idea that the earth revolves around the sun was once considered silly and nonsensical too, but naturally the scientists of the time kept asking questions and examining the evidence, and found it to be true.

And FWIW I do understand where you're coming from. I'm 34 years old and up until May of this year I believed that astrology was a bunch of make believe woowoo nonsense. (And to be fair, the so-called "astrology" seen in memes and pop culture very often *is* made up, written by people who aren't even using astrological methods to back their claims.) But when I ran across an article citing scientifically conducted studies showing that ancient astrological methods can be used to predict certain human behaviors and experiences to a statistically significant degree, I had to accept that I might be wrong. Of course you are fully entitled to your beliefs, and fully entitled to disregard any evidence contradictory to your beliefs, but there's a lot to be said for keeping an open, curious mind. Without open, curious minds there would be no scientists:)
Dreams are often metaphorical, but this one might be a little more straightforward. Perhaps you've been thinking (even just hypothetically) about having sex, and what the ramifications would be in a worst case scenario. Or maybe you're trying to separate your true feelings about sex from how your parents raised you to think about it. Just my perspective, may or may not be true for you! FWIW I grew up in the same kind of household, and it took me a while to let go of the guilt/shame/fears I had about sex. But ultimately these types of dreams are helpful and probably a good sign that you're letting go of some obstacles to being yourself:)
Well now you're just being obtuse lol, my second link has a long list of statistically significant data on the effects of not just the moon, but many of the other planets. Everything is cited and you can even read many of the studies yourself and see the data. If you just feel like arguing, knock yourself out. But calling research done by PhDs using blind studies and scientific methods of measurement "voodoo" makes no sense.
*In no way does it effect humans' emotions or personalities or life experiences.* 

There's an awful lot of statistically significant data suggesting otherwise. [Here's a very small collection of examples. ](https://www.near-death.com/paranormal/astrology/scientific-evidence-suggestive-of-astrology.html) And [more here.](https://www.astrologer.com/studies) But there's lots more out there if you're interested.
Thank you for saying that, I hope it helps someone. I'm very glad you're still here ❤️
This made me sad. I'm sorry your parents reacted like that when what you needed  was empathy and support.
I hope you feel better soon!
This is so cool, I can't wait to try it. Thank you for sharing!
It could be a reflection of how you feel you're currently progressing through life. For example, when people are feeling good where they're going in life they might dream of driving a nice car down a beautiful road. Or flying in an airplane. Lately I've been dreaming of being in a car that's out of control with no brakes, so you're not alone lol.

Can you think of anything in your life lately that you've "killed"? It could be a relationship, an idea you decided not to pursue, a part of yourself that you've suppressed, or even someone who's feelings you hurt. The fact that you did it without thinking, but felt bad afterwards is probably a helpful clue.
I'm so sorry to hear that. ❤️
Same here, and I don't relate to the typical Venus in Aries description very much. I'm extremely choosy about who I have sex with and rather than lose interest quickly (as Venus in Aries supposedly do) I'll stick around way longer than is healthy for me.

In answer to your question OP I think I interact fairly normally, but under the surface I'm a bundle of insecurities for the beginning of the relationship, and even once I'm settled in I have an underlying fear I'm not good enough. I've come a long way but I still need fairly regular reassurance from my partner.
That's actually an urban legend and not at all based in factual evidence. The universe and I have arrived at the conclusion that you're a six foot tall pile of awesome.
I would love that. Someone posted a dream here like a year ago where aliens invaded and created a test to determine whether she was a real human or an alien in disguise. It said "What did you do last summer? Yes or No?" And she was sweating it out trying to guess what the aliens thought a human would respond. That needs to be a meme I still laugh when I think about it.
I'm glad it was helpful! And congrats on making big strides forward:)
I'm a straight woman and I'm not even on Tinder but Samantha has the power to change all that.
Definitely start keeping a dream journal, it will help you start remembering them with way more clarity. Also check out /r/precognition you're not alone:)
The profile pic in my dream was a little different, her pose was less sassy and more "FML" with her shoulders slouching, arms down, and she was frowning.. but I could only find so many options for images of women in coveralls.
Isn't it crazy? I only discovered the nodes a few months ago and I was amazed, as my north node is precisely what I had realized that I needed to cultivate in myself earlier this year. I showed a friend of mine how to look up his and he had the same reaction. Best of luck to you, we got this!
Driving = your life path. The dream with your high school friends might have been about the path you were on back then. 

Bridge = connection between things. So it could be past/present and future, for example, where an unfinished bridge represents an uncertain future or unclear path to get what you want.

Bus/bus station = public aspect of your life journey, or the parts of your life that you have less control over. 

These are just some possible metaphors to consider. Dreams are usually little stories we tell ourselves to illustrate how we feel. So think about the feelings in the dreams and what they might represent for you personally. Like the fear of heights you have in the dreams might represent a fear you have about "falling" or losing control in some aspect of your real life right now.
Thank you so much!
Normally I default to the metaphorical method of dream interpretation, but this is one of those dreams that feels more spiritual/energy related to me. I do think it's relevant that you're doing EMDR therapy right now. If I had to guess, I'd say that you're probably ridding yourself of some yucky energy that accumulated in the time you lived in that house, and the therapy is bringing it to the surface to be dealt with. So while I'm sure it was awfully scary, it's probably a sign of progress. /r/energy_work Might be a good resource for releasing it, just remember that you're safe and in control:)
Would you mind recommending a website? I've tried astroseek and the TimePassages app but neither of them seem to include North node in their synastry interpretations. The person I'm seeing now, his north node is my sun sign which I'd think would be a good thing but I'm an astrology newb.
How can you tell that he's activating your north node?
Your sister and I have the same sun/moon placements:) I agree about the pushover stereotype. I think it's because Pisces are intuitive enough to recognize *why* someone is behaving badly and empathetic enough to give them a pass if they feel like it. Like if someone is going off on me about some trivial thing, I can see that they're actually stressed/angry about something that has nothing to do with me, and it makes me feel like figuring out what's actually bothering them more than getting defensive. So from an outside perspective it looks like I'm just incapable of standing up for myself, when actually it's a conscious choice to let them off the hook and see if I can help. My Mars is in Aries though so I'm fully equipped with a temper lol.. It just doesn't flare up easily.
*or to run away from people/relationships if you feel pressure to conform to circumstances or the partner. I love Aquarius so I think that's a nice placement, however.*

Oh snap that's definitely me. I can hang in there for a while (i just ended a 12 year marriage that I was mentally ready to leave 6 years ago) but I feel very claustrophobic when a partner expects to have a lot of sway in my decisions. I'm still trying to figure out what's fair in that regard. 

And I love Leos btw.. I have no Leo in my chart and I wish I did! There's just a cheerful magnetism in the Leos I know that draws me in like a moth to a flame lol. I'm currently seeing a Leo sun/Sag moon which seems to be working out well in that he needs his freedom and respects mine. The lack of communication is trying, though.
Secondary characters often represent parts of your psyche that aren't fully integrated. Sex, kissing, etc often represents the integration or "merging" of this part of yourself into the whole. So for example if you've been working on being more assertive, your subconscious might illustrate that with a dream like this. That's just one possibility to consider. You can try asking yourself what the man represents as you fall asleep, and it may be illustrated in a different way with a new dream.
My Jupiter is in Aquarius in the 4th house. Of all my placements I've probably looked into that one the least.. I'm still not sure how it manifests in my life. My Venus is in the 6th house and opposite the ascendant within 3.5 degrees, according to TimePassages. Would that be considered wiggle room? Mars opposite ascendant within 4.5 degrees. I don't relate to the Venus in Aries descriptions very much.. I never knew why but what you said about the double negative and directing the typically "outward" tendencies onto oneself is interesting and got me thinking! Mine is 22 degrees so (from what I understand) if I were to pick up on the tendencies of another Venus placement it'd be Taurus? But I relate more to the Venus in Pisces descriptions.
Hey cool I'm a Libra rising, too! I wish I could take credit for the chart analysis but it must have been someone with a similar user name.. I'm still kinda new to astrology! But I'm glad another "Your friend" or "Mary Grace" out there was helpful, ha:):)

My Lilith is also in Aries, as is my Mars, both in the 7th house and conjunct my Venus. It occurred to me recently that in all my major relationships there's been an ongoing power struggle, where my independence and need for autonomy is perceived as a threat to the relationship. I'm also very choosy about who I have sex with, to the point of long periods of celibacy, even though I have a really high sex drive. I don't even know why, but I just can't do causal sex. And I'm happy with how I look now, but it's been a loooong road to get here!
How do you feel like it affects you? I'm a retrograde Venus in Aries.
I've forgotten several, including the big one that seemed to cause some major glitches in the following days. I take it as a sign that my jump was so successful I've just forgotten the previous timeline :)
You can find out right now using [this free calculator.](https://www.findyourfate.com/astrology/northnode.html) Once you know what nodes you have, Google "North node in ___" and read a few different sites to get a good understanding. 

If you do locate your chart, it should also tell you what houses your nodes are in, which will give you even more insight into your soul's journey:)
I love all of this. She's very artistic but she has a short attention span so I think something that requires figuring it out as she goes would be perfect, and hold her attention better. Thanks so much for the suggestions:)
This is SO fascinating.. I absolutely give in to her wanting to quit things all the time, and I would say I've been doing less discipline than I'd planned. I'm a softie Pisces sun lol but I can see how it is more helpful to her in the long run to teach her perseverance and responsibility now. Thanks for taking the time to respond, it's really useful stuff!
Wow it's really good you brought this up because her dad and I are (very) recently divorced, so there's lots of changes happening, and my tendency is to keep her out of the loop unless it's a big, obvious thing that needs to be discussed. But she's so observant that I find her asking questions that she wouldn't be asking if she hadn't already picked up on a lot of what is going unsaid. Thank you.
If you're open to astrology, calculate your birth chart and see what your north node and south node is. They're commonly known as karmic parts of the chart, with the north node being the traits you should develop, and the south node being what you need to overcome. For example, my south node is in Scorpio which indicates my past lives have been dramatic, and probably full of control/abuse issues. This is reflected in my past life memories and has been true for my current life as well. And my north node is in Taurus, so I'm meant to learn how to be in control of myself alone and build a stable, enjoyable life for myself.
I suppose it comes down to a matter of belief, but personally I believe that our loved ones (animals included) can use the dream world as a vehicle to come check in on us and let us know they're still around. I had some very memorable dream moments of conversing with my granddad after he died, as did several other people in my family who were close to him. 

I'm sorry for your losses, and hope it helped to be able to see them again ❤️
This is so helpful and encouraging, thank you! It definitely sounds like her.. She loves to paint and seems to have a knack for learning languages. My challenge with her is that she is very interactive, she doesn't like to entertain herself and wants me to be engaged in everything she does, and she wants to do a LOT! So I'm always looking for ways to keep her busy so she doesn't feel ignored when mama needs a minute :)
I'm so sorry to hear that. ❤️
My 5 year old daughter is a Gemini sun and moon, Pisces rising. Would you guys mind sharing your parenting tips? What helped (or would have helped) little you thrive and feel supported growing up?
I'm a Pisces sun and a Capricorn moon. I consider it a blessing because the practical, down-to-earth Cap qualities help me regulate my spaced out Pisces tendencies:)
You're the best interpreter of your own dreams so the following is just my first impression. Take what's helpful and disregard the rest!

Seeing her in a gritty fast food restaurant = this was not a healthy or nurturing relationship

Resembling someone you dislike = seeing with new clarity the aspects of her that didn't jive with you

All black clothing = endings, closure

Holding a baby = new beginnings 

FWIW I find it's pretty normal and common to dream of an ex once you find a better partner. When you're still single and searching, it can be harder to process the emotional impact of a past relationship, and harder to see it clearly, too. You've found someone more compatible which makes it easier for your brain to sort out what was wrong before. Think of it like self-therapy. It's possible you woke up after "Did you ever love me?" Because that's not something you can really be certain of either way. 

Hope that helps, and best of luck with your new relationship :)
The hot and cold thing?
Ok, thank you for the straightforward feedback! I definitely don't want to change him, I guess I just wanted to understand if this is his true nature or if I'm just not someone he feels safe opening up to or what.
He's a Leo sun, not positive but I think he's an Aquarius rising. No Aries in his main planets, but a Neptune in Scorpio. Venus in Gemini. Yes to the temper tantrum /letting it go quickly, though the tantrums have (so far) been directed at people he feels are being tricky or unfair and not at me. He does get jealous/pissed at the thought of guys hitting on me, though.
I... I am so glad you told me this. That's the opposite of my natural reaction lol. Thank you! But what if he never brings up anything that's bothering him, like ever, until eventually he's so fed up about something that he wants to end things and it's something I could have made better if only I'd known?
Does anyone here have advice on getting a sag moon partner to open up about his feelings, or at least admit to having them?
That's amazing! If you haven't already looked at the research into past lives, I think you'll be surprised how much evidence there is to support it. Jim Tucker is a great place to start.

That being said, I find it's helpful to think about it from the perspective that regardless of whether or not the memories are "real", these images and storylines came from your own subconscious mind. So there's something in Oliver's experiences that you can learn from or relate to in this life. I did one of those regressions and had vivid recollections of being a really sad and sexually degraded woman named Marnie who married for money and then spent the rest of her life depressed and bored out of her mind. I've always had a strong desire to marry for love, respect/own my sexuality and make my own living, and maybe those hard lessons Marnie learned are part of the reason why. Or maybe it's just a story my brain told me to illustrate how I feel. Either way, it was helpful:)
Thanks for the update! How would this affect someone with their Venus in Gemini?
I don't know!  But I do think it gets easier with practice. For me the mental diet definitely seems to be helping. That being said, last night I found myself worrying again haha.. So I'm still learning!
I'm reading this 44 minutes after you posted it:)
I'm so sorry for the things you never got to experience with him. I bet he's so proud of you he can't stand it:)
First of all I'm really sorry you're feeling this way ❤️ 

I'd suggest you start by manifesting better self-esteem. Imagine that you're happier and more confident in yourself than you've ever been. Imagine that you're turning heads when you walk into the room, or getting compliments that make your day .. Whatever feels like a "wish fulfilled" of being a confident person to you. Just leave SP out of it as much as possible for now. And when you do think of him, try to simply intend that he's happy and fulfilled, too. I know it's not easy, and definitely give yourself a grace period of processing that anger, but it will help you in the long run to work towards genuinely wishing him well in life, with or without you. 

Once you've got that self-esteem up, then work on the SP. By then you may not even be interested in getting back together, but if you are, you'll be all set to have a healthier, happier relationship.
SAT = "State akin to sleep", but I'm not sure how it might be translated into the books you've read. It's the method of getting very relaxed, but still awake, and visualising the end result of what you intend to manifest. 

SP = Specific or Special person. It's not a Neville term as far as I know. It's used by people who have a particular person (usually someone they know, like a friend or an ex) they want to date.
Damn, that's exciting.. You're a badass and you got this!
There ya go, perfect step one for your new formula! I like being subscribed to  /r/hydrohomies because it's like a wholesome drinking game for me lol. If I'm scrolling Reddit and I see one of their posts I stop and drink some water. It also helps me to keep a reusable water bottle I can carry around with me. It's a little annoying to keep up with, but that's part of what makes it an effective tool for remembering to hydrate:) Once you get used to the (wonderful) feeling of being well hydrated for a few days in a row I bet it'll become a habit. The mental clarity alone makes it worthwhile, not to mention you'll start to look and feel more healthy!
Without any specifics it's hard to offer advice, but generally speaking I think starting with small changes in the way you're going about life can get the ball rolling. Go to bed thirty minutes earlier tonight, drink a little more water than usual tomorrow, say hi to that neighbor you usually don't speak to:)
Kind of depends on the context of the dream but it often represents some new or underdeveloped part of yourself. Could be an aspect of your personality that's ready to "grow", or even an idea you'd like to see brought to life. Feel free to message me if you'd like some help with anything specific from the dreams.
Usually overwhelming emotions. Maybe you've been through (or are in the midst of) an emotional experience. The good news is that you either made it through or you're well on your way to making it through :)
Oh man, that's a lot of stress to deal with and I think it's understandable that you'd feel totally overwhelmed by it. But it's also the kind of thing that, a few years from now, you could be telling a new partner or friend or colleague about and they'd say "What?!? YOU did that?!" And laugh their ass off because it is so out of character for the person they've come to know and love. One of my favorite people in my life is a guy who got DUIs and stole shit in his younger days, even spent some time in jail. And now he's so damn accomplished and successful and happy that I (a relatively successful woman with two kids) look up to him a lot. 

Point is, as bad as this may seem, it is really and truly okay and you can get through it and come out the other side with lessons learned and a hell of a story. Try and cut yourself some slack.. We're lucky to have you here and I really hope you stick around. ❤️
I often dream of my friends as a representation of some part of myself. And sex dreams can often be symbolic of merging/integrating/accepting two (or more) disconnected parts of yourself. It might be helpful to think of the first thing that comes to mind when you think of each friend. 

For example, let's say Kevin is really comfortable in social situations. A dream about having sex with him might be your subconscious mind's way of illustrating that there's a part of you that can also be comfortable around new people, and you can integrate it.
You would probably find /r/astralprojection very useful. You're already halfway there!
I think first and foremost you should follow what brings you joy. That being said, *Real* love, in my opinion, doesn't involve trickery and confusion and demands of loyalty. It's just freely given to you as you are. I'm wary of anyone or anything that expects you to jump through hoops to meet their needs/desires. It sounds like both these fellas have you in a rather vulnerable and confused place, even as they may *say* it's for your own good. You are all you need to be empowered and vibe high.
I don't know that there's anything we can be 100% certain about in this realm of existence.. That's part of the adventure:) But you might find it helpful, or at least entertaining, to do a past life regression meditation on YouTube. I saw myself in vivid detail as a humanoid cheetah looking being from another planet who decided to come here to spread love and light. The revelations about that life, and what I was like "before", continued to come to me through dreams and meditation for about a year afterwards. Regardless of whether or not it's "true", it all came from my subconscious mind and really helped me know myself better, as well as refocus my energy and refine my goals for this lifetime.
I haven't experienced flips with anything but Fruit Loops, and it seems to flip every few months for me!
This reads like a message from you to yourself that you can be more assertive. It's all started with you saying yes to a date, not because you're dying to go but because you don't want to be rude. And then you stay in a very uncomfortable situation because he told you to. You only get freedom in the end by doing what you want and need to do in spite of the guy's orders. It seems like a horror story about being passive, in other words. 

But that's just my interpretation, and I might just be seeing it that way because I tend to be way too passive and I'm working on being more true to myself:)
Gotcha, thank you for clarifying:) We're probably going to have to agree to disagree here but personally I believe holding fast to love and light is the only way to "fight" the dark. Responding with violence only begets more violence and round and round it goes. Nothing new about that. I also believe that respecting the free will of others is essential to being truly loving and as such we can't really "wake people up". We find our own way when we're ready.
Ok but what does "fight" mean to you? As in physical violence?
What do you mean by fight?
Is that across the street from the Thinkery?
Four years ago. At the time there were a lot of sightings reported around there, and IIRC there was a group of Austin people who would meditate together at night in Manor because it always seemed to "summon" UFO. But I should have said it *used to* be a hot spot, as I don't know how many have been spotted there as of the last couple years.
Manor seems to be a hot spot for UFO, I saw one there on my 30th birthday:)
Keep googling them, there's an article for just about every number you could possibly see. But know this: the idea of "good" and "bad" numbers is a human concept, angels will only send you love and encouragement. I get 43 pretty often and I like the last paragraph of [this interpretation](http://sacredscribesangelnumbers.blogspot.com/2011/07/angel-number-43.html?m=1) as it often crops up when I'm overwhelmed by the clutter in my home or workplace.

Edit: oops, just realized you said 42 not 43:) but hopefully something I said was helpful anyway!
Can confirm. Am the wife.
Interesting that they chose to live as the person they don't remember being. I would rather continue living the life I remembered, and as a family member I'd rather be around the person who thought/acted/remembered as the person I knew than be with a virtual stranger who only looked like my loved one.
Thank you!
Dreams of having a baby are often about birthing (or in this case losing) a part of yourself. I think it's interesting that the baby looked fake to you. My guess is that the baby represents some aspect of yourself that you lost in the process of dating/breaking up with him. The fact that you're not very sad about it and it didn't look real to you in the first place maybe suggests this part of yourself and wasn't a part of who you truly are. 

Just something to consider:) If it doesn't resonate, disregard!
Happy birthday!
This is a synchronicity for me.. I had a strong urge yesterday and this morning to lie in the grass and get some sunshine. I felt a little bad about it both times because my brain was so quick to remind me that there's chores to be done, gotta get ready for work, etc. But yesterday my 2 year old seemed to read my mind and ran into the back yard and stretched out in the grass, smiling. I followed suit and then did it again this morning. That little bit of spontaneous relaxation, just for the pleasure of it, seemed to set my whole body and soul on a better track!
Reading this at 11:11 😊
Oh my, never knew about this before but it's super intriguing.. Thanks!
I think so too, and I wonder if the magnetic pole shift believed to have happened many thousands of years ago may have messed up earth's frequencies, or messed up our ability to receive them. I've also wondered if this is where the Tower of Babel story comes from. People working together to build something suddenly lose their ability to communicate and have to invent languages amongst themselves.
You're welcome, so glad to hear it was helpful! I relate to that very much, especially the fear. There's always a dozen what-ifs that stop me from doing things that I know would serve me and others well. We can unlock those chains, I believe in us 😊
"Mindless" activities like riding the bus can put you in a hypnotic state much like meditation. So it could have been some subconscious imagery coming through, not unlike a dream. It might help to think about it metaphorically. Bikes are used to move us forward, is there a metaphorical bike you're leaving chained up when you could be well on your way to something/somewhere else? Could be a spiritual, emotional or even literal journey you're ready to go on. When I was ready to go back to work after having my baby but I was nervous and hesitating, I started dreaming of cars stuck in a garage.
Feel free to send me a message.

I thought he meant it like if you're afraid of death it would mean that you love life. But I may have misunderstood!
It might be helpful to do some imagination work with the end result in mind. Imagine your excitement in telling your mom how everything is going at work. Imagine how you feel a little nervous on your first day. Imagine a year from now, when you are welcoming a new employee and remembering back to when you were the new guy:) 
I had an interesting conversation with my husband the other day that, prior to learning about the ME, would have turned into an argument lol. We were discussing some decisions we made over the summer and the motivations behind them. Without going into boring detail, basically the way I remember his motivations are completely different from the motivations he remembers not only having, but discussing with me at length. Before, this would have angered me, and I would have thought he was delusional. But seeing how ME has effected us both differently, some of the differences being cultural stuff that has happened since we've been married, I feel like there's really no use trying to insist that I'm right about how I remember him feeling. We might just be coming from slightly different timelines! 
Ohhh I get it now, that makes so much sense! Thank you for clarifying, gonna try it tonight:)
Do you set an alarm for every 90 minutes?
If Nikola Tesla and Johnny Depp had a baby.
That's really sweet 😊 One of my co-workers was telling me recently that his wife watched the Andy Griffith Show every night at the same time. After she passed away, he was watching a game with his friend, neither of them touching the remote, and the channel flipped over to the Andy Griffith Show not once, but twice! They were really in love and when her cancer got really bad, she told him before she died that she would do her best to let him know she was saying hi from the other side. He had a lot of cool experiences like this. ❤️ 

ps so sorry for your loss, hope it's a comfort to know he's never really gone. 
It's usually a good thing, a sign that you're discovering new or long forgotten parts of yourself. The windows might represent that this part of yourself gives you a new outlook on life, or the world around you.

Probably so, the subconscious tends to tell stories to help us work through whatever we're consciously thinking about! You might really enjoy taking something like [Meyers Briggs](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test) to help you get to know yourself better. I was in the same boat, trying to figure out who I was without the outward influences, and it really helped me to take this and read about my type. If the first result you get doesn't feel like it describes you very well, [try this one!](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp) 

Hope that helps 💕
Re: your post title, you might find it interesting to check out the recent research coming out on the nature of our dreams. It would seem that they are often [meant to be helpful in processing our emotions and experiences.](https://walkerlab.berkeley.edu/reprints/Gujar-Walker_CC_2011.pdf) 

Anyway, I think the finale of the dream is quite interesting, because bathrooms are where we tend to our most private business, and in dreams they often represent the same thing. But you're in a public bathroom, which seems to be a hint that this is symbolizing a private element of your life that is difficult to keep under wraps. The costume, or rather pretending that you are wearing a costume, makes me wonder if there's some part of yourself, or your personal life that you try to "disown" in front of others.

But you are the best interpreter of your dreams, since you alone know what's on your mind and what's happening in your life. If any of this was helpful, awesome, but if not.. Please disregard! 💕
Asking for help is an act of STRENGTH, not weakness. There's nothing pathetic about it, and the sooner you can accept that, the faster you'll be able to make some strides. This has been the biggest lesson I've had to learn this year, and it's tough. It's sad because we come into the world as little babies who are completely dependant on others for survival, and we accept this about ourselves naturally. But over time we internalize messages about being independent, and forget that humanity wouldn't have survived, nor would it continue to survive, without relying on each other. It's natural and human to need help, and by asking, you're giving people like me a chance to experience the joy of lending a hand. 

Another thing I see in your post is the negative spin you're putting on your life story. I have "failed" at many things as well, but that's just one way to look at my life. I could just as easily frame my "failures" as many different things I've had the opportunity to learn. The story we tell about ourselves is very, very powerful, and sets the stage for our future. So look again at your life experiences, and think about how much you've grown, what you've learned, what lessons and experiences you've had that you can utilize in your new chapter. 

I also recommend taking a personality test that can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses. I really like [Meyers Briggs ](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test) which of course is not perfect, but has really helped me to understand myself and how I best fit into the world! 

Okay, I could go on and on but the most important thing I wanna say is that you are doing great!! Housing, debt, wealth, and all other forms of material "success" can never, ever tell us about who you truly are. You were worthy of love and acceptance the day you were born, and you didn't bring a dime with you 😉❤️ The same is true for you now, even if it doesn't feel like it. I love you and I'm proud of you. And  I'm here for you anytime! 
Dreams like this usually represent neglecting yourself in some way. Water often symbolizes emotions, so perhaps you have some emotional "cleaning out" to do. The big, dangerous fish could represent anger, sadness, or some other feelings that are affecting your well-being. 

Of course, this is just one possible interpretation. Thoughts?

I have similar dreams about trying to protect my daughter from critters and other dangers. I think it's just a symbol of the anxiety we feel, knowing that we can't protect our children from everything dangerous in the world:(
I just want to say how terribly sorry I am for your loss 💔❤️ I know that pain, my first pregnancy ended in miscarriage and it's a heartbreak I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Please give yourself time to grieve, and reach out to me and anyone else who is willing to listen. You are not alone, and you never have to be. I'm here for you anytime ❤️❤️
The grungy mirror likely represents not being able to "see yourself" clearly. Floods almost always symbolize an overwhelming level of emotion. This could be a current situation, or something from the past, but typically if it's set in the past there would be some indication of that in the dream, which there doesn't *seem* to be. The person trying to stop you from mopping up the water could be a lot of things, think about who or what in your life is an obstacle to sorting out your feelings. It could be a representation of some part of yourself that avoids working through difficult times. 

The finale is a bit difficult to guess.. Could indicate that the overwhelming emotions are work-related, but honestly I'm not sure. 

Does any of that help?

I take it as a sign I'm on the right track. I think we live in the midst of infinite timelines, and repeating signs that feel positive are basically a function of the more optimal timelines:)
Happy Cake Day, friend! Thanks for sharing this great picture of your handsome pops and uncle 😊
You are an amazing artist. This is beautiful!
The most effective tip I've found is setting the intention (as you've already done by jumping) and carrying on as if it's already done. Think about it like placing an online order. You trust that it will come to you, but you don't expect it to show up instantly, or order it again and again, you just place the order and know it will be delivered. 

It also greatly helps to put it out of your mind as much as possible, and when you do think of it, practice feeling grateful for the thing you've asked for. In other words, think "I'm so thankful that I get to have ____" rather than "Why haven't I gotten my ____ yet??" 
Ahh, fair enough! Well I wish you the best of luck and if I can help you with your experimentation lemme know ☺️
I think your belief in it working is pretty helpful, so going into it expecting it won't work may manifest exactly that - not working! I wouldn't advise you plan on trying again for the same thing. Rather, do your best to expect the jump you already did will work! That being said, I typically wait at least a week between jumps. 

More gradual methods can be found at /r/lawofattraction or /r/NevilleGoddard I've had success with both but mostly prefer these over the jumping methods. 
Loving and forgiving people brings you much greater joy and peace of mind than holding onto your frustrations and pain. Easier said than done, I know, but worth the effort every time.
Narwals are not a fictional creature.
I used to coordinate weddings. Brides and grooms were 10x easier to deal with than the parents of the couple tended to be. Moms of the bride and groom IME are very nervous about everything going well, and end up being a huge nuisance trying to control everything and worrying about stuff for no reason. 
That's cool! Who knows, you may find that you have more in common with your sister than you thought, and you could encourage each other/manifest together ❤
My most successful two cups jump ever was for "more creative ideas". Maybe try jumping for business ideas?
I was in high school, learning about the French and Indian War. Little did I know, my future husband was in college, also learning about the French and Indian War. Pretty weird but we have a lot of these synchronicities from before we even met, and many more since then. 

I just remember feeling really sad, and wondering if it would have a bigger impact on American history than the French and Indian War. 
I was walking through my apartment complex on a rainy night. There were lots of snails on the sidewalks, and I stepped on one. This caused me to scream, and become frozen in fear of crunching another one. It took my husband a while to convince me to start walking again, and almost as soon as I did I stepped on another snail. Rather than get stuck again, or ya know, watch where I was walking, I decided to make a run for it, crunching snails and screaming all the way home. 
St John's Wort. It's OTC and remarkably effective. Also just taking good care of myself, even (or especially) when I don't feel like it. Specifically I try to have at least one green smoothie every day so I'm sure I get at least 4-5 daily fruits and vegetables, getting out in the sunshine, exercising several days a week, limiting my internet/screen time, and making time to do creative stuff. This is not medical advice by any means, but personally I took antidepressants for years, and they weren't nearly as helpful as all of the above. Also, finding friends who aren't judgmental and will listen to my problems and empathize. I've been fortunate to find a few online and IRL friends like this and its life-changing. 
The smell of chlorine and sunscreen. Public libraries. American Girl stuff. I often feel nostalgic around 4pm because it was my favorite time of day as a child, I would get to eat snacks and watch PBS. 
That's so damn cool!! My spiritual journey was kickstarted in a single evening early 2013, and it's hard to explain just how radically life-changing a moment like that can be when talking to someone who hasn't experienced it. How awesome that yours was during an ellipse! And yes please do PM me, I love to chat about this stuff! 
I like to meditate, and beforehand I set the intention of receiving any kind of help that comes from a source of love and light. However I don't think there's anything you *have* to do other than be willing. If you've ever woken up in the morning with a new insight, or just been walking along and suddenly had a revelation, or clarity about a problem, that's what I would consider a "download". 

For me, days with big energy shifts or upgrades often make me feel super restless, like I need to run sprints or something! And in the days following I often find myself having enormously helpful dreams about my emotional life. Sometimes I make unplanned changes, for example on 8/8/18 which is sometimes called "Lion's Gate" I suddenly lost all interest in eating meat. Others found that their habits and addictions were suddenly much easier to kick. 

Now that you're aware that these things often come in waves, you'll be able to make note of your own personal symptoms. It's different for everyone yet there's a lot of common experiences. 
I'd love to hear about your achievements, if you're comfortable sharing :) I think it's really cool you live in Ireland. I spent the summer in Dublin one year and loved it! My kids are only 4 and 2yo but I hope they grow up to travel and have different experiences.

As for always being the one to reach out first, I feel ya. Try not to take it too personally. People are busy and caught up in the day to day world, and just don't take the time to reach out sometimes. It doesn't make you any less valuable or important in this world. 

I love you and I'm proud of you. Please feel free to PM me anytime you want to chat! 
Yeah, the subconscious mind is pretty cool! We're all different yet we dream in a lot of the same (or very similar) metaphors and symbols. When I'm feeling vulnerable or exposed in some way, I usually dream that I'm in the shower and people are just walking right in the bathroom to talk to me.
This is so awesome! What program do you use?
The best way to make them stop is to figure out what they're trying to tell you. Even stressful dreams, nightmares, etc are your brain's way of sorting through the emotions and situations you're faced with. Starting school back can definitely be stressful, but it could be something from your past or even worries about the future that are surfacing. 

If you feel like sharing your dreams, or even just some of the recurring themes I'd be happy to help out  
Front yards usually represent the way you present yourself to others, or how you feel like you're perceived. Toilets are typically used in private, so having to use one on the lawn would seem to be a metaphor for you feeling like your privacy and personal business are exposed. Think about what in your life has made/is making you feel vulnerable and it might help you hone in on what your subconscious is trying to help you with.
💚We really are, my friend!! I love how the internet enables us to find our kinds of people 😊

I couldn't agree more about the monetary system. I really believe we'll evolve out of it, or it will simply collapse, at some point in our lifetimes. In the meantime, I'm sending you abundance vibes with all my heart! We're gonna make so many people happy with our random tips, gifts and donations! 😄💸

Edit: another thought I had that seemed to come from somewhere greater than me.. If I really want to peacefully disrupt the system (and I do!) What better way to do so than to open myself up to greater abundance and redistribute it myself? It seems obvious now, but it was a revelation when it came to mind yesterday! 
You got me thinking with your post, so thank you as well!! It's funny you mention the financial stability - I've been having this realization over the past 24 hours that I don't need to be broke to be a good person. Not that there's anything wrong with being poor, in fact I think guys like Jesus and Ghandi are in part why I have been afraid to accumulate money. But for now, I see that getting to the point where I'm not worried about the bills, and actually have enough to take care of myself AND others, would better enable me to give freely and use my gifts of service. It's a wildly different perspective, but it seems like I'm getting the message that being financially strapped is actually keeping me in a place where I have to think about my needs *more* than I would without financial stress. I think too, that I need to learn to trust myself. I'm terrified to turn into a self-interested rich person who is negligent in the needs of those less fortunate, so I keep myself in a situation where I'm always busy trying to make ends meet, which isn't really helping the less fortunate, either. 
The silver triangle! 
I haven't had the chance to watch your video yet, but your title is a little synchronicity for me as I've had the phrase "You can't pour from an empty cup." running through my mind lately. I have two children (4 and 2yo) a husband, a dog, a cat, two part-time jobs, friends and family who have their own emotional and practical needs I try to fill, the list goes on! And I can do a lot, but I tend to be self-sacrificing to the point where I simply don't take the time to nourish myself or get enough sleep. 

I used to consider taking care of myself as "service to self", but I no longer see it that way. I see that getting adequate nourishment and rest, putting on clothes that make me feel confident instead of schlepping around in whatever I pull from the drawer first, exercising, getting out in the sunshine, and putting on makeup or earrings or whatever else feels fun that day.. These things allow me to open my arms wider and work harder for others. 

To me, the only real difference is intention. I'm re-filling my cup so I have more to pour out, not so I can keep it full and set it aside just for me.

As for the dark-workers thing, I actually never heard that term until this week, but it perfectly describes my past-life memories on a spaceship, and essentially what I do best in this life. I seem to have a knack for walking right up to the "bad guys" and diffusing situations, breaking up fights, etc, which is kind of funny because I'm tiny. But when I first ground myself in love and light, I am somehow able to gently talk down angry men who could chuck me across the street if they wanted to lol, but it is essential to do so as though they are my beloved brothers - because they are!

So I consider myself a light-worker, I just thrive in the presence of darkness, and transmute it the best I can.
This sounds like a game I would have played all day! You should try /r/tipofmytongue :) 
I am so very sorry this happened. I have been the first person to drive up on the scene of a fatal accident and it was horrible. I was so upset I couldn't sleep all night - I'm glad you're reaching out to us and I hope that you can make peace with this. As for what the universe is telling you, don't stress about it. If there's a lesson in this I'm sure it will be clear to you in good time. 

Please know that there's no shame in your feeling that you wanted no part of it, it's a horrendously traumatic thing to witness, and our brains are wired to avoid trauma. You managed to override that fight or flight reaction in order to call 911 on her behalf, and that's all anyone could ask of you. 

I love you and I'm sending you all the good vibes I can. Please feel free to PM me if you'd like to talk about it, you're not alone 💕
When this happens to me I like to stare at the palms of my hands. Sometimes I pretend I'm a character that just morphed into the body I'm in, and I'm seeing my own hands for the first time. Come to think of it, this is a much weirder thing that I do than the other thing I posted in this thread. 

Anyway, it zaps me back to the present moment and it's almost surreal sometimes, like I suddenly feel more alive. 
I take it as a sign I'm on the right track. I think we live in the midst of infinite timelines, and repeating signs that feel positive are basically a function of the more optimal timelines:)
I'm sorry. I'm always here for you if you wanna PM 💕
I work with moderately famous people but the nature of my job means never talking or posting any details about it, lest I lose my job:( 
The sheer number of great ideas for art, products, and businesses that come to my mind every day and I almost never do anything with them. 
When you said it generated energy, something clicked in my mind because when I saw the shape turn into a structure being built, I felt it had tremendous importance. And I've read theories that structures like the pyramids were made to generate energy and maybe even create portals or open dimensions. 

Tell me what you think about [this image](https://goo.gl/images/GkDT1z)? It's a recreation of what the Great Zimbabwe Ruins looked like and how they were being used in the 1500s, and the people who lived in them at the time said they didn't build the walls, they were built in ancient times using unknown technology. Here's an [aerial view.](http://noisebreak.com/great-zimbabwe-ruins/) 

Edit: another potential clue.. Looks an awful lot like a cell, it's got the nucleus and everything! [Diagram](https://kr.123rf.com/photo_51124034_흰색-배경-벡터-일러스트-교육-및-학교에-대-한-유용한-에서-동물-세포-구조.html) 
Really?! I was hoping someone would recognize it.. Truly mind-blowing how we share these things. It makes me feel so thankful for the internet and the opportunity to compare notes! 

Tell me about the waves.. Does it feel like the shape is creating the energy somehow?
I don't feel bizarre, but I did have an awful lot of energy, both physical and mental, all night long. Couldn't sleep a wink! I wrote this to a friend at like 3am because I couldn't stop thinking about it: 

There's this little mystery shape I've had in my mind's eye since I was a tiny child, maybe 3 or so. I knew this shape so well that I'd constantly "see it" in clouds, patterns, textiles, everywhere! Pareidolia, but instead of a face, I see a 2D, two-tone shape that looks something [like this.](https://imgur.com/a/XlYMLJK) 

 The feelings I have at the sight of it, even today, are like a deep recognition, and a sense of nostalgia. Which has always mystified me, because.. What even is this? How can I recognize something I don't remember?

And then, one day whilst meditating about two months ago, I saw it appear in my mind's eye, and then transform juuuust a little bit, into a bird's eye view of an ancient building being constructed, with ancient people working together. Just a super quick, 8 bit quality glimpse, with the implicit *knowing* that it was ancient.

I don't know what any of it means but it's jolting to have a sudden development after 30 years of having no idea what I was looking at.

In addition to the meditation and suggestions already offered, it might be helpful to look up some common dream interpretations of the basic elements of these images. Or even just contemplate and do word association with yourself. 

Knights make me think of armor and therefore protection, but being in a coffin makes me think of the death of some form of protection/armor. Many different cups makes me think of hosting or communing with many people, or having an abundance of domestic resources, but having them on a shelf behind a knight's coffin makes those things feel.. Less than accessible! That's just my brain though, needless to say it may not be remotely close to what your own self is telling you!
Aww I think it's sweet. If she was an awful person in life I'd totally find it sinister, but it sounds like she was lovely and just wants to be in the familiar for a while longer.

Is it okay if I post something I more or less agree with? Because I think [Paul sabotaged Jesus' message](https://www.jesuswordsonly.com/books/505-paul-a-false-apostle-blog.html) on purpose.

I've happily eaten way too many burgers and chicken wings to claim that the actual eating part makes me feel sad. But thinking about them being killed does.
I know, and far be it from me to begrudge anyone a good meal! I just wasn't expecting the adorable rabbit-feeling-safe-in-a-cuddly-blanket imagery to take a turn for the slaughterhouse lol

Also, excellent post. It's something I've been thinking about a lot the past few days! I notice that often, when I make peace with the situation I'm in, I actually end up progressing out of it much more quickly. 
I used to live in that neighborhood. That blue Eiffel tower looking thing is adjacent to Sea World, and everything else is just a large grassy area.
Okay, thanks for letting me know. I definitely don't mean to be condescending so I will think about how I can do better. 
I'm sorry I bothered you. Just sharing my thoughts. Love you bro 💘
What did you guys do with them?

Also, this is excellent /r/writingprompts material.
I don't claim to know how it works, but I can elaborate in case its helpful. I was telling myself that everything would be okay no matter what, and trying not to focus on the money so much as the goal of having our needs met. In fact my husband got the email  about the money almost immediately after getting off the phone with a family member we were considering moving in with, so in a sense it came through the minute we gave up. Weird. 
Manifested $3,300 that we were previously told wouldn't be available for many years. It came when we really needed it, without us even trying. It was crazy, like some law changed and the funds had to be released to us immediately. 

My body has changed quite a bit, too.. Though tthat's more of a lesson in "be careful what you wish for" lol. I used to be athletic and pretty thicc, but I desperately wanted to be skinny and petite like a ballerina. Through a years long process of getting sick, depressed, anemic, etc.. I'm now so small and skinny that I often hear "You should eat more!" I used to daydream about being told that, and now it really bums me out! I'm at the gym trying to put on muscle and eating as much as I can, trying to get my booty back haha. So yeah, I think it's all attainable! Just make sure you have goals you'll be happy with long-term:)
I'm sure he's a great guy, and that's probably why he'll still be your friend after this. Personally, I'm much happier now that I've grown into friendships where we don't poke at each other's insecurities for fun. Life has a way of making us feel like crap about ourselves all on its own... At best, friendships are a welcome break from that. Not an additional source of it. Just my personal perspective, friend to friend 💕
Whoever you are, the fact that your "friend" would post something like this tells me that you are someone who is so awesome that people will go out of their way to try and put you down. 

Don't let em, you keep being awesome and don't let goofballs like OP get you down. 
You look like Kristin Cavallari!
No problem! I used to live in SoCal and took about a million visitors from back home to see the walk of fame lol.. They've always looked this way in my timeline, but I'm curious what others remember! 
Grey slab, pink star, gold letters, and an icon for the type of media the celeb was best known for ex: a camera for film stars. 
I... I thought it was just me.
Nothing wrong with feeling compassion. IMO there are no "bad guys", just lost, wounded and confused souls who don't realize they're just pawns. It is sad.
I'm really sorry about your dad. I hope you're hanging in there 💕
I'm so sorry you went through that. I can't imagine 😔 Sending you hugs and lots of love 💕
That is so intriguing and weird! It's /r/GlitchintheMatrix material for sure!
I'm so sorry for your loss 💕 I hope you're doing okay.
I'm interested in the story if you feel like sharing! Also, do you remember what the individuals looked like?
Heart stopped beating.
Were you aware that you were dead? Did you have thoughts or feelings? 
Have you guys ever listened to [these songs remixed to sound like they're playing in an empty mall?](https://youtu.be/D__6hwqjZAs) They fill me with a strange mix of nostalgia and existential dread.
I'm gonna copy and paste the thing I wrote in an Ask Reddit thread about alien abduction:

"Not an abduction, but I saw an alien in my living room about a month ago.  He was blue with an enormous, mushroom shaped noggin. I didn't feel afraid though, as he looked strangely familiar, like an old friend. I thought to myself "Why am I seeing this guy?" And the answer was telepathic, saying "You made some deals before you came here." I understood this to mean that I knew him in a past life and had done him some favors, so he was going to help me out in this life, in some way. Then he disappeared.

It was bizarre, obviously, but somehow really comforting. I actually got emotional thinking about it the next day.

I had a series of past life dreams after this that were intensely vivid, they felt more like memories than dreams. I never saw what I looked like, but all my friends looked like the guy I saw in my living room. We lived on a spaceship that was small but expandable, like additional rooms could just kind of materialize at the push of a button.

The feeling I had with them was total love and support. We were workers who spread love and light everywhere we went. We zipped around and took meetings with aliens who worked for the "dark side", so to speak. We never fought with them though, we just used a kind of telepathy to determine if they were willing to work with us and maybe even become less dark. If they were, I or one of my buddies would teleport to their ship and negotiate.

Eventually I got bored, and wanted to try something harder. So I heard that the planet Earth was in trouble, and needed volunteers to come and spread the light by being loving and forgiving. I was told that I'd need to be careful not to hurt anyone. I thought "Huh? Why would I ever do that??" It's hard to explain, but the dimension or atmosphere of this place I was in made it really easy to be loving all the time. I was really naive, like I couldn't possibly understand how much I'd be hurt in this life, and how much I'd hurt others as well. They tried to tell me, but I just couldn't comprehend it and I was too excited about the adventure of it all.

The idea was that they'd basically upload my consciousness into a baby, and my next "memory" is being in the womb, already able to sense how painful and difficult it is to be here, thinking "Oh no, I don't want to do this anymore." But it was too late. The dreams came to a screeching halt after that, but I don't mind because if (and I realize that's a big "if") this is at all true, my focus needs to be on this life I chose and work I signed up for.

Edit: interesting side note.. my whole life I've had a recurring thought that I wish I hadn't been born. I'd have this thought a LOT, even in the happy times. But ever since I saw my old friend, and had all these dreams, I've found myself thinking that I'm glad I was born. Honestly, this all feels very real to me, but either way it's been a blessing.
Long answer: Pregnant women don't lactate unless they're already nursing another baby. Milk doesn't come in until a few days after the baby is born. Before that what comes out is a sticky clear-ish substance called colostrum which is easier for the newborn to digest, and contains the nutrients it needs most. 

Short answer: She's most likely got a breastfed baby at home. 
Under the Umbrella Tree
My four year old and I were painting a picture together, and I had to briefly stop when her baby brother woke up from his nap. I told her I'd be back in a few minutes and that she could play on the iPad in my absence. She typically jumps at the chance to play on the iPad, so I thought nothing of leaving the paint out as I hurried off to the kid's room. Big mistake.

Angered by the sudden mother-daughter-painty-time interruption, she proceeded to paint all over herself, the floor, two cabinets, and my grandparent's antique pie safe. 
Yeah! Great minds think alike 😉💕
I can't speak for your mom, but I really just want my kids to be happy. If getting married/being in a relationship wouldn't make them happy, I sure wouldn't want them to fake it on my account. She might just be talking about it under the assumption that's what you want, you know? 

At any rate, you're perfect just as you are. 💕
I'm so sorry 💕 I hope things get better for the both of you soon.
Thinking about it metaphorically, do you feel like you're unable to get control over some kind of situation in your life? Maybe you can't say what you're really thinking to a boss, or family member? Food often represents nurture, maybe you lack nurturing environment in your life and have to take what you can get in terms of feeling loved and cared for? I'm not sure, to be honest, but that's what comes to mind at first glance.
I'm so sorry 😔 and I'm glad you're here. 💕
I am so very sorry for what you're going through 💕 It may encourage you to know that there's thousands and thousands of accounts of loved ones reaching out in this way, letting their families know they're okay. I experienced it myself after my grandfather died. Science tells us that our brains operate in 11 dimensions, only 4 of which are we currently able to observe and measure. So there's an awful lot to our consciousness that we don't yet understand, but that doesn't mean it's not happening! Once upon a time, there was no credible evidence for radio waves or electromagnetic fields 😉 I think our consciousness is eternal, and just like the internet doesn't cease to exist because your laptop dies, we go on long after this particular body we're inhabiting here is done. 

I'm always here for you anytime, please feel free to pm me! Sending lots of love to you and your family 💕
That was a dick move on their parts for sure.. But FWIW the way you turned him down so politely tells me you're a really good person. I hope you find/found someone who deserves you!
Hey there, lots to unpack here but I'll do my best to help! The first thing that jumps out at me is a recurring theme of overindulgence. Too many chocolate covered strawberries, public masturbation, taking things too far with the girl you weren't engaged too, etc. The subconscious tends to use metaphors to illustrate things, so it helps to think about what real-life situations and feelings might be symbolized here. 

Obviously there's a lot more going on in these dreams, but that seems like a good place to start. Does that help? 
I actually laughed out loud.. Thanks for this one!!
I like to Google "angel number x" (with x being the number I saw) and see what, if anything, resonates. But off the top of my head, 4545 is interesting from a numerology perspective, because in numerology you add single digits together, and then if you end up with a double digit number, you reduce it to a single digit number by adding the individual digits together. 

So 4+5= 9 and 4+5+4+5= 18 and 1+8=9 ... Basically any way you slice it, you've got a pretty potent 9 there! In numerology 9 is associated with the end of a cycle, and old things falling away to make room for the new. Given all you've been through this year, that seems pretty apt! 

I don't know if that's helpful, but if nothing else maybe it'll give you a fun rabbit hole to fall down 😊

💕P.S. I'm so sorry for all your troubles. Hang in there, there's brighter days ahead!! 
You don't pee on the whole stick lol, just the cottony part that sticks out of the very end, which is then covered by a plastic cap. 
You can request that some of your birthday or Christmas presents be donations to a cause you care about. Especially if you tend to get gifts you don't particularly enjoy. 

But you shouldn't feel guilty. Be thankful you were born into abundance, and thankful that you have opportunities to pay it forward! I think it's lovely that you recognize your good fortune and want to help others. 💕
This is really lovely. Thanks, 1889 man for inspiring me to be a better friend! 
I can understand you being disappointed, but I can also understand wanting my kids to have as normal of a childhood as possible, and be able to just focus on family time when taking them places. It would suck (as the kid) to feel like your parent's career is always going to be a priority.
This makes me happy. I love KITH and especially Scott!
Yes "waited on them" in this context means they served them a meal or drinks at a restaurant. I can see how it would be confusing since "waited on them" could also mean "it took time for them to arrive."
Sometimes I listen to binaural beats or a meditation track on YouTube, but most of the time I just lie still and focus on relaxing my body from the feet up. Then I mentally repeat  loving phrases, starting with "I love myself." This is a tricky one for me, because I tend to dwell on my mistakes and I don't usually feel like I actually love myself at first, but I keep repeating it until it feels good. Then I focus on my love for my family and friends (much easier!) and finally everyone in the world, and the universe. After that, I try to let my thoughts drift off, unless some other affirmations come to mind. By then I'm usually sinking into the deep waves, and that's when the tingling and vibrating begins. Sometimes it causes me to come back up to a fully conscious state, because I get kind of excited lol, and I have to remind myself that it's normal and I can let go. 
I often experience this in meditation and light sleep cycles. To me, it's like I'm subconsciously conversing with my angels and it's a normal occurrence in that state. But of course, once I wake up, I'm often left wondering what we were even talking about. And the vibration thing often accompanies the chats, I especially feel it in my neck and face. 

Sometimes I'll remember key points or suggestions that are really helpful and encouraging. Other times, I'll only remember something random and (seemingly) nonsensical, but it will make sense later. This morning I could only remember them telling me something about "tiny bears" lol, so I'm excited to discover whatever the heck that was about. 

All of the above being said, it's a good idea to meditate on love and light a bit before going to sleep or meditating, as I have also had the strange experience of some less benevolent-feeling interactions as well. 

TL;DR I have no definitive answers, but I know what you mean! 
Aww. Your mama sounds like my kind of person. My best friend's mom always said "We're making a memory" in the same contexts. I think it's a nice way to look at things:)
I'm so happy you're okay, I was quite sad to see you not yourself. You get infinite love and forgiveness from me, always. Everyone here does! Please take good care of yourself 💕
I had sleep paralysis once, and it was a demonic cat trying to suffocate me. It sucked! I felt that it had this intense hatred for me:( I really don't know if these sleep creatures are actual demonic entities or what, but it's certainly not fun to experience! 

The dream itself feels more metaphorical to me, as dreams often are. Can you think of any real-life parallels? The co-worker may represent an aspect of yourself, maybe something you do as way to escape something you can't otherwise avoid. For example, if you don't like your job but you can't quit, the job itself could be represented by the person chasing you. The fainting co-worker could represent calling in sick. Does that help? 
I think God is everything, and nothing can exist outside of it, because it is *existence itself*. To be anything is to be God, the source of everything. I think the idea of God having personality and individuality is a man-made concept, devised for various reasons. [Here's a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/7kcsq5/i_feel_like_i_was_healed_of_some_inherited_trauma/?st=JKV858HJ&sh=9faf1c4f) I wrote here quite a few months ago, which is about an experience I had which blasted my last remaining Christian ideals about God out of the water. Well, except for the "God is Love" part! That part absolutely still rings true. But that's just me! Ultimately you have to find the truth for yourself, and you may discover something different 🤗💕 
Think about it symbolically, and what Barbie might represent to you subconsciously. If you liked playing with them as a kid, maybe it's a symbol of carefree, childhood joy that's just out of reach. Or maybe it's about trying to live up to a certain image or standard of beauty/lifestyle and feeling like other people do it better. Does that help?
Dreams are most often symbolic, and the subconscious attaches (or in this case, doesn't attach) emotion accordingly. So in this dream I'd guess that it's really about "killing" some part of yourself associated with that person as a way to grow.

For example, maybe your mom has been a little too pushy about your career choices. A dream about killing her wouldn't need to feel sad because letting go of her input and listening to your own life goals would be a helpful thing for you. Hope that helps, but if not let me know!
 > True spirituality and drugs are polar opposites.

I'm one of many people who was using a psychadelic when my life changed forever. I was going through a really hard time, and one night I smoked some weed and was crying out asking the universe, God, *something* to give me a reason to live. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks that LOVE is the answer to life, the universe, and everything. I knew it was true to the core of my being, and it set me on a path of awakening that has continued (sans drugs) for five years now. I've had equally profound experiences in sober meditation, so I don't mean to imply that drugs are necessary at all. Just that some of them can and do provide a little window or "cheat code" into 5D that can spark enormous spiritual growth. 
I sure try to be that kind of person. Everyone needs help and support sometimes! I've been lucky to have people on Reddit cheer me up when I needed it and I'm always glad to pay it forward 😊💕
Check out /r/precognition :) this is a very cool and surprisingly common thing!
Gosh that must have been traumatizing! I'm so sorry💕

I'm really sorry you're dealing with physical disabilities and some bad luck. But you're right, you're a survivor and you can and will cross the ocean 😊 I hope you have a good day, too, and please feel free to reach out any time. 
:( I don't know you, but I have a feeling you're being way too hard on yourself! Wanna PM me and we can chat? I don't have all the answers but I've hit rock bottom and bounced back to a better place more than once, and I'd be honored to be a listening ear ❤️
This sounds like a disagreement or misalignment between your conscious and unconscious mind. You're consciously creating positive thoughts, and so the icky stuff comes out of hiding to be dealt with. It sucks, but ultimately it's a good thing because dealing with the icky stuff will allow you to feel consciously and unconsciously better about yourself.

Try to identify the thoughts and feelings you're having just *before* the self-hating thoughts pop up. Chances are, you're experiencing shame, guilt, or some other difficult emotion, and thinking "I hate myself" is a sort of mental escape hatch to avoid processing those feelings. Once you've identified the trigger, face the source of those feelings head-to-head and work through them. Forgive yourself, forgive the situations that have hurt you or caused you to hurt others, and keep up the positive affirmations!

I love you 💕
Hold up, what happened with the dead body? Did you call the police?

I've had some glitchy stuff happen after doing the two cup method, but it was harmless stuff. I wouldn't fault yourself for that person's death or your FILs job loss. Unless those occurrences could somehow move you closer to your goals, I really doubt they're related. I second /u/coolchic101 suggestion though, Neville was awesome and his method is much more gentle.
I think our brains subconsciously store just about everything. Sometimes I'll have a "random" flashback to eating at a certain restaurant or hanging out with an old friend, and then when I look back at my journal or a photo I took I'll discover that it was exactly a year (or many years) ago. It's pretty cool, we're all a lot smarter than we consciously realize:) 

PS happy cake day!! 💝
I'm far from family too, and IME ditching social media has actually made me feel more connected to them. I actually have to call or text them which enables us to really talk about our struggles and hopes and stuff rather than the superficial level of interaction via social media. 
I wonder if it would help to have a /r/precognition link somewhere visible? I'm fascinated by prophetic dreams and I've had one myself, but since there's a whole sub dedicated to them, and a lot of the dream posts here are precognitive, it might cut down on the quantity if there were a link. 

That being said, I do enjoy the dream posts here:)
I'm sorry friend 💕 They're very lucky to have you around! Hang in there 💕
When my mom wants to listen to a song, she just turns on the radio and says "Let's find it!" And most of the time, she does! It's like she just knows it'll be playing, even if it's an old song. 
Weird, I definitely feel like there's an energy shifting tonight, but for whatever reason I'm feeling pretty great. Everything feels more "real" somehow, like I'm immersed in the present moment more than usual. It's interesting how these things hit us differently. 
Some of my favorite movies are the ones where the character has a lot of sadness and difficulty to overcome. It would be a pretty boring movie if everything was just sunshine and rainbows from start to finish! Think about Harry Potter. His parents are dead, he lives with his emotionally abusive aunt and uncle and his bullying cousin, then he gets into a magical school only to find out that teachers apparently hate him and some really powerful guy wants to kill him! But that's why we keep watching, because we know these challenges are what make it an epic story and it's not the end yet. It's not the end of your story, either, and I for one would like to keep watching:) 
Sense of adventure, gentle, gets excited about stuff, willing to consider other people's perspectives and either change his mind or respectfully disagree. I've been married to a man like that for 11 years and he's awesome:)
Oops.. Thanks!

Edit: Your bio made me laugh. Keep up the okay work! 
Please listen to me.. I know it probably just seems like fun and spooky entertainment to interact with these different energies, but it isn't a good idea at all. Until our technology advances enough to detect other dimensions it's almost impossible to know for certain what exactly you're inviting in, but regardless, it's almost certainly bad juju. 

I might get roasted for taking you seriously because a lot of people haven't had the experiences we've had, but look ... There's far more power and beauty in the love and light kind of energy, and it offers *real* love and protection far better than whatever bullshit "A" is peddling. You need to get rid of the tools you've been using and issue some firm but loving commands to them go away, and repeat as needed. And if you're still spiritually curious, and I hope you are.. Check out subs like /r/SoulNexus or /r/astralprojection or /r/luciddreaming and seek out some positive metaphysical experiences 💕☺️ They're much more fun, I promise! 
What can you remember about them? Are there any recurring themes? The subconscious mind tends to create nightmares in effort to help you consciously process emotions that you may be suppressing. I had nightmares nearly every night for years until I learned how to understand what they were telling me. I'm happy to help you with this if you feel like sharing. You're welcome to PM me as well.
The first lecture is just a long, rambling monologue and it's impossible to tell whether or not what they're saying should go in your notes. 
Think about what the old man might represent within yourself. For example, a dream about killing a greedy person might mean you're trying to be more generous. Does that help?
There's nothing wrong with wanting to be around people! I'm not an extrovert by any means, but too much alone time makes me feel crazy and kinda sad after a while. I think it's good and even important to get out of the house and talk to people, we have a light to shine after all ☺️ 

And don't do what I did and carry on for ages assuming that you're alone, I'm amazed at how many people I meet that are every bit as "awake" as I am. Uber drivers, homeless people, baristas.. There's a lot of people waking up and have been for a while, just gotta give them the space to feel like they can open up. 

In the meantime, I'm always here if you want to chat! 💕💕
Just to clarify, I didn't mean to imply that 10/10 bullies were bullied as well, though I did say "most". IME kids (and grownups!) who truly feel good about themselves and their place in the world tend to want others to feel good, too. And sadly the reverse tends to be true, also.

At any rate, you sound like a wonderful teacher, and I'm very glad that lil guy found his way to you 💕
Sure seems likely to me. I'm so sorry about your pup. I hope you're able to take the time you need to grieve. Sometimes I find that just listening to a sad song, really leaning into the feelings I'd typically try to avoid like sadness, and letting myself have a good, hard cry makes a big difference.
This typically represents a situation where you've felt you had to "kill" some aspect of yourself. For example.. Maybe the loved one you strangled is a very funny person IRL, that would mean you've had to stifle your sense of humor lately. Does that help?
I love you with all of the hearts.
I bought a day pass to the swimming pool for myself and my kids. So my life will have a lot more chlorine and floaties 
I'm in! 💕🤗
> Consider how you should act with young children; saying "I love you" every time they misbehave would be a terrible thing to do to them, and it would be deeply and genuinely unfair to the other kids who may be suffering at the hands of unchecked bullying. 

Far be it from me to tell you how to parent, but in my personal experience as a parent and teacher, I have found the opposite to be true. When my 4 year old yells at me, responding to her with love and compassion is absolutely the most effective way to help her see that she's wrong. I used to try and one-up her by being very stern, "tough love" and all that, but it only served to create more anger and frustration. I've learned that by responding with love and compassion, she's infinitely more willing to listen to what I have to say, apologize, and do better.

As far as bullies go, 10/10 times they are acting out of insecurity, and most of the time they are being bullied themselves, often at home. It's not a disservice to the children who are being bullied for a grown-up to let the bully know he or she is loved. It's the surest way to help them see that they don't need to hurt others to feel good about themselves. 

None of the above has be *in place of consequences*, or in place of explaining to them what they did wrong. It's just a whole lot more likely that they'll actually listen and want to change if they first feel that they are worthy of love.
101 Dalmatians - the animated one.
Hmm. If your SO is willing, it might help to join forces on this, and speak your instruction out loud. Remember to instruct, not request. Some people recommend burning white sage around the house as well. Also check out the spiritual lessons in the sidebar/community info, as there's some specifically for protection. If it persists, let us know! Sending you all the good vibes 💛💛💛 
The sense I'm getting is that the energy is.. less than positive. Don't be afraid of it, or angry towards it, just ground yourself in love and light and issue a firm instruction to leave your presence. Think of it like a neighborhood kid who's out late and needs to go home. *You're* the adult here, and you have the power to send it away.
Beautiful eyes 😊
What's the thought process behind that myth? It's very confusing!
Typically, yeah, but some women's bodies are just like "LET'S DO THIS!" and labors can escalate very quickly. With my first baby I was just chilling, breathing through spacious contractions like a champ, got in the tub to clean up before heading to the hospital and suddenly my contractions were less than two minutes apart. My second baby came so fast that I was still gathering up my phone charger and toiletries when I felt him move down, and the urge to push was so strong I couldn't walk to the car. We had to call for an ambulance and within minutes there were five firefighters surrounding my bed, strategizing how to get a stretcher down our narrow hallway lol. If we have a third I might have to either camp out at the hospital for the last couple months or deliver it myself. 
Please tell your grandmother I said thank you for sharing this lovely little glimpse of her life with us 💕💕💕
I'm gonna have to take a pass on the fusion, but thanks just the same, and I'll keep a steady stream of love and light headed your way! 💛 And I'm glad it was helpful.

Is there anyone IRL you could reach out to, maybe go for a coffee or something? I don't know what your social life is like but for me, staying inside with my own thoughts and energy can get overwhelming and confusing. It's important to keep a steady footing in the human world and it might help to get out of the house and do some "normal" stuff every day. Just a humble suggestion!  💛
Hey buddy, things seem to be a bit muddled and confusing in your communication lately, are you okay? I know you've been struggling with the job search, and as someone in the same boat I just wanna say that you're not alone, and you're worth so much more than a job could ever encompass. I'm sending you lots of love and light, and I want you to know that I'm thankful for the encouragement you've given me here so many times. Please don't forget who you truly are: you have a gift for offering clarity and support to those who feel lost.. Just remember to reach out when you are in need of the same. You don't have to have all the answers. None of us do, and that's why we're here! I'm always here for you, K? 💕 love you brother. 💕
I care about you ❤
Awesome, please do report back! I wrote "creatively unfulfilled" on one and "creatively fulfilled" on the other. I recommend doing it at night, I think it helps to go to sleep with the expectation so your subconscious can adjust without the distractions of daily life. Have fun! 
Doughnut shaped?
Out of the thousands and thousands of people I've interacted with online, I've become close friends with three of them. Two of the three turned out to be INFJs lol. I do think it's a subconscious thing on some level, because I was drawn to one of them long before she said anything particularly INFJ-like. But it also makes sense that we'd be drawn to people with similar values. 
If it makes you feel any better, participation wasn't exactly voluntary.
It's really up to you, but the original method recommended using as few words as possible, and waiting about a week between jumps. 

Btw, my very first jump was for new creative ideas, and I went from a two year streak of no creative inspiration at all to keeping a notebook with me all the time because the ideas just kept coming! 
Be grateful that you were able to help someone who needed it, and trust that the universe will repay you with or without that person's help. If you focus your attention on that specific person repaying you, you shut out the infinite possibilities of the money coming back to you some other way.
Resonates as this day's energy has been reminding me again and again that I came here to help others. I get so lost in the concerns about how to pay the bills, how to explain myself to others that I forget how simple my mission ultimately is!
I'm feeling all sorts of shaken up about some conflicts with my parents, some financial issues, and what feels like a setback in my life and dreams. It's hard to know where to put my focus and I keep internalizing a lot of guilt and shame. But I don't know what to ask, exactly.. General guidance?

Thank you so much for offering 💜💜💜
How did you feel about what you were doing? I had a dream where I was trying to distance myself from some girl who was shooting up, and for me it was about trying to distance myself from some bad habits I have (not heroin lol, my habits are legal but still damaging).
I think we all use it all the time because it's basically just the energy we send out coming back to us eventually. But I focused on the belief that the job I really wanted was mine, and even though I didn't hear back from them for weeks I got the job:) Another time I was running late for a flight and the line for security was so long there was no way I was gonna make it. But I focused on the belief that I would make it and suddenly a TSA agent walked out of a side door and opened up a new line, making me have to rush to get my shoes off because I was suddenly second in line:) 

I've also manifested money, creative ideas, and more feelings-based things like confidence.
The thirty minutes or so before and after my babies were born. 

Helping a woman get away from her boyfriend after I saw him throw her up against his car felt pretty good too. I'm tiny but for some reason he backed down when I told him to. 
Trying to get somewhere in life like..
What's your favorite number? 

What is one of your happy childhood memories? 

What do you miss the most about having both legs? 

Also, and I know this isn't a question, but... I love you and I'm glad you're here. 
Give the homeless man more than $3 and some chicken nuggets, because he's gonna start telling you that you're a blessing and a light, that you're gonna be okay, and he's gonna make you feel like you are worthy of being happy so much that as you drive away, you'll start crying with gratitude and have to pull over just to compose yourself. It's worth every penny you have on you just to experience the wholesome encouragement of someone who has been through much worse than you, yet found peace and joy in just being alive. 
Thank you for sharing this. I've been having to look at my financial situation and face the fact that I've been irresponsible and impulsive. It's painful and I have a lot of shame/guilt about money that keeps me repeating the same patterns. It's really nice to see that I'm not the only one having to look at myself and my actions and take stock of the changes to be made. I have a tendency to think that everyone else has it all figured out and I'm the only one screwing up! 

I also see that the blame I've been placing on others is actually disempowering me, making me feel like it can't be helped, and that by owning my mistakes I give myself the agency to do better. Tough stuff to go through but my hope is that by doing so, I'm preparing for the brighter days ahead.
I love you both!! 💕💕
This is good advice! It also helps me to remember that I can never know the full story behind someone's motivations. I tend to take things personally that might have nothing to do with me! Using your example, maybe people at your sister's church make her feel guilty when she doesn't go. Maybe she'd actually rather help you, but she's afraid of being made to feel bad at church. Maybe she needs the unconditional love you give her more than you'll ever know, so your being kind about her saying no could be really healing for her and help her stop caring so much what the church people think of her. Obviously I don't know your sister or her situation, so this is a hypothetical, but you're right and thank you for sharing 😊💜
Trading! It's something we can start doing on our own and allows just about everyone an equal chance to use their skills and work with what they have. I don't know how we can upend the money system in a big, speedy way, but I think looking for every opportunity to simply stop using it is a great start. I once coordinated a wedding for a massage therapist who gave me treatments after each planning session, and totally fixed my jacked up shoulders! We both felt like we got a great deal. 
That is a common and enduring myth. I'm not saying you should hate on them, just that there's really no such thing as a job anyone can get. They [only hired 6.2%](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-hard-it-is-to-get-a-job-at-mcdonalds-2011-4) of applicants in 2011, and now they're rolling out automated cashiers so they'll need even fewer human employees. 
Holy yes Batman, this is huge. I was told "anger is just justifiable self-respect that wasn't allowed to express itself in time" and I have found it to be true. I tended to bottle things up until I exploded, often hurting people who weren't even the cause of my *real* pain, they were just triggering the same feelings I had tried to suppress for far too long. If this sounds like it could be the case for you as well, I really recommend the book *Self-Therapy* by Jay Earley. Just reading the free introduction sample on Kindle was kinda life-changing for me and others whom I've shared it with. 
I don't claim to *know* anything, but my feeling is that "The Event" is an ongoing process of our collective human consciousness expanding, and our steady gaining of awareness about the true nature of ourselves and the universe. For a great many of us it started soon after the end of 2012 and I think it will continue to gain speed throughout our lives and beyond. 

So personally, I don't anticipate a single day in which everything dramatically changes.. I think that's perhaps a 3D expectation/misunderstanding that crept into the general public because people correctly sense that things are changing, and correctly sense that "something's coming", but our limited human understanding of time leads us to get excited about it happening all at once. But when I think about it, in all the billions and billions of years of eternity, a few hundred years or so of "awakening" on a single planet might as well be "all at once"! Does that make sense? Just my perspective, and I may very well be wrong!

As far as the burnout goes, I don't think there's anything at all wrong with focusing on the down to earth stuff as long as you are tending to your own well being. In fact I think getting too swept away by the spiritual chatter can be a frustration and distraction sometimes because everyone's experience and purpose here is different. It's ultimately about discovering and utilizing *your* inner voice, *your* light and *your* mission here, and that right there is best done (in my experience) by drowning out everyone else and just letting your truth arise in its own time.

I hope that helps, and if not, that's okay too!! Just know that you're loved and cared for by me and many others, and you're doing great! 💕🌈💕
One possible interpretation is 5+4, so the number nine. It's the number of endings making way for new beginnings:) 
I love this, and I love you! 💚💙💜💛 
Look up the shadow man or the hat man. Dude is seen all over the world!
Hahaha I'm glad I'm not the only one looking around at my life like 🤷‍♀️

Hang in there. I bet we'll see each other on the other side of this and be like "Man- we had nothing to worry about!"
Oh thank you for offering, I'll gladly take you up on that! Am I making the right decision, moving to TN for a while?

Edit: actually just any reading will do... I have so many questions about my life that it might be better to leave it open-ended and see what comes up.
Are you talking about the OP or the video I linked? Your explanation could work for the OP but not sure how it would apply to all the footage in my video.
Here's [another sky anomaly](https://youtu.be/1ZIWtXSH6qo) which to me is even more bizarre. Really cool, whatever it is!
>It is a man-made hypothesis with which he explains away things he does not understand.

Preach! I feel the same way about the phrase "just a coincidence".
Man, it's been bananas for me too! I haven't done a tarot for myself lately, but my [angel card readings ](http://www.angelmessenger.net) have been pinpoint accurate! And yesterday /u/MajorArcanaMonk did a reading for me that was super helpful, and even echoed some of what my angel cards and dreams have been telling me to a very attention-grabbing degree! 

I've started documenting the battery/time number synchronicities on my phone, for example I'll have 33% battery at 10:22pm, and they've been off the charts. On Wednesday I had nine of these syncs, and today I'm already up to four! 

I've also been having *really* intense dreams, mostly about emotional baggage related to money, family, and other crap I'm ready to let go of now. It's not exactly pleasurable but I know it's a good thing in the long run! 

The biggest thing I'm noticing today is a very strong urge to nourish myself. I have struggled with disordered eating in the past and even though I've come a long way, I still tend to skip meals or just eat a bit of something on the go. But today I've been happily going after fruit, fruit juice and all the water! It's nice:) 
[Can't Bring Me Down ](https://youtu.be/YYAdh9KT7wM) by Awreeoh is one of my favorite jams!

Sample lyrics: *life is surrounded by signs. If you're connected you know.* 
Happy birthday! 🎂🎈🤗
Wow! Your second paragraph is extremely similar to [this remote viewing of Mars](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf), circa 1 million years BC, which was conducted by the CIA in the 80's. Soooo fascinating. 

I don't have any answers for you, but I know somewhat how you're feeling. I just keep trying to be a light in my day to day life and meditating, hoping to be the change I wanna see and all that 😊💕✨
I have so many questions it's hard to choose!! So.. Either "General guidance", or "why am I feeling unmotivated?", or "is there something I can do to speed up my manifestations?" Dealer's choice, ha! And thank you (as always!) for sharing your gifts here 💕💕💕
Holy cow dude, congrats!!! This is all kinds of inspiring. Thank you so much for sharing your story! 
Lord yes, a big one! I feel like everything is on the line and I don't know what to expect next. I'm gonna be checking in on this thread and sending my comrades at the crossroads lots of abundance vibes with love and light. ✨💛✨
Hey, same here! I first noticed it following me around when I was a kid, and similarly adopted it as my favorite number. I hope this full moon is transformative for the both of us, in all the best possible ways! 
Here's 27 stars for you:✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
God I hope so, I feel like I've been in the throes of labor all summer! This gives me hope, thank you 💛
"Your weapon against light."

.. Huh?
Ha! This is timely because I just did it before checking in here. I woke up before dawn due to a really upsetting nightmare about my current situation. I walked into the living room and sat down with my phone, opened the music app and asked if I made a mistake, if the choices I've made that lead to this situation were a mistake. I got "Three Little Birds" by Bob Marley.

"Woke up this morning, smiled with the rising sun. Three little birds by my doorstep. Singing sweet songs of melodies pure and true, singing *This is my message to you: Don't worry about a thing, cause every little thing is gonna be alright*."

I let it play all the way through, and the next song on the shuffle was Rhapsody in Blue, which has long been synonymous with adventure to me, and I even used to listen to it in the early morning hours the last time I felt like my life was falling apart. I'd kinda forgotten about it.


FWIW, I've had encouraging and helpful messages from music for a long time, and personally I don't attribute it to this "SAM", but rather my own angels/guides. If you try again, it might be worthwhile to ask for communication with only those who come in love and light 💛💛💛
RemindMe! 6 months
I don't want other people to know either, but what amazes me is that when I do open up, I find that I'm sooo not alone! Nearly everybody, save for a few very lucky people, maybe, have needed help from time to time. And even wealthy people worry about money, because they have loans that are overdue, or stocks that crash, or because their pal has a bigger summer house lol. 

For me, my fears about money are tied up in worrying that I won't spend it wisely once I have it, or that I'll get cocky and stop caring about people who are struggling, or that I'll only make enough to get on my feet but I won't be able to sustain it, etc. Basically a lack of trust in the universe that I'm gonna be okay, today and in the far future! But I'm gonna be okay, and you are too! 

I'm gonna set a reminder and we'll check in with each other in six months. I bet we'll have all kinds of amazing new things to share:)

I'm in the same boat as you, and an affirmation kinda popped in my head a few days ago that's really been helping me: "Money is a tool. Some need it, some don't, either way is fine." 

I don't know if that helps, but it's allowing me to shed some layers of shame, and to be okay with needing some support right now. And I think that shame and fear is the thing that's been holding me back from going for things.
I prank called my dad using one of those soundboard sites. I was shocked by how completely unimpressed he was, like "Uh huh.. Yeah, that's Tom Hank's voice. Got it." Made me see my dad in a different light! I guess I'd never realized he'd lived a whole life, complete with pranks and shenanigans, enough to be bored by my feeble attempt. 
That's adorable.
I like to keep an open mind so I don't have firm beliefs about this, but the one that I been contemplating a lot lately is infinite timelines. Basically at any given moment we're living in one of an infinite number of timelines, and shifting into different ones constantly without realizing. Theoretically then, Mandela effect, glitches, maybe even ghost sightings would happen when we shift a little further than usual, creating discrepancies in our experience of reality. 
Forgiveness takes a lot of strength, but it's so damn powerful. For me, it helps to remember that believing that others deserve forgiveness creates a universe in which I'm worthy of forgiveness, too. And goodness knows I need it sometimes! 

It also helps me to remember that everyone has their own unique path, and it's not going to look like mine, and that's more than okay! Once upon a time I mocked people who meditated, and now it's a huge part of my life. I thought everyone else was an asshole for years before realizing that I was just as much of an asshole 😂 Point is, people are going to let us down but it doesn't mean they'll never change - and actually being truly kind to them can be the very thing that sets them on the path towards change, probably more than you'll ever know! 

Just my perspective, keep what resonates with you and disregard the rest ☺️
You got it!! I hope you enjoy your new job!! 
Same here!! I remember when it was so tiny, and the love and light of it was so unique (and still is!) that it felt really renegade, but full of joy, like little kids running around playing without adult supervision. ☺️💕 Gosh I love this place. 
Me too. Also, the way my 4 year old uses the iPad is so wholesome it hurts! She would FaceTime her friends every day if she could, but since other people are sometimes busy, she also loves to play Roblox with me and her dad, learn how to do magic tricks, color by numbers, and fire up some tunes for impromptu dance parties.

I don't know why people think it's an either/or situation. She loves being outside, reading books, painting, going places.. Technology is just an extension of the things she enjoys, it's not at all a replacement.
Some say horizontal stripes are unflattering, but I think he looks very handsome.
One time my husband and I took our two little ones on the train to downtown. We got off the train, one of us holding the 3 year old and the other pushing the baby stroller, and walked past a guy who said "Look at that, Dad of the year right here!" I just had to laugh. 
That's so thoughtful of you! I don't know what teens are into these days, but I think anything you do will be appreciated:) Maybe a gift card to the neighborhood pizza place, or a little themed gift basket, like for for a family movie/game night?
I think we exist in a stream of infinite timelines, and for whatever reason, they are merging and collapsing at an increasing rate. So theoretically, the moment you "remembered" playing that game with your sister would be a moment in which a timeline where that *did* happen folded itself into this timeline. 

I've experienced this as well, and I know what you mean by the "memory" feeling just out of reach. I think it's because it's more like a memory of a memory. Your brain is trying to reach into a void where that timeline (and all it's events) were once held, but there's nothing to latch onto, which creates a weird cognitive dissonance. Along the same lines, I've had sooo many glitchy things happen to me, which at the time were completely shocking.. yet I've noticed that unless I write them down immediately, within a few days I can't even remember what happened! 

At any rate, welcome to this timeline! I brought you a cookie 🍪💕
Wow, this is *exactly* what I needed to hear. It's remarkable how well it fits! Thank you so much, you're very gifted. I'm indeed at the end of an era in my life, and I think my blind spot has been thinking I need to check in with everyone else before trusting what I already know my heart is telling me. Thanks for the empowerment 💚🤗💪
Unless you're in desperate need of the money, I'd say cut your losses and definitely cut contact. He may be withholding the money precisely *because* it keeps you in contact with him. If you really need the money, pursue it through a third party if at all possible.

At any rate, I'm glad you're safe and sound.
Considering that you explicitly stated you didn't want him to replicate the story, I understand you being upset. I can also understand not being totally over it and ready to celebrate as if you have nothing to be upset about.

*However*, as someone who has been married almost 11 years, I highly recommend taking a minute alone to scream, cry, kick a pillow, whatever you need to do to release your frustration, and then try to move on and enjoy your evening. He's apologized, he's trying to make it up to you, and a good marriage is one of forgiveness. You'll be the one apologizing for something sooner or later, so extend the grace to him that you'd like to receive.

Also, plan your next anniversary, birthday, etc together! It's a lot of pressure on your spouse to have to come up with an evening you'll both enjoy, and placing the responsibility on both your shoulders will prevent a lot of potentially disappointing celebrations:)

P.s. Congrats on your one year milestone!!
Hey there! Thank you for sharing your perspective:) Abraham Hicks is fully entitled to his opinion, as are you! Personally, I don't disagree with the possibility you speak of, but I also think there's not a singular correct way to look at dreams. Our minds are too big, too varied, and there's no way to say with absolute certainty that a person's dreams are always made for one specific purpose. 

I have found that after I set a new intention, I tend to have vivid dreams set in my past for a few days, and lots of emotional conflicts that bubble up. I think it's because as I adjust to the new reality I'm creating, I have to address and release some old fears and feelings that would otherwise keep me tied to the old reality. 

Anyway, that's just my two cents, and if it didn't resonate with you, that's okay! I certainly did not mean to be offensive or frustrating to you, and if I was, I sincerely apologize 💚
I help people interpret their dreams, and I (lovingly) disagree about nightmares predicting the future. They certainly *can* be prophetic, but far more often they're a reflection things that you've already been through, and feelings that your subconscious is still trying to process. If you (or anyone, for that matter!) would like to PM me a dream, I'd be happy to help you hone in on what your subconscious is trying to bring to your attention:) 
So cool! I had something similar happen where I was meditating and a strange phrase popped into my head. I googled it, and it turned out to be a lucid dreaming technique. I'd never heard of it, never tried to lucid dream, I have no idea where that phrase came from at all! And soon after I had my first lucid dream:) It's like my subconscious mind was trying to get me to try before I ever consciously considered trying.

Anyway, I don't know how these things work. I just know that you're not alone, and sometimes we somehow know things before we know them. 
When we first looked at our rental house, it was late at night. We'd just found it on a rental site and wanted to see it in person before calling the property management company the next day. Our soon-to-be-neighbor was freaked out by our late night appearance and walked over to yell at us, being super rude and confrontational. I remained calm, acting as though I perceived her actions and words to be friendly. I wished her Merry Christmas, told her it was nice meeting her, smiled, etc.. the way I would have if she really were coming over to make friends:) 

The next time we saw her, she was every bit as friendly as I was pretending she was the first time. We became friends for real, and she ended up being the person who pet-sit for our animals when we traveled, she'd bring gifts for my toddler's birthday and baby gifts when my son was born. We love her, and she and her wife love us! 

TL;DR "Acting as if" is a powerful tool!!! I've been successful in transforming people's anger into kindness many, many times. This is just one example:)
Thanks for the offer! Any insight into my "blind spots", things I may benefit from paying attention to, etc would be lovely ☺️ I can't shake the feeling that I'm missing something! 
What did he call the other leg?
Love this idea! 💚 I got two very positive work-related emails this week. One letting me know I'd be paid a day early, which was sent at 3:33pm, and another offering me an ongoing gig which was sent at 12:22pm! 
I got a concussion a few years ago and when the paramedic asked me if I remembered who the President of the United States was, I had a flashback to the scene in this movie where he says "It's Jimmy Carter!!" and then they *know* something's wrong.

I have this too! There's multiple realities I visit at night, and the main thing they have in common is that I'm married to my same husband, but we have no kids. Which is interesting, because we spent the first 6 years of our marriage not planning on having kids, but changed our minds and now we have two. 

The one I visit the most is like a cross between Hunger Games and the Amazing Race. We're racing alongside others through forests and rivers, but it doesn't feel fun or even remotely safe. It feels like we're just trying to survive. But with all the alternate realities, it's like you describe: they're continued storylines and being there always feels normal, complete with a memory bank for that particular reality.

I have a half-baked theory that our souls or consciousness travel to these places at night and learn lessons, like an extra credit or night school program for the things we're meant to learn in our day-to-day reality.
Dimetapp was delicious.
I have news for you. That's called an episiotomy and it's very real, and very common. 
Let us know next time! I'll bring drinks.
Oh it's real. The CIA has declassified multiple documents containing extensive research and experimentation on the phenomena, concluding that it's not only real, but a valuable tool. [Here's just one](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/nsa-rdp96x00790r000100030004-1) of many such documents you can find on their site. [This one ](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf) is far more in depth but absolutely fascinating. 

I hope you enjoy the chance to expand your mind. Once upon a time I thought this stuff was hogwash, too! I'm glad I was able to accept that I didn't know everything about how the universe works, because it's pretty fucking magical and I was really missing out on some cool experiences. 💕🤗
::: hugs:::
I'm so sorry that happened to you 💔
I love you 💕
General guidance would be greatly appreciated, as I'm at something of a crossroads in my life!Thank you so much for sharing your gifts 💕💕
My 4 year old watched a video about continents recently and asked me which one we were in. When I told her we were in North America she thought it was amazing and jumped off the couch and said "Look at me!! I'm standing in North America!! You gotta try this!" So I stood up and yelled "I'm standing in North America too!!" It's actually really fun and I would recommend it to anyone in any continent.

Hey, look at you go.. You've manifested a reply so you can find this later!
Yes!! *Love has my back.* I am gonna make that my affirmation today. Thank you 🙏💜
I think you're exactly right ... We've been feeling like we should move, and reach for some new things/goals for a while now, but kept on maintaining the status quo. I love your perspective and I hope this is just the end before a much better beginning! 

I took your advice and sent a message to the coworker I was concerned about, and she was perfectly understanding about my mistake! I suggested to my boss a way of avoiding the confusion next time and he thought it was a great idea. By the time I left they were both praising my work, so I couldn't have asked for a better resolution. Next time I'll do it before I leave to avoid a restless night! Thanks so much for your wise and very kind words. 💕💕💕
Thank you so much for the vibes, I was able to check my phone periodically throughout the work day and felt like I was receiving a warm hug all day long!! 💕💕💕
Thank you so much, and thank you for creating the loveliest, lightest place on the internet 💚💙💜
💚😘
I love you too!! 💕💕💕 So dang much.
Gosh.. This brought tears to my eyes 😢❤️ S Such solid wisdom and advice. Thank you so much, it is so helpful and appreciated. ❤️❤️
Beautiful 🌈💕 I can't thank you enough for your focus and energy on my behalf. Love you brother 💞
Gosh I can't imagine how tough that must be. You've both got all the wishes and good vibes I can muster - and I'll keep em coming your way!! 💕💕💕 I'm always here if you want to PM and just vent or have a virtual shoulder to cry on. :: big hugs:: 
I'm so sorry for what you're going through. It may not be much but FWIW a random internet stranger is thinking about you and your mom today. ❤️
I'd suggest asking your subconscious that very question! Today, and just before going to sleep, ask yourself "Who is this man?" And "How can I make peace with him?" Intend to have a follow-up dream about this, and give it a few days. Keep in mind that the follow-up dream may consist of entirely new storylines and symbols, so feel free to check in and share any dreams you may have and I'll be happy to help. 
 Awesome, I'm so glad to hear it was helpful!!

 >Is the buying of gambling chips in any way notable? It dawned on me we didn’t actually gamble.... we just kept buying chips.

 Yes! It's almost certainly symbolic of a recurring behavior, mentality, or something along those lines. Dreams aren't big on "filler" content, ha! It's probably worthwhile to try a little free association with the various elements of the dream, and see what first comes to mind. 

For me, gambling immediately calls to mind the word "risk". But in this case, the real risk is in *not* gambling! You've already bought the chips, so you're better off playing and possibly winning than just continuing to stockpile chips. Perhaps the chips represent some leverage or asset you're not using to your advantage in the dating game, or at work? Perhaps you are comparing yourself to others, and feeling like your metaphorical "pile of chips" are inadequate, thereby making you feel unworthy of the relationship or career you desire? 

Just a few things to consider! 


In the dream world, your house represents yourself as a whole person. Taking a shower is symbolic of an emotional cleansing, forgiveness, spiritual renewal, etc. It's significant that you saw this man *before* you got in the shower, as it would seem to indicate that he represents something or someone who is keeping you from undergoing the emotional and spiritual cleanse that you need. It's entirely possible that this "man" is an internal part of yourself. It's also interesting that he is doing his own thing, he isn't actually hurting you, but you're *afraid* that he will. 

I don't think this is about your potential relationship, exactly.. It seems more like your subconscious trying to draw your attention to some fears or perceived threats that are holding you back. If that doesn't resonate, let me know and I'm happy to help you examine some other possibilities 😊
I have experience helping people interpret their dreams and would be happy to help you with this one. Can you provide all the details you can recall, including the setting, characters, colors, emotions you felt, and so on? 
Buying the chips because the other women were suggests that you're caught in an undesirable feedback loop, or that you aren't being true to yourself in some way. The subconscious mind likes to cast an additional character for each part of yourself that it wants to illustrate, so it's likely that all three women represent parts of yourself. Since your subconscious chose single friends, specifically, it may be a feedback loop within yourself that is keeping you single.

The business cards are interesting because you left them in two stacks. Two is often used to represent the idea of a relationship. You put out cards that don't direct people towards yourself, but rather your uncle, by way of a job he doesn't  even like! This seems to be indicating that you're either not putting yourself out there at all, or you're putting yourself out there in a way that is ultimately directing people *away* from you. 

Dream interpretation works best as a collaborative process, so do let me know what does and doesn't resonate with you, and I'm happy to help you hone in on what your subconscious is trying to process 😊
Wowwwww dude! I can't even tell you how much this applies to me right now. There's two loved ones in particular who deserve my love and support right now, but I've been withdrawn and I don't know why! Thank you so much. 

Also, I got your message at 11:11am, and there's 33 comments in your post. Time for me to pay attention 😊
General guidance, please:) Thank you so much for your kind offer! 💗💚
Thanks for taking me seriously, I felt pretty self-conscious posting this! I  don't remember what the deals were, exactly.. But I had a series of  past life dreams after this experience that were intensely vivid, they felt more like memories than dreams. I never saw what I looked like, but all my friends looked like the guy I saw in my living room. We lived on a spaceship that was small but expandable, like additional rooms could just kind of materialize at the push of a button. 

The feeling I had with them was total love and support. We were workers who spread love and light everywhere we went. We zipped around and took meetings with aliens who worked for the "dark side", so to speak. We never fought with them though, we just used a kind of telepathy to determine if they were willing to work with us and maybe even become less dark. If they were, I or one of my buddies would teleport to their ship and negotiate. 

Eventually I got bored, and wanted to try something harder. So I heard that the planet Earth was in trouble, and needed volunteers to come and spread the light by being loving and forgiving. I was told that I'd need to be careful not to hurt anyone. I thought "Huh? Why would I ever do that??" It's hard to explain, but the dimension or atmosphere of this place I was in made it really easy to be loving all the time. I was really naive, like I couldn't possibly understand how much I'd be hurt in this life, and how much I'd hurt others as well. They tried to tell me, but I just couldn't comprehend it and I was too excited about the adventure of it all. 

The idea was that they'd basically upload my consciousness into a baby, and my next "memory" is being in the womb, already able to sense how painful and difficult it is to be here, thinking "Oh no, I don't want to do this anymore." But it was too late. The dreams came to a screeching halt after that, but I don't mind because if (and I realize that's a big "if") this is at all true, my focus needs to be on this life I chose and work I signed up for. 

Edit: interesting side note.. my whole life I've had a recurring thought that I wish I hadn't been born. I'd have this thought a LOT, even in the happy times. But ever since I saw my old friend, and had all these dreams, I've found myself thinking that I'm glad I was born. Honestly, this all feels very real to me, but either way it's been a blessing. 
Gosh I'm gonna sound completely insane, but f*ck it. Not an abduction, but I saw an alien in my living room about a month ago.  He was blue with an enormous, mushroom shaped noggin. I didn't feel afraid though, as he looked strangely familiar, like an old friend. I thought to myself "Why am I seeing this guy?" And the answer was telepathic, saying "You made some deals before you came here." I understood this to mean that I knew him in a past life and had done him some favors, so he was going to help me out in this life, in some way. Then he disappeared. 

It was bizarre, obviously, but somehow really comforting. I actually got emotional thinking about it the next day. 
Winona Ryder. It has no effect on my life except for randomly being told I look like Winona Ryder from time to time.

Ps I like your style!
Beautiful! Thank you for sharing. My brother has autism, and I am a better person for having grown up with him. He got a job bussing tables, and my dad had to teach him about paying bills because he just wanted to give all his money away 💖 I'm so glad you and Kyle found each other ☺️
/u/Eateroflife283 remotely viewed you order food last week. You picked your side, and it was mashed potatoes. 
You're welcome:) And it's not a dumb question at all! It's normal to second guess things, especially when feelings are involved. I hope you have a good time on your date! 
I sort of naturally believed in the LOA as a child. For example, my mom took me to see the play *Annie* when I was about five years old, and I became obsessed! I pretended to be starring in *Annie* all the time, and would practice as if I'd already been cast. When I turned 10, just the right age for the part, I saw an ad for *Annie* auditions in my hometown newspaper, and I got the part:) 

Rediscovering the LOA as an adult, I found it harder to "Act as if", but I basically use the same techniques of imagining myself in the scenario I intend to manifest. So far, so good! 
You're welcome! I'm only able to offer this advice because I struggle with the same things, and becoming aware of it has been helping me a lot💕🤗 You got this! 
When my daughter was three she used to tell us all kinds of stories about "When Daddy was a little boy", always from the perspective of an adult. I tried to ask her about when Mommy was a little girl and she said she didn't know. She also said that her baby brother was her brother before, but he was a girl:) 

You'd probably enjoy checking out /r/pastlives if you haven't already! There's some cool stories there. 
I believe you Mac! Have you read about the Mandela Effect? 
You and OP should check out /r/precognition 😊 You're definitely not alone!
And I just read this comment at 11:33 
I manifested a very positive conversation with my boss. I really like him but he was a jerk recently and it was pretty upsetting. I focused on projecting love and forgiveness towards him until the next time we worked together, and the whole drive to work that morning I tried to feel grateful for the best possible outcome of the situation. 

Truthfully, I wanted to tell him he was wrong, but something in my mind told me that I should ask what I could be doing better instead. So I did, and he immediately responded with an apology for the way he'd acted, said that it wasn't my fault, and that he's very happy with my work!! I can't even tell you how unlikely it seemed that he'd ever acknowledge he was a jerk, much less apologize. I'm so thankful and surprised! It was also a learning experience for me to keep an open mind about people, and to stay humble and be willing to be part of the solution rather than assume they'll never change. 
I really like all of /r/GarbageDolly advice! Here's a few things that jumped out to me in your post and responses:

Unnecessary limitations: there's a lot of ways to make money besides being a massage therapist or a server! So starting your own business doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing situation unless you make it one. Try and open yourself up to many possibilities for earning a living, and see what comes up, because the possibilities are endless! I have a part time job, a small business, and a hobby that sometimes pays, and I love this combo because it's never monotonous and I don't have to strictly rely on any one thing in order to have income. I've also found that even though the jobs are in fairly different fields, I still get clients/contacts through one job that end up being business for another.

Negative motivations: it's hard to get excited about something if there's shame attached, and there's definitely some shame in the motivation to "finally get out" of your parents house. It has the implication that you've been there too long, you should have reached full independence by now, etc, which are making you feel bad every time you think about this goal that's supposed to bring you joy! You're doing great, and there's no (real) shame whatsoever in living with family at your age, so try to focus on moving out for the most fun and uplifting reasons:) 

Externally-placed identity: I get the impression that you feel like you need money, success, a home etc to feel like you're "enough". But you were worthy of existing on the day you were born, and you didn't bring a single one of those things with you😉 The same is true for you now, it just doesn't feel like it because of over time we're conditioned to think the most important thing we can do is make money. There's nothing wrong with the goal of financial success, but please don't measure your worth as a person that way. You have much to offer just as you are, and we're all lucky to have you here! 

I love you and I'm pulling for you! Keep us updated as you experience the sunrise in your  new beginnings☀💕
I don't think you're crazy but I do think you're freaking out for no reason 😉 There's no chance I've been pregnant the past month and I've been seeing 333 like crazy! Our reality is an unpredictable place, so I would ease up on the assumption that this is a sign you're having a baby. IME it's more likely to be a little pat on the back saying "You're doing great! You are loved!" than a prophecy.

That being said, the thing I recommend the most is the power of positive thinking. Believe that if you have another child, it will be a very special child that has been planning to be with you since before you were even born. Believe that you will have more than enough resources and time to raise another little one. Believe that you are in the middle of something so much greater than yourself. 

We were practically homeless when I got pregnant with my oldest, and for a month or two I wasted so many tears worrying about how things could possibly work out. We had to move to a new city and get different jobs, etc, but in the end we were able to provide for her better than I could have imagined. Not only that, but the "sacrifices" we made in order to take care of her ended up putting us in a far better position to reach the very goals we'd been trying (and failing!) to achieve for years. We thought we needed to hit all these goalposts before we could have a baby, and it ended up being the other way around! So take a deep breath and know that the universe is working in your favor, baby or no baby 💕💕💕
This is great!! How long does it take you to animate about one minute worth of video in this style? 
I'd love to! Will do so shortly 📚💚
Careful with that! Your thoughts are very powerful, and if there is a Satan, he'd like nothing more than to make you feel afraid. Especially when you might be on the verge of some beautiful experiences! I've been seeing repeating numbers a lot more recently, and I try to remember to mentally express love and gratitude every time, assuming that the numbers are a positive sign. And guess what? I've had extraordinarily good luck lately, and so many things I've been working towards for years are just falling into place all of the sudden. 

For every good thing that can happen to you, you can find someone on the internet telling you it's a bad thing. *You* and only you can allow the energy within yourself to skew negative or positive, so if you think you've got an evil entity in yourself, you might as well have one. Simply declare yourself free of their control, and you are free. Declare yourself open to the influences of love and light, and expect miracles. To believe that you're a helpless victim of darkness is to throw away your tremendous personal power and to miss out on opportunities for a happier life.

PS I'm posting this at 12:22pm and I feel great about it 😉💕 Don't worry, be happy. 
[This is just one](http://ndestories.org/stories/) of a dozen or so websites that collect Near Death Experience stories. Of course you gotta decide for yourself what to believe, but it certainly makes for some interesting reading! 
Passionate, empathetic and creative certainly describes me. In fact I was working on illustrating a children's book when I got your message, ha! Thanks so much for the reading, it's a very cool gift that you have 💕💕💕
Based on the information I'd say she's genuinely interested in you. 
If you don't mind me asking.. At what age did you develop this, or did you always have it? I used to nanny for a little guy from age 2-3 who would tell me what color I was. After I had a miscarriage, he had no idea why I was sad but he started telling me I was gray 😔 I moved away 5 years ago but I've always wondered if he was seeing my aura, and what color he'd see from me now. 
Check out the sub /r/precognition and you'll see this phenomenon is pretty common! When I was 11 years old I dreamt about the grisly specifics of my pet rabbit's untimely death a few days before it happened. Been trying to understand the nature of "reality" ever since. 

PS I'm so sorry about your pup ❤️

Edit: spelling
So much food for thought here - this is something I've been learning a lot about recently and I feel like it's a vitally important topic for our whole society.

I really respect your courage and honesty - anger is something we've all felt but many are afraid to talk about, because it's not considered a "good" emotion to have. We learn from a young age that only the "bad" kids get angry, and this shaming is reflected in the subsequent years as we become conditioned to choke it out, lock it in a cage. But there is no part of ourselves that can stay locked up forever, just like you described: eventually the banished emotion escapes, and then you're dealing with the anger of the situation at hand plus an eruption of backlogged anger!

But it doesn't have to be this way.. Anger, when properly integrated, is just a calm, steady voice of justifiable self-respect. It's a small but powerful flame within that gives us the courage to ask for a raise, firmly assert boundaries, and protect the vulnerable. When we accept that anger is a natural emotion just doing its best to protect the self or others, we're able to harness the self-respecting motivation behind it and express it lovingly as soon as we feel disrespected. It's much, much easier to keep your cool if you address what you're feeling long *before* you get hot. 

I tell my kids "It's okay to be angry, but you can't hurt anybody." and I even suggest punching a pillow, stomping, etc sometimes because I firmly believe that anger has to be allowed to be released. I actually did a therapy session recently where I found myself screaming "fuck you" into a pillow over some things that happened back in high school! I couldn't believe how much lighter, calmer, and more forgiving I felt (and still feel) after that. Crazy stuff.. I'd unknowingly been carrying that rage around with me for 18 years. 

Point is, your anger isn't shameful. It's just ready to be let out of the cage so it can become the loving, safe and well-integrated tool it's meant to be. Just my two cents😊. Take what resonates and leave the rest behind! Much love to you my brother 💚💚💚 Keep it up! 
You mean [these books?](https://imgur.com/gallery/mIdNZ7C) I grew up with this set and just started reading them with my own kids 😊 🔬 🍁 🤖
That's (thankfully) a myth; dying in a dream is not uncommon, but it is usually something that happens in symbolic/metaphorical dreams and is meant to illustrate some aspect of your emotional life.

I would categorize this as a precognitive dream, which is surprisingly common as well! Check out /r/precognition for many similar accounts. Glad you're okay! 
I pay attention to the feelings I get while considering the action. If following him on IG makes you feel excited, nervous in a good way, joyful, etc, do it! If you feel unpleasantly anxious or conflicted about it, wait for the next possible action and see how that feels 😊
I'm so sorry you went through that - sounds terrifying! You've got such an encouraging and uplifting vibe, I'm really thankful you're okay 💕 

Your story is bound to be controversial, because money is a loaded topic to begin with, and it's such an unexpected twist to the "almost died" storyline. Most people will probably be watching expecting to see you speak on a newfound appreciation for life, and then your taking the money will seem shallow in comparison.. But anyone who has been greatly in need of $100 (raises hand) knows that the gratitude you feel once you're struggling a little bit less is anything but shallow.

And none of us can say how we'd react unless we've been in your shoes, so don't let the criticism upset you. At the same time, I do suggest being willing to consider how you might have responded differently. Not because you did anything "bad", but because every moment of our lives is a sliding door to other possibilities, and we can learn so much from considering the other paths we might have taken. You shouldn't feel any guilt or shame, though. You are beautiful and deserving of everything good 😊💕🙌
Me too!-But I also feel like the exhaustion and discomfort aren't bad, but rather temporary symptoms of having shifted in some way. I was meditating last night and I quickly started to feel a really pleasant tingling/vibration. The phrase "ancient upgrades" came to mind, and I saw a 2D shape that's been coming to my mind and puzzling me since I was a child. The shape started to turn into a 3D construction project being built in ancient times, which was so cool! Aaaand then my son woke up and I had to snap out of it and go be mommy :)
TL;DR I wonder if something leveled up in our DNA or consciousness last night that we're energetically adapting to today. 
It's a great sign, it means you're on the right track! In addition, many believe it's a sign from your angels or guides that they're with you and proud of you. You can Google "angel number" and the numbers you keep seeing and read multiple interpretations, but I think it's important to remember that only you can sense the true meaning, because whatever you see is *for you* and specific to your experience.
You might want to try posting this on /r/Retconned as there's some really interesting discussions over there about geography changes.
/r/lostreddditors ? Slaying isn't quite what we're about here 😉

It's funny you mention aliens though, because a few nights ago I dreamt of an alien invasion. Everyone was terrified, including me, but I intuitively knew that wishing them harm was the only way they could get me. I focused all my energy on sending them love and light, and it was like they had no choice but to pass on by. Not only was I safe, my loving intentions made me uninteresting to them because provoking anger and fear is how they* get their kicks. 

Edit: by "they" I mean this specific group. I think the vast majority of aliens are benevolent. 
Oh wow, when I wrote the other comment I had no idea that you were the same person I responded to here! I read sooo many posts but feel compelled to respond to (relatively) so few of them, it's crazy that I inadvertently reached out to you twice! You and I must be on the same wavelength:) 

I'm honestly not sure why, but I felt like I should delete my other comment and resend it via PM, so I deleted it but I hadn't sent the PM yet! If you're open to it, I'd love to talk more about these new/old friends of ours. 💜💚💛💙❤️
I'm on board if you're interested in illustrations:) 
Oh my goodness, you've made my day! I appreciate and love you so much too, and I'm here for you anytime! 💜💛💚💙❤️

It's not vain to see your own power and potential, it's beautiful and essential that you do! You ARE one of the greats!! Embrace it! Life is long, and sometimes it's really hard. But if you can learn to appreciate the hard times as a trial by fire: a chance to burn off the things that are no longer serving your highest potential, so that you can grow into something much greater, you'll soon come out on the other side like a Phoenix born from ashes.

You mentioned getting your whole self to cooperate, and I truly get what you mean! I highly recommend [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Therapy-Step-Step-Cutting-Edge-Psychotherapy/dp/0984392777), even if you only read the free sample you'll get a lot of helpful realizations. 

The idea is that as we go through life experiences of trauma, sadness, etc, parts of our truest selves go into hiding, while other parts of ourselves spring up to put up defences and barriers to try and stop the wounded selves from getting hurt again. These "bodyguard" parts of self only have good intentions for you: they want to protect you! But sometimes they're misguided, or no longer needed.

For example, you have a "bodyguard" part of yourself that's telling you you're tired, and it's safer to stay in bed. If you view that part of self like he's bad, it only doubles down on the hurt and fear he's already feeling. You have to be thankful for his efforts, love him, assure him that you are safe, and gently tell him that he can move along now. 

TL;DR Love, forgive, and appreciate every single part of yourself, even (or especially!) the parts that you don't want to be anymore, and they will dissipate and reintegrate back into the whole, making you into a new and improved version of yourself. You got this!!! 
::hugs:: you're never alone. 

I see a lot of self-defeating assumptions in your post, such as the assumption that your brain is wired to be negative. You have a beautiful brain, it's just in need of a little makeover:)

You can change anything you want, and changing your way of thinking is one of the easier things to change! If you don't meditate, it's time to start. My brain is very active, always going and going, so I really understand what it's like to feel stuck in a negative thought loop! Meditation trains your brain to slow down, and starting with just a few minutes a day can make a noticeable difference in less than a week. So start there.

Next, write down some positive affirmations and try and think of them every single time you catch yourself having a negative thought. You don't have to believe the statements are true - just start thinking about them and they will start to become your reality. Here's a few of my favorite affirmations:

The worst is behind me.
I'm doing a great job.
I'm safe and loved.
Everything is going well for me.
I have a lot to look forward to.
I love myself.
I love everyone.
I have an abundance of money.
I have an abundance of energy.
I have an abundance of love.
I'm really blessed. 

I also recommend thinking "Thank you" and "I love you." as much as possible. You can direct your love and gratitude to yourself, random strangers, the universe, whatever you want! Just practice feeling love and gratitude, *especially* on the tough days.

💚 I love you, and I'm here for you anytime! 💚
Plaaahs-taahk!! Lol my brother and I loved this movie and loved to imitate his weird pronunciations.
Your associations make perfect sense to me! In case it's helpful, here's my thoughts on few of them.

Mario Kart: maybe about how you are navigating through life? Or the "games" you play socially, at work, etc to get ahead.

Toilets; could represent your thoughts /feelings about what you're "producing" with your current life. Or something you and/or others are trying to keep hidden.

Belly of the serpent: makes me think of the Wolf in sheep's clothing, but it's a man in snakes' clothing, and it feels like a trap! Does that parallel to a feeling you have sometimes? Like you have no choice but to appear threatening? 

Shark in the water: water often represents emotions, the shark could be an angry part of yourself, or an emotional threat of some kind. 

Shopping centers: often represents how you are presenting yourself, or how you see yourself in relation to society. 

Do you have any more recurring characters? Thinking of your immediate associations with the people in your dreams, or the recalling type of person you were back when you spent the most time with them, might be helpful for identifying which parts of yourself the dream is trying to resolve. For example, you mentioned the ex-girlfriend dreams; perhaps there's a part of yourself that's still "stuck" in those days, waiting to be reintegrated. So for instance if you felt like you were selfish back then.. Forgiving yourself and your mistakes would probably soothe those particular dreams away. 
Well I for one don't think you're crazy:) IMO it's entirely possible that scientists there (and elsewhere) are doing all kinds of crazy stuff that isn't disclosed to the general public. But regardless of whether or not our universe is being tampered with, I think the most important part of your comment is this: 

>he believed it was absolutely crucial that people need to hold true and not lose themselves 

I believe that too, and I think people are doing it all on their own. It's amazing how many people (myself included) are actually living better and happier lives since experiencing these alternate dimension type dreams, glitches, etc. And even though the recent batch of shared dreams were apocalyptic, the underlying theme was that the dreamers felt calm, and knew there was no reason to be afraid. That's beautiful, and worth taking to heart! 

All of this to say: don't worry, be happy. Personally I believe there's an awakening force of love and light rolling in, and it's unstoppable. 
I don't think it sounds stupid at all, and I think your mom is blessed to have you in her life. 💕 My advice is to lead by example, try new things, and pass along the things that you find helpful. Here's my go-to daily list for improving my mind and body, complete with an acronym: SWEM! 

Supplement: getting all the vitamins and nutrients I need, either through food alone or food + supplements. 

Water: staying hydrated.

Exercise: hitting the gym, doing thirty minutes of yoga, or even just dancing around the living room is great for my overall energy and mood. 

Meditate: I try and do at least ten minutes a day. 

These are just a few ideas, but the point is to take care of good yourself, and talk to your mom about the benefits you're experiencing. Wishing you both all the best ✨✨✨


That's amazing! I'm in a private subreddit and the same thing happened. *Huge* influx of powerful dreams reported Friday morning! 
Seeing the little ordinary, daily life things in places like this fill me with existential dread. Someone washed that coffee mug, set it on the wire rack to dry, and then what? Where did they go?
Are you serious?? I'm so glad you shared this, I can't wait to read more! 
He said he doesn't remember any colors in particular! Do you? 

I like the shared dream idea - I hadn't thought of that. Sometimes I wonder if our consciousness have experiences in alternate dimensions while our body is sleeping. It's as if some really crappy universes were destroyed, and y'all were all there for the end of (those particular) times, somehow knowing that it wasn't the end of *you.*
First of all, I'm sorry you're feeling this way! It sounds like you're under a lot of stress and some old wounds are feeling raw. It's understandable that you'd be upset, but keep breathing and know that everything is going to be okay. 

The idea behind those dimensional jumping methods is that we can shape our reality. If that's true, then it's not really possible for you to jump into the wrong dimension unless you decide that it is! And if you did decide that you jumped into the wrong dimension, you could simply jump into a better one:) 

Are you familiar with the law of attraction? It's the same general idea, but instead of trying to jump straight from one version of your life to another, you set the intention to have certain changes *come into* your life. I've had success with both approaches, and I think it's really just about deciding what you want for yourself, and then moving forward with the assumption that your desires are already manifesting. 

If you want to speed up the process, then expect the best, practice feeling love towards yourself and others, and be grateful for everything good in your life, no matter how small. It's pretty mind-blowing how many wonderful things you can attract!
Beautiful! The number 27 has been my favorite since I was a child. It wasn't until I turned 27 that I learned it's my grandmother's favorite number as well. It's a very special number:)
Truthfully.. I don't know what it is. I don't really have a belief system about this, I just observe correlations and look for patterns, and sometimes I notice that the people around me and everywhere I look online seem to be experiencing some very specific things within a 36 hour or so block of time. This time around it was people who don't normally remember their dreams having vivid dreams, people unexpectedly reconnecting with someone they lost touch with, and random good things happening to people. 

If you don't mind sharing.. What was your dream about? 
I'm so very sorry about your friend. It's a sad irony that depression can make us hide away from the very people who love us and are willing to help. I'm sure you meant more to Scott than you'll ever know. 
Do you remember what it was about?
You're never alone. 
Anytime you wanna get stuff off your chest, please don't hesitate to PM me. I don't judge and I'd be honored to provide listening ear. 💕
What the what! My husband had that exact same dream. Here's [another one ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/8pi3po/comment/e0bncof?st=JI7R41DK&sh=00ef07b7) and [another. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/8potvd/unusual_dream_summary_insights_please/?st=JI7R7E3F&sh=a737ffa2) 
Mazel tov, Gay Jesus! 💕
Whoa! Wouldn't it be cool if that plays out in reality? It's like we got some kind of system upgrade that improved relationships and circumstances. 
Did the logo appear yesterday, by chance? It seems like a whole bunch of people, myself included, shifted to a better timeline/universe sometime Thursday night. 
This has happened to me before! I saw my face morph into the faces of dozens of old women, and their faces reflected the emotion I was feeling in that exact moment. For example, I started to feel anxious, and my face became the face of a woman who was anxious her whole life. When I calmed down and felt happy, I saw the face of a woman who was at peace her whole life. 

I believe it's a function of the third eye. Ancient cultures throughout time were well aware of the abilities of the third eye, but in modern times its less common for people to hear about it, so when it activates, we don't know what's going on. The brain is a fascinating and complex machine capable of all kinds of amazing things. Stay positive, and start meditating if you haven't already done so. You're in for some beautiful experiences!
I'm so sorry you're dealing with this, my friend. It sounds awful. It's possible that they're going through something that's making them feel angry and aggressive, and not telling you about it. I would try and get them talking about it at a time when everyone is calm and happy. Tell them that you don't understand what changed, and that the constant fighting is breaking your spirit. Be honest and express your feelings with love and gentleness. Be open to the possibility that they are just hurting. I think there's a lot of truth to the phrase "People who are hurting hurt people." 

Beyond that, do what you can to create a port in the storm. Go to your room and listen to binaural beats. Meditate. Intend to have a healing experience with them. Intend for them to have healing experiences on their own. Practice [ho'oponopono ](https://upliftconnect.com/hawaiian-practice-of-forgiveness/) and direct the energy to them. Know that you are safe and loved. I'm always here anytime you want to chat 💕
Forgive yourself, love yourself, and be patient. We all have painful experiences that can leave us stuck in negative thought cycles. You aren't thinking "bad" thoughts because you're bad at this, you're thinking that because you've been hurt. So getting mad at yourself is just doubling down on the hurt you're already feeling. Does that make sense? 

Try this: whenever these Ughhhh thoughts come up, respond to yourself with positive affirmations, like "I'm doing a great job." Or "I'm a beautiful person inside and out." Or "I'm thankful for how I look." It's okay if you don't necessarily feel like they're true just yet. By replacing the negative thoughts with positive ones, you'll begin a healing  process and raise your vibrations to a level where you can receive the gifts you're asking for. Know that you are deserving of all gifts, and practice feeling grateful for the beauty that is *already* manifesting for you. 💗
1. Stay hydrated
2. Look for every opportunity to make someone's day a little better.
3.  Practice [ho'oponopono](https://upliftconnect.com/hawaiian-practice-of-forgiveness/) 
4. Take a break from reading the news and social media.
5. Text a friend just to say you're glad they're in your life.
You're not crazy, and there's nothing to worry about:) Think of it like a little wink from the universe, letting you know you're on the right track. There's no real reason for it to be ominous- all kinds of amazing things could happen to you! 
This comment reminded me of [this song](https://youtu.be/L5jI9I03q8E) that I love to listen to when I feel low, because it lets me express my sadness and loss before celebrating all that I have:) 

🎶I got my arms, got my hands, got my fingers, got my legs, got my feet, got my toes, got my liver, got my blood! I've got life, I've got my freedom, I've got LIFE!!!🎶
Don't worry about the rockstar example, I should have worded my suggestion better!

The method is just to gain confidence by pretending you're already confident. Imagine yourself as you'd like to be perceived by others, and then imagine that you're already being perceived that way as you go about your day. We all put out energy to others all the time anyway, be it anxious, shy, agitated, whatever. This is just the act of consciously altering your energy. As you get used to the idea of projecting confidence (or any characteristic, really) real confidence begins to grow underneath.

Think of it like exercise. First you decide you want to be able to run 5 miles, and eventually you will, but it starts with jogging around the block. 
I think it's just the way you go about it- you can be confident and also be warm and inclusive :) 
Hey there! Just checking in after a little Reddit hiatus. I'm so glad my response was helpful. FWIW, the "free of charge" bit in my title was a joke - I never charge! So please feel free to comment or PM me your dreams any time. I relate to some of your experiences and would be happy to help however I can 😘💕
😍 love it.
Walk into the room pretending to be super famous, and that everyone wants to talk to you. You don't have to 100% believe it, just keep mentally projecting the confidence of a rockstar and see what happens. It's pretty crazy how heads start to turn, try it and see. 
Okay, thank you for the solid advice, kind stranger. My children are quite little, ages 1 and 4, so they are far more into stuff like swimming, roblox, dinosaurs, and impromptu dance parties than anything I could possibly say on this subreddit:) 

But I feel ya.. I was raised in a very religious household, and when I grew up and felt differently about religion than my parents, it was really tough, and I didn't know how to tell them. So I hope very much that my children never feel like I'm pushing my personal beliefs onto them. I don't feel as though I need them to be interested in, or even aware of what I think about the universe. I just want them to feel as safe, happy and loved as I can.


P.S. What are your thoughts on [this](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170215-the-strange-link-between-the-human-mind-and-quantum-physics), if I may ask? I don't like to argue on the internet but I am always up for a friendly discussion!

I hope you have a good day. 💕
Ha! Because I let them watch Willy Wonka, or because their mom enjoys pondering theoretical and practical applications of physical science? Either way, I love you. I really do. 
Thanks so much for sharing, and congrats on the lucidity! I've only had a lucid dream once, and I decided to fly right away, haha! That was just a few months ago so I'm hoping it happens again soon. 

I'm eager to hear the message of this dream, if you don't mind sharing! 
I'm glad you asked! This is a pretty common one so don't feel bad 😊 A quick way to figure this one out might be to ask yourself "What do I feel guilty about?" 

The "accidentally cheated" dreams can come from the feeling that you're spending too much time on work, video games, thinking about other people, and so on.  In other words, the dreams may not be about actually cheating with a girl at all, but rather some other form of letting her down. Or simply a *fear* of letting her down. Does that help?
How strange! They say that we often dream of stores as a snapshot of how we're considering presenting ourselves in society. In that light, this might be a dream about feelings of society being "past it's prime", holding nothing new for you, and yet creepily keeping tabs on you just the same. However, children's dreams are a bit no more difficult to translate, because children's associations can be so different from adults. 

So a good way to figure this one out might be to try and think of your life at the age you had these dreams, and what your associations with stores might have been. If not "place I go to get stuff I need to function in society", maybe "place my parents take me", or "place I might get lost." Then think about the imagery and feelings you had against that backdrop. 

Let me know what you think!
Hey, that's not a bad thing! My husband is the same way. I have vivid and memorable dreams almost nightly, and his memorable dreams are few and far between. Maybe one or two a year. 

I have a theory about this, totally unproven: He's a really extroverted feeler, like he's able to process his emotions very well and speak to what he's feeling in the moment. Whereas I tend to try and avoid thinking about my feelings, and sometimes I keep em suppressed and unprocessed, until they come out in the form of dreams. So! I've wondered if those who don't remember their dreams tend to be able to process and express their emotions on the fly. What say you?
First of all, and hope this is okay to say, but I'd love to see this as a scene in a movie! ✨✨

 As with any dream, you should trust your instincts on this one. Your spiritual journey is your own beautifully unique thing, so I'll leave the spiritual interpretations up to you! Disregard anything that isn't resonant, but here's what I see in the emotional intelligence of the dream:

The setting of the girl's house may be uniquely significant if she was a real girl you know. If it was a random girl, then the setting seems to me to be conveying that this dream is illustrating (in part) how you feel about yourself in society/in relation to others. 

The thing that sticks out to me the most is that the painful feeling manifests immediately after being shushed by your mom. You were just sharing your thoughts, hurting no one, and she made you feel as though you were doing something wrong. Your confidence was undermined, and you weren't able to truly stand up for yourself. 

The "punched in the gut" feeling is one of painful shame and sadness, and personally, I often feel it when I've done nothing wrong! I only*fear* that I have. Does that sound like what you expedience? It's a sickening feeling, for me, and one I'm only just starting to realize that I don't deserve to feel that so much of the time. Many, many of us get traumatized by feeling shame in front of others at a young age. Or any age! And then, long after the critical, condescending or angry voices that made us feel that way are no longer around, we still feel the affects of them, and for some it feels like what we call social anxiety and depression. It's exactly the kind of "stuck" emotions that are the subconscious' #1 job to make better. But it all needs to be consciously processed before the healing can begin, so vivid dreams are born from that subconscious effort to help you know what you are feeling. 

TL;DR  perhaps you have difficulty speaking your feelings and beliefs due to some negative conditioning ❤️

P.S. What are the six orbs of energy, and what's your interpretation of the parable? 




don't want to intrude upon your own way of looking at the dream, because as always, *you* are the best interpreter of your dreams! It's most likely to be a culmination of the things you're experiencing and feeling, so above all else, trust your instincts 😊




This is a good one! It's fascinating that you were in the backyard, because in dreamland backyards often represent childhood, and the past experiences now "behind" us. It's as if this dream was *meant* to be brought with you into adulthood, which certainly warrants a closer look. 

To interpret a child's dream, it helps to think like you did as a child. Bees can represent transformation (as in the honey-making process), community, collaboration, hard work, etc. But to a child, the association may be as simple as "thing that might hurt me." 

Hands are usually symbolic of the work that we do. Whether it's a child building block towers and cutting paper shapes, or an adult doing the dishes and having a job, we use our hands! But they can also symbolize our life's work, our true calling, and the fact that this dream has stayed with you leads me to think this is the case.

To be bitten in a dream typically indicates feeling attacked, vulnerable, leeched off of, or some other form of threat. But what's interesting is that you feel no pain, almost as if your hands were prepared for this. 

To be perfectly honest, I don't know what this dream is saying. But if I were to guess the message, I'd say it's something like "Nothing can stop you from doing what you came here to do." 

💕🐝💕
Wow! IMO this was your Inner Self coming through with a powerfully important message. Thanks so much for sharing. 💗
It's my pleasure, and thanks for being willing to share some of your dreams! ❣💭

My first instinct is that the house, at least in the first dream, speaks to some feelings about growing up with your mom. But it's just as likely to be about your family as a whole, and yourself in relation to them. The age of yourself in the dream indicates that this is about lingering effects of the younger you's experiences. The woman selling the house may represent parts of your mom's psyche. The subconscious tends to add an additional character for each part of someone's personality that it wants to illustrate.

Bathrooms are where we tend to our most private (and sometimes unpleasant) business, and in dreams they usually represent much the same thing. The things we don't want anyone to know or see, and aren't a part of our public persona. So it's possible that there's some family drama that was kept under wraps, or aspects of your family's life that were kept from you, or some other form of private pain that you haven't properly processed and healed from. It might be pain that you experienced as a child, and felt like you shouldn't tell anyone. 

Looking out a window typically symbolizes your view of the world, or in this case, the way you looked at world in the time of your life that this dream is meant to illustrate. The broken down amusement park seems to say "Joy is gone." The colorful, abandoned houses may be "colorful" parts of yourself that you lost when you were younger, or "colorful" parts of your family life that were ruined somehow. The fact that your family is happy with the view, unaware of your feelings of dread, makes me think that you are the one who "died" in private, murdered by the stranger who might still be in the house. The fact that he might still be in the house suggests that your pain felt inescapable, and maybe still does. 

The attic represents your highest thoughts, which often means spirituality. Forgotten or undiscovered parts of a house is a very common dream metaphor, and it means that there's a part of yourself that you've lost touch with. The childhood friend and her family are probably parts of yourself that you lost when you were a child, and stopped "spending time in" this part of your spiritual life as a result. It's very powerful imagery, and it's more hopeful than it probably feels within the dream! There are "hidden rooms" within all of us, just waiting to be enjoyed again. They've just been boarded up with pain we aren't ready to face again. 

Please don't feel discouraged by the darkness of these dreams... It's not indicative of anything you're doing wrong, or not doing well enough. [I keep recommending this book](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Therapy-Step-Step-Cutting-Edge-Psychotherapy/dp/0984392777) for precisely this reason! It's helped me to understand that each and every "bad" self within us isn't even bad, it's just a defensive Bodyguard self that is protecting a wounded little Child self. Children need to be able to express their feelings and receive unconditional love and support, but when that inevitably fails to happen, a little piece of that child remains stuck in those bad feelings, and a Defensive self develops to try and stop you from reliving that pain. 

As with any dream interpretation, this one is subject to my own projections and experiences, so I want to stress that *you* are the best interpreter of your dreams! If any of that resonates, awesome, and the things that don't quite feel right are your subconscious telling you "That's not it.. Keep thinking!" I find that by pondering the interpretations that *do* feel right, and then thinking about them in relation to the parts that are still confusing me, things start to click into place and make sense overall. 

Please don't hesitate to follow up with questions, other dreams, etc. I'm truly happy to help however I can 😊💕💕💕💕
That's beautiful. It's a lot like what people who participate in the therapeutic MDMA trials say .. That they got to know themselves underneath all the barriers they've built up, and that in itself is a catalyst for continued healing. 

I'm glad my comment was helpful, I was hesitant about posting it because the last thing I want to do is derail your positive experience by projecting my own beliefs onto it! It's really cool that it resonates with what you felt. Thanks again for sharing, it was helpful for me 💕💕
Your ankles are lovely. 
 Just my personal opinion, but I think the concept of a "higher self" that is somehow removed or above the self is a misunderstanding. I've been reading about the therapeutic MDMA trials, and one thing that seems to come out for everyone is a healing Self within, that is benevolent and somehow unaffected by the trauma of our lives. It knows who we are, and who we might be without the trauma weighing us down. I call it the Inner Self, or highest self, because to me, thinking of it as a separate entity leaves me feeling like I have to appeal to it or beckon it somehow. I think it's the same Self that creates the dreams which bring us clarity about our emotional lives. To be clear, I do believe we have angels, guides, whatever you want to call them! I just think the "Higher Self" is within, and not in any way better than us, because it *is* us. 

Anyway, thanks for sharing your session, it's a gift to be able to read others' experiences! 
Gosh this made me sad. It's late at night and I'm up holding my baby boy who is sick, and started thinking of him wanting to see me, not being able to talk to me... 😢Idk where I'm even going with this except to say I'm sorry, and I hope she gets out soon. 

::: Virtual mom hug::: 


Ps I believe you. 
Dreams like this usually happen to people who are thinking about/preparing to "give birth" to an idea, a new venture of some kind, etc. 
Isn't it amazing how much we can intuitively realize, seemingly out of nowhere? I'm starting to think there was a recent "Know Thyself" upgrade in this universe, ha! I keep bumping into people online and IRL who are also finding peace through sudden clarity into their psyche. 

And thank you! Same to you  💕😘💕
This is something I've been thinking about too! I've been reading [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Therapy-Step-Step-Cutting-Edge-Psychotherapy/dp/0984392777) about the "Internal Family Systems" method of therapy, and it's so encouraging. The idea is basically that our even our "bad" and "self destructive" parts are just pieces of self doing the best they can for us, because (however misguided their efforts may be) they are just trying to protect a wounded part of self.

I used to feel bad about how frustrated and panicked I'd get when my husband was telling me about something complex. I knew cognitively that he was just trying to share some interesting thing he learned, but I couldn't stop the amygdala reactions. Eventually I realized that I was reacting this way because of my experiences as an ADHD child and teen, not being able to pay attention and feeling the intense embarrassment of not "getting it" like the other kids. So my feelings of anger and fear about these conversations weren't bad, they were just screaming "Get out!" to try and protect me from feeling embarrassed again. Realizing that has helped me stop guilting myself for the feelings, and instead I think to myself "Thank you, frustration and anxiety, for trying to keep me from reliving embarrassing situations. But I'm okay! I'm safe, it only *feels* unsafe."

That's just one example of many I could share, as I am something of a walking ball of triggers lol. It's been hugely helpful for me in my healing 💕🤗

Edit: I've also realized that by soothing these "dark" reactions, I'm able to stay in the moment and let my wounded selves experience safety. Now when my husband wants to tell me something complex, I find that I can listen and learn just fine, which is healing in itself. 
I'm sorry you experienced that dream, it sounds pretty terrifying! I'm of the belief that dreams can come in many different forms: precognitive, intuitive, and metaphorical, to name a few, and sometimes (as appears to be the case here), they're a combination of metaphors based on past and future events. The kind I work with are the metaphorical, which can tell us about what's going on in your head that you may not be consciously processing. The most important thing to know is that these are *my* impressions of the dream, and since I don't have the brain that dreamt this, I can't tell you for sure what it means for you. The best way to receive a dream interpretation is to ponder it, disregard anything that didn't resonate, and think about how the imagery and emotions correlate to your real life. 

Missiles are a direct and targeted attack. You may want to consider if/how you might have been feeling attacked, or afraid of being attacked, at the time you had this dream. It could also be a dream about an attack from years ago, which your subconscious is still trying to make sense of. 

Our friends often show up in a dream as stand-ins for ourselves, specifically the part of oneself that is reflected in the personality of the friend. For example, my friend G often shows up in my dreams, and through context and introspection I realized that I dream of him as a stand-in for the part of myself that gets distant and aloof from insecurity, which is one of the traits I noticed early on in G. 

You have a few old friends with you, and it's quite possible that they all represent a part of yourself. It's also possible that your subconscious placed them there because the dream is reflecting an "attack" that occurred during the time of your life that was spent with these friends. It could be both! The one that dies, I suspect, is a part of yourself that you've lost as a result of some unexpected trauma or difficulty (i.e. Missile) in your life. 

Having to tell his family seems like a significant plot point, but it's hard to say what it means. A few possibilities: when some part of your persona "dies", friends and family are typically the first to notice that something is off. Maybe this part of the dream reflects having to interact with your family without this lost part of yourself. Another possibility: the family could be other parts of yourself that you have to interact with differently now. 

With regards to feeling stuck, my guess would be that you are ready to reintegrate this lost piece of self back into the whole, but there's still some inner work to be done. It could be as simple as identifying the part of yourself that's missing, and intending for it to redevelop! 

If any of that resonates, awesome, but if not, that's completely okay! Don't try to make it fit, dreams are individual creations and you are the best interpreter of your own ❤️☺️

Edit: Oops.. I left out an important possible explanation toconsider for the friend in your dream, which is that of course he may be playing the part of himself! It's especially likely if you went through hard times with this friend, or have lost contact with him. 

A good way to test this is to observe the very first thoughts and emotions you have when you think about this friend. If you feel something unpleasant such as guilt, sadness, etc, that's an emotional response that your subconscious would probably like to resolve, which it often does in the form of nightmares about how you ended up feeling this way about your friend. If you feel loving and neutral when you think about the friend, then he probably represents a part of yourself. 
If you have any recent dreams you don't mind sharing I'd be happy to let you know what I see.
I don't disagree with you on the deceptive intentions. But I still pay attention to the dates and claims because I have a hunch they are often used to distract from the real beauty of the day. Many people predicted Feb 20th as a possible date for the event, while others were predicting global chaos. I had quite a huge personal breakthrough in meditation on Feb 20th, and yesterday I had some smaller but powerful realizations. So I just think it's possible that these dates *are important* energetically, and the thing that's fake about them is what we're told will happen. I don't think they draw random dates out of a hat, I think they try to create fear on dates when we might otherwise be especially likely to raise our vibrations. 
I went from 5'3" to 5'5" by improving my posture, using a foam roller on my back and re-training my back muscles to strengthen and lengthen. I'm not sure if I manifested it, or if I just had two inches worth of height hiding under a slouch/weak middle back. Either way, it's pretty cool! 
😊 Sure they do! People all over the world have grueling schedules and need to play sometimes. No argument there! 

The question of *why those specific words* were displayed on their signs remains. 
Yeah! This isn't the exact article i read, but it's a bit better because it summarizes the results of many experiments such as the one I mentioned above. [Mediation and violent crime.](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-04/muom-cgm031316.php) 
I read an article recently about transcendental meditation. It said that when 1% of the town's population practiced meditation, the crime rate went down by 16% ... Pretty incredible! 
This is a good one! I'm super intrigued by the possible implications of quantum entanglement, and this could be a great example. The idea being that your initial interaction, and ongoing inside joke about them, kept you all "entangled" enough to subconsciously decide to return at the same time. 
Haha yep I had my first lucid dreaming experience recently, and it was in one of the many alternate universes I visit in my sleep. I was walking down the stairs in my old sorority house and noticed that the walls were painted beige. This struck me as odd, because I know they've been painted gray since I graduated. My next thought was "This must be a dream! I can fly!" 😆

I think there must be a *suspension of disbelief* switch that the subconscious can flip. Otherwise, it makes no sense whatsoever that of all the crazy things I've dreamt, some walls being painted beige instead of gray would be the thing that made me go "Waaaait just a minute now ... This can't be my day-to-day reality!" 
She looks like a kind and lovely woman. I'm so glad you found this photo. And though it's been a long time, I'd still like to say that I'm sorry for your loss. ❤️❤️❤️
He'll yeah. Your are really showing him whose boss.
Did you feel like you were gonna go crazy? I don't know what my mind would do with a week of isolation.
I relate to your post very much. My first awakening came with "the meaning of life is love" hitting me like a ton of bricks, and I've also gotten to experience the feeling of that ultimate love and acceptance surrounding me. It's hard to put into words what it feels like, but if it were a drug I'd be hooked! I think you're right about keeping an open mind. I feel a bit sad for people who don't want to ask questions and explore the possibilities. The universe is so mysterious and beautiful! 
Try keeping a dream journal. You can use your phone or an actual notebook by your bed. Just jot down the key points of whatever dreams you had as soon as you wake up. You might be surprised to see some patterns emerge, and it can even help you figure out things that are bothering you subconsciously. I've learned that keeping a dream journal can sort of prompt the subconscious mind to dream more effectively and helpfully, and it should help you distinguish between dreamland and real life, too.
I don't know that it provides proof of anything *new*, but it seems like pretty good evidence of the existence of a collective unconscious. 
Ha! My bad!-I got my fancy schools mixed up
I was feeling like today was special... Some kind of collaborative energy in the air. So I checked the GCP dot and it looks like the coherence of the number generators is off the charts. Very interesting and I was wondering if anyone has seen it like this before? 

For those who have no idea what I'm talking about lol.. Here's the [Stanford University webpage ](http://noosphere.princeton.edu) with information on how the data is collected.
It's so weird.. I can see your first response in my notifications, but I can't click on it or read the whole thing. Anyway yes, it is a wand! The lovely man I bought it from does the woodworking part, and his partner who chooses the crystals and stones was not in the store at the time. He thought it might be serpentine. It's pretty smooth, isn't cool to the touch.
Yours might be a true statement, though;) You can find out for yourself that /u/imreallyokay is sharing the truth. All you have to do is experiment. No purchase necessary!
Dude you aren't kidding! It's been mind-blowing to me. I'm getting chills just typing this lol. It's like the biggest obstacle is just realizing what the universe is really like. Once you accept that it's operating according to your expectations, you can change your life. 
I don't know what it is. I first started noticing how real these things are in early 2013, and it seems that a *lot* of people started noticing around the same time. Then there was another big influx of people having these experiences in December, and again in February of this year. Maybe there's periodic shifts in energies or frequencies or something that supercharges the effects of the thoughts we have. Whatever it, it seems to be getting stronger and more frequent.
[is this aventurine? ](https://imgur.com/gallery/Mtohx) thanks for sharing your gifts here!
"Coincidence" just means that two related events happened for no *apparent* reason. It doesn't mean that there is no reason! My theory is that the veil over reality started lifting a few years ago, and picked up the pace around December 2017. It seems like synchronicities, precognition, manifestations, and other thought-powered occurrences are off the charts these days. 

My advice is to stay in a loving and grateful mindset as much as possible. It supercharges these abilities (and we all have these abilities btw) to a degree that still surprises me, even after years of practice. 

> Maybe if I start thinking about money, it'll appear in my life.

It will! But the key is in *how* you think about money. If you're thinking "I don't have enough money." You'll manifest a continuous lack of money. Thinking "I have an abundance of money/I'm thankful for an abundance of money." has worked much better for me. 
I have experienced that with personal changes. My theory is that it's something to do with collapsing timelines. You can remember the "facts" of a collapsed timeline for a while, but it eventually fades away as you progress through the remaining timelines. 
Yes!! My skin feels tight and itchy, even on my back which was fully clothed all day. Other than that I feel great. I went to bed early, feeling out of sorts and irritable. Woke up at 3:33am feeling overcome with love for my husband and little ones, and the rest of the world, too! I've been awake ever since, feeling perfectly rested. ❤🤗
We already have the gifts, we've just collectively forgotten about them/no longer teach them. You are capable telepathy, remote viewing, lucid dreaming, and manifestation, with or without the "event" some are foreseeing ;) 
Sign me up, please! I would be happy to help moderate as well. 
I'm a Philip k Dick fan and find this interesting, as he had a friend named VALIS who assisted him in getting his life together. But his VALIS was a pink light and had a female voice. 
I think you'll find this interesting, then.. Friendly hallucinations are only rare in some places. From [this article:](https://news.stanford.edu/2014/07/16/voices-culture-luhrmann-071614/) 

Stanford anthropologist Tanya Luhrmann found that voice-hearing experiences of people with serious psychotic disorders are shaped by local culture – in the United States, the voices are harsh and threatening; in Africa and India, they are more benign and playful. This may have clinical implications for how to treat people with schizophrenia, she suggests.
I find that when people's negative energies, limiting beliefs, etc bring me down, it's because they're mirroring something within myself. Like if I'm not experiencing any anger, I can observe anger from within a bubble and just feel kind of amused, and eager to help. Sometimes it even seems to supercharge my positive state! But if I'm experiencing even mild pessimism, for example, the pessimism of others brings me wayyyyy down. 

Just my thoughts, friend to friend ❤
I had a nightmare of an attack on the country, maybe the world? It was coming from the sky via helicopters and such, and I was taking shelter with others. I haven't had a nightmare in ages, and war isn't something that typically worries me, so this seemed to come from nowhere:(
Aww. My daughter is three and doesn't understand that I actually order and pay for the groceries that get delivered. I haven't explained it to her because it's funny and cute seeing her flip out with gratitude over everything. She just goes to the door and immediately starts thanking the delivery person for random items. 
A few of my friends and family have had similar experiences, like watching a movie or craving a certain food and then learning they watched/ate the exact same thing on the same date a few years back. My theory is that the subconscious mind keeps track of a lot more than we can consciously remember. So basically you listened to the song and recalled that memory because you subconsciously remembered it was the anniversary of your friend's post. Again, just a theory but it makes sense to me:)
[This article ](http://humansarefree.com/2014/03/the-fascinating-story-of-man-who.html?m=0)  is pretty long so I've copied the relevant parts:

All of these were minor interventions compared to its apogee, the saving of Phil’s son’s life. Phil describes how one morning he was lying in a semi-sleep state when he heard the voice announce that his recently born son, Christopher, had a potentially fatal birth defect and that urgent medical attention was needed. Indeed the voice was quite precise when it stated:

“Your son has an undiagnosed right inguinal hernia. The hydrocele has burst, and it has descended into the scrotal sac. He requires immediate attention, or will soon die.” 

Tessa, acting on her husband’s frantic instructions, took Christopher to the family doctor and it was, indeed, confirmed that Christopher had exactly the problem the “voice” had described and surgery was needed.

This is cool:) Philip K Dick saw a pink light that he credited with saving his little boys' life.
Hey buddy thanks so much!
Woah! I love these beautiful "coincidences" of the universe! 
I've always found it really cool and interesting that Albert Einstein was born on Pi Day, and now it's the day Stephen Hawking died as well. It's also my birthday, but I have made no significant contributions to math and science:)
Hey neighbor, I believe in you.
❤️ I'm really sorry for your loss.
I haven't seen Game of Thrones OR Avatar, but the header image really gives me the creeps for some reason!
I think it's something to do with the frequency or energy of our thoughts, but I'm not sure. The exciting thing is that these phenomenon and things of a similar nature are being observed and studied in "mainstream" science now, whereas in the recent past it's been relegated to the mystical realm. I'm of the opinion that our brains are naturally wired to do all kinds of cool things we're (mostly) unaware of. 

I'm so sorry you've been going through some hard times. Please, don't hesitate to PM me anytime you want to talk. I know how sometimes it can be easier to open up to a random stranger than a loved one, and I'm here for ya anytime. And the same goes for anyone else who happens to read this! 
I relate to your post! I've had two life changing experiences: the first coming from a place of despair, crying out for a reason to live, and suddenly knowing that LOVE is the answer to life. The second was like yours, in that I saw the Source, it was pure love, and I recognized that I was a part of it, and so was everything else. 

So for me, these are the things I know. I'm open to a lot of ideas, and I enjoy the search for the truth, but I'm not in any hurry to *believe* much else.  I figure that if something is true, it will eventually hit me like a ton of bricks the way those other realizations did 😊
Another floor sleeper here! Hmm.. I wonder if this is a common tendency for people like us? 

My sleep last night was normal, but Saturday night was bananas. I went to bed like normal, but I seemed to linger in a meditative state for hours! I kept experiencing lucid moments of processing things I'd just been shown by my subconscious, I guess. Like I'd be semi-asleep, and fall into a negative thought pattern of thinking defensively. Then whatever was "talking" to me would draw my attention to the way it was pulling me into a lower vibe, and exactly where on my body it was creating tension. I realized that I fall into these defensive thinking patterns all the time, for no real reason! 

That's just a sample of the things I realized that night. It's never happened to me before, but it was very helpful, even if I was tired yesterday! Has anyone else experienced this?'
"Good to see you again". Yes, exactly! I had this experience on an airplane recently. I was walking down the aisle, holding my baby boy, and I locked eyes with a guy who I instantly recognized, though I'm sure I've never met him in this life. It was bizarre. We couldn't stop staring at each other! Then the man in front of him hit his head on the overhead compartment, I winced, my buddy laughed, and I walked on by to find my seat. 

I did a past life regression recently in which I saw myself as a little girl, running around and playing chase with my soulmate (who is my husband in this life), and then he was just gone. I guess he moved away, I don't know but I never saw him after we were about seven years old:( I went on to live a very sad life. I sought casual sex and trying to look like Jayne Mansfield to feel good about myself, and married an older man for financial security. I was miserable and never came close to any kind of spiritual awakening. 

Then I died, and I was a little ball of light hovering around my body for a time, until I finally realized I was free, and I took off zipping all over the world seeing sights like the Eiffel tower. Then I saw myself in front of the Source, and I was playing chase with another little ball of light that I knew was my husband in this life. We were SO happy to be reunited! 

It's sad that I was alone in that life, but I see how many lessons I learned that prepared me to meet him and be with him in this life. I was born with the innate sense that being able to marry my soulmate would bring me more happiness than I could ever have by living in a big house or having designer clothes, even though I wasn't exactly taught that. 

When I met my husband, I was drawn to him immediately. The first night we ever spent together was the night of Hurricane Katrina, and he had called to make sure I was okay. I was alone and worried about my family (who were right in the path of the storm), so he invited me over. We fell asleep on his living room floor, just staring into each other's eyes. I didn't believe in past lives at the time, but the feeling that we'd known each other for a long time was overpowering. 

I don't know why I felt compelled to write you all that, but there it is lol.
My grandparents had this exact one printed and framed in their house when I was a kid. Thanks for the warm fuzzy throwback feels! 
That was weird. I haven't checked the Schumann in several days, then suddenly felt the urge to check it a few minutes ago. I guess my subconscious recognizes the feeling now! 
Don't let your looks stop you if you feel it's something you'd like to do. Babies love being snuggled up in big arms!

Source: have had two babies. Both seem to prefer being held by our guy friends, and the bigger the better. 
Agreed, of course, but I think OP took a cab 😊 It would be interesting to know if it seemed like a normal trip to the driver. 
Try to be detailed as possible, and include any emotions you felt to get a good interpretation. The subconscious is strange in that it will put important parts of the dream in what seem like unimportant details.

If you want to go into detail about one of the ones that was really vivid and memorable let me know and I'm happy to help you figure it out 😊

Edit: btw I don't need to know private details like names or anything, just any other things you can remember.
Awesome! It's so very helpful for unlocking your emotional conflicts. The subconscious mind is  so interactive, it's incredible! Sometimes I'll help someone with their dream symbols, and the following night my dream will borrow a symbol from their dream to illustrate how I feel about something in my own life. And once you begin to consciously process your dreams, it's like the subconscious starts working overtime to help you grow. It's so creative, too. This morning I woke up with a little poem running through my mind on repeat. 

>"You shall know thyself, and thine inner self, this is my gift to you.

>You shall know thyself, and thine inner self, and then know others, too."
You got it! And for anyone else interested, PM me anytime, and rest assured that I don't judge! 
I enjoy helping people interpret their dreams, if you feel like sharing. 
Do you feel like you've been forced into something lately, or like someone is trying to make be you more like them? Rape dreams are often about feeling a loss of control. It may or may not be about your dad, but it's almost definitely not about sex. 

Sorry this happened to you! 
Obviously! Quick question though, why don't you just give them the message yourself? 
Where is this whole "forced reincarnation" belief coming from? I'm open to the idea of reincarnation, but this particular flavor just tastes really off to me. Like a disinformation campaign or something. Anyway, it goes against the entire nature of higher beings to force anyone to do anything. I have some experiences and have read the experiences of countless other people, and there's no reason to be afraid. "The Event" isn't postponed, its ongoing and has been for several years. It's the thinning of the veil that has kept us from being able to see the true and beautiful nature of our universe and ourselves, which is why so many people have been experiencing "glitches" and the overwhelming feeling like something bigger is going on. 

Again, there's no reason to be afraid. And "Discord Headquarters" should consider integrating meditation practice into their lives;) 
This is awesome!! You've brought up some things I've thought about, as well as some things I've never considered. I'm not a lucid dreamer, so what got me thinking about this possibility was when my dreams suddenly started to fall into two very distinct categories. The first is what I call metaphorical dreams, and they're not linear or anything close to real life. The settings and circumstances are wildly different every night, and they make no sense as a storyline. They're super useful though, because they help me unpack the emotional conflicts I have.

But the second category started happening just a few years ago, and they're *completely different.* I've only seen three "realities", but I have been to them countless times at this point, to where now I know what universe I'm in as soon as I arrive. I'm still married to my husband in all of them, but we have no children (IRL we have two). Which, I don't think we *would* want to have children in these realities, because they're dangerous and shitty places. It's like the same universe as this one, and our personalities are the same, but everything feels much more hopeless and frightening, almost post-apocalyptic. Like one time my husband was almost killed for his crappy bike, and it felt scary, but also like it happened all the time. 

That's just about the only significant event that's happened though, because most of the time we're just walking to the car, or sitting in the house, or talking to friends. It's like things are so bad that no one has jobs or anything to look forward to. And that's the other thing that makes it hard to believe these are just dreams. My metaphorical dreams are like Alice in Wonderland levels of nonsense, but these are just so... Real. I experience them in real time, and the way we/they feel is so vivid and raw and depressing that it's a huge relief to wake up back in this universe. 

I like where you're going with the idea of what our experience of being "overtaken" might feel like. I hadn't thought of that! I wonder if it might explain why we feel Deja vu as well? Like maybe we already experienced the moment vicariously in another reality, but it wasn't vivid enough to remember when we woke up. 

This theory might also explain Deja rêvé/precognitive dreams. Like maybe when a universe is very similar to ours, random events that happen ahead of time in one show up in the dreams of another. One thing that's often noted on /r/precognition is that there's usually a detail or two in the dream that's off. And if these are closely related alternate universes, it makes sense that some of the specifics would be different. When I was little I vividly dreamed that both my pet rabbits were attacked and killed by dogs, which had never even occurred to me as a possibility before. About a week later they *were* attacked by dogs, but only one of them died. It's one of my earliest memories of knowing the universe is more than it seems.

Thanks for the response, I love this stuff! Can't wait to hear more of your thoughts. 
I got chills reading your post! You really *get it*, and yes I think we share many overlaps in experience and tendencies. The way you describe the justification for our mental revenge is so apt, haha! It's an ongoing process for me. I've made it a long way, but I still search my heart sometimes and find various people who I haven't yet come to believe are worthy of full understanding forgiveness. In meditation a few weeks ago, I realized that there were 4 people I was still holding a bitter grudge against, because they hurt my older brother all the way back when I was in high school. I hadn't consciously thought of them often, but it was a feeling of newly deepened physical relaxation as I forgave them one by one. 

Which reminds me of the other thing that I wanted to ask you about! Have you looked into the physical side of trauma at all? I'm still learning, but it's fascinating how trauma is stored not just in memory, but in the nervous system and body as well. I thought of it because you mentioned trauma, of course, but also psychedelics. MDMA therapy is doing miracles for people with trauma of all kinds. Just something to consider! It's not going to be legally available until (hopefully) 2020, but some therapists will do it off the record, or you could even possibly be a part of the trials, or just [read the method](http://www.maps.org/research/mdma) and take a DIY approach. I'm just throwing out ideas:) I have also read of people physically releasing trauma through acupuncture, sensory derivation chambers, somatic therapy, and of course meditation. 

I'm so sorry it's been a really rough 1.5 years, and I hope you are at the precipice of a whole new world of beautiful experiences. I'm thankful for your kind words, and inspired by your spirit! 💕🤗💕💕💕
I hope I'm not out of line, but I was also born into privilege and I relate to much of what you've shared. About 5 years ago I rejected the life of pursuing wealth and image, and I gave away my belongings and moved to the desert. Everyone thought I'd lost my mind, and were checking in on me with great concern, but it's probably the most sane thing I've ever done! And I just wanted to tell you what I wish I'd done differently: 

I wish I'd known the power of forgiveness, love, and unconditional acceptance. I went through an awakening that led to this desert adventure, so cognitively i knew these things were of utmost importance, but I was still in a very bitter and judgmental mindset with regards to my parents, my upbringing, anyone who had a healthy savings account, and all the powerful people of the world who don't care about the powerless. In my mind, I was doing something very wise and awakened and they were all so very wrong and lost. 

It. Held. Me. Back. I was meditating and learning, but I was also stuck replaying the mental tapes from my childhood, pinpointing the endless ways that I was wronged, thinking of all the things that *other* people needed to understand, imagining myself telling them, and I never found the bottom of the barrel of reasons to rehash it all. It was a giant, toxic waste of time and energy. I thought I was figuring stuff out and understanding things that needed to be understood, but in hindsight, none of the revelations were even useful. What's been useful is realizing that people hurt others because they themselves are hurting. And that the trauma I received will not go away because of time spent dwelling on the past mistakes of others, but rather forgiving them and believing that I'm not better than them. It's counterintuitive, but believing that I'm no better than anyone else has been enormously beneficial in learning to love myself. 

I'm now a firm believer that everyone's path is different and perfect for them, so my evaluation of where another person "should" be in their own path is effectively meaningless. It's helped me stop looking at my parents (and everyone else!) and seeing people who don't get it, or people who fucked up, and instead simply see them as souls having an experience, just like me. And that's opened the door for a whole world of spiritual growth that I couldn't imagine before. I actually [wrote a post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/7kcsq5/i_feel_like_i_was_healed_of_some_inherited_trauma/?st=JE3LT930&sh=2b38b610)  about one of my meditation experiences that you may find resonates. 

I'm totally rambling, and none of the above may even be useful to you!! So more than anything just know that you're not alone, and I'm here for you anytime! ❤️💕❤️💕
This is called Deja vu! It's a very strange feeling. 
What made you remember it as "WW3", specifically? Like they were calling it that on the news as soon as it started? 
I have died in a dream before, too. There's all kinds of things people say supposedly "can't" happen in a dream, like die, read, use a computer, etc etc. I think it's a little silly, because anything can happen in dreamland! It's probably more accurate to say that certain things *rarely* happen in a dream. 

Anyway, I tend to look at dreams metaphorically, and imagine what real life experiences and emotions might be symbolized. In yours, I was thinking about your friend as a lost part of yourself. Maybe something you've suppressed as you try and play the "game" of life, social pressure, etc. The house that's out of place and didn't belong in the park made you want to run out of there. Maybe that's symbolic of the same idea, in that you "lost" part of yourself for fear of not fitting in? And dying.. That seems to me like you can't truly live without this part of yourself. I'm just telling you my impressions though. I think it's very, very important to take interpretations with a grain of salt, because you have the mind that dreamt it, so your own feelings about what it means are most important.

An interesting detail of your dream is that you fell to the west, looking north. The four directions carry an energy and meaning that, incredibly, is found in disparate cultures and beliefs all over the world, and across time. The West often symbolizes a journey to grow and fulfill a purpose. Think of the tribal cultures where a young man reaches a certain age, and is sent on a solo journey to "become a man". The West is kind of like that, symbolically speaking. It's not a journey for someone who knows nothing. It's a journey to grow and put to use all the things you have already learned. 

The north is often used to represent death, wisdom, old age, and completion. So it's very cool and interesting to me that in your dying moments of the dream, you were facing north. The beautiful thing about dying, symbolically speaking, is that you will be reborn into a better version of yourself. So to tie all this together, it would be a pretty exciting message about the next phase of life that your subconscious has planned for you. 

I'd love to read more of this series of dreams, and if you do feel like sharing, remember that sometimes the best and most potent messages from a dream are in the details that seem unimportant at the time. I'm also very open to the idea of dreams as portals, alternate dimensions, you name it! So do share your theory if and when you feel like it:) 
It seems like a dream about the competitive nature of our society. 
Check out the sub /r/precognition and you'll find you're not alone! It's called Deja rêvé.
Hey! I'm not the person you were asking but I can tell you my experience. It seems to me like synchronicities, especially when they have a "theme", are like little messages from the universe. There's something about Jesus or religion that you are supposed to do or understand, and it will help you. Once you get the message, your syncs will probably switch to a different theme. 

Edit: Just a thought... I don't want to influence your perception of the message, so this is just something that was true for me personally, but a huge part of my spiritual awakening came with the realization that Jesus' words "Love your neighbor as yourself " would completely change the world if everyone did it. I'm not a Christian or a follower of a particular religion, but that one night of realizing the profundity of that message opened my eyes to a whole world of spiritual growth. I just mention it as an example of the message being a doorway rather than the end of the messages:)
Water bottles and cats seem to be tied for the glitchiest things in the universe.
Had either of you seen or thought of something that was "Oh no" material? Sometimes my husband "hears" me calling for him when I haven't said anything, and it's usually when I was just thinking about asking him something. So I've wondered if the energy or intention or frequency of our thoughts sometimes manifest in a way that another person might perceive as audible. 
I can't advise you in terms of medication, but what you're describing is no way to live. Your greatest mission is to love and be loved, and whether it's "real" or not, anything infiltrating your thoughts and frightening this you this way does not have your best interests at heart.

Sorry. My 3 year old borrowed my phone and wanted to contribute to the discussion and I didn't have the heart to delete. Anyway I've been thinking about physics lately and how it might explain some things that we see on this sub. Like how when particles collide, they influence and affect each other for life, regardless of how far apart they end up. If this applies on a human being scale, it might explain things like friends and partners "reading each other's minds" or randomly messaging each other at the same time. Especially in the case of separated twins, since it doesn't get much more particle collision-y than sharing a womb.
Some men would, but not all of them. There are men who feel the same way due to personal or religious reasons. 
Deja vu is when you suddenly feel like what's happening in that moment has happened to you before, but sometimes the feeling occurs when you are doing something you've never done. It's hard to explain, but I think most people have experienced it at least once. I've never had Deja rêvé but I get Deja vu. 
That's awesome, you have a gift! Check out /r/luciddreaming they have all kinds of tips for taking control of your dreams 😊 💭
I'm very sorry that happened to you. Your theory is fascinating to me, as I've been studying the way trauma is stored in the nervous system and I've never seen this particular symptom suggested. In 2020 we may have MDMA therapeutically available, and I think it's going to be amazing how many "lifelong" conditions subside as people are able to process and release the awful things that have happened to them. I have a friend who did it and he's a palpably happier and healthier person now. Anyway thanks for sharing and I really wish you all the best ❤️
I don't think there's going to be a Big Event, I think it's more likely to be many, many events that unfold over time, and are already unfolding! And many of them may only be perceptible to some, so one person's great day may be another person's crappy day, and the next time they'll have the opposite experience. So while I'm not a believer in terms of "THE Event", I love reading the messages and feelings people are getting, because to me they hold weight even if the day comes and goes without any big headlines or energy shifts that effect me. 

I feel bad for you OP, because this is not exactly a win-win situation! But if I may be so bold as to make a suggestion, I'd say let the group think it over and see what we come up with, rather than declare a blanket ban. I greatly appreciate this sub, and your desire to keep it peaceful, and I think we can manage that without silencing the people who have a message to share. 

Lastly, thanks for all the work you do here! 💕🌈💕

Edit: One more thought that just came to me, perhaps a slight change in the expectations we have is a key here. When I think about it, headline news is almost always based in things that evoke fear, uncertainty, and other low-vibe feels. For all we know, yesterday there was a 5000% increase in the number of random good deeds done by strangers, the effects of which will positively impact us for generations! 

But if we keep getting our hopes up about some news-worthy event, we'll be perpetually disappointed in what otherwise might be some magical days. I guess my point is that the key might be not to silence the predictions, but to look at the projected dates as days where we might experience "newsworthy" spiritual upgrades. 

Yesterday I was * bursting* with energy, and because of the predictions for the "eye" passing through space and over our earth for the next few days, I decided it was a good day to go deeper than usual in my meditating. So I did a meditation track meant to help you meet your higher self, and mine looked like a fox! It helped me untangle an internal conflict about my heart's desires that has been heavy on my mind for nearly 5 years, which for me was a HUGE event! If it hadn't been for those predictions, I might have chalked up my energy boost to too much caffeine and not even tried to meditate. So I'm thankful, and they weren't wrong in my book 😊
It's called Deja rêvé and it's surprisingly common! Check out /r/precognition
