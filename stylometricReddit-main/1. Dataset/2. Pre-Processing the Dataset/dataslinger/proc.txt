yevgeny prigozhin aka putins soontobe successor

prigozhin pointed to the social disparity underlined by the war with the sons of the poor being sent back from the front in zinc coffins while the children of the elite shook their arses in the sun  
this divide can end as in 1917 with a revolution he said in an interview posted on his channel on the telegram messaging app first the soldiers will stand up and after that  their loved ones will rise up there are already tens of thousands of them  relatives of those killed and there will probably be hundreds of thousands  we cannot avoid that

ordinarily talk like that would get you killed in russia if hes talking like that hes going to be doing the killing

me wow hes really controllingah hes 37 and shes 24 she doesnt know any better yet than to tell him to go pound sand

the problem op is that your bf is a controlling asshole theres nothing wrong with your hair or the way you choose to wear it the problem is him hes trying to tell you what to do because the power dynamic in your relationship is tilted toward him more established in his career etc so he feels entitled to dictate your actions start dictating some of his actions and watch what happens hell be beyond affronted that you dare tell him how to conduct himself when that happens it would be fun to say something like so when one partner tries to dictate terms to the other this is the appropriate response right
nta uninvite them youre trying to do a super nice thing for them and theyre giving you pushback in the nicest way possible they dont seem very on top of things anyway so stop asking about it and just let it fall off their radar if they ever bring it up again just say something like

clinton got reelected after the 1995 standoff gingrich was forced to resign in 1998 from newts wikipedia page

the electoral expectation was

the party winning a net total of six to thirty seats in the house of representatives

x200b

but instead of gaining seats republicans lost five the worst midterm performance in 64 years by a party not holding the presidency
im referring to the 1995 standoff between gingrich and clinton details here the important bits

there were unique aspects to this standoff dole was not interested in continuing the negotiation as he was running for president gingrich made comments about being snubbed by the president while traveling with him on air force one and the press had a field day with those comments linking the shutdown to the snub polling increasingly showed that the republicans were getting blamed for the shutdown  a 1995 abc poll indicated 46 blamed the republicans and only 27 blamed the democrats

then in 2013 with obama in office this happened

at the same time republicans who controlled the house had demanded budget cuts as well as policy changes they wanted obama to eliminate the funding for his affordable care act which was considered his major legislative achievement  
the government was shut down once more for 16 days again public support for the republican approach began to erode that led the gop to capitulate and adopt a budget that did not include significant cuts and raised the debt ceiling all in a vote the day before the government was slated to run out of money

not sure if this will lead anywhere but commercial property landlords are under pressure right now due to low occupancywfh might be a thought to talk with some commercial landlord groups to see if you guys can help each other out you need a space with a sweetheart deal they need  or soon will need  tenants you might also be able to assume a lease for a bankrupt tenant etc maybe start by looking around for suitable spaces where the occupant recently vacatedwent out of business this is kind of a unique moment in the world of commercial property see if you can find an advantage for yourself in these circumstances just by starting to talk to these folks you might network into an unusual situation that could work for you

this doesnt get you capital but it might make it so you need less of it to get started

the next morning she texts me saying i need to tell you something oh god

she didnt want to become official until she had given you full disclosure another sign of a decent person

i think we agree the only point i was trying to make is that i inferred from ops question that they were merely asking if it should legal or not and that my comment was there were many legal ramifications other than thumbs up or thumbs down that would need to be considered family law in general would have to be reviewed and modified in multiple areas because of its inherent assumptions
thats kind of my point though in a polycule would there need to be a change in law to allow for more than two of the partners to be legal parents

my point was that laws around marriage take as their starting point that its a two party arrangement making polyamory legal as op said would likely require a prenupmedical powerofattorney for all participants so that it would be clear how things would shake out when disagreements arise on parenting medical care inheritance issues child custody how liabilities are handled

in traditional marriage one spouse is incapacitated other spouse is not so who gets to decide medically is pretty clear in a poly situation who gets to to decide absent any legal directives isnt clear at all
there are many ramifications to the term legal

for example if one spouse is in a hospital incapacitated the other spouse can make the call on extraordinary medical measures if someone has multiple spouses and they disagree on what should be done how would that work

if there are children in the relationship and the adults disagree on vaccination for example how does that work

if there are children and one party wants to leave how does physical custody legal custody child support work

youre just talking about the relationship between the adults but what about other family members what if one person receives an inheritance becomes financially liable in lawsuit or accidentally kills someone in a crash how would relationship assets work in the event of liabilities

maybe old friend had an interest in you and sister wasnt sure about your relationship and said she should try and get in touch to see whats up that question is an indirect way of asking if youre in a relationship

talk to sister first and figure out which way the wind is blowing if friend is interested in seeing you go from there

if sister was trying to pass the buck to you you can say the wedding is a year away you imagine youll take whoever your so is at that time to the wedding
okay semantically and technically i agree with you mining itself is inflationary slowly at this point but other factors are counterbalancing that with the aggregate effect being that the circulating supply has leveled off in recent years

i guess given the sub were in the real question should be is bitcoin a good investment i dont think so but what ops assertion is is that its fake money

i think op was trying to make the point that bitcoin is fake money and since it is fake money its therefore a bad investment i agree with the conclusion but not the rest of it it has features that make it a useful medium of exchange

privacy is not one of them btw something like monero would be better for that dollar transactions have no privacy at all unless youre transacting with cash in person which elevates risk
your example with bitcoin being immediately exchanged for other currencies shows precisely that it is useless

just because its not fiat doesnt mean that its useless its a feature not a bug as the saying goes its lack of centralized authority means that it cant be taken from you by another entity unlike with the us seizing russias foreign reserves cutting them off from swift etc fiat currencies move within the worlds banking systems which are subject to the control of the worlds financial powers and so can be taken from you for any reason

if you want to conveniently send dollarseurosetc to a counterparty elsewhere in the world you have no choice but to involve a financial institution if you are one of the millions of unbanked who pay steep prices to use the likes of western union to do remittances bitcoin and the lighting network are a way better and frankly less predatory option to move money around the world

i dont know what your definition is but to me thats not useless

circling back to your first statement  im not arguing that bitcoin should be treated as an investment or a store of value people saw the rapid price appreciation some years back wanted in on that and the speculators piled in totally a speculative frenzy you and i are in agreement on that

but just like tulip bulbs had utility in that they could also grow flowers bitcoinlightning has genuine utility beyond being a target of speculators that utility is often missed by people who only see bitcoin as a shit investment
its true that more will be minted into the next century but the velocity is slowing way down more than 19 million of the total 21 million have already been mined so while the remaining time to mine makes dilution seem like a problem were only talking about 10 of the total so not much dilution and it will be very slow dilution this will also be counterbalanced by circulating supply loss there are many stories of people who junked their computers and lost their wallets or lost custody by some other means  sent a transaction into the void  with the result being that a substantial amount of bitcoin is out of circulation either permanently or for a very long time i dont think dilution is a significant consideration
eh im not following your reasoning there are plenty of currencies out there that have volatility yet are still convertible to other currencies while bitcoin is being invested in by speculators seeing it as a store value it is intended to be a medium of exchange it does that its somewhat volatile but it does that people buy things with it if you quickly move from your currency into bitcoin pay for something with it then the recipient converts it into their currency the speed of those conversions should protect you from volatility risk

you seem to be arguing that its a poor store of value and im with you there but youre also arguing that its fake money while it is literally being used as money right now your ponzi scheme argument doesnt hold up how is a public blockchain ledger that everyone can see hiding a ponzi scheme the total number of bitcoins is finite so theres no dilution or money printing unlike with say the us dollar or other crypto

this is actually a great one security issues come out like rain these days bookmark the cve web site when boss asks pull up the site and say this new cve just popped up and im looking into our potential exposure

boss whats a cve

you starts to explain

boss glazing over itching to exit the conversation i have to run to a meeting but keep me posted
my experience is that the tone is set at the top and they tend to hire for and allow behavior that matches theirs thats true in companies of all sizes not just small ones
op do you really want whoever committed crimes with it getting out of prison and looking you up because you got their car and its contents the smart play is to let the cops sell it who knows what might be hidden in it
if all else fails have the face to face then send a confirming email afterwards just confirming the details of our meeting today where you said x y z let me know if i misunderstood anything

if they dont respond thats a tacit admission that you understood correctly
great design simple yet evocative
would love for someone gifted at osint to tell him where he banks at who his accountant is where his kids go to school his home address the car he drives his license plate number court cases hes been involved in  etc
op it would be a good experiment to try w bf to track how often she calls him when hes available versus how often she calls him when hes with you having proof that shes actively trying to pull him away from you could lead to a step in right direction or not something to try if youre reluctant to give up the relationship just yet

and there is no ring so have your dad put the condo in your name only

thats not pressuring your bf only reflecting the current circumstances these events need not be linked your bf is where he is your dads terms are what they are let the events play out

butdont be surprised if the condo going under your name only upsets your bf or dont be surprised if he suddenly wants to propose when that happens and if thats the case your bf is in this transactionally and not for you do with that information what you will
as others have said boss has already figured it out but assuming you signed the 2 year contract the terms would likely be that if you left youd have to reimburse boss for the cost of the course that he paid for

so assuming there are no other restrictions like a noncompete just sign the contract boss pays for the course you leave as planned next year pay boss back for the course and off you go
plus changing the name would be discarding the goodwill that the current company name has bonehead move from a branding standpoint assuming the current reputation is good
what he stole was the companys goodwill which has value

i was always second to her in lots of things especially when it came to boys but none the less here i was engaged to the love of my life and so happy

shes not just jealous shes angry that op isnt sticking to her designated role as second best to her

sorry op this likely was never much of a friendship if the ground rules were that you had to be the designated second place in order to make her look good she always wanted the spotlight she announced her pregnancy at your event her nonefforts throughout the wedding planning were acts of slowmotion sabotage and causing stress for you

you are well rid of her put your energy into relationships with people who want to lift you up not hold you back

if they make a bad offer you can talk about offering it to other developers or even the general public and see what they might pay for it maybe the developers in your area are friendly with each other or maybe another developer would love an opportunity to be a bump in the road for this one
so assuming op is being honest that hes done nothing to warrant this and assuming that its highly unlikely that the gf would accept disparaging testimony from a rando the only conclusion is that leah and david backstabbed him for some reason they are not your friends op who else knew what was about to go down and could tell the gf something that she would accept without question its the only explanation

first get the story out of someone gfs parents sound promising as sources

you have been slandered you have suffered harm do you want your gf back after this if so time to go on the offensive

get a lawyer involved let leah and david know that ruining someones life has consequences
then leave the kids with me for a few weeks once everyone was settled in

this is insane theyve never even met you  i agree with admirabletrees theory that shes scrounging for free child care for some reason guessing the reason for dumping her kids is not compelling or she would have mentioned it

i have brain cancer and will be down for 3 weeks can you help out

vs

i want to go on a cruise and dont want to bring the kids step up for your estranged sister
if your wife cares for these kids she will make your home a safe place for them instead of an interrogation room

should the deceased have minded his own buisness of should the killer be charged with second degree murder

sort of the person who potentially might have minded his own business was the killer not the killed

its not a strong question much more pertinent is what the altercation was about were they arguing about baseball teams or was one of them trying to prevent the other from beating a child to death context matters certainly when youre talking about whether a murder charge is justified or not you seem to think that race is the only context that matters but youre mistaken

others here are saying narcissism but let me offer a possible alternative i once worked with a guy who was married to a woman who really struggled with apologies she was raised in a toxic household with several competitive siblings and apologies were weakness  it meant you had caved or lost

she was otherwise a great person and her husband just dealt with it knowing her past and the baggage she carried

op you would likely know if she had an upbringing similar to this otherwise probably a narcissist
1 there is a certain zen to repetitive tasks that can make them quite enjoyable when youre in the groove you can think about other things or just bliss out when youre hiking youre essentially doing the same thing for long stretches are you bored
2 different people appreciate different aspects of work some people dont want a lot of talkinginteraction and for those in factories there are often teams that engender esprit de corps and take pride in their groups output some people like to work with their hands some people really appreciate the immediate gratification of doing a task and that task is done in mental tasks like engineering sometimes you go down a road only to discover your approach wont work and you have redo or reconsider the task people who like closure would hate that

before looking down on other jobs consider that there are people out there who wouldnt want yours dont pity the content individual it is wiser to try and emulate their contentment enough is better than more

first press charges for assault
oh yeah id forgotten about that ostensible claim by anonymous that they were onto roves electioncooking schemes and had thwarted them hard to find articles on that theres this one about the configuration heres one about the story

for those not familiar with the story heres the gist

for example consider clevelands fourth ward in 2000 al gore won 95 of that wards vote but in 2004 the county reported its results after the 1114 pm crash and it showed that kerry had only won 59 of the vote  a 35 drop without any explanation there were several other abnormalities across ohios postserver crash that delivered the state to bush

an election server crashed before the server crash things were worse for bush than after the crash when votes seemed to have skewed in his favor the story goes that anonymous looked into this compromised the vote stealing system ahead of time so rove couldnt steal another election and in 2008 when the server crashed and came back up votes werent flipped so obama won

so just to be clear you owe 80k on the car 14k in other loans and 4k in cc debt

youre upside down on the truck and cant sell it or at least cant sell it without getting yet another loan to pay off the truck loan to clear the lien before selling

so youre more or less 100k in the hole not 14k from the sound of it

but if you could get a loan pay off the truck sell the truck get something much cheaper that would enable you to put probably at least 10k towards your debts that would be a better situation than you have now

yta your son is just starting to participate in the workforce earn his own money learning how to be an adult he wanted to deal with his own affairs you completely took away his agency and trashed his professional situation yes it was just a lifeguarding job but the issue isnt him prioritizing work over family its you yanking him from his first foray into adulthood and making it perfectly clear that to you hes just a kid and what he wants doesnt matter to you

you have seriously damaged your relationship with your son and you should apologize for your narrow take on the situation in two years hes going to be 18 and not inclined to put up with your heavyhanded interference in his life if you want to alienate your son keep doing what youre doing you may find that once hes 18 or 19 he no longer comes on family trips at all and why would he hes not respected as an autonomous person with his own goals
dont drive angry
he said i could still see her but not the kids because they are too young

holy shit he felt entitled to give you permission did you have any idea that he was under the impression that he could dictate your life choices and actions

you and your husband have two different ideas of what your relationship is might be time to take a pause take stock do some couples counseling and figure out what there is to salvage

and you were absolutely right to yell at him

yikes
ruining a chance for her son to bond with his child

bond how by looking the the window of the icu arguably due to his actions mil needs to sit down and be quiet this was unforgivable on the part of both her sons if she always lets shit behavior form them slide then shes part of the problem

nta op am very glad things werent worse for you they easily could have been
i feel like an asshole for considering leaving my current job as i know several people had to go to bat for me to get such a large raise

they went to bat for you and the company still didnt pay you what youre worth you can make it clear to the people who went to bat for you that you appreciate their efforts but the fact that despite those efforts the company still wont pay you what youre worth and another company will means that its time to move on no hard feelings

motives are clear as day to me when the labor force was tight employees were hard to hire and wages went up they want to flood the labor market with extra workers kids so they can keep wages down its always about money

op i would sit tight on engaging a lawyer just yet given the amounts involved and the expense of a lawyer it sounds like shes more likely to go the small claims route without a lawyer

in your shoes i would keep on doing what youre doing  saving evidence  and be ready to respond to service if you get served usual is 30 days notice or more before an appearance is required if its small claims you can probably represent yourself and she would most likely do the same

not a bad idea to line up a potential lawyer just in case she makes a big claim to justify a lawyer

we would both approach our boss together and say that while we were happy with our work to date we were both looking for new challenges and perhaps new team members that meeting is planned for tomorrow and i believe the boss who is a very smart woman will get the message and reassign us both without prejudice

not so sure of the wisdom of this the very smart woman may conclude that you had been hitting on your attractive coworker and may either be subjecting you to extra scrutiny or forming a negative opinion about you which will do you no favors in the long run wouldnt be at all surprised if she calls the coworker in privately and asks if you have problematic behavior that needs to be escalated to hr if it comes down to coworker either looking bad or throwing you under the bus which do you think coworker might do to save her professional skin

good luck op dont be surprised if your very smart boss starts to evaluate you negatively come review time

i try not to be overly bound by rules i read the golden dawn by israel regardie and was struck by how much they make their own implements imbuing them with their own intent

the bottom line is that you are the reader various spreads are a framework but the magic comes from you whatever works and gives you good results is what you should use you can invent your own spreads and if your intentions are clear about what the positions represent you should get good results

all that to say if this technique came to you in a dream i would give it a try and see how well it works if it works well keep it if it doesnt try something else sounds like a great message and a clue to how you might naturally operate though and i would give it credence

brace was diagnosed with adhd and narcolepsy forcing him to take medications that require proper hydration especially during exercise  
despite his medical needs the lawsuit said that two coaches would mock him when he asked for a water break saying do you think you are special and are allowed more water  
on the day of his death brace completed numerous sprints and then sat down out of exhaustion the lawsuit said  
after being told that he would be kicked off the team he is said to have performed an additional run to the top of the hill before stopping and saying im done i cant do this anymore  
suffering from heat stroke grant begged i need water somebody help me the lawsuit said adding that he told people that he felt like he was dying and was speaking in gibberish phrases  
coaches screamed at him after the team returned indoors and he fled the wrestling room the lawsuit said he searched for a working water fountain but collapsed and died before he could find one

they new the kid had medical needs didnt care and killed a kid and the university is still chest beating about how they could have won the suit but are settling out of teh kindness of their hearts

a university spokesperson said the university believed that it could have defeated the lawsuit but the legal process would have been long difficult and costly ending years from now in a trial with an uncertain outcome  
the university made the decision to settle the case now in a manner it hopes will respect the brace familys tremendous loss

they cant even settle without being pricks and thats bullshit they just didnt want the ongoing pr nightmare hurting their reputation

from their mission statement

the institution is grounded in christian principles and leadership through service 

why is it that all these christian organizations are the most oppressive

two coaches named in the suit allegedly created an atmosphere of fear of intimidation on the team

kkk in the 1920s they declined during the depression from the bill of rights institute

some said klan membership reached 8 million by the mid1920s but the actual number was somewhere between 25 and 4 million still that was enough to make the klan an organization to be feared not only when it physically threatened blacks catholics jews bootleggers or local adulterers but also when it burned fiery crosses on deserted hillsides or on the front lawns of its opponents including future radio demagogue father charles a coughlin during the decade it even exercised great power at the ballot box helping to elect governors in alabama california oregon and indiana an estimated 75 house members took their seats with kkk assistance in the 1920s they included earl mayfield as us senator from texas in 1922 and future us supreme court justice hugo black from alabama in 1926

the total white population  men women and children  was 94 million in 1920 assuming half were male 47 million and somewhere between 2025 of those were children that would leave 3537 million white male adults that would put klan membership in the low teens nationwide

however klan membership was very high in certain states so its possible the 13 proportion was true in those areas of high concentration

in 1924 more than 40 percent of all klan membership could be found in just three states ohio indiana and illinois but the klan also secured significant support in maine colorado and oregon where it helped ban catholic schools it enjoyed a smalltown base but also appealed to bigcity protestants with large chapters in such cities as chicago detroit pittsburgh dallas and indianapolis

many years ago i was speaking to a friend of mine about how certain branches of freemasonry allowed women annie besant being one such masonic example

he was very steadfast in his position that it was very important for there to be menonly spaces and that certain kinds of conversations would only happen in the company of men he wasnt specific but he had been in war zones and at the time it was unheard of to have women in combat zones i hadnt considered that male veterans commiserating with other male veterans might go through some raw emotions that they wouldnt be comfortable displaying with women around

likewise there are certainly conversations among women that they probably wouldnt be comfortable having in front of men i think what used to be genderspecific discourse is more widely discussed between the genders now  and even between generations  than was done in the past

still i think theres still some merit to having single gender spaces in order to have certain kinds of discussions just as its a good thing to have things like support group spaces for example to discuss things such as struggles with substance abuse

the actual final duel yes it was talky and not very cinematic but the movie version is ridiculous it happening in front of the crowd  a witnessed downfall resulting in an ordinary corpse instead of a shower of dust  those were such important elements and there was also the explanation about the messianic bit that harry had tried to sacrifice himself to save all of the others and that was why voldemort had blunted effectiveness was also a key point

again overly talky not cinematic but it could have been done well and instead we got that lazy spectacle

circular firing squad
i wasnt the pool operator nor one of the workers making up the batch of chlorine just a lifeguard on duty who got to deal with the event and the aftermath
so given that lithium hypochlorite is more expensive than sodium hypochlorite and calcium hypochlorite im guessing the combination was sodium hypochlorite and calcium hypochlorite

i was a lifeguard at the time but i had to write a report about the incident the workers who had been mixing the batch werent positive about what they had used so i did a small test after hours with what they thought they might have used i put about a 14 cup of each in a plastic bucket and poured a tall cup of water over it and moved away nothing happened i moved to a point where i could see the mixture and it was just kind of gently fizzing like baking soda it continued to do that for some time  a minute or three  and i assumed they didnt correctly remember the chemicals used then it exploded really loudly think m80 for those of you familiar with fireworks blowing a grapefruit sized hole in the side of the bucket

old houses with plaster walls used to use a 34 round decorative wood trim cant recall its exact name but imagine a dowel with 14 of it removed then affixed to the corner it had nice finials on either end and was usually positioned around the height where it might take contact especially on a stairway going around a corner the ones ive seen were around 34 feet long and did not extend to the floor or ceiling

anyway a dowel maybe 1 or 114 in diameter with a nicely turned end about 45 tall and sitting on the lower floor could look nice here and youd router your board ends to meet the rounded surface

look would be similar to this or you could just do that and make it square and not round

funny how having your best receiver taken out of the game due to concussion protocol results in letting up off the gas
none of us looking at this will ever create anything that will still be in existence in 3000 years humbling beautiful craftsmanship
eh as soon as harrison jr got taken out for concussion protocol offensive options got a lot more limited that play was the beginning of the end right there stroud did his best with what he had left to work with but he couldnt do it all
dont think he choked watch the replay and watch his interaction with the holder after the kick i think the holder botched it because ruggles was clearly trying to console him afterwards ruggles is going to take the blame though
dont think it would have ended up that way without harrison jr getting taken out due to concussion protocol
dont think that was on ruggles setter looked horrified and ruggles pulled him up guessing he didnt set the ball correctly for ruggles
did you see the kicker pull up the setter i think the setter botched the set and that why the kick was so off setter looked devastated at the end

heres my thought process

if you have the cups upright any dust cooking spatter etc thats floating in the air can land on them if you dont have them in closed cupboards if you fry a lot youre going to put stuff into the air

if you put them upsidedown any airborne stuff will land on the outside which is fine but if you put them away and theyre not completely dry you can get a water seal possibly mold and make rings on you cabinet i put down plastic shelf liner with raised ribs so that if they are wet the waterproof plastic protects the cabinet and the raised ribs let air in and out so even wet theyll dry out if upsidedown

once i had 3 cats with two of them strongly pairbonded the third cat came along later and while there were no disagreements among them he generally didnt hang with the other two

he was the first one to pass on and for a month or two after he was gone one of the other cats would frequently stand at the bottom of the stairs and stare up the steps towards the departed cats usual spot on the top step he didnt act like he missed him really just like he could tell something was there

perhaps your cat is hanging out for a bit

great image but it occurs to me that its super dangerous for the observers think if youre standing behind harry and he ducks a killing curse or if youre on either side of voldemort and he deflects harrys curse definitely wands up time

yta obvious who the golden child is
but she had been caving into the fiancs demands too sounds like it wasnt a healthy mutually respectful relationship and splitting from him was probably a blessing in disguise it was really painful but it also sounds like oop is on a much better trajectory now she said she hadnt wanted to get married so soon so she kind of got her wish

the article was a bit unclear but this quote

this malformed command likely crashed all the botnet code that was running on infected machines and talking to the c2  essentially killing the botnet cashdollar added

makes it sound like they sent a malformed command to the c2 server and crashed the c2 server not super clear on that point though

agree with others here but just saying that family travel from the north to the south in winter is an obvious market to serve and to capture more of it amtrak should consider
1 having family friendly departure and arrival times
2 make it economical for family groups  cheaper than air travel
3 have some form of kid entertainment on board so kids arent whining along they way and are actually enjoying the diversions
4 higher speeds so the trip doesnt take as long and they get to their destination faster
it was a photo shoot jkr needed to introduce rita needed this event and so this is what she made of it
this without this scene how does rita skeeter get access to harry
agree about the times for example if you wanted to take the train from cleveland oh to orlando that train leaves in the middle of the night not enticing for families who want to escape the winter to go to disney world

the kids discount is a start but could be more enticing for family groups also a family who wants to escape the winter and spend time in florida doesnt want to spend so much time traveling air travel buys them more time at the destination higher speeds would help in this regard

ontrain entertainment would also help make the time pass international flights breeze by these days when you can watch movies and tv shows inflight also an advertising opportunity having a similar option would be good for train travel kids especially are only going to want to watch scenery for so long

of course no one has any questions or even interest totally bewildering
i remember reading an article about how it came to be there years ago in a nutshell during the war they needed to move nuclear operations from university of chicago they were given the use of this land but ownership was not conveyed after the war they had nuclear waste that they needed to dispose of so they buried it on site they wanted to make it a restricted access facility but the county or municipality said no way thats our land we just loaned it to you the feds said but theres nuclear waste buried here the city county said tough shit its our land and were taking it back and thats how nuclear waste came to be buried on public land

these days my biggest fear would be ransomware ransomware agents communicate with a c2 server so you should make sure outbound communications are whitelisted to only known legitimate addresses

as uinevitablefault452 mentioned you should also be watching resource utilization and disk space as spikes in those could indicate encryption taking place

speaking ofwhen was the last time you tested your disaster recovery plan if the server was bricked today how confident are you that you could access cloud backups restore lost transactions since the backup and get a replacement likely cloud server up and running so your usersconsumer processes could continue to function how would you go about repointing those usersprocesses to the replacement server
