Haha! your brother and his wife  aren’t very self aware are they? 

I hope you let him know all the years he and his wife tormented you about your weight is the absolute reason you can be rude to her. 

Good for you!  

To all saying E S H-
She was a teenager being made fun of by grown adults. That in itself warrants her clapping back. 
Gross.
Does she know this? 
Time for an honest convo about where you two are. 

She may think you are going to be a cute little family and you’re over here thinking you’ll take care of the baby, because you’re going to do that right? , but this is not going to turn into a living together and being a couple. 

It’s not unheard of that a hookup gets pregnant, and you both comparent, but not have a relationship.
I’d have to ask him about it. 

If he was that drunk, it’s possible he doesn’t even remember it and continues  to hang out with these people- who are clearly not his friends. 

You’ve known him for 4 years, does he look 20 or 16?  Do you recognize his clothes as what he wears now or in the past. Look for little clues as to a timeline. 

Or he knows it happened, and it was a one off that his friends were just screwing with him because he got so drunk. Way way too far but idk these ppl. 

Either way it warrants a conversation. 

He may be embarrassed, but if he can’t discuss it with you, after 4 years together, I won’t say it’s a problem per say, but you two should be able to talk about pretty much most things by now.
Right now I’m kinda obsessed with married at first sight. 

It’s a train wreck but I can’t help myself.
Does it not seem odd to anyone that -

you live outside of the country, your godfather gets diagnosed, decides to rewrite his will and —-

The only person GF told he gave you your inheritance already was your brother—-

The one who got everything! 

I’m calling shenanigans on your brother. He’s gross. Taking advantage of a sick old man.
You’re broken up.  Stop obsessing over did she or didn’t she cheat. 

What diff would it make to know at this point anyway? 
Will you be more angry? And what purpose will that serve? 

Being angry at your ex will do nothing for you except hinder your moving forward. 
Do you want to be an angry ex to any other girls you might meet? Cause that’s a sure fire way to stay single. Nobody wants a bf who is stuck in the past. 

Block her and her friend. Move on.
But they’re not that young if he gave them cars and expensive trips. 
And they all still have their college fund. They lose nothing while he’s still alive. 

He didn’t say how many nieces and nephews he has, but his wealth seems to be enough that even if they don’t get the whole thing, they will all still be getting a nice chunk of change.  It’s his million dollar insurance, investments and his home and a summer home!  

It’s sad really that these young adults are so selfish to think he shouldn’t leave his daughter the bulk of his estate. 

I wonder if anyone from his family has ever expressed any happiness that this man is becoming a father. They all know how they felt when they had their kids.
This is your first relationship and it has moved way way way too fast. 

The find my iPhone thing would have been an instant break up. 

If you break up, her mental state is not your concern. What did she do before you were around? 

Anyway, what you need is some time to yourself. 

Stop picking her up every single day. 
Go back to your 3 dates a week. 

You will have time for yourselves, and will also have things to talk about when you get together. 
Maybe you should join a club or activity so you meet some people, you need other things in your life besides her. 

And tell her that you will not - note: will not - entertain her ridiculous amount of texts throughout the day. She can either stop sending them, or be prepared for them to be ignored. 
You are an adult, you have a job. You can’t be watching tik toks all damn day. 

You have to make your boundaries very clear to her or she will run over every one of them.
You need to have a talk with his mother. Is she as worried about him as you or is she ok with what he’s doing? If she is worried then you two need to decide what to do next. 

If he has a therapist, maybe it would be worthwhile to make sure they know what he’s been saying. 

Maybe he needs in house mental health care. 

I’m sorry you’re going thru this. It’s painful when your kids are struggling.
You are the teacher all teachers should aspire to be. 

Good job school dad. 🏅
If he had a draw I’d just throw them in, but it feels… odd? to just throw them  on a shelf all willy nilly. Idk. 
Now I feel like a weirdo!
I’m a woman and I do like your gf, and it goes in a draw. 

But I do the laundry and I fold my husbands underwear. Boxer briefs are bigger than my bikinis and have more structure to them. 

His dresser is a tall one so he has shelves on the top, where his underwear and socks go on the top shelf, behind doors and deep drawers on the bottom. 
So he stacks his undies, so in  order to stack they need to be folded. 

Makes perfect sense to me.
I agree. 

The idea that she’s more worried about talking to him is a problem. 

She might find that after spending however long/24 hrs with hubby she might actually enjoy alone time. 

And she gets to hang with her gf’s for her bday and talk about the wedding and honeymoon. 

I realize tho that some people feel a certain way about their bday, maybe she’s one of them. 
Me, I’ll celebrate whenever. Just wish me HB  on the day and were good. I don’t even want a gift, just take me to dinner.
I tripped coming down stairs and broke my tibia. 
I sprain my ankles pretty easily so I 
thought it was just that. 

Hobbled on it the rest of the evening and until midday the next day. 
I was on vacation at the time. 

Had a cast up to my knee and was told no weight on it at all. 

Got home a week later, went to ortho and the break was stable so I got a walking boot and had to go for physical therapy. 

It’s been a little more than 4 months and the swelling is gone but I still feel little twinges in the ankle or leg at times.
Age doesn’t really have anything to do with it. 

I started with just store bought readers, probably around 40?

When they stopped working, I needed rx glasses. But at that time my doc did say that I probably would need distance glasses as I got “ not so young”- (he never said the word old)

Now I wear progressive lenses all the time cause I can’t see near or far.

I’ll admit, I still hate wearing glasses. I never feel like they look good on my face. I’ve also never wore sunglasses for the same reason. 

I asked about contacts, but that was a no go too.
It’s been a month. If she can’t compromise so you both can schedule your daily call earlier at this point, she never will. 

Schedule a 15 min call at 8 pm. Then she can both go do whatever. And you can go to sleep when you need to. 

Also, texting is ok too. You don’t have to have marathon calls every night.
Of course they did. 

Have to keep it till the 11th our so both sides can tout their “compromises”. And their “thats what we were proposing all along’s”

This whole routine is getting old.
I think it doesn’t matter that it’s  a “you feel” as opposed to her feeling that way. 

She’s not going to admit she’s just with you for the lifestyle you can afford her, so it doesn’t  even make sense to ask. Add in that it’s difficult to talk to her about money? Why is that? 

You think this relationship isn’t an equal financial partnership, in addition to not feeling this is a romantic pairing anymore. 

She’s a gf, not a wife. There is no reason you have to stay with her if you want to move and go back to school. She supported her D before you came along and she can go back to doing just that. 

You’re going to work part time to basically help support her and her D. Why would you do that? You’ll be gone 5 out of 7 days of the week. 

It’s time you decide what you want, not what you think is the “right” thing to do as far as gf is concerned.
NTA

I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. 
We do it frequently in my family and we all live about an hour away. 

We just had a child’s bday the day before Mother’s Day and we all gave the moms their gifts then. 

No sense driving on sat, seeing everyone and then driving again on Sunday. 

Just give your dad a heads up that since you’re making the drive for the graduation, it’s silly to do it again just a week later. He shouldn’t have a problem with it.
NTA

he’s afraid you’ll expose him as the abuser he is to the gf. 

I might accidentally on purpose run into gf at daycare one day. If at least ask the daycare people about her. Does she seem like she’s nice enough to your D? 

Doesn’t the daycare realize that all of a sudden someone new is picking up D and using her dads pin to do it? 
You would think they would want to know who she is, give her her own pin, and have a contact number.
Stop trying to find your one and only. That will lead you to settling just so you have someone. Which is why you maybe stayed in an emotionally challenging relationship for so long. 

Take this little break to analyze what it is you want in a partner and what you are not willing to put up with. 

This is especially important for people who had less than easy relationships, you don’t want to get back in the same routine just because it’s what you know. ( does that make sense? Wasn’t sure how to put it) 

When you feel you are at your strongest, then you can put yourself out there and start dating again. 
And maybe you can be the one to go after the person *you* want to be with. IOW, ask out the guy you want to get to know instead of waiting for him to do the asking. How many guys do we not date because they didn’t ask? 

It’ll happen, maybe when you least expect it.
But is he in therapy?

It’s great that your bro adopted an older kid, but he had to know this child would come with some issues.  It’s been years, what are they doing to help him?
Then that’s what you should do. 

Move out to the country. 

You two are never going to agree on lifestyle, and be assured, where you live will dictate your lifestyle. 

You’ll stay in London and be unhappy and years from now, you’ll realize you should have left years ago.
NTA 

as long as when applying for this job, your wife knew there would be travel. 

I can’t imagine you went thru the application, interview process, and accepted this job without talking to your wife about it. 

But also, it’s only 4 days with one almost 4 yo. Why can’t she handle that?
I would tell her that instead of making excuses as to why she thinks he’s still open to the idea, she needs to just ask him. 

It’s a simple, do you want kids?  That is either a yes or a no question. Not a discussion. 
Although we all know he doesn’t, she needs to hear it point blank.
Why in the world would you volunteer that info? 

There’s no reason for her to ask specifics of your where and what you did with a past gf and it’s kind of gross that you even told her. 

Maybe you should think about having some respect for the woman you date and not go blabbing. A gentleman never tells.
👏👏👏
Reditt has a mix of everything. 
I like seeing how diff generations deal with issues. 

There’s funny, sad, stupid weird crazy posts. It’s amazing to see glimpses into how people live. 

And sometimes I feel I can give sound advice, you know, from being soooo old!
Buy bitcoin. 

This was said in the very beginning by my 20 something son. 

But at the time I knew nothing except I thought bc was being used for things on the dark web. 
And since I don’t even know how to get on the dark web, thought there was no reason to buy. 

Yeah, missed out on that big time. 

Now I listen when he suggests something, especially when I don’t know anything about it. Don’t always do it, but I listen.
Does your state have ACA insurance?  
I’d look into that first. The subsidies really can make it affordable. 

But I’d start with just a regular doctor visit.  It may be something simple as an infection. Try to find a clinic in your area.
So he’s okay with you feeding him, but has a problem when you offer to feed his gf who just happens to be in the house. It’s not like you only cook when she’s there. 

Why? Is he afraid you’re gonna steal her with food? Is he afraid she’s only hanging out with him because you feed her? 

 Ask roomie what the problem is. And then stop doing what he doesn’t like. 
If that means not feeding her, then stop feeding him too. 

You sound like a great roomie. You mow and offered to wash their cars?
Who does that? You’re like southern hospitality on steroids.
So I saw that there are 175 or so winners of this award. 
Surely they all can’t make an acceptance speech. 

So my Q is, is TW slated to say something? 
And if she is supposed to talk, why her? She’s hardly the most esteemed of the list of winners. 
I can understand others going to meet and make connections, but no one wants to meet or connect with her. She’s hardly the “it” person at this point. 

On the other hand, might be nice if she went and was shunned. But we’d never know that anyway.
Dont feel bad, I think the same thing.
NTA

How did a bunch of 14 yo’s get to a cabin 2 hours away?
Someone had to drive them. 

And who leaves a bunch of 14 yo’s on their own? 

The girl whose cabin it is had to have known there were no beds in the cabin. 

Everything about this was a mess from the get go. 

You did nothing wrong. You had company who were taking up sleeping space in your home. 

And if you had a bunch of young girls sleep in the house with you and your friends I guarantee someone would have had a problem with that too. And that optic is worse.
What kind of work do you do? 
If it is mentally taxing that could be why you’re exhausted. Don’t discount the amount of energy you expend by literally thinking and problem solving. 

If that’s not it, then you have the classic “ a body at rest tends to stay at rest”. Get up and walk around every hour or so. 

You also work 6 days a week!  

And don’t go home and just sit - do something, anything. Even for 15 min at first.  Walk around the block, do 10 push ups.
I have been down the ALF and NH  road with my sister. The diff is, she is disabled and had zero assets. 

Can you clarify something please. 

Assisted living costs $6500/ month

But you said your dad has an income of $6800/mo. Does this money include his 401? 

He has enough income to pay for this. 

Why do you think he can’t afford this? 
He of course is not ever going to be able to give your brother any money. Ever. Ever. Ever. Again. 

He’ll have $300 extra every month. You can bring him what he needs from this money- deodorant, clothes, etc. 

When his money runs out, he can apply for Medicare and I know they cover nursing home. Not sure about ALF, ( I think only if disabled, but even then, we had to private pay for 2 yrs before my sister qualified) 

Your dad may well be ready for a NH by the time he’s 86. 

I think this will work——
If he can pay cash for 6 or more years, he can transfer the house now. Then it won’t be in the look back period. Make double sure what the look back period is. ( I think it may be longer, but I’m going with this time since it seems to be the consensus in the comments) 

Also, when you move him in, go see the social services office. They should have one. 
Explain to them that your dad is private pay, his house is not needing to be sold in order to pay his bill and no one from the facility should be talking to his dad about it. At all. 
Have them put it in his admission record. Watch them do it. Explain that Linda is pushing this and it’s not going to happen. 
You might want to get a POA for your dad. That way, he can’t be held if he signs anything.
I love a sweeter breading on pork. It just seems to go together. 
I haven’t done Frosted Flakes just because I don’t normally buy that cereal. 
Try adding some crushed almonds to it too.
NTA because OP’s fiancé, bro to the sil was in agreement with how everything was planned. Did his sister go complain to him I wonder? 

It doesn’t really matter that sil blocked this couple. 

In a couple of months they won’t ever be seeing each other because this couple is banned from bringing their baby to any family functions anyway -

Let’s see how long that lasts. No one can tell me that grandma isn’t going to want to see that baby at Christmas. 

And op, if your in laws want to do separate holidays so sil doesn’t have to see your baby, I’d advise against it. We are either a family or we are not.
At this point send 1 group message to anyone who has your number. Then block all of them. You don’t need this crap from anyone. 

I’d mention the fact that none of them contacted you when your bf of 4 yrs disappeared when you were pregnant and both him and his mother ignored repeated attempts at contact after that. 

Then mention the repeated attempts after the baby was born and passed. 

Then nicely mention they can all go to hell.
NTA. 
How old is this guy?  
I wouldn’t let him in either, even if I heard him. This is lower than even basic adulting. 

He remembers to lock the door and that doesn’t instantly make him realize he needs a key?

You can always tell him to wear his key on a string around his neck like the latchkey kids always did.
Not going to be popular but oh well. 

Honestly, I think your wife is just done with parenting altogether. It’s easy to just say go out and play. 

You  bathed them, took to urgent care, went to pharmacy, made breakfast -and she hadn’t even gotten out of bed yet- then you still had to go fill the prescription. 

And then she gives *you* attitude? And decides she isn’t talking to you? 

Im all for giving the SAHP a day to sleep in and taking over the kids, but when my spouse tells me it’s urgent care time? You bet I’m up and seeing what’s going on. Has she always been so irresponsible?
This relationship has run it’s course. 
It’s extremely common when ppl start dating as teens. 

But you are an adult and you have to know that cheating is not the way to get out of a relationship. That’s a cop out. 
You knew on some level exactly what you were doing and you thought this would be a sure fire way for your gf to break up with you. I’m shocked you were the one who had to tell her. 

You haven’t said much about your gf reaction. Is she not upset? How could she even want to still live with you? 

Are you planning on living together until sept?  That’s a mistake. 
Doesn’t your school break for summer? Go back home or find someone who has a graduating roommate and move in there.
Me too! 
Just never liked her.
Maybe it’s time to lay out everything sis has said and done to you, to the kids, if they don’t know. 

That way they will know to stay away from sis and not believe anything she says. 

They are old enough to make a decision not to be around their aunt and I’d expect them to decline any invites where she will be. 

Your H can go alone. He is the one who didn’t put a stop to this nonsense from the very beginning.
I can understand partner worries about transitioning in that climate, but what op is asking about has less to do with that. 

The way I read it is that each one of them is asking for reassurance about the other still wanting to be a couple. It’s their personal relationship they are worried about

And in that case, the transitioning one is not really reassuring op.  Why shouldn’t both of them be each others support? OP’s life is drastically changing also. She is going from having a male partner to having a female partner. It’s a lot to handle and their concerns shouldn’t be discounted just because she’s not the one going thru the physical transition. They need to know that during and after transition their partner is planning to still be there. 

OP, you need to explain to your partner what you’re feeling and thinking. Your partner should be doing everything in their power to reassure you when your insecurities creep in.
I don’t think I’d want anyone in my home without me being there, even if you know half this couple. 
Isn’t it kind of understood that you’d all be going back to your home together at the end of the night, that’s what I would expect if I was the friend. 
Maybe call your friend and ask her to thank her bf for the trinkets. You should def acknowledge it. 


I always wonder tho, you spent a few hours with this new person, did any of you actually try to talk to him, get to know him? 
It’s hard being the new one. It’s natural to be the more quiet one in this setting. 

If you did and he didn’t really reciprocate or try to keep the convo going, then great. But usually it’s the group just doing their thing and expecting the newbie to just join right on in, which if you’re not an outgoing personality is hard to do.
If one wants kids then it’s not going to work ever. 

If it’s a matter of spouse just wanting to sponge off the other then you have to decide if that’s a dynamic you would be happy with. 

If you can afford to live on one income, and the stay home person is willing to look at doing all the domestic upkeep as their job, and the other will be ok with that, then maybe try it out. 

But if one feels that no one should be a stay home person then again, it’s not going to work. Someone will always be resentful.
Ooh how good would it be if no photogs even bothered to take her pic. 

She gets out of the car- no flashes
She walks to the door- no flashes 
She walks out at the end- no flashes. 

That would be awesome!
Conventional wisdom says don’t quit until you have another job lined up. 

So that’s what you should be doing. Use your unhappiness about your job and homelife to give you that push to find another job. 

I’d you quit with nothing lined up you will be home all day in a place that makes you miserable. 

You have an education so you should be able to find something else. 
And don’t just take anything, find something you think won’t make you miserable, but also that will allow you to move out, even with a roommate or
two. 

Don’t just go thru life. Start taking a pro active stance with your life. It’s the only one you got.
That’s all well and good if you want to believe that, but the second I walked in and saw everyone else I would have had some questions of my sister. 

And I wouldn’t have stayed after such a blatant disrespect of my relationship. 

I believe your (hopefully) ex gf, never mind fiancé, knew all along. There’s no way she hasn’t been around or talked to anyone in the family or friends in the lead up to this marriage for it to not come out. 

Why you are still with this person is beyond me. You obviously aren’t her number one, and if I’m marrying someone that’s the spot they should be in.
Well, I’d like to think a 4 year old knows the word beautiful. 

One of mine was reading by then, who do I call to get an article about them? 

It still just blows my mind that any, and I mean ANY publication would print obvious puff pieces that have anything to do with these two. 

I can’t be bothered to check cause I really don’t care, but did either of these two publications cover the chase, non chase? Or do they just exist to go give platitudes.
Oh, did you think she was actually going to *do* something? 

I’ve figured her out. 
Since she’s a woman and self proclaimed activist she thinks that is enough to get *other*people to do something. 
She just collects awards, while others do the work.
I can understand her wanting stability, you have a child together and she wants to be married for all the protections that come with that for her and your child. 
So give her a wedding, maybe not the one she wants, but one you can afford. 

Stability in a relationship is more about the innate knowledge that you’re in a partnership. That person is there, for the long haul, through it all. It’s less about the stuff you have. 

But stability also comes in another form. And keeping even one of the properties will give you instant financial stability in the future if the need arises for an immediate need for a large amount of cash. 

A luxury apt is nice, if it’s well within your income level to purchase and upkeep it. Which it isn’t because you have to sell off both your safety nets to afford it. 
Not to mention, one is your childhood home. 

Or would stability come from owning an apt that is easily affordable and you can then save more for experiences you both may want in the future? Travel or hobbies or extra activities for your child. Or if you have another or two or more children. Kids are expensive! 

Im one who has always believed to live below your means, without denying myself certain things that I want, and save as much money as possible. Investments and building wealth will always trump bigger,better, or more expensive every time for me.
Just something to think about.
NTA

It’s absolutely astonishing to me that your gf wants to sell property as part of financing a wedding.  And not just 1 property, but both of them. How big of a wedding does she want and how expensive of an apt? 

I could maybe understand, maybe selling the apt if it’s not a place you or her do not want to live, maybe you can’t live in the country while working in the city, or for whatever reason, but  in that case, proceeds from that sale should be used only to buy something where you want to live. Even if you have to finance the rest. 

The country house would be a wonderful place to have as a respite from every day life in a city. 

Talk to her, it seems there’s more to this. Is she looking at expensive, luxury apt’s when you normally wouldn’t be able to afford and wants that as status?
You should have cancelled the weekend with your sister on wed or Thursday when you realized you are not up to having visitors. 

Idk about the secondary stress, but if you can’t even get off the couch I really hope your sister isn’t expecting you to entertain her and the kids. 

Why would she even want to come if you are so sick? that’s just risking her and/ or the kids getting sick also. 

Do yourself a favor and lock yourself in your bedroom until you feel well enough. Sis can use your home as a base and take the kids out to do whatever she wants and she can feed them on her own also. I would never still visit if I knew my sister was so sick. Your sister is being selfish.
Thank you for that.
It would take a bit of getting used to for sure. 
Nobody thinks how parents feel when the kids move away for their careers, or just because they want to try living elsewhere. 

And I think it really depends on how often you saw them. We’re in the same state as our parents and sibs, but they both live an hour away. We see them a few times a year each, holidays, birthdays, etc. 

We def think about that when we talk of moving away. Like how often do we really see everyone and we can just travel back.
Yeah the whole thing with the cab and go pro was odd. 
We’re they originally stopped for a red light? Or did they just get into the cab? Either way, you get in and take off. 

Why would the security guy in the cab get out to try to shoo away the one guy? All that did was make the cab stay stopped for a longer time, thus, more photos. 

And none of the three of them even tried to hide their faces. If you want to make the pics unusable, you don’t give them a shot, you give them the most unusable pose you can.

I had heard it was because in coed classes, the boys were getting more attention from educators and the girls were kind of getting lost in the shuffle. 

Boys called on more for answers, girls questions not being explained to satisfaction, those sorts of things. 

So having all girls would let them be more involved in the lessons or discussions.
The problem I see with sending the photos to the friend is that you have no idea who else he’s sharing or showing them to. 

At least when your H shared he was in control, I’m assuming by just showing the friend his phone. 

And I hate to say it, but you shouldn’t need any affirmation from other men to make you feel good. I understand missing your H, but that could lead to a slippery slope and you might not even notice it happening. 

I would let H know and hope he’d blast the friend and I would let the friend know what his gf said. 
Then I’d send a scathing text to gf, then block her and the friend.
So wait- was there even any paparazzi trying to follow them?

The article says they didn’t want it known where they were staying so they were driven around for a over an hour- overkill much? 

But was there anyone actually even following them? It doesn’t actually say that. 

So then what- go to the police station to what wait for another car? Oh and they had to be escorted to the next block before they could get into them other car. 🙄

These two are only important in their own minds. 

So. Much. Drama. For absolutely nothing. This chick lives for pictures of her. Was she afraid someone was gonna break into her hotel room?  GMAFB!
Don’t be so quick to judge. Lots of younger kids gain a lot of weight right before they have a growth spurt where their weight evens out with their height. 

But when I see older kids within a family and all of them are overly big, then I wonder why the parents weren’t more conscious of the kids at least. Like they can be however big they want, but wouldn’t you want better for the kids.
Sandals are even better than sneakers. If you have a lightweight button down that looks great with shorts too. Roll up the sleeves.
The idea that you both have to see other people in order to know that you want to be with each other permanently makes no sense to me. 

There will always be someone else that either of you could fall in love with and that person becomes the one. The idea is that when you find a person you want to commit forever to, you stop looking. 

But you two are young, have been together since you’re teens, so basically what you’re both saying is-
you both want to play the field, sleep around and see if there’s someone better out there because you haven’t and you don’t want to regret it. 
And that’s fine to want to, most people do that in their teens until their mid 20’s or longer. 

Just realize this, be honest and verbalize this. 
If you want to pretend that dating others will be the catalyst to losing weight and solidifying that your current partner is actually the one, you might be surprised with the reality. And are you both prepared for that?
I think it depends on what you’re doing after the grad ceremony. 
If you’re going to a lunch at a decently nice restaurant, then please dress accordingly. 

If you’re only going to the ceremony to be there for a friend and not going out afterward, then I think it’s ok. 
( but actually, I hate flip flops in public, especially on men, so I really think you should put sneakers on).

How about nicer shorts, a polo and a pair of sneakers?  You’re still comfy, but look like you made an effort.
There are a lot of recipes that “ hide” veggies in regular meals. Try to look up some of them. At least he’ll be getting some nutrients that way. 

One I know is shredding carrot into meatloaf, so things like that.
Is it just a case of him not used to these veggies?
Maybe try to get some veggies that he would have from his home country so he’s at least eating something healthy. 

Does he eat fruit? It’s not a substitute but it’s good for him at least. 

Then you can try to introduce new ones. 
Be patient, everything is new to him and he’s only 10.
Info:

How long are you dating?

And is this your first serious relationship?
If you care for this woman at all, you would let her go. 
You want to go back to normal, but verbal abuse has no place in a relationship. 

You admit you have verbally abused her for all 4 yrs of this relationship. You are not a good partner because of your anger issues. 

You need to stay single, get some help for your anger issues, and only then should you try to have another relationship. 

You cannot solve your issues on your own and asking this woman to be abused more from you is cruel.
Late to this thread, but I’ve heard this is a new thing CCL is doing. 
It’s not so much an “offer”, anyone can earn it. 
I read something about it, but I think
It works this way-

As you gamble on the ship, you accrue points. You always had an option to convert these points to free play while on the same sailing. Points do not transfer to another sailing so it didn’t make much sense not to convert them. You did however earn some perks on the sailing. IE at 1500 points you get free drinks in the casino, you might get a steakhouse dinner or a spa service, but idk how many points you needed for any of them. 

Now however, the new plan is that if you do not convert your points, you are supposed to be given a certificate for the above amounts depending on how many points you earn. 
But I believe these certificates are used for a future cruise. 

So is it worth it? Idk. But I just play whatever I would normally play and whatever I get, I get. I wouldn’t overspend my budget just to get to the next level of points.
I’m harsh because honestly, I’m gonna take care of me first. 

What he does after you break up with him is of no concern of yours. 

At this point I’d send a text, tell him it’s over. You’re done. Tell him to get some help  

Then block him everywhere. 

And all those friends who hate you now? Once you block him, you can give them a heads up that it’s their turn to take care of him, you know, since they care so much. Then block them too. You don’t need these people in your life. I’d rather have no friends.
 NTA
It’s not your parents event, idc who is paying for it. 

Your fsil said pants or a dress. So you can wear the pantsuit. And I don’t know you, but a pantsuit will look great on you. 

Go and have a great time and after the wedding try and keep in touch more with bro and sil.
I have found that once I really get to know a potential romantic partner, their attractiveness, or lack of becomes a non issue. Like their personality just meshes so well with me that they in turn become, sort of better looking in my eyes. If that makes any sense.  I *know* this person would not be on anyones top 10 good looking list, but that one trait just isn’t a dealbreaker compared to the immense feelings when I’m with this person. 

But if you’re talking about do I have to find my partner attractive all day every day?  No. We all go thru periods when we’re not looking our best. Did we gain weight, happen to get a horrible haircut that changes the way we look, did we radically change the clothes we wear cause we’re in a weird fashion phase. 
Those types of things come and go. 
Take a good look at your partner when they’re all slack and sleeping, probably not the best look, but that is them, in a raw sort of way.
Im thinking it wasn’t malicious. More so that the two of you, you and sil are the baby’s main caregivers. 
Not great wording by mil. 

I love my mil but I would have laughed and said something sarcastically funny like “ wait, I’m the mom, I did the labor and have the body to prove it”. Or said to sil “ ok you get her when she won’t stop crying since we’re sharing anyway”. 


I cannot fathom why your h and bil were included unless the gift was a ticket for each of you to go out somewhere together. 

Are you gonna get a Father’s Day gift too?
Honestly, I usually don’t  care if the story itself is a bit disjointed, ill see if it evens out or I’ll even reread a sentence that “sounds” odd to figure out what they’re trying to say, but spelling errors are a non starter for me. 

A random one here or there- ok
Constantly? Nope, I just stop reading. 

You want to be a writer ffs, learn to spell or get even a friend to read just for spelling errors.
I want to know why you want to do this? 

Are you gonna wake up and have a couple shots in the morning or wait before bed? 

There is absolutely no good reason for you to do this. 

Are you making up for lost time, do you think it’ll make you a grown up? What?  

This just seems like a weird ritual to start.
This is what I would and have told my daughter. 

He can be frustrated, and rant and rave - about that thing- but he has absolutely no right to take it out on you. 

Get up and leave. 
You do not sit there and take it. 

You need to draw a line with him. Tell him in no uncertain terms that you will not be treated in this way. 

This is your first bf, know your worth and what you are willing to put up with and what you are not. And this is not one. Saying sorry does not negate the fact that he scares and hurts you. 

There are other guys out there.
Oh yes, I watch a lot of news programs. 

The one thing that always gets me talking back to the tv is when anyone, usually politicians, are on there telling me again what the problem is and blaming someone else, usually the other party. 

So ok, we all know the problem so instead of blaming someone else, tell me what YOU propose as a solution. 
I’d rather listen to a ridiculous idea than no idea.
Just give her back the money for her ticket and take someone else.
Wow. Had no idea about any of that so thank you. 

I’d be up for building a bigger building.
You don’t have to have a high credit line, but you could call your cc and ask them to increase it for a medical emergency. 

It might be helpful to call before hand and ask if that’s something they could do in the event of an emergency. Maybe explain that you have insurance and can prove that so they know you will have the means to repay. 

My policy is a pay now and get reimbursed. So if I have to go to the ships doctor, I pay and then submit for reimbursement. 

But for example, medical evac, I call the insurance and they make the arrangements. I’m not expected to lay out half a million for that.
“ what form of gov’t do we move towards”

Correct me if I’m wrong, but the system we have now was laid out in the constitution, so in order to change it to something else we’d have to effectively dismantle the constitution. 
Keep the “good” parts and change the “bad parts” 

That will never happen. 

Our system should work, there are adequate checks and balances to keep things on the up and up. 
But individual interests are always going to take precedent over the greater good. 

I’m certainly not educated enough to know where it all went wrong. And I suspect it’s been a long time of small incremental changes that have got us where we are today. 
But it would be an interesting discussion
From what I read and see, Middletown township has a really great special needs program. Like, people move here just for that. 
The problem is there aren’t a lot of rentals around, and home prices are high. 

I’d suggest getting a list of school districts, checking out COL, see if you can afford to live there and take into account what your commute would be and if you can find anything about their special needs programs ( don’t know if it’s published), but then join the Facebook group for those towns or cities and ask there. 
I’ve seen moms ask and the responses have been overwhelmingly positive. Those that have been thru it are the most knowledgeable of the ins and outs.
I think I remember it being this way- 

hospitals were so wildly overcrowded that the idea was that anyone who came from a nursing home and was deemed stable, or on the way to recovery could be sent back to finish their recovery in the NH. 
BUT, the caveat was that the NH was supposed to be able to segregate these patients away from the other residents until they were no longer able to infect others. 

If you’ve ever visited a NH, you’d realize that this is impossible to do. 
Besides there being no empty rooms usually, each resident has an assigned room, and as is the case with older residents, they know where they belong. 
Suddenly moving not sick patients out of their room in order to use that room for a recovering but sick resident will not go over well. (And vice versa - moving sick out of their room)

So I think NH’s took back recovering residents either thinking they could make it work, or knowing they couldn’t but we’re getting so much pressure to alleviate the hospital’s burden or, the NH only gets paid from Medicare when the resident is actually in house that they didn’t want to forgo that payment. 

I have a relative in a NH, and I will say, there is no way to stop the spread of any communicable illness. Most of the residents don’t even ever leave the home. Even just to be outside on the patio. Some more mobile residents can get themselves out there, but most need assistance and the staff can’t be bothered. And there are never any windows opened. Luckily mine never caught Covid during the major surge, (but we suspect she had it prior).
I get that *she* thinks she’ll get a payout, but it comes up so often that KC will be the one who pays that it just gets on my last nerve!
Again with KC paying her out. 
I really don’t understand what the rationale for this would be. 

Even if she has an NDA, she’ll never stop. She will find a way to get whatever she wants to get out, to get out. Another leaked letter to a friend? Anonymous friend source spilling info? Cryptic statements? 

It is not KC’s responsibility to get rid of her. 

What could she really know at this point? Nothing so earth shattering damaging to anyone but Harry. And I have no problem if she drags him thru the mud, it’s just karma coming back to him.
NTA

personally, moms attitude is crappy. 

You are supposed to fund a gift and a dinner for 4 people? 

Just make her lunch at home and be done with it. 

She’s taking this Mother’s Day thing way too far, considering she only has 1 kid who has a job.
Shes never going to see your side of it. She needs to be right more than she needs a relationship with you. 

Your partner needs to stop entertaining his mom. He needs to tell her if she has something to say to you, she should say it to you, not him. And he’s ending any conversation that goes that way. 

She’ll either get in touch with you or not, but your H being the go between at this point is ridiculous.
It doesn’t matter. 

Don’t analyze someone you are not dating. It’s exhausting. 

Move on. 

Nobody should have any patience for a constant on/ off relationship. We either want to be together and resolve our issues, or we go our separate ways.
NTA

You have two other kids in that house that you need to protect. Not that they need to know. 

I say you have every right to ask. 
He’s living with you and you are caring for him through this tumultuous time in his life, he should trust you enough with the information. 
But don’t say that and just accept if he won’t share his diagnosis.
Tablecloths because I hate to see the fold marks when it’s on the table.
NTA for keeping the letters, I would have also. 

Do you forgive him? The problem with lying is that once they lie, you don’t know what, if anything else, is true. 

Only you can decide if your relationship is real with him or not. 
What did he say about all of this- why lie about having a gf, why’d he keep the letters, what did she mean to him. 

I have an idea about why he lied but I’d like to know what he said.
So I’m a lot behind on this whole story, so if someone could explain please?

Phone hacking, I agree would be something to sue over. 

But, paying for a PI to get info any him or anyone else, just seems to me like it’s a normal course of events? 
So for example, if I’m a tabloid or even just a newspaper, how else could I report on a celebs activities if I didn’t know where they would be? Seems like to hire someone to follow them would be par for the course? 

Also, the suspicious phone calls- what made them suspicious? We’re they hang ups? We’re they asking for confirmation if the subject was going to be at a particular party, ceremony, etc? 

Sorry, but other than the hacking, is hiring a PI, even if it’s to follow someone, illegal?
Walk the strip and go into each casino/ hotel. It’s fun to see the diff theming.
NTA for trying. 
But I don’t think it’s going to do any good. 

You can try to occupy him when it’s usually “ her” days, but she’ll just change up her schedule. 

The fact that he proposed a poly says that he isn’t willing to stop seeing her and that is the real issue. Why hasn’t he? If he knows you are not happy with her specifically why isn’t he putting your marriage first? 

What did he say when you said no to a poly situation? 

She sounds a bit unhinged. You’re getting in the way of “ true love” and “ it’s gods will”?  
Does he not think these missives are a problem?
He may well be miserable in the gloomy, grey, cold winter time. It’s a thing. 

But also, some people don’t need to see their so every day. 
You guys see each other at work, so there’s no reason you need to be seeing each other every night also. 

When do you see your friends, do laundry, grocery shop? 

Pick one week night and make that your night. Wed is good. It’s right in the middle. Then you can decide if and what you’re going to do on the weekend. 

He’s telling you it’s too much, not that he never wants to see you again. Give him space.
So basically you just don’t want him to show up on Mother’s Day with a gift from your kids and then you all go to his moms like you’ve always done, because you had a fight and are
still not talking. 

If you successfully dodge him on moms day and he gets in touch on Monday what are you going to do? 

It seems like you’re trying to punish him by making him go to his moms alone. 

As for the picture, chances are his D is putting hers in front of yours. Find another spot. 
You don’t want to go on vacay with his parents bc of whatever happened last year, fine. But has that situation been resolved at all? If not, why would you ever entertain Mother’s Day with his mom? 
No key? Did you ask for it back or were you waiting for him to make a grand gesture over it? 

There’s a lot of passive aggressive going on here. 
Speak up. Use your words. 

Look, it’s been 9 years, it either works or it doesn’t. And it seems like it doesn’t work. Maybe it did for a time, but realize this, both your and his kids are seeing this and I’m sure it’s not the first time.
This is the way.
This is all what HE thinks. 

There’s not one iota of what he says that would show that he actually knows for a fact that the kids watched, or that the non existent party happened or that H tucked anyone into bed that night. 

So basically this is a non story. 

It’s really easy for anyone to say what someone else would do or thought or felt, but those  ideas are based off of what we ourselves would think or do or feel. 

Why even give this guy any interviews? Have they not caught on that he’s not reliable at this point?

Did they actually say that? 

Do they really expect you to never have another partner? That you should be alone and lonely while they go off and make their lives. 

We’re not talking about children here who are still living home. They should have some semblance of sharing a life with someone, especially the 29 yo. 

So If any of their marriages don’t work out they are never going to look for another partner because they might be replacing the first one? 

Your kids are being selfish by denying you the happiness you deserve. 

And I’m over here pushing my step dad to move on, and it’s been over 10 years since my mom passed. I want him to have someone to share his life with, why should he be alone?
NTA
But your dad sure is. 

 The first person he should have told is his wife. 
What does he hope to accomplish my telling you kids first? 
Is he hoping one of you will tell mom so he doesn’t have to? 

He makes no sense at all  what if he tells you all and takes his sweet time telling mom? Do we all just pretend all is well?  

Mom might not see it coming,  but she’s been as unhappy as him, she might welcome the divorce.
I need to know how this person knows their partner? Did the partner move to Nigeria after an in person relationship or is this an online thing? 

If it’s online, absolutely no way in hell should a parent leave their child to go meet someone they have never met, and I don’t care which country it is. 
But doubly if the country could be dangerous. 

If it’s a case of knowing this person and they had to live for a legit reason like a job, then I might go, but my partner would need to meet me at the airport and not leave me alone in an unfamiliar country. Doubly if it’s a dangerous country. 

Come on, this is basic common sense. Even if I didn’t have a child, why would I put myself in a dangerous situation in a foreign country?  

I have no idea if Nigeria is dangerous to travel to. I got the sense that you think it’s dangerous?
Yeah and we have no idea if that’s really what he said. I’ve seen 3 or 4 diff interpretations of the lip readers. 
I don’t trust any of them. 

I do find it hard to believe that H would talk about either his fam or M in this way so freely with Jack unless they have been in regular contact. Like was jack asking how are you and H went into a litany of complaints? 
Or has Jack been privy to any ongoing crap with M or the fam that they’ve previously spoke about. 

I didn’t think they had that kind of relationship, if they do it would be the only secret either Harkle ever kept.
Does your H understand that your dr has not cleared you to go back to work?  There’s clearly a reason for this. 

Explain it to him again, in plain english- (obviously his advanced degree isn’t in English)

“ I will never be able to go back to my high paying job that I love, that supports this family if I do not get myself mentally healthy. In order to get healthy I need to rest. And rest means not working a crappy job while you refuse to be a partner to me, and a responsible dad to our children. The answer to this is that you take over being the support of this family, as I have been for the past 10 years. 

If you cannot do that, then you are not the man I thought I married. That man would be worried that I had an actual mental breakdown at work. That man would be doing everything in his power to support me until I am better and able to resume my career. If that is not you then tell me now and I’ll figure out what my next steps should be. Because I cannot go on like this.”

Sorry but I cannot understand your husband’s attitude at all.
I don’t understand why anyone would change majors just because they aren’t getting straight A’s. 
That was the first mistake your kid made. Straight B’s gets the same diploma as A’s. 

So they changed majors to something they didn’t even like, that’s the second mistake. 

So now they’re miserable. 

Just let the kid quit this job. If they keep getting bad reviews they won’t have a job and they won’t have a god recommendation either. 

Let them come home, get some therapy if they need it and let them figure it out from there. 

This isn’t a hard decision.
NTA

First off, quit whatever job you have. Your health is more important. 

Does your H at least agree with the fact that the household needs an income that covers your bills, and even more importantly has benefits that cover your medically fragile child. 

This is a man who has a masters degree and is confused as to why he needs to get a job? 

So what exactly does he think the solution should be?
Too bad if it’s going to hurt her, someone always is going to be upset in a breakup. Better her than you. 

Break up, block her everywhere and move on. You’ll be better for it.
No because in order for her kids to experience anything like this she would be forced to—— volunteer—-
You know, like an actual act of service! 
And not get paid for doing it. 
Oh the horror!!!
You’re missing the point here. 

Establishing paternity is in your child’s best interest. 
If he is the father then you can file for support thru the courts and he will have to pay. That benefits your child. 

But if you just want to keep going back and forth with him, he will not just hand you money for the baby every month as he has proven. 

Split the cost of the test.
Massive massive YTA

In the event this is actually true, which I doubt strongly because no one can be this out of touch-

What exactly do you and your wife do in regards to your kids?
Your bro has been doing literally everything for your kids. 
Between you and your wife, you don’t even bathe and put the kids to bed. 
How exactly is him doing the kids laundry going to help you out so much?  Seems to me you have an over abundance of free time after work and on the weekends since you don’t do anything else. 

You do realize he has a job, and a life- that doesn’t revolve around YOUR kids. 

I really hope he just leaves in the middle of the night. I’d love to see how that next morning goes.
So he asks if her robe is heavy, whatever she said made him instantly uncomfortable. 

Maybe it was something like “it’s a small sacrifice for the family/ crown/family” or “service is a huge weight to bare” 

Or she really dug in with something like “ you’d know if you stuck around”.
 No there’s nothing to be embarrassed about. 

This relationship isn’t doing it for you anymore. 
You’re thinking is that there has to be a big reason to break up with someone, but you can break up with someone for any or no reason. 

Don’t stay with her or anyone you are not 100% invested in. . It’s not fair to you or them.
Found this:

He needs to see a dentist and a doctor.
It’s possible that at 18, this LDR satisfied your emotional needs. And even just seeing each other intermittently was doing it. 

It may be tho, that at 20 it isn’t satisfying your needs and you need a partner in closer proximity. 

Or you’re just really bored with this girl. It happens.
Have you tried redirecting the conversation? Or has your wife? 
Do the other men also add to these little anecdotes? 

Sex conversations will and have come up occasionally, but they are short lived and not every time we’re with friends.  Thats an odd topic to always come up. 

Maybe the other women keep bringing it up because your wife never has anything to share. They’re trying to figure her out. 

Your issue is your frustration with your sex life, not that your wife laughs along with the conversation. 
It’s been 8 years, you must have some idea what is holding your wife back. Is it something that can even be fixed with therapy? If not, all the therapy in the world will do no good. 
Maybe you as a couple should see an actual sex therapist.
Gf is tah for not deleting the pic as soon as asked, especially bc they know op doesn’t want them to have those type of pics. 

And op is tah for physically restraining the gf. - (it should not have had to get to that point, but gf did challenge op to come get it, and they did).
So it seems as if your parents and his know each other.  Do they speak often? 
I ask because you said you argue with your parents over something and once they see they have no reasonable reason to say no, they back down and you get your way. 

I wonder if your parents can explain to his parents why they are ok with this trip, and maybe that would help his parents get on board. 

I understand it’s cultural, but you both have the same cultural norms, yet your parents are being more tolerable.
ESH

Just the fact that she didn’t delete it as soon as you asked is a problem for me. Especially that you’ve already had this conversation. 

Today it’s a picture, what is tomorrow boundary break going to be?  
I 
have to trust that my partner is going to respect me enough to not do things I specifically ask them not to.
YWBTA if you say anything now. 

This family is your uncles wife’s,  no?

Why would these people even be invited to your wedding? 

I can understand being close to an uncle and his wife- but her family? Other then saying hi and bye at occasions your uncle has, you can absolutely not invite them. 

Plus, you’re no where close to even getting married, so leave it for now.
I have no judgement because honestly I am not understanding this. 

Your friend wanted you to design her wedding invitations? 

We’re you supposed to draw or write one invite and then she’d what? Make photocopies and send them out? 

We’re you supposed to hand write all the invites? 

Is there a reason she didn’t just order invitations?
I would think he would be invited with a plus 1. And that would be you. 

I wouldn’t expect to receive my own invite to weddings of his friends or family. 
You can always ask, at least for his brother.  Wont you have to make arrangements with work?
Yes, I am in the hopeless phase right now. Im in the having it all planned out in my head and just need to start phase. 

Don’t give up just yet. 
You’re doing well with breakfast and lunch. It’s just dinner that’s messing 
you up. 

So maybe try telling your wife that’s a problem. She’s going to have to be supportive of what you’re trying to do or this won’t work. 

You can go out to eat, but watch what you order. Have a salad before your meal. Chicken or fish and a veg. 
Then when your meal comes, half everything in the plate. Only eat that and ask for a take away box. That’s tomorrows dinner. Box it up and be done. Have a coffee after dinner and maybe a few bites of your wife’s desert. 

When you’re going to eat at home, you’re going to have to plan for it. 
Grill up a bunch of chicken on Sunday. Use that for a day or two, add a salad or a veg. 
It’s ok if you and wife don’t eat the same things every night. There were plenty of times I cooked for the fam and ate a salad and added a protein. 
I almost always snack on nuts in the evening if I just need something to nosh on, I find they satisfy that need with a small portion. 

You’re doing so well all day long, don’t let the one evening meal mess it all up.
This was your tipping point? 

Not the time you spent working while planning for and having a baby and he did - nothing but tag along on vacation while you worked? Was that part of your plan, you can have a year off with the baby so he gets one too? 

I’m gonna guess that he isn’t making the same money you did and that’s why you need to have such a tight budget, but did either of you think maybe he should have been working last year and you could have built up some savings?  

You had a plan, but it had some holes in it. I’m afraid this is going to be a very long year for you.
You’ve been stuck for several years, coincidently you’ve been with the bf for several years. 

Is it possible that part of your dissatisfaction is that you cut your traveling plan short to stay with your bf and you’re wanderlust is creeping back in? 

You have been working so it’s not as if
he’s been supporting you. Not everybody is going to be so career driven or always have another goal to reach. A lot of people just fall into a career, find it’s pretty ok and stay with it. 

No one can tell you what you should do with your life, but you like traveling and have/ had a passion for it so maybe try to find something in the travel planning sector.  Or work for an airline to get the travel benefits. 

There’s also online teaching English which might be better than in class. 

I think there’s some kind of test you can take that shows what you have an aptitude for, you might try that and see if it gives you any ideas. Otherwise, just look at some job sites and see if anything sparks your interest. You might get lucky and find something.
What has he tried to do to get his weight under control that after 2 years he hasn’t been able to find something he can stick with? 

We all know exactly what we have to do to lose weight and control our cravings, and a lot of us just can’t be bothered, but when it becomes an actual medical issue that’s when it shocks us into action. Is he not actually scared about this health issue? Why not? 

You have to decide if you are ok with a relationship of no sex and a man 10 years older with health issues. 

At 24, it would be a no from me.
you need to have a serious talk with your bf. 

He wants to move and you don’t. Have you discussed this at all? Have you told him why you want to stay- your job, daycare and family support? 
What could he say to counter that? 

You live together but are on and off- how does that work when you’re off? Does one of you stay somewhere else?  Or do you just ignore each other on the regular while still living in the same place? 

Look, this relationship doesn’t sound very stable. It’s good that you are conscious of stability for not just you but also your child, but buying a house on your own with no discussion will not go over well at all. And I could absolutely understand that from his point of view. 

Have the tough conversations now. Nobody wants to have them, but you need to figure out what is going on with your relationship because honestly it seems like neither one of you are all that committed to the other. 
Once you figure that out, a plan going forward will quickly emerge. You’ll either both want to stay together and you’ll buy a house together, or you’ll go your separate ways and figure out visitation and child support. 
Whichever way it goes at least you’re both not in limbo.
That’s the only way I like them. Firm and crunchy.  Or dried is really good too. 

But I like all my fruit like that. There’s something so gross to bite into a fruit and the juice goes everywhere. 🤮
We only do it for final jeopardy if we need time to decipher the clue. 

During the game we just yell out the answers.
Your art is stunning!  
You are very talented.
So he keeps saying he wants someone on the same level as him in regards to some very specific things. 

Has it occurred to you that he threatens divorce just so you will bend to his every whim? 
Do you find yourself changing things you do after he threatens? 

You shouldn’t have to put up with a looming threat over your head every single the day from the person who is supposed to love you the most. 

Id tell him the next time he brings up divorce is the day I will be finding a lawyer. He needs to find a better way of communicating.
The old “he/she loves me so much they want to spend all their time with me” excuse. 

No, it’s weird and controlling.
5 pm for preschool- yikes!  

I still wouldn’t do it. It’s not your job. 

And frankly, you went to school to be a teacher not a bus monitor. 
I can’t believe the other teachers don’t feel the exact same way. 

This is an assistant problem, they can figure it out. I’d remove myself from the situation, give the assistants the number to call for a sub bus monitor and be done. 
If they can’t get a sub one day then one of them does it, you know, because it’s their job.
NAH 

So, greeting guests means what? After church when we walked out we stayed by the church doors and as the guests filed out we greeted them, thanked them for coming and they have their congrats. But this was both 
sets of parents then leading up to us. 

If this is what you’re doing why would you not have stepmom standing right next to dad while receiving guests? If greeting guests is a MOB thing, then I’d think it’s a FOB thing also? Are your new in-laws in this receiving line also? 


And it’s really not all that much trouble to have her in the room where you’re getting ready. I’m assuming your bridesmaids will be there also? 
This one seems petty to me, like there’s not really a reason for it other than exclusion 

And lastly, I’ve never seen anyone but the best man give any kind of speech at a wedding. (But that could just be the norm where I’m from) 
If your dad is making a speech then sm can stand up there with him. She doesn’t have to talk, but it’s the acknowledgement that they are together and she’s a part of your life, and his speech should reflect on that.

I wouldn’t do bus duty either if it’s not part of my job. 
As a lead I’m sure you have other teacher duties that you need to do after school or at home. That’s the stuff you do, and assistants do the bus. 

You have 4 assistants, it’s their job, so they can take an extra day each week. 

I would just tell all of them, not my job, I get car sick, and I’m not doing it. They are free to do whatever they want. 

What time does school end that you get back at 6 pm? 

This is really odd to me tho, where I live the bus company hires drivers and aides for the bus.

Any change in how they see him is only gonna change - if they see him-  

So If he wants any relationship with your fam he needs to start showing up. 

That’s really all there is to it.
So now I’m curious- does she print her signature on everything? 

Like I’m thinking a drivers license or bank acct application. 

My youngest is 26 and they were taught cursive.
The ex is certainly taking up a lot of space in your head. 

Why is that? Are you not secure enough with your bf?  How does she ever come up in conversation and what did he say when he told you she misses him? 

But if you just want to break up to save yourself some drama then that’s perfectly ok also. It may be your intuition telling you that this isn’t a forever thing. (Not that he’s cheating or anything, more a feeling of she’s always gonna be lurking somewhere and you just don’t want to deal with it.)
And honestly, it doesn’t seem like you’d be all that hurt if you do break up, so maybe you’re not as invested, which is good. 

I’ll tell you this tho, if you decide to stay, make sure you go to every family function. Make yourself seen. She’s thinking she intimidated you into not going- and she’s right. Treat her like she’s any other of sisters friend.
That’s not really an ultimatum tho, he hasn’t really given you any indication he’s into you but you keep trying anyway. Why? I’m sure he’s a great guy, but there’s not much coming from him. 

His indifference is telling you all you need to know. 

He’s not the last guy in the world, find someone who actually wants to be with you and stop wasting your time. 

Do you really want to be with someone that you have to chase until he just gives in? Then you’ll be here all sad because you chased and chased, finally got him, but it isn’t the grand love affair you envisioned.
So it’s not really about having an independent life, it’s all about having a partner. 

Well, to attract a partner you need to be a good partner. 

Your mh is bad but you aren’t getting help for it. 
You had a job but they cut your hours so you just stopped showing up, instead of getting a part time job since you had extra time to work. 

Take a second and just stop and think what you need to do to get where you want to be. 
Ask for help if you need, but no one else can just give you a life. You have to make one. Just like every other person.
YTA 

He’s 6!  He’s not a man and you shouldn’t be trying to teach him to be a man at his age. 

Honestly, you sound terrible. 
You can disagree with a book he reads, or any other issue, but you have a normal rational conversation with his mother and come to a mutual decision. 

She left over this. Even if it’s for a night, she’s got enough sense to leave when you show how absolutely unreasonable you can be. Next time she may not come back.
I mean no offense, but is there something about your autism that makes you not able to live independently? And if you don’t mind, how old are you? 

You need 2 things. 
A job and an apartment. 

Do you have a job? If yes then stay where you are for now and save as much as you can. 
If no, then figure out what you can or want to do and start looking for that work. 
If you can’t find what you’re looking for right now, take any job. The idea is to just start having an income. 

After you save enough money then you can begin to look for an apt and a room mate or two. 
Then come back here and ask how much you can afford to pay in rent based on your income, and we’ll help you figure that out also.
I think you over reacted to this situation. She was with her bf, who I assume you trust since he stays at your home sometimes. 

I can track all my adult kids and only 2 still live at home. But I rarely do because they tell me what’s going on, just like your d did. ( we just always had it since they were teens) 

Why would you check that she made it to work? What if she just up and decides one day she wants to skip work and go to a park? Are you gonna go to the park and make sure she’s ok?

Leave her alone. She’s an adult and doesn’t need you constantly on top of her. 

Tracking is for when they up and disappears and I can tell the police where the last location was. But even then, the cops can get more info than I can anyway.
It’s not just rich people who want more money, it’s pretty much all people. 

There are exceptions of course. 

Some people are very content with what they have and aren’t always looking for more.
ESH

Im just sitting here baffled that the H is actually complaining to his WIFE that he has to find a new job because WIFE told GF’s husband about the affair. 

Like, how is this even a regular conversation between them?
What should you do?

You turn to her and tell her
“ Cut the crap. Stop your crying like a baby because I saw an a** on tv. If you cannot get your insecurity under control this isn’t gonna work. Go see someone if you need to. I’ve been more than patient over the last 4 years, but my patience is wearing thin and I’m tired of it now. We’re here to have a good time and I’m not putting up with this. You can go back home if you’re going to be miserable for the next 4 days over something that literally- literally does not affect either one of us”. 

And then you stuck to that. Stop giving in to her. 

This might be the most absolutely ridiculous thing I’ve ever read on reditt. And we all know the ridiculousness that is on this site.
Keep in mind that while you would be ok with not having any contact with your family, she isn’t you and when faced with that choice, I think a lot of people wouldn’t. 

So she cuts off her whole family and then what? She has you? And only you? You cannot possibly, no matter how hard you try, replace a mother,father and siblings. 
Those are unique relationships that for most people cannot be replaced. 

Take some time to get over her and try to let go of some of the anger you have thinking that you were so easily discarded. This was probably extremely hard for her to do. 

Life goes on and this too shall pass.
I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. 

You tell your parents what you told us here-
That they’re lovely people, you love them and severing them from your life will be hard, but if that’s what they choose, then you’ll abide by it. 
But add that you refuse to be verbally abused by anyone at any time so they can call off the dogs. 

You can add that you are absolutely positive in the fact that somewhere in their minds they know- they have to know- that being gay isn’t a choice, it’s the way, (whatever their deity is that they believe in) has made you. 

Then you go live an absolutely wonderful life and surround yourself with people who love you being you.
Please do yourself a favor and download a news app. 

Even if you don’t read any full articles, you will at least read the headlines and have a very vague idea of what’s going on in the world.

What exactly does she want an apology for? Your wife is allowed to still be pissed and take some time. She offered to drop the kids off- what more does dad and wife want? 

Has the wife taken responsibility that what she said was done in such a way to make you and your wife look bad?
And why would she even want that?

Because until she ponies up that admittance and apologizes for it, there’s no way I’d want to see her. This whole fight was her doing. 

No way is anyone holding my kids hostage like that. Grandpa will just have to get used to not seeing the kids then. 

Depending on the ages, if the kids ask, just say that grandpa is being a brat and he’s in time out.

But your first mistake was not having your own acct. 

have a joint for bills ( that’s your 70/30), a joint for savings - decide on an amount, and each have their own. 
Ideally each of your paychecks should
be deposited in your individual accts, and each person transfers what they need to. 

By you leaving your extra money in a joint acct, you are essentially giving her free reign in that acct, since she can access it. But you cannot access her own acct. 

How did you even agree to this?
I would say just use your new thought process of understanding to slowly work through to the next step. 

Don’t look at the next big picture, slowly work through the concepts one at a time until you have absolute command of that step, then move to the next, eventually the bigger picture makes sense. 

Abstract concepts are hard to understand. Is there really something to be learned in a sense, if there’s no definitive way of proving what the end is. 
So maybe the point of your paper is to apply what you think/ believe to be the end result based on your individual thoughts?  
(I’m not sure this applies to you and what you’re studying tho)
(Just to be clear- he’s a male 32? 
Your post says 32F)

He’s pushing way too hard. I wouldn’t even keep talking to him. 

You’re under no real pressure from your parents to get married - right now-  

But it seems that he, as a 32 yo man who has up until this point hasn’t found a match for himself, is trying to push you into a marriage before you have even met. I suspect being pressured by his parents. 

Stick to what you want, a marriage where you are in love. That means no more meeting people who do not live within a realistic amount of distance that you can actually date. 

Don’t shortchange yourself on this. Picking a spouse is literally the most important decision you can make. It is the one decision that can make your like a living hell if you get it wrong. Or can give you a lifetime of happiness if you choose right.

Move to the other place, take the manager spot there, hire a nanny. 

I don’t know why you think you can’t raise your child by yourself. Millions of women do it every day with a lot less resources than you seem to have. 

You’re an adult but you don’t seem to want to do a lot of adulting. Time to step up here. 

Leave him to his deal with his child. 
He’ll probably end up hiring a nanny too. 

He cheated with your sister- Is this a man you even want to be involved with?  Even if he didn’t know it was your sister, he’s an older man with a very young wife who still cheated on her. What more is this guy looking for? Whatever it is, he has proved it is not a monogamous marriage.
I usually try to explain how I’m understanding it and the other person will then point out where my flawed thinking is. 
So I’d say” so X does this, and Y does this, so when X does it’s thing, how does Y know how to do their thing” 

This way the other person is seeing where I’m getting confused and explain just that part of it so I can make the connection. 

So instead of hearing the explanation that still doesn’t make sense, they explain just the part that’s tripping me up.
And that’s why neither of them should be running. 

After the last 2 elections we should not still have to choose between the lesser of two old, horrible candidates. 

Im kind of hoping there are a slew of people just throwing their hat in for both parties. 
Someone new might just rise to the top.

Do you even like your mom? 
She wanted one thing and even paid for it! 
Tell work you can’t make it. 

You should have told work before you changed shifts that you have plans that day and needed it off. 

I’ll bet you would have done that if you had plans for an outing with a bf or friend. You wouldn’t forget about those plans. You wouldn’t cancel on those people. 
But this is just your mom and you don’t even like the event so she doesn’t get the same priority.
I would absolutely rat out SIL to the company. 

This woman is making fun of you for not being able to get a job while gloating about hers, which really could have been yours if she didn’t lie. 

As for your sister being mean to you. 
Think about this;

Her wife doesn’t help her with any bills even tho they should be partners, 
she was mean to you until you cut her off so where do you think sil put all that snark?  I’d bet on your sister. Your sister probably is not standing up to her wife, so she’s taking out her annoyance on you. Getting mad at you over little things could be because she feels she can’t get mad at wife. 

I’d get sister away from wife for an afternoon and have this very needed chat. Is she even still happy with her wife, what is really going on there. 
With any luck, sil will be gone and you can get your sister back.
This is not your fight. 

Don’t use a relationship with your kids and their aunt as an excuse. 
Your kids have other aunts and uncles. They won’t be scarred for life if they don’t see this one aunt. As long as they are told that mom and aunt are fighting and that’s why they don’t talk. No biggie. Happens to a lot of families. 

Your SIL is finding it hard that, in her mind, she did everything right and just how the parents wanted, got a great job, and yet her sister gets all the praise. ( and praised for something sil probably doesn’t think is such an accomplishment, but that’s whatever)

Let your SIL come around on her own time. Or not. 
The new baby doesn’t care if they meet auntie.
You can’t afford decent groceries, but there’s money for weed. 

Priorities man, if you can’t afford your bills then every single non essential expense goes away - that’s weed, cable, eating out, etc 

If she doesn’t like it, she can get a job and pay for those things.

Why would you clean more than once without being paid? 
It’s 4-5 hours that you’re over there. 

After 1 or 2 times she could have told him. 

At this point she’s using you. She’s using your labor to fund her vacation. 
GTFOH!  

Please stop cleaning for her. If she’s so bothered by his messiness she can clean his apt.
I’d you’re at the stage of a proposal you should be at the point where you can flat out ask her if she wants to give you an idea of what she likes, if she wants to give you a few pictures of exactly what she wants and you’ll choose from that or if she wants you to just pick out the ring on your own. 

The proposal will be a surprise as far as when and how.
It’s a phone call, he has the time. 

This is important to you. You need to see him supporting you in this. 

Tell him that.
Since your dad thinks the teacher was out of line, he should call her. 
And if your mom thinks she’s out of line, she should also call. 

Let them tell the teacher that your behavior isn’t out of line or worrisome and that he doesn’t appreciate her telling you it is or separating you from the class and to cut it out or he’ll be speaking with the admin of the school.
The very first time a partner hits me is the last time I would ever see them. Idc if it’s a man or woman doing the hitting. 

It will not stop. It will get worse. 
Get out now. Why would you want to be with someone who resorts to hitting when you’re having an argument.
I want to know what she says the reason is that she won’t get a job? 
Does she not realize you two cannot afford to live on your income? 

I’d also stop buying her any special food, wine and nicotine. I’m not saying not to buy vegetarian food, just not any specialty stuff. 
That is not your responsibility. 

Honestly, you’ve only been married 2 years, I’d cut my losses, split up and let her make her own way. She is not adding anything to your life at this point.
I thought the same thing! 

Like, what interviewer would even ask that question out of the blue? Why M of all the women out there? It makes no sense. 

The absolute only way I’d believe it is if the discussion somehow went to who would be a good model/ spokesperson for the line and since it is DM, ( based in the UK) they asked about M to somehow tie the article to the UK through H, the prince. 

And then of course, flip flop the quotes so it seemed as if the M question was asked first. 

Of course TW takes this as a win that a Rockefeller even knows who she is! 
She should have answered with - Who?
How long are you together?  And how old are you all? 

If it’s not very long maybe he just doesn’t think it’s that big of a deal. It’s a lot to meet the whole fam at once. 

So going to the baby birthday is his out.

Im not so sure that because his friend is a girl is as big a deal as you’re thinking it is. This girl is with the father of her child. I doubt she’s looking to make moves on your bf.
Your friend has Im sure tried to talk to her friend about this guy and it fell on deaf ears. 
There aren’t some magical words that are going to make her see the light now. 

So Julie can go be witness at this mess of a marriage, or she tells friend she wants nothing to do with it, but if she needs help getting away she’ll be there for her. And have Julie start saving money for that plane ticket.
What kind of guy doesn’t know how to cook a hamburger or a steak? 
Grilled chicken is stupid easy. How about a salad? 

I refuse to believe he only *knows* how to cook those three things. 

I wouldn’t order out just because of the expense, but when it’s your day to cook, make enough extra just for you to have it the next night. 

Or take a Sunday and make yourself 3 or 4 portioned meals that you can heat up for when he slaves away in the kitchen and makes pancakes again.
Oh no, you’ve misunderstood his concern 

Worrying about security to the spare means he’s really worried that he’ll be swept for recording devices and / or shadowed everywhere he goes to keep him in line. 😁

He has no fear for his personal safety, he knows no one cares enough to do him harm.
So what? At least he’ll have something to eat at home. 

And she shouldn’t be as stressed if she’s working so she won’t stress eat.
I’ll repeat what others have said-

Do not buy a house with someone who is not your spouse! 

Your gf wants to buy a house, get engaged, and have a wedding, all within the next few years. Oh and go on 1 or 2 big trips!! 
And your’e supposed to fund the majority of those endeavors. 

Must be nice to be her. 

You need to decide what YOU want. What is your priority? 

Is it a house? Then you buy it on your own. If it’s getting engaged and marrying? Then you buy a ring and ask. If it’s travel, then you plan that. 

But you have to tell your gf that her pressuring you is only going to make you rethink being with her. This isn’t the way partners go about things. 

See how she responds, but if she is reluctant then you know she’s looking at what she can get out of it. Not so much looking toward a life together. 

There will be other perfect houses, skip this one.
Well they shouldn’t have been wasting time trying to clear up a stream of errors, as it relates to M. 
It’s a ridiculous notion that above all else they felt the need to devote their time to that. 

Just let it go. Not every freakin little blip needs to or needed to be contradicted. 

That was the problem. They wanted so badly to make it look as if M was this perfect person. That wasn’t real then and it isn’t real now.
I like the idea that both of you on your journeys together. Great thought! He won’t feel so alone then. 

You’ve got this. One step at a time and you and him will get there.
Ok so NTA for not wanting to take total responsibility for your brother. 

Your parents tho… total ah’s. They cannot just decide they are done being parents.   That aside. 

You don’t say what mental capacity your bro has, so -
You need to explain to your bro that you are not equipped to handle being his caretaker and he needs to find whatever is going to make his life the best he can make it.  But it’s going to mean he has to work at it. No one else can do it for him. He is an adult now and a if a group home is the best place for him, that’s where he should be. The idea is to get him as self sufficient as possible. 

Mom must have some contacts that she has used in the past. Contact them, get bro evaluated to see exactly what his strengths and weaknesses are. Autism is a huge range, but he at the very least will need mh therapy. 
After that he may need some basic vocation training so he can get a basic job. 

Best of luck. It’s not easy, you’ll be overwhelmed at first, but once all the pieces are in place you and your bro will be better off.
I’m so glad I’m not the  only one who found the idea of him peeing too  loud to be bizarre. 

Couldn’t really care about any of the rest of it. I was just stuck on that.
No, not just anyone can go vote. 

You have to register to vote. 

Then you get ( or at least I did, but it was lots of years ago) a voter registration card in the mail. 
Depending on where you live you are assigned a specific place where you vote. You can only vote at that place because you will be on their voter roll ( the list of ppl registered to vote at that spot) 

So when you go to vote, you give them your name, they look you up in a book, you sign the book ( and they are supposed to make sure your signature matches what you signed when you first registered) and then you can vote.
INFO 

I need to know how old your brother is
So sit by your dad, even if he’s not conscious ( idk his state) and just talk. Say whatever comes to mind. Ramble. 
He will hear you and you’ll have no regrets, you will have told him everything you haven’t been able to say in the past. 

Hugs to you.
From your comment, I think it matters what he did during this fight that made you feel you had to leave. 
If you felt threatened it’s completely diff than if you were just done fighting, he wouldn’t stop, and wanted to just get some space. 

In any case, he’s just embarrassed, and even if some of your friends have reached out, he thinks others will hold this incident against him. So you tell him he either comes on Thursday or he doesn’t but he can’t be sad if you go. Seems he wants you to avoid these friends so he doesn’t look like the bad guy. 

Also I feel pretty strongly that you need at least one friend you can vent your problems to. That’s what they’re for. It’s ridiculous that you would never talk about him or your relationship with your friends. 
We all do it and don’t hold it over the partner. Its a way to get an objective opinion on what’s going on.
Very sorry for what you’re going through. 

I think the answer is very different for everyone. 

It will depend on what you already know. So for instance, was your dad military and never talked about it, do you want to know that. 
Did dad have a first wife and you’re curious. Why is he fighting with…, 

Or do you just want to hear that you turned out alright in your parents eyes. Are you doing ok, do they like your partner or kids. 

Maybe you want to make amends over an issue. 

Figure out what it is that you need or want to know and have those conversations.
Maybe your dad should tell your sister that. 
Not that I think it would do any good. 

She knew it was wrong and that’s why she never said anything to anyone. Even if she was having a reveal you’d think she’d have spoken to your mom about names, even just in passing conversation.
Look, you need to have a talk with Pam. 

Explain to her that you actually love this guy. And even tho you married - I’m not even sure why- for a lark, a joke, just for the trope of a Vegas marriage- that over the last year you guys realized you had more and are happy. 
But let her know you aren’t going to divorce just because she’s not happy you two are together. 

Ask why she is so upset. Is it because it’s *her* friend or did she want him, or what. Because she seems to be upset for no actual reason. Something else is going on with her.
During peri I had bleeding that lasted weeks also. 
That was pretty much my only symptom, but it lasted years- on and off. 
My doc prescribed micronized ( I think that’s it) progesterone. It stopped it. 

Then normal periods for a while and when it didn’t stop I was able to just call her and she’d call in another rx. 

Maybe ask if that might work for you?

I don’t want C to pony up one red cent! 

This is Harry’s burden to bear. She can have half of whatever he has and he can pay his own damn lawyers! 
And he can fight for custody on his own. If he gets full or half or visitation or none, oh well, he had those kids with her. 
C doesn’t have to worry about those kids being in the LOS, it is practically guaranteed they are never going to be anywhere near taking the throne. 

And if she wants to go and spill all his dirty little secrets, so be it. He deserves everything he gets.
Is this her first year in school? Maybe she is really stressed just getting used to it.  

How long are you together?  Maybe she’s just over this relationship. 

But the insults? Yeah I’d let her know she can think you’re joke isn’t funny but she can’t insult you. 

But by your own admission, you’re
clingy- she may have been ok with it in the past but as you both matured she might feel it’s too much. You’re both adults. You should be ok without constant contact all day long. 

Talk to her, tell her you feel she’s pulling away or not being as receptive and would appreciate it if she just owned up to what she’s thinking and feeling rather than you having to guess.
 NTA

what is wrong with your bf?  Even if this person likes you, they did nothing odd or creepy to you, so why does he care. 

I would tell the person what bf did and that it wasn’t you tho. Just to clear up the situation so this person doesn’t go on thinking you like them. 

Go ahead and end this. 
These games will never stop and your bf will never take accountability for anything he does.
Mainly because my whole family is here. 

Parents are getting older, my kids are here and I would never leave them. 

I don’t want to be hours and a flight away if there is an emergency. 

Plus, my life here is good.

Why is the bf not going to be in school? If they would both be home all day then no, I wouldn’t let her. 

I would have told her she can stay home on Friday and have a nice 3 day weekend. 

Please be aware that just as adults need a mental health day, so do kids. 

My kids were always allowed to stay home just because. Because sometimes they just need a break. Especially by HS. It can be mentally draining.
Seriously- it’s a month- 30 measly Days 

You are not in love. You are not sexually satisfied and you don’t want to wait so do what any one would

Break up and find someone who’s not a virgin and date them.

Amazing that at 30 yo you need to be told this.
It doesn’t matter if one of you is home for him now-  this marriage may not last. That’s the problem. 

How old are you guys? She seems immature. 

Your wife needs to figure out what it is she wants. Either her marriage or affirmation from others.  Because she cannot have both. 

Put a hold on the foster and have a heart to heart with your wife. 
She’s still talking to this guy which means she’s getting something from him that she isn’t fri you. And that’s not necessarily your fault- no one can be absolutely everything for another person.
The last few cruises I went on they lined up the boarding group, we had to put our bags on the floor and the sniffer dogs came by, so be careful. 

Idk what vacuum sealing does but just saying
And why does that not immediately scream that this guy is just looking for a wife- anyone will do. 
You are just way too naive to realize it
Hasn’t he been in trouble previously? 

How does he keep getting elected or how has no watchdog group been keeping a close eye on him.
I agree I hate the way it looks, even tho I currently have this look. Haha
I dont have very big roots showing but they’re there and I see it a lot more than anyone in my family notices. 

Brown to blonde isn’t hard to upkeep, but it has to be done very often and Im due. But I just got home from vacay so I scheduled it but it’s gonna be a few days. 

Also, depending on what process I have the brown can be made to almost blend into the blonde. So it’s not all flat blonde, but highlighted blonde with still some brown so it isn’t as obvious.
You’re only 25, there’s no shame in living at home. If not now, then when in your life would you ever be able to save as much as you can? You’re lucky that your salary affords you a chance to get yourself financially ahead. Why spend money unnecessarily. 

Your gf cares more about what your
money can do for her. 

She has said you two should have a lavish lifestyle and travel. But the thing is, she can’t afford to do that- only you can afford to finance her lavish lifestyle. 

I’d break up with her honestly, but you need to think about if you want a partner who has goals closer to your own. And she doesn’t. She thinks you’re boring unless you can lavish luxuries on her and it’s only going to get worse as you make more money. She’ll want bigger and better.
By your own chart it takes $95,000 just to start up a daycare. ( less if the contingency and working capital is lower)

So let’s say you magically find a benefactor for that money. 

Im not sure I understand how you’re going to lower the cost. Even if it’s not for profit, it needs to self sustain at some point. 
Being transparent in how the money is spent is all well and good, but it doesn’t make up for the fact that running a business takes money.
You could run the tightest budget, but there is an absolute bottom line needed to run. 

Teacher costs need to be in line with teacher salaries, especially that pre school is in a sense, a specialty. 
I proposed the admin being paid at the same rate of a teacher, so no excess bloat there. 
And at a modest $45,000/ year for each of those positions, we’re at $9,000/year per child. 

Ok, so we take a loss for a year or two,  We’ve only got about $40,000 contingency and capital. How long will that last? 

We add in older kids for a smaller ratio and increased income, that’s another teacher, but we have to get them to the center after school. Do we need a van or a bus? 
Maybe we add night or weekend baby sitting service for a small fee, we still have to pay an adult for that. 

We can ask for volunteers, older folks who are retired or moms that have their kids enrolled. They don’t add to the payroll. But they need to be bonded. 

Maybe you don’t have your own building, maybe utilize empty classrooms in a school or community center of the town. 

Im sorry, I feel like I’m missing something but am very intrigued to see a way for your idea to work.
So I think your idea sounds great in theory. 

But a quick search brought me to the 
staff/ child ratio for kids 2 1/2-4 is 1T for every 10 k’s 

So let’s assume a teacher salary of $45,000/year ( conservatively) 

That divides to $4500/year per child just to pay for a teacher. 

Add to that - at least one administrator,rent, insurance, supplies, and idk what else. 

Let’s say we pay the admin the same as the teacher, so we’re looking at $9000 per child before factoring in any other expenses. 

The average cost of daycare in nj is between $10-12,000 a year. 

So based on these numbers, I can’t see how you can run a childcare center for less than most parents are paying now. 
And even if you don’t take a salary to start, at some point you’re going to want or need to draw a salary. 

Now, I don’t know if the state has any programs that help with daycare costs, if so then maybe it’s doable?  

You might be better off getting a home based daycare license, and having less children, while also incorporating a learning atmosphere.

Maybe your friend is the boring one and he needs drunk you to make his party a success. 

Or you’re just really fun at parties, drunk or not and he just thinks you’re drunk because you are such fun and he’s too drunk to tell the difference. 

I would be slightly insulted by someone saying that, so go to the party, have a few but don’t get drunk and be your fun self.
NAH

You haven’t actually explained why you don’t want your H to take this job. Has it occurred to you that he has been out of sorts for 3 years and maybe your H feels like he needs to work. A lot of people get their self worth from working and contributing to the family. Plus you mention insurance, which if you don’t have is kind of important. 

How is his health now? Can he even handle this job? 

Why exactly do you not want him working? Is it his health or do you need him home with the child so you can grow your business, or do you just not want him gone for 2 weeks at a time because then you have to do it all? 
Does your business cover all of your bills or are you dipping into savings every month? It’s always better to have more savings than less. 

You need to find out why he wants this job, at this time. If he has legitimate reasons then maybe you should try to support him in this. If you need to, you can put your child in daycare while you work on your business. 
Will it be hard while he’s gone? Absolutely, but supporting our partners is part of the deal. He supported ( I don’t mean just monetarily) you when you wanted to start your business.
 Ok, I have to ask- what exactly is he doing for work? 
He’s in an awful rush for someone 
who is a spender. Why is he in such a rush? It’s been 6 years, he can wait another 2?  You’re both still so young. 

You say you have money saved for a house down payment, I can’t help but wonder if he sees you as his cash cow. Has he saved any money since he dropped out of school?

Sit down and reiterate to him that you have always said you will not be married until you have completed your schooling and have a stable job. 

Let him know this is what you want and him constantly bothering you when you are still in school is useless because even if you wanted to marry right now you wouldn’t. 

Im sure he’s a great guy but think long and hard if you, who from all you’ve said, sets a goal and works towards them, and achieves them, while he seems more like flitting from one to another thing based on his whims. 
You need to see how comparable you two are when you’re both out in the real world- rent, bills, chores, etc. you may find you want a guy who is more on your wavelength.
NTA

Who believes that you’re a fool if you learn from your own mistakes. 
Isn’t that the point- make mistake, learn from it, don’t do it again. 

Does she keep making the same mistake over and over again? 

In this case, her saying she knows she’s right and you’ll continue it at another time, just means she will harp on this until you agree with her and she can then gloat about it.
YTA

How has this conversation not come up in 3 years? 

Stop brow beating the poor kid. 
His mother has told you how she feels, maybe you should try listening to her. It is quite possible that you aren’t as all knowing as you think you are. 

I will say tho, one way to get kids in the habit of please and thank you is to just always say it yourself. 
They hear it and model it. It almost becomes rote to say it. ( kind of like amen at church). That’s my experience anyway.
It’s 3 months, you’re not officially bf/gf and he’s asking? telling?, strongly encouraging? you to get rid of something you’ve had from your childhood?  Nope. Not happening. 

Adults are allowed to have comfort things. Him saying he’s there to comfort you is weird to me. Like only he can do that for you. 

You keep that bear forever. And take him out when you need to.
You got this!  
Now, hope he’s a good kisser!
Okay. I can better see why you wouldn’t want her there. But she really won’t be able to outshine you at your own wedding. As long as she doesn’t get the dance, which is easily done. 
What else could she do? You let the photographer know to put her in her place, you get the band to ignore her requests. And you warn her she’ll be tossed if she gets out of hand. 

If you might want things to get better then ask sis if she’s be willing to go to therapy with you. 
Maybe an outside person explaining to her why her attitude is harmful to you may just make her take a back seat at your wedding. 

Or just don’t invite her, but that plays into her idea that you know she’s better than you and that’s why you don’t want her there. 

Good luck. Don’t stress too much, you have a year to figure it out.
How about at the end of the night when he drops you off at home, you can just flirtingly say something like, “ what? No good night kiss”?  

It will only be a teeny tiny moment of fear, but I guarantee you, he will kiss you good night.
YWNBTA, 


Im struggling to understand what is wrong between you and your sister. 
I understand SM being nicer to sis, but that’s not her doing anything wrong. She was a child at the time too. So I can understand you not having anything to do with dad and SM, but you got along well enough with sis to be a bridesmaid for her. 

Just so I understand tho, you don’t want her there because you think she’s going to somehow have a f/d dance with step dad at your wedding? 

Easily fixed, you tell the band they cannot under any circumstances take song requests and you also let SD know what she’s thinking and ask him to not dance with sis at all. If he understands the whole dynamic and realizes the place he has in your life, he should be willing to do that.
Thats what I was talking about! 

Put that on your tik tok, your insta, anywhere you use social media.
And I’ll add the Florida law has a rape exception also. 
But it has to reported. 

(You may be toxic, but that comment was not.)
How about compiling a list of birth control resources. 
Put it on Tik tok, Instagram, Twitter. 
Places younger  women might frequent. 
And fb for the older women. 

Take a diff approach and try to prevent an unwanted pregnancy instead of having to deal with it after the fact. 

And have a connection resources that connects women willing to fund bc for women who can’t afford it.
Well, the easy hard answer is to find a job in London and move there. 
You have a roommate now, so get one there. 

Or find a job in London and live in a suburb close enough to enjoy the city but less expensive. 

What kind of engineer are you?
This is what I always thought also. 

Just let me get up and walk off. Then the rest can deal with getting their bags. 

And while we’re revamping debark, can we just board the plane by rows? Starting at the back please. ( I’ll even let first or business board before me. They’re not the problem)
Find a Boy Scout troop in your area. 
They would be happy to have it. 
They do lots of camping and might have kids that don’t own gear. 

Elementary schools have Cub Scout troops, but Boy Scout troops usually aren’t run through a school, but if you
can get in touch with a cub troop they can put you in touch with a Boy Scout troop that they usually feed into.
Tomatoes. 

I could not stand the texture of the seeds. 
Even now, I won’t eat the seeds in the big tomatoes, I cut them out, but can handle the small cherry tomatoes.
I love the way he says it’ll never happen with you two because you aren’t going to have kids. As if that’s where he draws a line. Pretty convenient for a guy who doesn’t want kids. 

But what happens if he, for whatever reason, decides he’s not sexually attractive to you? 

Or what if you get sick and can’t have sex for a while?  Is it ok then for him to cheat? Because you know he just can’t go without!  

I feel like you are going to be doing anything you can to keep him from cheating- probably to your own detriment. And it won’t make a diff anyway. 

Im thinking he’s already cheating when you’re not there. He can’t possibly be expected to go without his sex needs being met for a whole month!  Gasp!  

If I was you I’d slow this relationship way down. If he wants to move to Canada, ok, but he’d be getting his own place. 

But I’m not you, so I’d get rid of this guy. I want my partner to go into a relationship with the absolute idea that he has found the person he wants to be with and not having pre conceived ideas of circumstances of when he’d cheat
11 hours non stop to Hawaii in economy. This was the smallest seat I’ve ever been in. 

I dropped my ear bud right in front of my seat and had to contort my body to reach for it. 
Im not a large person either. 

Made it 7 hours ok, but the last 4 were really really tough. 
And then had to do it again to get home. 
The whole family agrees that we’ll never do that again.
Im not in Texas but I’m not so sure there are specific parking lot laws. 

Drive slowly thru the lot. I think my shopping center has a 10 mph speed sign. 

Yes, please stop for pedestrians crossing in front of your car. The lane directly in front of the stores near me have stop signs. Usually close to each of the stores entrances/ exits. 

You don’t have to stop as soon as you see a person, but it really depends on how far away they are from you. If they’re like 2 stores away, you slow down and / or stop until they cross. 

I’d wait until the person was pretty close to the other side of the road before scooching past. Especially if they’re older or have children with them. Just so they feel safer. 

Better to be safer and drive slow or stop if you’re not sure.
NTA. I would not apologize for any of it, substance or tone. 

Your tone needed to be what it was to get the message across that he is no longer welcome to stay. Too bad if it upset him. 

you basically said what your mother has been unable to do on her own. 

He needs to get out. Your mom said she needs a break from him, so now she has it.
Wouldn’t the line be drawn by what are natural genetic advantages to a person? 

If one is just, as is said, naturally gifted in a sport, should they be not allowed to participate because it’s not “fair” to the other participants? 
Their genetic make up is basically what is making them what we would call, naturally gifted. 

But with trans women athletes, they have an unnatural advantage over women, due to their genetic make up as being born as men. 
Hormones may counteract some of this, but it is never going to completely reverse the effects of the genetic processes of male puberty on things like strength and muscle mass.
Are we talking during a marriage, or a dating situation? 

Why would you think that just because one person cheated you will never find another who won’t cheat?

If the cheating happened during a marriage, I would say take some time for yourself, don’t be in any rush to get into another relationship. Treat it like a death, you need time to grieve the loss, and when you feel ready then you can get back out there. 

If you were just dating, this shouldn’t be causing you so much angst that you’d be averse to ever dating again. 
This was one scummy person out of thousands you will meet in your life time. 

Millions of people cheat and as many get cheated on. It happens. We deal with it and get on with living. It’s not the end of the world.
Why are you letting him insult you? 
This is a person who loves you? Id hate to see him when he doesn’t like you!  

I suspect he wants you to do better so you will have more money to bail him out with. 

You know this, but you are doing just fine. You can pay your bills, support your kid, and really can buy whatever you want, if not right this minute but with some planning. 

Stop giving him money and do not move in with him- ever. You will be stuck paying for it by yourself.
After 7 years you’re finally getting tired of this?

I wouldn’t have lasted 7 days. 

Be honest with yourself here, he absolutely is not going to wake up one day and be secure enough that he will stop this behavior. 

So you either put up with it, or you break up. He’s way too insecure to have any middle ground.
First off, don’t change anything fundamentally “you” for anyone. 

Second, you said you’re studying for med school. So use all this extra free time to do just that. But get out at least for a bit every day. Take a walk, study in a park, coffee shop, anywhere else than where you live. 

Third, you’re young, but not a child. You started dating as a kid tho. Idk what you did that he thinks you hurt him so bad that he doesn’t want to date anymore, but it does not matter. This breakup is not totally your fault so stop thinking that way. There will be others you will date and break up with, use this as a lesson to not lose yourself to a partner. 

Fourth, get back in touch with the friends that you let fall to the side. If you did indeed lose them from studying too much they should understand. 

Fifth, stop studying so much. 
There is a point where it doesn’t actually help. Studying is for review, not for learning the material. 

This all will pass and be a distant memory you will look back on and wonder why you ever wanted him so badly to begin with.
Yup me too. 
They wanted to make it look like she was. 
And Harry lobbied for her but the palace said no way.
Then your wife had all the time in the world to pick him up from school and she should have. 
Plus your d was away and it’s a perfect time for some mom/ son bonding time. 

Your son is 13, he’s going into some crazy years. Your wife should take those rides to and from school as an opportunity to just talk to Ty about what’s going on in his life. And if that includes James, even better. 
They do say car rides are the best way to get kids to open up.
I think there’s no reason you should have known who was picking up Ty since I’m guessing your wife stays home with the kids and usually does the school runs. 

But if your wife is home, why is your 4 yo at grandmas for the last month? 

Since you had discussed not letting him have too much contact with your son, I think it was short sighted of your wife to allow him to pick the kids up for weeks. ( weeks!). 

I think for this instance you two need to figure out what to do together and tell Ty together. ( honestly, I think a good talk about what he says and where it’s said should be enough, what kind of punishment can you give for a kid saying stupid stuff, but whatever) 

But I also think you and wife should discuss that she’s going to need to dole out the discipline when the issue happens. And I’m not talking punishments, I’m talking correcting bad behavior when it’s not even so bad so that it doesn’t get bad. 
This isn’t 1950 where it’s wait until your father gets home.
Because people now feel like every day has to be a good one, a magical day where their partner makes them feel special at all times. 

Their lives have to be picture perfect, their partner the perfect one, the proposal and marriage have to be planned down to the last detail and one little bump just ruins the whole thing. It’s all so superficial. 

That is not reality. A lot of long relationships are quite mundane. But nobody wants to stay thru that to get to the next special moment. But the mundane makes the special that much more. 

Add to that the sense of entitlement it seems people have. Everyone cannot have the dream job and make a million dollars so they can buy the biggest house and the most expensive car. 

So people basically are unsatisfied with their own lives so they feel they have to jump from one person to the next looking for someone else to make their life satisfying. 

Married 30+ years, since our 20’s and it just works because we are ok with the highs and lows. We just take what comes and deal with it.
You sit back and take stock of what’s going on in your own life. 

Then you decide, am I going to let my life be dictated by others or am I going to take matters in my own hands. 

Leave the emotion out of it. No issue is ever solved by the heart, you need to use your head. 

In this instance, you get mad- 
I’d be thinking:
Who the heck does this person think they are to treat me badly when I’ve done nothing to deserve it. 
He’s obviously up to no good, I’m not gonna sit here and take it!  I’m out. He can do whatever he wants but I’m not sticking around and watching. 

And then you say that- loud and firm. This isn’t a discussion. It’s a decision. 
Its your decision.
Ok so you know exactly what kind of person he is. 

Do you think you deserve to be talked to in this way?
Do you think a partner has the right to demean you to get what he wants? 

Why are you still entertaining being involved with him. 

This is a person who has denied your existence to his family based on his religion. I’m gonna guess and say his religion probably would frown upon him asking for nudes to get off to.
That in itself is so disgustingly gross to me that I’d cut contact with him. He sees you as less than, and you have allowed yourself to believe it. 

Tell him to take a hike. Find a real man who will treat you with dignity and respect.
Have you ever met this guy? 
And by that I mean have you ever lived in the same place and actually dated and are long distance due to one of you needing to move?
You find STD meds and you didn’t ask what he was taking it for? 
did he willingly tell you he was going for an STD test?  And you didn’t ask him why he felt the need to? 
And he’s checking himself all night and again you didn’t ask what he was looking for? 

Do you two even talk to each other? 

Yeah, you know what’s going on. You guys have been together since you’re teens, it’s run it’s course.
I’ll be honest, I would not continue dating him. Drugs are a hard no for me. 

You say you’re ok with coke at a party, but really, it’s never going to stay at just parties. And he’s already tried heroin after 2 months. 

Im more curious tho about how he just picked up this little habit. Did he just wake up one day and say hey, think I’ll use coke today and see how it goes? 

If he’s addicted, it’s really really hard to break the addiction. He will relapse. 
He will lie. 
Are you prepared for this major upheaval in your life? The highs when he’s clean and the very low lows when he relapses. The in and out of rehab. 

I’d tell him he has to do this on his own for himself. When he’s clean, and has his life all back together then to give you a call and you can see what 
you want to do. 

Good luck. It’s hard to see someone you love struggle, but it’s his struggle, don’t make it yours.
So the story I just read, his lawyer argued he was mentally ill. 
No mention of being autistic, so that had no bearing on why he killed. 

Sorry, I agree with the judge. He should never see another day free. 

He was 20, so even though technically a minor, whatever law you mentioned shouldn’t apply to him as he must have been tried as an adult.
What’s to question? 
You’re a boy, you are/ were attracted to this person who presents as a girl. Therefore you are straight. 

Now this person says they’re a boy, but they still look like a girl, so you’re still attracted and still straight. 

Does this persons family know they think they’re a boy?
Did you ask them if they think they’re a boy, are they gay then, since they presumably like you and you’re also a boy. 

Still not going anywhere romantically. Just be friends.
Ok I have to ask-

Are you straight? And thought you were dating a girl? 

Or are you gay and thought you were dating a guy?  

If you’re straight then obviously you cannot date this person because they think they are a boy and you are not into boys. 

If you’re gay, then you can date this person because they think they’re a boy, —. except for the fact that they look like a girl and you aren’t attracted to girls. 

This is going nowhere romantically. 

Just be friends since you seem to get along so well. Then it won’t matter if they’re a boy or girl.
How old are you two? 
How is it that your salary is all of a sudden not enough? 

What did the two of you change?
Has Rose explained why she never told you about being pregnant? Otherwise it’s going to be a very awkward dinner. 

But I think you’re trying to do the right thing. It’s up to rose to realize it’s what her D wants.
Sorry but she knows the real reason she doesn’t want to have sex and it’s not stress or low self esteem 

She would have had to been super stressed every day for the past 5 years!  And really, a lot of people will use sex to combat stress. 

If she still has self esteem issues after being in a loving committed relationship for 5 years, then she’s got  therapist level issues that she needs to address. 

You two need to have an honest to a fault discussion about this. 

I’ll bet she’s probably more asexual than she will ever admit to you, because she’d be afraid of losing you. 
But you cannot sustain a relationship without honesty, especially on this subject.
Maybe just stop lying. 
Have a sit down and explain you are so close to being an adult and you have to start making choices for yourself. 
If they turn out to be bad, so be it. But at least you did it and learned from it. 

And idk how your schools work, but if you don’t know history or geography, how are you going to be allowed to actually graduate? There has to be some minimum grade you have to get. And if there is and you’re making it, just tell him that too.
Your BMR might be off if you’re using the same number from when you were 250 lbs. 

Recalculate it.
You do realize that your sole job is not to make him happy. 
Of course in a relationship, each person makes the other happy, but not from doing every whim the other has. 

Also, you are your bf’s first gf, from what you wrote he didn’t seem to have friends either, and didn’t leave the house much. 

He didn’t have the usual date around as a teen, figure out all the dating rituals, etc. 
idk how you two met or why he was finally able to connect with you and have a relationship. 
That might not bide well for the two of you as he may feel like he missed out on dating around, and sleeping around. (Plus, most first relationships do not work out long term - but those are usually had as a teen, which he didn’t.)
His idea of having threesomes may be his attempt to experience others without losing you. He’ll get to sleep with others. 
And having 2 permanent gf’s might be way of dating around. Hell have to navigate more than just one personality. 

Im probably reading too much into it,  but thats the first thought that came to mind.
I agree. Its sad almost. 
I buzz my H’a hair and I told him, When he has nothing but a horseshoe we have to think about shaving it. 

But I would not just not say anything. 

But who knows, maybe H’s happy with it. 🤷‍♀️
While I absolutely agree, it is monumentally stupid for a 17 yo to have a car loan, I suspect there was a lot more going on. 

OP says son wanted to live with mom almost full time so I suspect dad gave in to the car, if not more just to keep son happy and not hate him. 

And lets not forget mom probably had a hand in that decision also. Its not just dad.
He put money away for college and cars. Its not that the money he gave them to invest was going to be the only money they had for college. 

Some kids are spenders (and some are savers) and no matter how much talking, showing and giving advice, they will not change until they are faces with the consequences. 

Son can still go to college, he just doesn’t have the option of any college he got admitted to. His list shrinks due to money issues. 

Remember too that D is making up the diff between what the parents saved for them, which would be what they are willing to pay or can afford, and the actual cost out of her savings.
YTA. Massive 

Come on dad, as much as you are scared about what is happening with your wife, double that for your son. 

He is losing his mother!  The one person who has always always been there for him. 

So instead of coming together and trying to hold both of you up, you get mad because he didn’t clean his room. 
Really? How important is his room right this minute? 
Give him a break. 

And I’m sorry, but I don’t understand the significance of the hair. If someone could explain please.
The minute he TOLD you to delete a friend- for any reason- is the exact minute you should have broken up with him. 

When are young people going to understand this?  Its irrational, its jealousy, and its controlling.
I say let bf pick whoever he wants as best man. 

Maybe ask your bf why, if sb is such a bad person it would mean so much to him to be there. 

Is there more to the relationship between sb and bf that means so much to bf? Was sb good to him at a time in bf’s life when he needed someone? Was sb a mentor for bf? Something, anything? 
Then I would take that into consideration also. 

It just seems odd that sb is pretty much hated by everyone but your bf isn’t really seeing that, and I wonder why.
Bring back the hat and rename back to Hollywood studios. 
We still call it that anyway! 

We’ve been going since 94 and don’t even remember that hand sign. I had to look it up to see what it looked like. I don’t like it.
Then you’re going to have to remind her of the agreement to not be in the room while you work. 

Maybe include in that convo that her anxiety seems to be getting bad again and she should start getting a handle on it now before it gets bad enough that her school and work will suffer. Maybe suggest she start looking for a new job now. If she loses her job, or quits, will you be able to afford it?  Don’t wait until shes crippled with her anxiety to decide to address it.
At this point, just swap rooms with her. She can set up her school stuff in the br. 

This way if she wants to stay in bed all day she can. And if she wants to do her schoolwork she can also. 

It seems like shes going to either quit her job or get fired, so you might as well give her the bedroom now so when shes home all day, you wont be dealing with this every day.
Her motivation is to just hang on to you long enough for you to marry her. 
Then shes all set. 

Honestly, I would be embarrassed if my date showed up to a family thing so woefully underdressed, but only if I have already explained what the vibe of these parties are. Did you explain this to her? If you did and she still made no effort, that would be a big problem.
You didn’t pressure him into not telling his family, but you also only told him when you were 5 months along. 

Im sure he knew- how could he not, but it seems odd that you seemingly confirmed the pregnancy and was I’m guessing all excited, but you didn’t share it with him. (!did you share this news with anyone?) 
He didn’t get to have that surprise reveal from you and share the excitement. 

Im curious tho, what family traditions of his does he not agree with?
My dermo told me to just moisturize them. Like thats gonna help. 

I remember as a kid there used to be a commercial for “age spots”. I think it fades them?  

Im thinking of looking for something like that but I cannot remember that exact name tho.
I had to go back to make sure but 

You are 16!  You have years and years and years ahead of you to find that special person. 

Are you expecting to meet someone now that you will stay with forever?  Its not going to happen. Teen romances very rarely last. 

Your teen years are for figuring out all this dating stuff, so ask out any girl who seems to be nice, cute or have a same interest as you. 

And stop worrying so much, desperation is not attractive at all.
You don’t think you’re attracted to her so give it one more date. 

Don’t discount that you two could just be friends if you enjoy her company.
Here’s how i look at it, as long as my partner is just looking and not engaging with any of these people, especially if they don’t even live anywhere near us, i don’t have a problem with it. 

There are so many other people who could tempt my partner right where we live, that I really am not going to be jealous or worry about a picture on a screen. 

Its basically harmless. 
But thats just my personal feeling.
Pretty sure anyone who reads a newspaper, or had any form of SM knows about it and talked about it. 

We heard all about it, talked about it, speculated about it, waited for all the details to finally come out and ——-

We got a list of people who flew in a plane. 
Virginia Guiffree got her payday, Andrew is relegated to scum of the world, JE is dead and ghislaine is in jail. 

What more is there to say? 
No one who was kidnapped or trafficked has come out in public and accused anyone else.  (Im not even sure they named anyone in any kind of sealed legal documents.)
Sometimes relationships just run it’s course. She was 17 when you started, andnow shes an adult. 
She wants to do all those things that she missed out on that all her friends got to do while she just sat on the sideline and watched. 

I think its absolutely gross that she called you and basically told you she cheated on you and was planning on taking this random home. That alone would make me lose any feelings for this person. 

So don’t concentrate on what you lost, concentrate on the fact that she didn’t even have enough respect for you to have a conversation about the fact that she was doubting this relationship, and needing some time to decide if she still wants it. 

She doesn’t want you, she’ll go play around for a while and is expecting you to be there when the grass isn’t greener. Don’t be that guy. Block her on everything. You’re worth more than that.
Wait- 
the dad didn’t want one. 

What did the wife want? 

Cause the fact that her best friend wanted one and they had it is extremely bizarre to me.
Maybe its a good idea that his overbearing parents step in and actually get all of them on the right path. 

Even if he’s depressed, he seems to be able to do the farm work, he just starts much later than most farmers. 

But if he got to sleep at a decent time, he should be able to get started after he puts the kids on the bus. 

Talk to him and his parents. 
Im sure the parents know this whole situation has to change. And if they’re so overbearing, i cant really see how they let it get so out of hand. 

I don’t think you’re too involved, you care about his family and only want what’s best doe them.
I think you’re trying to get him to be more responsible about his farm and getting the work done, no? 

If that’s the case, just waking him up isn’t really going to help unless he stays up and does the work. Who is working his farm? 

I think you need to have a serious talk with him. 
If you guys were so close what happened? When did fam dinners stop? When did you stop working for him? 
You said the behavior changed a year ago, so what was it like prior to that? 

And where are the kids mother? Does she not see them at all, does she also just let them do whatever?  


He needs to get his kids on a better schedule, his 4 yo should not be up till all hours of the night- what is he thinking by allowing this? And his other 2 need more sleep than they are getting. 

Talk to him, explain your concerns. If you are as close as you say he might open up and explain what’s going on with him. 

Is it possible for you to talk with his parents about the kids schedule or the state of the farm?  Do his parents not see what is going on?
Why do you want to get past this?

He’s been doing this stuff for 6 years, what makes you think he’s going to stop?
See, here’s the thing as I see it-

Yes, she cheated. And that in itself would be a reason to stay separated and ultimately divorce. 

But you have to also realize that you weren’t a model partner to her either. ( you lost your job over drinking and I’m gonna assume when you drank you weren’t exactly a great husband to her) 

Now, I am absolutely not saying you drove her to cheat or am I excusing her cheating. 

Im saying that you two should both just cut your losses and split up. At this point there are just too many issues that neither of you will ever be able to forgive, forget or get over. 

Get some help for the drinking. Its no way to live. And her affair partner can worry if shell cheat on him, thats not your problem any more.
Thank you. 
Now I understand what ppl mean when they say it.
Can I ask what they nickel and dime you for?
I hear the words I’m reading in my head, but I actually read too fast and find I don’t retain what I read sometimes. 

So I have to purposely make myself read slower. And if I don’t understand what I read, I read it very slowly, out loud, pausing to make sure I’m getting it. 

I’m curious tho. Have you tried to purposely read faster? What happens? Do you retain the info?
I love that you know that much history of your family. 
Have you been back to Hungary to meet your relatives still in the village there?  

Those pics are so classic 50’s America.
I don’t necessarily have a problem with these materials being shipped, they have to be shipped somehow, but I’d like the rail companies to have an emergency response team that is always ready to jump right in if something were to happen. 

An approved, maybe regulated plan, from outside the company preferably.
Good job on the script. That way nothing gets taken out of context and you say all that needs to be said. 

And I never meant to imply anything dangerous or reckless about the weed as far as the baby goes, just saying it’s not the best in the long run for his problem.
Ah, big ones. 
I searched quick but didn’t find anything helpful. 

So I’d say go to the ER, but I’d tell them they passed out the same day, that way it’s an emergency and they have to treat. 

I’m sorry, I hope your relative will be ok.
While I agree you cannot make him go and get help, I would have one more conversation about it. 

Frame it as this- we have a child, we need to make sure we are at our best for them. If you won’t get help for yourself, at least do it for our child. It’s not healthy that your child will grow up seeing dad have a panic attack every day. And it’s not healthy to self medicate with marijuana, I’ve got nothing against it, it just ultimately isn’t going to solve his problem, it’s just pushing it down the road. 

Tell him you’ll go with him to any and all appointments until he finds a dr or therapist he likes. ( I’d ask friends, neighbors,anyone for a recommendation) and I’d call and explain his apprehension and ask them to please use kid gloves with him.
What kind of work up did the dr recommend? 
I don’t know about the ER, but I’d be surprised if they would do a work up there. I’m assuming a work up would be like a check up with labs? 

I found this tho-

https://www.needhelppayingbills.com/html/middlesex_county_clinics.html

Specifically look at the medical walk in and wellness in metuchen. 
It seems they are free and will do a check up, which usually involves lab work. Idk how the lab work would be billed tho. Maybe give them a call and ask. Explain what happened and what the dr said.
We need to know why your son has seemingly cut contact with you until he needs you to sign over the car. 

Depending on why the no contact, I’m not so sure I’d sign over the car since you had to pay off his sallie Mae loan. 
Are you sure he’s paying off his car? You might get stuck with that too. 

But I also agree I would never, ever sign a blank document. If you’re going to sign it over I’d make sure to fill it out first. You should know all then I do it’s asking for. And take and keep a copy of the filled out form.
This is what I did. And I am absolutely NO expert by any stretch. But this will at least help you to get an idea of how to get started. 

Go here. 

https://tdeecalculator.net/

This will give you an idea of how many calories you need to maintain your weight. 
Then subtract 25% of that amount and aim to eat that each day. 

Get a food scale to weigh everything. 

Then I just planned out what to eat for B,L, and dinner for the next 2 or 3 days. I went shopping so I had everything I needed to stick with it. 

I very rarely eat breakfast, just coffee, but I almost always had a huge salad for lunch with tomato, olives, carrot, cucumber and a protein. The protein was either left over chicken from the night before or even just a can of tuna ( in water). I did add dressing but a low cal and never more than 2 tbspns. 
Dinner was 3 or 4 oz of chicken, fish or beef and vegetables. And a small salad. Lots of vegs. 
And water was the only thing I drank. Lots and lots of water. 

Snacks were portioned out nuts or a string cheese or just plain carrots. 
Have a glass of water before you snack to see if you really want to snack , or if you just wanted something. 

It seems daunting at first but you will get used to it pretty quickly. 

But weigh everything!  I even weighed out teeny amounts of carrot and celery for my salad- a lot of times it ended up being like 6 calories but I still counted it. 

You can do this, just don’t try to be so militant crazy to start because you won’t stick with it. It’s ok to be over your calories when you start, but you want to be over by 50, not 500!
I would cruise alone, but make sure to go to the solo traveler meet up on the ship.

Go meet other solos, these would be the people you can hang around with on that sailing, and you might get lucky and find one or two who you get along with and can plan future trips with. 

I wouldn’t trust rooming with a random stranger.
I’m a little confused about Justin. 

He’s not the baby’s dad, we know that. 
You met him when you both lived in diff states and somehow he just decided he would be “dad” and you allowed that? 
Then you break up and he still wants to be dad? Even going as far as wanting to help with daycare? 
Have you even met this person? Have you ever lived in the same place? 
All of this seems really really odd. 

You broke up, he wasn’t in your life or your sons, for all that long as a dad figure, so why would you even entertain the idea of him being a father figure to your son? 

Now, Brian on the other hand, do you 
know for a fact that he is the father?  

Because, honestly, it might be better for your son if he’s not.  The in/ out is ultimately going to leave your child feeling not enough. He doesn’t support the child, and you seem to be doing ok without him. 

And now Greg, I would have him tested to see if he’s actually your sons dad. 
Even if you don’t want any support from him and even if he doesn’t want anything to do with his child, it’s better for everyone involved to have a definitive answer to this question. 

If he is, then you can cut Brian out all together because really, who needs the problems he comes with? He’s out of state, has 2 other kids, is in and out on a whim and doesn’t pay any support. 

In short
- find out who the father actually is, then decide if you want to go for support and visitation 
- don’t have some random out of town guy playing dad to your son
- live your life, raise your son and don’t be so quick to want to have a daddy for him.
YTA
Show some respect for your grandfather, and your grandmother. 

Is this really something you want to even have an argument with your family about, at this time? 
Everyone’s stressed, on edge, and it’s going to become about more than what it actually is. 

This is not the time or place for you to make this about you, your clothing choices over the years, or what your family thinks about your choices. 

Either wear the dress pants or bring them and change into them.
Why are you even entertaining anything she says? 

After telling her you’re done, this is not working for you anymore, wish her well and hang up!  
Block her everywhere and get on with your life. 

She lives 4 hrs away from you, it’s not like she’s gonna go around town talking about you or making your life miserable. 

It’s not really that hard.
This has been my fear forever! 

Also, not just being uncovered, but I could never even have my feet hang off the bed. 

I do not have any idea how people sleep with no covers, not even a sheet. Nope! I need an actual comforter even in the summer.
NTA. at all. 

This is a lovely thing to do with your niece(s). 
And especially since it’s the younger ones first time, it should be just the 4 of you. 

This is something you and your sister can do forever with the girls and they will love it. 

I’m sure your sil does things with her sibs and all the kids, they don’t have to infringe on your day.
Ok so wait, I’m confused- 
The general tip box welfare thing, what exactly is this? 

Are you saying the gratuities that we all pay is not going to the crew?
I’ve read it’s room steward and the other positions that guests don’t see like cooks, laundry, etc., workers who don’t normally interact with guests. 

I always pay mine and give the steward extra, but I’d like to know that the behind the scenes people are getting their cut. 

So if we don’t pay it, the cook and laundry people will still get their same salary, but the company will then be shouldering the burden of that whole amount ( which they should anyway) instead of being supplemented by guests? 

If that’s the case, I’m taking my tips off and will try to find a way to funnel $ to those people, and of course tip the steward his “cut” plus my extra. 

Am I understanding this correctly?
NAH 
But he cannot always respond the way you want or need. He doesn’t know what you want him to do or what you need. 

Here’s the thing tho, 
You’ve been together since you were 15 and both of you are going to go off to college and will have a whole host of new experiences and meet new people. Not just him. 

Not to be mean, but I would be very surprised if one of you, if not both of you get to college and realize you don’t want to be tied down to someone who is not part of your every day. It could very well be you deciding there’s someone else out there that you’d like to get to know. 

It happens. And it should happen. You both need to be free to grow and mature. 

The summer before college is a weird time, both of you are going to be anxious, nervous about going away, being on your own for the first time, can you handle it, will you find friends, will you be able to keep up with classes, etc. 
So don’t stress about hypothetical things when you have enough real things that will stress you out.
We went twice in one day and my H was “that guy” both times! 
The rest of us loved it, he was not amused. 🤣
NTA for not giving a gift. 

It’s costing you a lot to go, and she did say it’s understandable, so believe her. 

Before I say more tho, what kind of reception has no alcohol and no food? What exactly is everyone supposed to do during the “party” part of the wedding reception? 

But there’s a few things you say that come off as concerning:

-why do you care that they are married but having the celebration later? Maybe they did it for tax purposes, for religious reasons, or just because they felt like it. Not your business 

-Your thought that she won’t be giving you a gift when you get married next year is bizarre. They are almost 10 yrs younger than you and your bf, how much of a gift were you actually expecting from them?

-not having alcohol at the wedding isn’t odd at all really. Plenty of people make that choice. 

Im getting weird vibes as if you’re taking her wedding as a slight against you personally somehow. 
She’s having her celebration before yours even tho you’ve been engaged longer, she picked the worst time according to your schedule and her wedding is not what you deem acceptable. 
Her wedding really has nothing to do with you, your bf, or anyone else. 

you understandably said it’s costing you a lot to go and how it’s really stretching the budget, but you’ve already got 2 weddings you’re going to next year, undoubtably your friends or fam, and I can see how you’d say well those were planned and hers was a quickie thing that came up and wasn’t really budgeted for, but this is the family you are going to marry into, so I’d stretch that budget, go with a smile and don’t burn bridges before you’ve even been accepted into the family. 

And it’s not your place to fight your bf’s family battles. If he’s always put last, it’s up to him to fix it or not. I’m still not sure what the parents or grands having money has anything to do with bf being put last tho.
I think it comes from our education system. 
Most people graduate HS at 17-18 and years back it was pretty common to get married to your hs sweetheart. 

So if you’re married at 18, you have to be allowed to do all the adult things- job, mortgage, kids, etc. 

And I agree with the other poster, by 18 you’ve seen and heard enough to be able to make wise choices. Why some might not is for the same reasons why a 25 or 35 or any other age might not.
I’m going to assume you’re still somewhat young. 

Ignoring him isn’t the way to go about this or any other issue or problem that comes up. 

Use your words- you think he was joking, but you’re not sure, so you ignore him for 15 min but then after that amount of time you what? Just start engaging with him again as if nothing happened? 
Then what was the actual point of not talking to him in the first place. 

Look, if he says something and you aren’t sure if it’s an insult or a joke, you have two ways to handle this-

- Might be a joke? Answer back with a joke- “ you’re free to leave at any time, there’s the door” and see what he says. He probably would answer back with something like he just hates shopping, that’s like the hundredth store we’ve been in, etc. 
you banter back and forth a few times and it’s over. 

- you think it’s insulting? Then you tell him, “ hey that hurt, what’s the problem”? And he explains the exact same thing as above, he’s just frustrated being in the mall. 

Learn now how to communicate, it will save you tons of drama in the future.
Think back to every place you have been since you last remember seeing it on the counter. 
Like literally sit down, close your eyes and go back thru every single thing you’ve done. 

Check every outfit you wore, every car you were in, every couch you sat on, every backpack or pocketbook you used. 
Were you studying at any time, check in your books. 
Did you pack a carry on or travel bag, check the outside pockets.
It’s only been 5 months- why are you so desperate to keep this guy? 

He treats you horribly and you keep going back for more. 

Block him everywhere, stay single for a bit, I think you need to feel better about yourself before you get involved with anyone.
Check out NCL. ( I don’t know anything about any other lines as I haven’t sailed them, sorry) 

they have a deal now that the second person flies free. But all the sailings in Oct are at least 9 days. 

You can do a complete mock booking, so you’ll see the total cost of the trip with the air included. 
The least expensive cabin will be an inside. 
I did a mock booking, 9 day, Southampton but ending in Lisbon. 
Inside cabin for 2, their free at sea promo, ( look it up if you don’t know what that is) with air round trip from Chicago ( picked a middle of the USA airport) and transfers from airport to ship and ship back to airport. 
Total: $3792.46

Do a lot of research. Understand what you are getting for that price. Look at the ship and decide if it has the amenities you would like. 

Booking air thru the cruise line means you get the cheapest flight they can get. Times might not be ideal. I suggest paying for a 1 or 2 day deviation so you’re in the UK early in case of flight delays. 

Check out Costco travel also. 
If you have a cc with miles see if you can use them for flights and then you can shop around for travel agent deals also. ( but if you book thru a 3 rd party travel agent just know that the cruise line will not speak to you about anything to do with the booking because you technically are not the one who booked it.) 

I hope this helps.
I agree so much with this. 

I don’t like Mexican food all that much, but I have never even tried refried beans. 
Just the look of it, never mind the smell makes me gag.
NTA
It’s pretty standard procedure which if he’s a regular he would know. 

Anyway, would it help if you mentioned it to the dr.? 
I would like to think the dr doesn’t want him talking to his staff the way he did.
You don’t say how long you are together. 

In my opinion, this is in no way cheating. 

What happened was you saw a very attractive person and had a physical response to the level of attractiveness. 
It happens. Whatever this guy looked like just hit your senses in a certain way. 

It doesn’t mean you don’t find your bf attractive, doesn’t mean you don’t like or love him. 

I wouldn’t say a word to bf. All that will do is start drama of “you dont find me attractive, you don’t want to be with me, you want him”. 
Honestly it’s just not worth it. 
Are you bored that you’re not fighting anymore, cause this feels like you’re looking for more things to fight about. 

You guys are really young, but if you are under the misguided idea that once you love someone, you should never find any other person attractive, you’re going to find that is just not the case. 
If you think your bf does not find any other girls attractive, you’re kidding yourself.


Edit to add:
Or you just were fed up with fighting with your bf and your subconscious is telling you to break up.
 NTA

You didn’t say anything even slightly upsetting. 

the fact of the matter is that Maddie is not your mothers D and the heirlooms are being passed down through your mothers family. 

Maddie might have a case to be upset if these heirlooms were passed down thru your dads family, but they are not. 

Maddie is 17, she knows how this stuff works.
So you guys haven’t been together all that long. 
Is there any truth to him saying if it wasn’t for the baby you wouldn’t be together?  Or was he just saying that to hurt you because you hurt him? 

Is his need to get rich now a new thing? Maybe he’s stressing about what he thinks should be his role as provider for the family, now with the baby on the way. 

The thing is, starting his own business is going to take all of his time to get going. When is he gonna have time to be a dad? Get to know his baby? Give you a break from work and parenthood? 

Your text was a bit rough, but the basic message needed to be said. 
You should have had a serious talk about what you see the future like. 

Be the bigger person and go talk to him. Get this settled or it’ll keep coming up again and again.
How long are you two together?
Do they have a registry? 

If I could afford it, for sibs I’d go with something big, car seat, stroller, high chair, etc. 

If I couldn’t afford that or I’m a younger sib who doesn’t work yet or still in school, I’d get a baby bath and fill it with bath supplies- towels, shampoo, baby wash, rubber ducky. 

And diapers!  They’ll need lots of diapers. (
But not newborn size, go one or two sizes up, everyone gets newborn and they grow out of them pretty quick)
Sorry, this is gonna come off as slightly mean, but, what exactly are you bringing to the table?

You work when you’re not sleeping most of the day due to your anxiety and depression, you have no hobbies, not that I think it’s a big deal, but it could make you you seem to be kind of boring. 

You don’t like sex, but are willing if the guy is successful enough- frankly, that is so gross. Because you seem to think it’s a transaction- take me out, buy me things and I’ll lay back and suffer while you do your thing. 

yet you’re looking for a guy, who, by your own admission seemingly has everything going for him. Oh and this guy has to put you on a pedestal. 

Ask yourself why this imaginary wish list guy would want to be with you? 

You’re going about this all wrong. 

Relationships take time, and you have to put in the time. Stop looking for prince charming and find your own prince, one who melds into your life, not one who comes ready made with a lifestyle that you think you deserve. 
Build that lifestyle together. 

Just something to think about.

I’m not really sure why location would have anything to do with laundering clothes, but I’ll give some ideas. 

I’m assuming you have a washing machine. 

You can try just adding regular laundry bleach to your wash. 

For stains, best thing I’ve found is oxyclean. 
I wet the garment, put a little of the powder on the stain and work it into a sort of paste. Let it be for a bit, then launder it. I add about a half scoop into the washing machine along with whatever detergent I use. 

I have also soaked generally dingy whites in hot water and the oxyclean. 
I try to get the oxy to dissolve, add the garment, leave overnight and then launder. 

If you don’t have a washing machine, use your bathtub.
I’m very late to the party, but with regards to him mentioning his age, it may be that he’s saying that if you have met, he may not remember it. 

I think based off your LOR, which he read, this prof probably found something in it that peaked his interest in you - was there any mention of a project you worked on with the student, maybe he is just interested in your particular field, maybe he just likes to meet the up and coming people in the field. 

Either way, I think it might turn out to be a very interesting lunch. Think of the stories he could tell you from years back in regards to your field of study. 
(I had an older prof of paleontology who had the most fascinating stories of his field work)

If you do end up meeting him, can you update us please?
NTA. 

If she’s your friend she would already know that you have been trying to have a baby for a few years. 

Does she really think you would plan to be pregnant or have had a baby right around her wedding on purpose?  

She’s literally being a bitch right now. 
And the worse part for me is that the other bridesmaids felt the need to text you. Who the hell do these women think they are? Your pregnancy is none of their or anybody else’s business. 

They can all just fuck right off!  I wouldn’t even go, and even better, I wouldn’t even tell her I’m not showing up.
What a wonderful thing to do. 

I’m sure that boy was thrilled!  

Well done!
NTA

Has it occurred to your H that maybe his dad doesn’t want to move? 

It’s quite normal for fil to be sad and unhappy. He just lost his lifelong spouse. 

But it may be that being in their home brings him some amount of comfort? 
(It did for my mil and my stepdad)

Your H and his dad just have to go through the grieving process. It may take some time, but they will get to where they are back to a new normal. 
It takes time. There is no rushing it. 

Your H doesn’t want to hear it now, but you’re absolutely right- his dad should not be making any major decisions this soon.
Sorry but if mom has issues and the child, who is still very young isn’t in school and is spending 24 hrs with an unstable person, then yes, it’s much safer and better for the well-being of the child to be placed elsewhere until mom can get the help she needs. 

It’s not like the 7 yo can raise a red flag for himself. 

Better they make the call and a trained impartial person can go and assess if all is ok. 

If it is, then great!  Everything goes back to the way it is. 

But if it’s not? Then both mom and child get the help they need.
Im not saying you should go, but here’s a thought. 

You should ask him to find out what the schedule actually is surrounding the wedding. What activities does he have to be there for if any. 

Have him ask the groom what the seating is like. Sometimes the bridal party is sat at one table together with their dates. Or is there a get together prior to the wedding for the bridal party and their dates, you’ll meet the other plus ones, who if you’re not seated with your bf you’ll be with the other plus ones, but you’ll have already met them. 

I can’t imagine there’s something wedding related every day for a week. 

If there’s a few days he needs to do wedding things, then you visit your family. If there’s days he’s free then you guys can explore the city together.
I only buy audiobooks for books that I have read. 
I put them on when cleaning or driving, or cooking, or on a Bluetooth when I shower. 

It’s my background so I don’t have to really listen so intently to get the story since I already know it, if that makes sense. 

If I listen to an audiobook that is new to me, I wouldn’t be able to do anything else because I’d have to pay attention to what’s going on in the story.
If your D stayed home from may to Dec, did she even have any income that would require her to file income taxes. 

Call me crazy, but if she didn’t  pay any income tax, because she didn’t work and stayed home with her kid while also pregnant, there’s no way she can get a refund. 

I think you’re fine but I’d check to see what would happen if she also files, and you both get audited, what will you need to show to prove you, and not her supported this child.

Keep the refund. You earned it.
I had read about this before, so here’s the answer. 

https://medtegrity.us/blog/history-of-baby-blankets/

I loved those blankets. Took one home with each child.
When you feel it’s the right time, and the other person feels it’s the right time. 

But please, pay attention to what your kids think and say about this person. 
If they have any apprehension at all about you pairing up, or spending time with your partner, take a step back and introduce very slowly. 

In other words, don’t force your kids to accept this person, it will never work in the long term.
Trust me, I know more about planning than I ever thought I would need to! 😁

Just some people find it off putting in the beginning, until they realize how good it can be! 

And you’re right, about dates when dating.
Here’s a thought. It takes some planning but it might help 

Pick a night you’d be ok having sex, when he comes home, or even during the day, let him know sex is on the table for early evening. I’ll guess he’d shower, since that’s his usual, and while you finish getting dinner ready, have him hang out in the kitchen with you. Or he cooks, whoever does whatever. 

He should, since he knows what’s coming, be flirty and affectionate with you, and since you need that romancing it’ll set the tone. 

Then by a decent hour you guys have your fun, he’s happy, you’re happy, and then you can do your night routine and get to bed at a decent time to get enough sleep. ( and he can play his games while you’re having a bath, if he still want to play afterwards) 

I get that planning sexy time seems, idk, weird? Strange? But sometimes it’s just what needs to happen.
Sorry, but as someone who has a hard line at cheating, he is totally justified in not wanting anything to do with you. 
That’s my one and done. 

You lost this good one, learn from that. 

now figure out why you allow yourself to get so trashed when you go out. He didn’t get you smashed, you allowed that to happen.
You met this guy for 1 month.

He went back home way across the planet. 

Did you really think he’s going to want to be in an exclusive long distance texting relationship with you?  

Why would you even want that? 

The smartest thing you did was cut him off- for both of you. Now you can both find someone that you can have a real relationship with.
YTA. 

Not only a huge AH, but you’re insane to boot! 

Who the hell do you think you are asking your supposed friends to wake up early to practice hair and make up for your stupid wedding? 

These are grown ass woman who I am sure know how to do their hair and make up. 

They don’t need to practice, and they don’t have to make any sacrifices for your wedding. 

Leave them alone or you won’t have any friends.
No
Does Hayley have any friends?  It may be that she doesn’t have anyone else to talk to, vent to, or ask advice of. If not she needs to get out there and meet other woman or ideally, other moms.  

So she relies on the only people she knows. 

Does she even want to live in Switzerland? She’s only been there less than a year no? 

I’d maybe have a talk with her and explain that you and your mom cannot be the ones to solve her marriage problems. 
It’s does no good to have the whole family involved in personal matters. 
She needs to talk to her H about these things. 

If she thinks it’s bad enough they can get some counseling. (Be prepared with a counseling service, because she’ll undoubtedly have no clue where to go) 

I wouldn’t write her off just yet, she’s had a lot of changes in a short amount of time. She might feel a bit like a fish out of water and she’s floundering.
Barely having arguments just isn’t a good enough basis for moving so fast. 

You barely know this woman. It takes longer than 6 mo to really get to know someone.  Is her behavior in this instance a taste of what’s to come?  Idk, and neither do you. 

Add to that she MADE you cut out your best woman friend. That alone tells me she’s a lot more controlling than you are allowing yourself to admit. 

Look, I’m just saying slow things down- a lot. 

You say you both came out of abusive and toxic relationships, so I have to wonder if you would recognize a healthy one. You’re so used to a bad one, those old familiar patterns may seem “normal” to you.
You’ve been together 6 mo and are already engaged 

She has a best male friend you have never met 

accused you of cheating, after dinner and took a pic of your lips???

 gave you the silent treatment and won’t even look at you 

This isn’t the happily ever after you think it is.
It’s going to take her a long time to undo what’s been ingrained in her mindset for so long. But good for her for getting help. 

Maybe you can ask the therapist if it would be ok for you to put some small decisions back on her, but only if the therapist says it’s ok. 
Small ones, like what other brand to buy. Have a code word or phrase when she calls and you can answer with something like, “ I trust you to make the decision, there is no wrong choice, so feel free to decide”. 
It validates her while also encouraging her to make these small decisions. 

Now of course you’re not going to tell her if the brand or product or choice she made is wrong. You’re going to have to just go with it, even if you don’t like it. That’s a sure fire way to set her back. 

She will see that she doesn’t have to defer to you for everything and there are no adverse consequences to that.
The problem with H’s mental health issues is that he hasn’t actually had much legitimate help for it. 

He went to a real therapist for a bit,( anybody know why he stopped?)
but after that he went on a crusade of trying to heal himself through some very unconventional means. 

He doesn’t want to actually get better - he thinks he’s perfectly healthy. He has it all figured out. 

Didn’t he say something like ( paraphrasing here) he wanted the whole fam to get therapy so they could understand that THEY are the problem. They need to be made to see that they are the bad guys, they treated his wife wrong, they didn’t protect them ( whatever the f that means), they drove them out of the fam, they made it untenable for them to stay, etc, etc, etc. 
As if him and the witch weren’t culpable at all. 

He is just so out of touch with reality.
She probably didn’t remember any of it and her bf had to tell her how she acted. 

She’s mortified about her behavior and is probably avoiding having to talk to you, especially after she read your text. 

Maybe give her another day or two and text her again. Just ask how she’s doing and see if she answers you. 

I wonder if the bf actually put her out.
I saw a woman win over 1 million on a wheel of fortune game in Atlantic City!

She was seriously shocked. She said she doesn’t usually gamble, had no idea what to do, just hit max bet.
I wouldn’t hug. When you’re introduced just give a wave and say hi, it’s not to meet you.  

Since you haven’t been around kids, just think of them as small people. 
You must have some idea what they like from their dad, so ask about those. 

And don’t disparage anything they say. You might not like snakes but the kid has a pet snake for example. You don’t say snakes are gross, you say I’ve never been around a snake and you talk about feeding it and caring for it, etc. 

Just be yourself, don’t be too quiet, but don’t take over the conversation either. 

Don’t rush, this is only step one, slow and steady is the best way to go.
Hawaii. 

Never had a huge interest in going, but we did and it was beautiful. 
Lots to see and do, or you can just enjoy the beach. 

It’s also kind of expensive, so a honeymoon splurge is justified.
We’re retired. 

It’s only that organized out of necessity really. 

A couple years ago, they went off in the middle of the night, of course no fire but we couldn’t get them to stop so had to get the fire dept out. 

After that my H started putting the install dates on them and this last episode we figured since the batteries were being changed might as well date them too. 
And they’re only hard wired cause we had an addition put on years ago and had to bring it all up to code.
We change ours every daylight savings time. But we did it about a month ago. 

Mine are hard wired, and went off one night. But it stopped. And then went off again. ( not the beep, the actual, fire, fire!)

So after realizing there’s no fire we set out to figure out which detector was faulty. 

In that process, we changed every battery, and a few of the older detectors. 

Of course the last one we had to check was the one that was faulty. This detector was 10 years old!  None of the other ones in the whole house were as old. (Most were about 3 years old, have no idea why we never changed out this one) 

So now every detector has a date written on it when it was installed and every battery also has the date we replaced them. 

Oh and detectors usually only have a lifespan of 10 years.
Seriously. It’s been 2 years and she’s still not over her ex? 

It’s not like she’s just pining away secretly, she’s  actively trying to meet up with him. 

Do you want to be her placeholder until this guy decides he wants her back and she dumps you? 

Im sure there’s someone out there who actually wants to be with you cause this girl isn’t it.
 Just to mention, they could have had the cruise line book them up to two days prior to embark date. NCL has that option. 

Of course that means they have to have more days off and pay for hotels and meals for those days, so a lot of people can’t do that, or just don’t want to. 

Personally, I would never fly in on day of embark. Especially with an international flight. It’s just too risky. 

And travel insurance is great for this scenario, but the dissapointment of missing my vacation needs to be taken into consideration also.
Because it doesn’t make any sense. 

Fed student loans were never going to cover the full cost of college. 
The maximum loan that can be taken out thru the govt is $31,000, divided over 4 years. 

In the big picture, this isn’t a crippling amount, people end up with huge debt because they then go out and get private loans for the balance. (Or their parents take out parent loans with the agreement that the student pay it back)


So the govt makes the loan, the student graduates and pays back the loan with interest. 

The act of repaying this loan plus the interest is then used to fund the next batch of students that need them. 

Cancelling $10,000, or $20,000 for pell grant recipients of loans is essentially taking away some of the ability of this loan program to fund itself. 
So that means the govt, - essentially every taxpayer- is paying for this relief.

I have a definite problem with continuing a program that  basically has no funding source other than more spending. 

The govt is making loans to incoming freshman for sept of this year. Where is that money coming from?  

So we cancel some amount now, but what about graduates in 2024 and beyond? Do they get some relief too? 

Look, I get the economy isn’t great, I have 3 kids that have this debt. 

How about we ensure that students who took these loans satisfy their legal obligation? They may have a few tough years as they begin their careers and life, but it isn’t like every other generation hasn’t had mostly the same exact scenario. 

Of course some had it better at times, but that is simply because of what was happening at the time, and the economy and jobs and salaries all have ups and downs.
Oh yeah, you’re fine then. 
I thought it was a not seeing her ever thing. 

But rethink the wedding. Mostly so your H doesn’t have to go alone, and he doesn’t get all the Q’s about where you are from everyone. (unless he doesn’t care, then you’re good)

Im pretty sure she’s the type that won’t even notice you’re there- too busy being fawned over by her bridesmaids, or yelling at the caterer.
While I agree she sounds unreasonable,(I’m trying to be nice),
The fact is that she is marrying into your husbands family. 

Which means whether you want to associate with her or not, there are going to be times when you will be around her. Think holidays, in-law bdays, children bdays, family weddings( not hers), funerals, etc. 

So you have to decide how you’re going to navigate all this without having the rest of the family get on your case for it. 

The wedding- you and H should go, it’s his bro. Your parents should decline. ( idk why they would even want to go). They babysit for you that night. 

The shower- you decline, and just say you’re working that weekend. They don’t need to know it’s on call or whatever. 

Any other occasions, you go, your in-laws are not going to take kindly to never seeing their son on a holiday because you don’t like sil, and maybe your H wants to spend some time with his parents. 
You say hi and bye and be civil. 

There’s ways to navigate thru this.
Thanks for the update! 

Amazing that they admit it’s their issue and still refused to refund 

Good on you for going higher. 

Here’s hoping the refund comes soon. 

Have a great trip.
So I found this recipe

https://www.sugarfreemom.com/recipes/low-carb-corned-beef-and-cabbage-instant-pot-or-crock-pot/

Im not so sure it’s a bad meal as it’s 285 cal for a 4 oz serving of the beef. 
Just trim any remaining fat, which I think you’d do anyway. 

But it has a very high salt content According to this

https://podcasts.ufhealth.org/avoiding-the-caloric-bomb-of-corned-beef-and-cabbage/

The first recipe is how I cook mine
Just put it in a pot and boil. I add the cabbage and potatoes pretty much after the beef is cooked because I don’t like when they get really mushy. 
I cook the vegs just until the potatoes are soft and the cabbage is cooked thru but slightly firm.
I can’t help with spring break stuff but If you really have to go to Key West, rent a car 

Miami to key west is a 4 hour drive 
And Orlando to Key West is a 6 hour drive. 
Idk where you’re flying into.
Absolutely agree with everything you wrote. 

But I didn’t mean to imply drop them at the club all day long. (It seems a lot of people thought that’s what I meant.
So to expand on that. 

Just if the choice is roam free or kids club, I’d opt kids club. At least the first few days for a bit to have a chance to meet other kids. 
And I said if he meets a buddy and wants to do something else, have the boy set a time and him and buddy can go do that or those things. 

And if he has a phone, even better, he can text where they’re gonna go next. 
“We’re done here, going for ice cream or in the pool or wherever” so at least the parents have an idea of where he is. 

I think that’s fair, gives him a bit of free movement without mom or dad tagging along, but he’s with a buddy or two and can get small doses of roaming free ( but somewhat controlled, if that makes sense)
So just so I’m clear-

This is on government ( or company) issued devices. 

If that’s the case, I don’t have a problem with it. 

What am I missing if anything? 

I know about China tracking and all that, but there’s got to be more to it since there’s such a ruckus around it.

The main thing is that this is passed on through your MOMS family. 

Your dad, and especially your half sis from him, have zero connection to your moms side. 

That’s your out- this is from moms side, not dads. 
Tell her to have her grandparents write down their recipes. She can have that. 

You’re not even close with this half sister, so I have no idea why she’d even care.
I wouldn’t let a 10 yo roam around alone. 
The kids club is where he should be. 

If he meets a friend in the club and they want to do something specific, like go to the arcade, do the ropes course, etc then he needs to ask if he can do that at a specific time. 

So maybe don’t put him in the club at that time, but they meet up where they’re gonna go to meet the friend and then they go off. But I’d walk him to the meeting place and at least meet the other kid. 

Does he have a phone so he can at least tell you where he is- like, after the arcade we’re going for ice cream, then we’re going wherever.
NTA
Your wife is being a bad mother in regards to your sons health. 

Your wife just doesn’t want to admit that your son is unwell. 
So it’s up to you now to help your son. 

Go to your son and ask him what he wants to do. He seems to relate better to you anyway. 

Is that therapy, or meds( NOT painkillers, more along the lines of an anti depressant), or does he just want a semester off to stay home, get out in nature, or just have no stress. 

Don’t dictate what he should be doing. 

He knows he’s unwell. He probably has some idea what he needs at this moment. 

Then facilitate doing what he wants to do for himself.
She was granted legal custody and the dad asked for no visitation. 

But dad was ordered to pay support. 

So I’ll guess the court didn’t decide visitation because he said he didn’t want it. 
Now he and his whole family suddenly wants to see the son.
I really hate that every time I hear of a dog attack I automatically think it’s a pit bull. 
But it is always a pit bull. 

I keep hearing that these dogs are really sweet when trained well, but these dogs were bred to be vicious. 

So even if it’s a well trained dog, there can  be circumstances where the dog will revert back to its basic instinct of being vicious. 

I don’t know what circumstance this could be, but it seems to happen.
Anyone else just curious why exactly
 his parents need a 
   
   “No doing dangerous things in the house” 

rule to begin with? 

YTA
stop doing dangerous things in your parents house, or you won’t have a house, or parents to come home to.
Why do you want to be married to someone who is not in love with you? 

How can you look at him, a guy who lied and cheated pretty much the whole time you are together, and not be absolutely disgusted by what you see?  That alone would make me lose any love I had for him. 

Don’t sacrifice any more of your dignity and pride for a guy who will cheat and/or move on from you when he finds something better in a heartbeat.
I am a parent, although mine are out of school now. 

I would not allow anyone associated with the school to touch my child’s personal laptop. 

If the school is so worried, they can give my child a laptop that only allows access to approved sites for schoolwork only. 

I’d ask your parents about this whole scenario.
Totally agree. 

She’s pushing back school so she can go on vacation, with money they don’t have. 
If they have extra money for a vacation that money should be used to pay down the debt. 

It’s understandable now why they have such debt.
 NTA

It’s really presumptuous of your bro and ex sil to tell your niece you would buy her a car?! Or even worse that you’d pay for her party?!! 

They are her parents, if they want her to have these things, they can buy them. 

If bro and ex own both homes why did they not divide them at the time of the divorce? 

This is your bro’s fight to fight. I wouldn’t do anything either. He made this mess, he can figure it out. 

In the event mom is forced to get out, then you can discuss with mom where she wants to live and if that means buying her a house then you do it.
I really don’t think I can take anymore of “her truth”. 

Now, if she wants to admit to “the” truth, I might listen. 

But we know she’d never do that. It will make her look bad.
But do you realize that the  loan you paid off, including the interest, actually funded the next group of kids that need loans?  

The fed govt only backed those loans so they had enough money to fund the next round of loans? 

I have  kids that are all paying off their loans. Of course they stopped when it was on pause, but I told all of them to make sure they didn’t spend that amount of their budget for when they had to start repaying them.

Oh, and my H and I paid ours off too.
I agree. I think first time employees need a bit of in office experience. 

You def get a lay of the land that way. 
You learn the in office politics, and just a general how to behave in an office setting.
I like seeing them. It’s kind of fun, seeing usually older couples riding. 

I always think the guy was a biker back i. the day, maybe and he had to give it up. So this is the closest hell
 come to riding. 

And he has his partner with him. It’s nice.
Oahu was absolutely gorgeous!

 The med on a cruise. Italy, Greece, turkey. Montenegro. 

Cannot wait!  
Spending a few days in rome, then doing a trans Atlantic back to Fla. 

It’s my longest vacation. Cannot wait.
Just find a teenager in the neighborhood to watch your kids at your home while your wife works. And ask your parents for the every other weekend, or whatever their schedule can do. 

Paying might cut into the amount of money your wife is making, but you don’t really have a choice do you? 

Even if you get the kids in daycare, is your wife really going to be making enough money to cover it? 
If it’s just a matter of her wanting to work, put the little one in daycare, while the 5 yo is in school and she can work those hours. 

Your wife cannot be mad at your parents. I’m sure it sounded good at the time, but the reality was it was unsustainable long term for them.
And that’s what you should have said at the time. 

(I also went to one store and found mine. Also only tried on a few. 
But I had been looking thru “brides” magazine ( do they still have that) for months. I kept coming back to the same one. 
And it was THE one, and 33 years later, I still love it!
Nah, this person will not care what anyone else has to say. 

Take what responses you have gotten here and decide for yourself what your next move should be. 

This is YOUR life, don’t leave it up to someone who belittles you. 

Look at what 5pinktoes has to say about the power imbalance. She is spot on!  
You have none if you stay.
All of this is really odd 

Why does he even care how long it took you to find a dress?  He should be thrilled, now you wont be stressing that “ you’re never gonna find one”, that happens a lot. 

For him to get mad over this is uncalled for. 
Does he frequently get mad over trivial things. Maybe that should be a conversation.
You’re not being sensitive. 

Every one of those examples are meant to demean you. The person saying them seems to have a very high opinion of themselves, and you won’t ever measure up to them. 

This person will not change, they will not understand how these words bother you - ever. 

I wouldn’t put up with it.
Slight YTA 

I understand  that in your experience laying it out so bluntly has been the way to shut down any debate, but I think you should have ( and in the future should) explain the reasoning once. If a debate ensues or your explanation is questioned, then you go nuclear. 

In other words, nice first, then nuclear. 

And hey, don’t stress. It’s one day. It will be wonderful, even if not perfect. 
Nothing is ever perfect. 
When you feel stressed, take a step back. Calm yourself and then go back to it.   One thing, one decision at a time.
Suppers done. Roast beef. 

To let D know.
You were only dating the first girl for a little over a month, so I do not think there’s anything wrong with breaking up with her to start dating another. 

That’s the point of dating. You date, you break up when you find someone else you like better. 

I would suggest not becoming exclusive with anyone until you date for longer than a month, and get to know that person better. As you found out, you really didn’t like the way the first girl treated you. 

Take your time with the new girl. Don’t go all in until you’ve dated for a while and make sure she is someone you have an actual real connection with. 

And really, get a hold of your emotions, you should not be upset because you may have caused someone to be sad. It’s going to happen, doesn’t make you a bad person. 
And frankly, the first girl doesn’t sound like such a nice person with the way she spoke to you. 

Any partner is going to, at times, say something you don’t like but it’s in those times that you think about what caused them to say it. Reflect and ask yourself if it’s justified, and fight the times it is not, and admit when it is.
First off, don’t have the open relationship talk until you have exhausted every other possible solution.  Keep in mind, even if she says ok, she may not be, and she will be home with your child while you’re out with another woman, which could then lead to a complete breakdown of your marriage. 
Tread very carefully here. 

So it’s been 4 years? And she hasn’t given you any explanation? 

Explain to her that she can no longer put off having this conversation. 

There’s obviously something going on with her and you need to know what it is. It is not fair to you or the relationship that she’s not willing to discuss a fundamental issue that you feel you are having. 

Yes of course caring for the baby is important, but not to the detriment of the marriage. There needs to be a balance. 

Start there and see what she says and where the conversation goes.
Did you ask why? What did she say the reason is? 

Im surprised you stayed that long. 

Do you miss really her, or do you just miss the idea of having someone in your life?  Your whole schedule is all changed up, maybe you just need to get into a new normal.
Humans need physical touch. We need to feel intimacy with our partners. It almost seems cruel to me that she’d withhold cuddling and kissing. 
Does she think you really cannot control yourself? That’s insulting. 

Do I have it right that she just decided after 6 mo of dating to no longer have sex?  Because you were together 1 1/2 yrs but haven’t had sex in 1 yr.
NTA

Wear what you like, and have her son tell his mom that she’s crossing a line with trying to dictate what you both wear. 

I liked showers better when the bride or mom to be had no idea and was surprised. 

your mil would have had a stroke if she saw what I wore to mine. 
I didn’t even know it was my shower so it was leggings and a long sweater, with sneakers!  😁
I don’t think so. I’d think they aren’t really hot.

These are a bit pricey so I’d shop around.
 NTA at all. 

Candles are dangerous and a 10 yo really cannot grasp the absolute seriousness of if something goes wrong. 

Anyway, buy her a few of the battery operated tea lights that she can place in nice holders. 
She’ll get the effect of candles with no risk.
You know what tho, it’s a big bday. You only turn 40 once, you’re already splurging for the Haven. 

Go for it!  Make this trip your ultra splurge for yourself. I’m sure you deserve it. Live it up!  

And one other tip, if you drink red wine, the East/West red blend is really good. (It’s an NCL proprietary blend.)
And the Gerard Bertrand cab is also really good.
Figure out realistically how many drinks you are going to have from the premium list. 
Add in the cost of the excursions you’re looking at taking and see if 
the cost works out to even close to what you’d pay extra, then I’d say yea. 


If you really only like one or two baileys after dinner let’s say, then it might be cheaper to just pay for those few drinks. 

And if you’re gonna sit on a beach a few times, or can excursions for much cheaper, maybe not

And your sis can get the unlimited Wi-Fi that she wants. 

It’s all really a money numbers game.  
But with sis not drinking I dont think you’re gonna come close to it making money sense. That extra  $300 vs just paying gratuities on the regular free at sea drink pkg makes a big diff I would think.
I think a trip to DMV would be the next step. Hopefully you can get a decent person there that can help you track down where your license physically is right now. 

Maybe they can cancel that license and reissue one to your new address? 

Try having your license showing the physical address but your paperwork having a mailing address. ( the P.O. Box) 

I know DMV  is the absolute last place you want to go, but I would think that’s the best way. 

As far as the paperwork, I’d use my married name, show the SS card and ins card. 
I’d make sure my insurance is in the married name, like your SS card 
What do ppl who don’t have DL’s do I wonder. 
If they need more show the SS,( married name)?old DL ( maiden), and marriage certificate ( connect the two) to prove you’re the same person.
Take a look at this page. 

Im looking into using this transport from Livorno. It’s €35 each,
But you have to get to Livorno town from the port. 

http://www.mediterranean-cruise-ports-easy.com/livorno-to-florence.html
What they mean is you have the original invoice which shows the lower amount that you paid and shows you owe a zero balance. 

That is your proof that you paid what was due. 

Your lower priced invoice should have a date on it and you can show that you paid the amount on the day you booked. 

I would call them. It doesn’t seem like they actually understood what you were asking them. 
They told you it was paid in full,  it didn’t mention anything about why the amounts changed. 
Make sure you explicitly say that you have an original invoice with a diff dollar amount. 

Im grasping at straws right now, but-

It looks like it’s the KSF discount. Is it possible the child discount is dependent on the age of the child and once you corrected your sons bday it put him into a diff age category so the discount is different? Idk, never heard it being done that way.
That’s what they just don’t get. 

They get elected and vote or support whatever their own personal opinion is on an issue. Or they just go along with the party line whether they agree with it or not, or whether we agree with it or not. 

How about they start listening to what their constituents want. We elected them to do what WE want, not whatever it is they want. 

These people are supposed to be OUR voice.
Since you have your original confirmation you can ask them to go over each charge one by one to find the difference. 

Just throwing this out- 
Did they maybe add on their cruise insurance?  (You dont have to get it, but I would strongly advise you have some kind of insurance.)

Or did they add in the daily service charge, which doesn’t have to be pre paid, but will be billed to your onboard acct each day you sail?
That is a cop out answer. I’m sure she loves her kitchen at home the best, but do you want your reception in her living room?  

Does he really want his mom cooking the day of his wedding?  All day?

Does she even realize that she’s going to miss her sons wedding by being in the kitchen? 
Is she gonna take the apron off for the mother/ son dance at least? 

Come on, I’m sure she’s a great cook, but she can leave the cooking to someone else and just enjoy the day.
You work and he’s a house boyfriend? 

But he’s your house boyfriend who doesn’t live with you. 

So basically you’re supporting some guy who you don’t know and somehow think this is an actual relationship? 

And you think it’s perfectly reasonable to buy him a car? And not just any car, a luxury car. 

And you think the biggest problem in this whole scenario is that his parents are going to think some other imaginary girl bought him the car he just magically shows up with one day?
ESH

He got mad that you weren’t looking at him while he was trying to show you something

But - he must not have been looking at you when he started this conversation about something you should look at - or else he would have known you were looking at something else. 

So he can’t complain you weren’t looking when neither was he. 

This is a stupid argument anyway.
My doc told me to just take vitamin D and calcium. 

I think we’re trying to see if it will stave of osteoporosis? 

My mom was on fosomax(?) for osteoporosis and didn’t have any side effects. This was a while ago tho, idk if there’s newer drugs.
A nice photo album of the two of you through the years. If you have any special thoughts on what was going on in the pictures you can write them in. 
Show him what all those years meant to you by having him in them. 

And of course the obligatory #1 dad shirt or coffee mug.

I had barely knew my future MIL when we got engaged. Of course we met, but we didn’t spend very much time together. 

My mother had one rule. 
She and only the the bride to be would be going dress shopping. She paid for out dress and it was a mother/daughter thing. 
No friends, no sisters ( I have 3), no anybody else. 
None of the MIL’s had a problem with this once it was explained. And my MIL only had boys, so she would never get that experience. 

Now, I also have 2 brothers and saw how mom was left out of any wedding planning. 
So I invited my MIL to the food tasting at the catering hall, just me and her, (H was working)and brought and showed her everything we were debating on. I wanted her to feel involved. It was her sons wedding also. 

Your SIL and MIL are out of order definitely. No argument there, but MIL may feel hurt and sil is fighting her battle, which she shouldn’t. 

So maybe just try to be a little more open with some of the other wedding planning. You don’t have to take her picks or advice, but at least make her feel like she is in the know, so to speak, and remember, it’s her sons wedding also. She just doesn’t want to show up and have no idea what it’s gonna be like.
NTA

I absolutely love your idea. 
It showed everyone what was involved and exactly why they couldn’t handle it. 

And bravo for handling the grandparents. Brilliant. 

I think your H should be the one telling the kids. He can explain why it wasn’t a good idea at this time mostly because he couldn’t keep up with the conditions. 

He might mention it wouldn’t be very fair to mom, who doesn’t want the dog, if she got stuck taking care of it as an added bonus.
I agree. 

Why William would ever want to even talk to H after such a betrayal is beyond me. Some things you just don’t come back from and what H has done is one of them. Can you even imagine the deep hurt W feels coming from his only sibling? 

I can see Charles wanting some sort of relationship, he is his son after all, but I would like to think even Charles realizes it needs to be a distant, check in, how you doing sort of relationship. Kind of like, you don’t wish any harm, but you don’t go out of your way to be close. 

Charles aside, Harry has to be seriously delusional if he thinks anyone in his family is going to want any kind of relationship with him. And the wife, not a snowbells chance in hell. 

They had to pick a lane and they picked celebrity over family- at the expense of family. 
Now they have neither. The quicker they realize that the better.
From one 30+ married to another, I’ve always said that’s the secret. 

Of course we love each other, but we actually like each other. That’s a big distinction isn’t it? One I’m not sure some people understand. 

Wishing your husband a speedy recovery and more happy years to the both of you.
Yeah sorry, none of that is even remotely ok. Especially that disrespectful bs with the picture. Can he not have an adult conversation? 

Is it a matter of him not having any money, but then he should have at least acknowledged the day. 
Does he not do anything for any special day at all? 

You need a serious come to Jesus talk with him. How exactly does he see you and this relationship? Is he in love with you, or did this pairing just move along until you had a child together and it evolved to where you are now? 

Sorry to be so blunt. 

Take a good hard look at your relationship, I’m gonna take a guess and say this pairing is much more beneficial for him than it is for you.
The best way to act in this situation? 

You reconcile this is your own head as you had a good time while it lasted, but it’s run it’s course. 

You’ve been long distance with periods of not seeing each other and now he’s moving even farther away. Do you really want to keep this up? A few days together every once in a while? 
How about finding a guy who lives near you that you can actually try to have a future with?
INFO please. 

Ok you had the conversation. But what did he say was the reason he did not do anything for v day? 

We need to know what his mindset is before we can actually give any advice.
 It wasn’t your moms fault. 

Your mom just brought up some uncomfortable things that you and your partner should have been discussing anyway. Since you didn’t, your partner had time to think thru the issues your mom brought up and came to a conclusion that it wouldn’t work. 

Was your gf supposed to go vegetarian and learn Hindi? Your mom points this out, but you don’t actually say if this is what you wanted also. 
Long distance is hard, your mom maybe didn’t want you two separated for that long. She likes your gf, didn’t want to see you break up? 
The dream may not have happened, but it made your gf really think if she could fit in with your culture. 

I don’t think your mom had any bad intentions. Your just sad and want to blame someone.

Did anyone really need a study to know this?
I love a good full salad. 

But I hate all the chopping that goes into it. So I make a huge salad that can last about 3 days, so as long as it’s readily available, I’ll eat it. 

Maybe try that. Make a basic salad that you can add diff things to it to at least make it slightly diff each time.
The problem I see with even trying to have a conversation about his weight is that, he knows he’s overweight and he’s probably embarrassed by it. 

So I wouldn’t harp on it too much, for fear of making him feel even worse about it. If he thinks you only care about how he looks instead of how he feels, that will add to his feeling bad about himself. ( not saying you do this, just that kids might twist it to that). 

Maybe just a gentle, “ hey kiddo, Covid lockdowns really did a number on all of us. I worked so much I didn’t really see what was going on with you, or your bro. I’m sorry. I’m not judging you at all but we both have to realize that your weight is unhealthy. If you want to or need help figuring out what we can do, I’m here. I’ll listen and we’ll figure it out together. And if there’s anything else you’re struggling with and need help, we’ll get some help. I just want you healthy and happy”. 

Then, leave him alone about it. Maybe just give him a few extra hugs. 
He knows what he has to do and he has a world of info with the Internet if he wants to do it himself.

Editing after seeing some of OP replies

Therapy would be great but only if he’s ok with it. Otherwise, he’ll just refuse to talk. He seems to have a lot going on- teens seem to be coming out of Covid with mental health issues, add to that his confusion of his sexuality, and it’s a lot for a teen to deal with. 

Have you taken him for a full physical? Covid weight gain is real, but that’s a lot of weight, maybe there’s a medical reason? I’d at least rule that out.
NTA
Let’s see if mom is willing to support her. 

I get the whole dont make her pay cause I’m the parent and all that. 
But that only works as long as you can afford it. 

What kind of child sees a parent struggle and still isnt willing to help? 

A selfish one. 

Your d needs to be on her own for a while. She’ll get a dose of real life.
I’m not judging at all. 

Just saying there’s a lot missing from the info they put out. 

I can see the 5 yo being with a parent getting gas, perfectly fine, so I wondered were they in the car caught in a crossfire, or were they being babysat by one of the other teens and brought to a party?, not good. 

How did it get that we have to actually teach our kids that we don’t try to KILL anyone we have a problem with? It’s a nuclear option to use. Sad really.
Right?

So there was an altercation at a party that spilled over to the gas station? 
Did someone bring the 5 yo to the party? 
Was the 5 yo there with a parent maybe and got caught in the crossfire?  But why would the child be out of the car? 

So many questions.
Time. Lots of time. 
You need to date someone until you know them, really know them. 

We rush into relationship ships because we want someone, anyone. We’re so afraid of falling behind,- our friends, our peers, that we take good enough instead of good. 

No guy is totally going to revolve his whole life around youc
Yea he’s being mean, and unhelpful to boot. 

He needs to get out of that habit before your child gets older. Little people need lots of help finding their stuff.
Ok.  NTA

whatever she did with it, she should have picked it up. I don’t care how busy she is, she’s been in that bathroom at least a couple of times over the 2 days. 

And then to yell at you and threaten no sex over it, that’s a massive over reaction. 

Time for a little chat about disrespect of your spouse.
Did she leave her bra in the shower or just in the bathroom?

How did it get soaking wet?
I heard it a couple days ago. It’s heartbreaking to think that no one did anything for the boy. 

But I also wondered why the coaches were not required to know cpr? 
Even if not, you TRY - you have 911 walk you thru it. Just something. 

I was a cub scout leader and volunteered as a coach for my kids grade school and it was required of every parent coach or for scouts, every leader. 

Thank goodness mine are grown or now I’d be staying thru every practice and game.

Im so confused. 
You dated Kate but never met her family for 4 years? How? You must have lived in the same neighborhood if you went to the same hs? 

Next, you break up with Kate during college and what? Change colleges to the one that’s a state over? Maybe, things happen. 

Then you meet Julia, who won’t let you meet her fam because she went nc, because they sent her away? Where? To take care of her sister, would this be Kate? 

You finally meet Julia’s fam, who turn out to be Kate’s fam, and what do you know? Julia also lives in your old neighborhood!  
And instead of acknowledging to the parents that you and Kate had dated for 4 yrs before you met Julia, you say nothing. You tell Julia and she’s just hunky dory about it. 
And Kate just happens to let this cat out of the bag- that she had been pregnant in college. Not exactly what his think would be dinner convo, but whatever. 

Then you yell at Kate because why? 

So I call bs on all of it.
So here’s my very rudimentary explanation. I don’t own a gun. 

The US is a relatively young country and when it was first discovered, there was nothing except for the Indian settlements, but there was vast wilderness. 

Guns have always had a place in our country because they were a means of survival. Had to hunt for food, protect land and animal stock, and yes, even protection from horse rustlers and robbers. 

So then we fight for our independence, from a country who had a national army. 
Way back we had no central army, ( we had 13 colonies, spread far apart and communication would take days, so even if we wanted a central army, it wasn’t feasible) so each state had its own militia, to be used in case of attack by a foreign army. 
That’s why it was written into the constitution as a right to bear arms. We were determined not to be ruled over again. 

As the country became more industrialized and modern? there were and still are very rural places where some people need to shoot prey animals. You have to realize just how big this country is. There are still vast swathes of undeveloped wilderness. 

There are also people who move from those very rural places to suburbia or cities who genuinely enjoy going to a range and practicing their skill. It was there way of life after all. Or they just enjoy hunting. 

So while mass shootings are mostly done by someone who it later turns out had bought a legal gun, you have to remember that the everyday random violence is mostly perpetrated by criminals who do not buy guns legally. And that gets us into a whole other conversation. 

So you can’t bar someone from legally buying a gun, in most cases, it is their right, but you also cannot stop them from using it to commit crimes. 
There’s lots of ideas going around, but outright banning gun sales is never going to happen.
While your stat is true, it needs to be put in perspective, 

as per this website:

https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(21)00341-4/fulltext

We found that some 297,033 children were married in the U.S. between 2000 and 2018: 232,474 based on marriage-certificate data plus 64,559 based on estimates (Table 1). A few children were as young as 10 years when they married, but of those for whom age information was available, nearly all—96%—were aged 16 or 17 years. Of those for whom age, gender, and spousal information was available, 78% were girls (under 18 years of age) wed to adult men (aged 18 years or older). The national number of children wed decreased each year—from 76,396 in 2000 to 2,493 in 2018 (Table 2)—but is unlikely to get to zero without legislative intervention.

So 96% we’re 16 and 17, hardly what most people think of when they hear  “child” marriages. 
And the number for 2018 is 2,493 total, out of 350 million people. 


In comparison

One out of every five marriages in Iran is a child marriage
A total of 550,565 marriages were registered in March 2018 to March 2019. In 112,647 cases, the bride was ages 17 years or less. More than a fifth of marriages registered in Iran during that year were therefore child marriages by UNICEF's measure.Feb 9, 2020
https://iranwire.com › features
Twenty Percent of Marriages in Iran are Child Marriages
Iran has a population of about 85 million people. 

From the same article, 

Data from the National Organization for Civil Registration records that around 1,100 girls under the age of 12 were married in 2017-2018; more recently, the figure has been around 2,600 girls. This is in the range of two or three marriages per thousand registered throughout the year – which is a large and significant number considering the legal obligation to secure court approval. The law permits a judge to issue a marriage license in all such cases when it is “expedient” to do so.


Now, I condone any marriage to a child in any country in any circumstance. But two 16 or 17 yo’s who find themselves pregnant marrying each other is very diff  than a  12 and under literal child marrying a grown man.
How long were you dating before you moved in?
It hasn’t even been a year that you’ve been together, which means you haven’t even scratched the surface of really getting to know this person. 

It isn’t all about love. That’s part of the problem, you think that just because he loves you he’s going to think of your wants and needs all the time, he’ll be appreciative of any little thing you do, for him and the household.
You’re under the impression that the two of you are working toward something and that all he has to do is talk to you and all will be magically better. 

But the reality is, he’s a depressed guy who won’t do anything about it and just wants to get lost in his games so he doesn’t have to deal with real life. 

Next time he tells you to leave, do it. 
Save yourself and get out before you waste more time with someone who seemingly adds no value to your life.
Thank you!  Lots of good info. 
That sounds like my kind of cruise.
What you’re failing to realize is that the only reason you want him back in your life is that you are struggling with making connections with other people. 

That’s you being selfish. 

You didn’t like lily because she was in effect, taking kaleb away from you, you didn’t want to share him. 
Now, I’d say you probably didn’t intentionally kill her, because that’s just too out there. 

But, you also didn’t try to keep your dad and family from threatening to destroy kalebs life either did you? 
You can’t claim it was just your dad, you were an adult at the time. 

You didn’t give kaleb time to properly mourn his gf, someone who he cared for and probably felt extremely guilty that he was the one who brought her to the dinner that ultimately killed her. 

You wanted him to just forget about her and concentrate all his energy on you. And when he didn’t you and your dad tried to rush him along. And when that didn’t work and he lashed out you essentially had him run out of town. 

Stop looking for him. If he wanted anything to do with you, I’m sure he knows exactly where to find you.
I am extra careful around mirrors, and will not walk under a ladder. 

I always say, you never know, so I’ll follow the superstition just in case. 

Now I have to stop putting my pocketbook on the floor. Never heard that one.
Have you been on any other lines and can you compare them? 
I’m not too worried about the food, I’m not a foodie so unless something is clearly inedible, I’m fine. 

What was the sea day activities like, and the night shows and casino? 

Oh and I also liked pic 4.  
Are you a photographer because I’d never even think to take that shot, yet it’s pretty great.
I think the earlier suggestion of seeing if any of the other people in these photos want them. 

Really, nobody in the fam is going to want to look at them from a viewpoint of “ that’s where aunt and uncle went and what did on their vacay”. But the friends they went with might want to relive those memories. 

Of course keep any that have no nudity in them, landscapes, signs, etc so that you’d have a timeline of their travels, if anyone would really want to know. 

Just a thought.
I don’t want to come off as mean, 

But, were you really tricked?
you really thought a 52 yo ( when he started dating you at 28) father of 3 adult children would have wanted to start all over again with a baby? 

Some might, but the majority won’t. 
He wanted to date a much younger woman to stroke his ego. 

If you want a child, do yourself a huge favor and find a man closer to your age who actually wants to have, and be involved in raising his child.
Oh great!  Now we’ll have to hear all about what they got wrong. 

Do these two really not have any sense of humor?  Laugh it off once in a while.
they must be fun at parties.
You have a lot going on, so I don’t know if this will be helpful or not,-

but I can say that my hot flashes have on occasion come on fast and I did have the dizziness and nausea. 

So that symptom may well be connected to menopause. 

Sorry but I can’t help with anything else.
We’ve all seen on reditt that some parents have an obvious favorite child. Those examples are I think more the exception than the rule. 

Most parents don’t have a favorite, but we recognize that each child has something special or different that their sibs don’t have. One can talk to anyone, anywhere and one takes a while to open up to new people, one is an athlete and one is artistic, one’s a spender, one’s a saver, those things. 

And when we recognize these differences we try to cultivate and encourage that “thing” so the child can make the most of it for themselves. 

So every child is the favorite, if you want to call it that, in a diff category. 

At least that’s how I saw and did it.
NTA

I think it’s perfectly fine for parents to go away without their kids. 
But you are too young to be left alone for a week, and it’s your parents responsibility to make arrangements for someone to take care of you for the week. That’s what makes your parents ta. 

Do you have a best friend that you can stay with? 

You need to make your parents understand it’s the leaving you home alone that is not right.
I say go for it. 

You really have no idea what your personal menopause is going to be like. 

Some woman go through it with minimal effect on their life. 
Others are hit hard and have a difficult time just getting thru the day. 

You dont know where you’re going to fall in the range and you’ll regret not taking this opportunity if you have an easy or even a temporary, short lived hard time. 

Surround yourself with one or two very key employees that you can absolutely trust to have your back just in case.
I’d give a student teacher a bit more leeway. Just because they are figuring out the best approach to a lesson. 
But I agree, the mentor teacher should have had a chat about the approach. 

Also, keep in mind, just in general, teachers try to explain things in multiple ways to cover all the diff ways kids learn. That’s not a bad idea. 
It’s repetitive for the ones that got it on the first explanation, but invaluable for the ones that got it on the last explanation.
I’m still not understanding. 
You park your car on the street. This is not a private parking lot or something is it? 

Is it correct to say that your car is NOT blocking their driveway, but is parked between two driveways on the street, so in front of a home? 
Are you parking in front of your neighbors house and that’s why they are mad? They do not own the street parking in front of their home. Can you not park in front of your own home? 

I cannot imagine that a traffic officer would give you a ticket, even if they have been called by the neighbor, if you are not parked illegally. How do you even call a traffic officer? 

I’m not really sure what to tell you, maybe take a picture of your car every time you park and then if you get a ticket take another pic with the ticket still on your car to prove the car was parked legally? 

Or see if you have a case for harassment on the neighbor if they keep calling the traffic police on you? 

Or call the traffic police yourself and ask them why they keep coming when they know you are parking legally.
If you don’t mind, Can you expand on the increase risk of cardio vascular disease please? 
Im trying to keep up but honestly it’s too much info that’s constantly being contradicted day to day and not making a lot of sense. 

I thought the heart issues came about from the vaccine, and mostly in youngish people?
Your gf is insane. None of this is normal. 

She knows her big v day gift is a play, she got a smaller gift on v day to mark that day, you asked what she wanted to do on that day and did it with her—

None of that was enough—

she still wanted you to acknowledge and recognize your past “failure” on gift giving occasions? 

Hell no. Your gf has a way over inflated opinion of her worth. 

How long or how many times are you going to have to atone for past grievances? 

This is your first relationship so I’m gonna give you the benefit of the doubt since you have nothing to compare this one to, but I’ll tell you this- this is absolutely not how a mutual respectful and healthy relationship should play out. 
You should not be tiptoeing around her trying not to upset her. 

Take a long hard look at what she adds to your life. I’ll bet not much. 

Do you frequently feel as tho you aren’t doing enough? Do her wants and needs count for more than your own? Have you ever really wanted to do something or go somewhere that she didn’t and you gave in? 

Simply put, she’s treating you like shit and you’re taking it and asking for more please. Time to send her packing.
It could be as simple as keeping “the good stuff”, he really had no reason to keep your clothes or nick nacks. 

Or he just couldn’t be bothered to pack it up and ship it. 

Even if you pay for him to ship it, he may just keep the money and not ship it anyway. 

Don’t read too much into it. 

Just write him and the keyboard off. Get yourself a new keyboard.
You’re 2 months in, it is totally unrealistic for her to be able to say whether she sees a future with you. 

So early on is the honeymoon phase, you and her need time in order to tell if this is a long term thing or not. You have to really know the other person, warts and all, as the saying goes. 

Work on your anger issues and see how it goes. 

Don’t pressure her to commit long term this early, it comes off as insecure, needy and obsessive.
She should have some idea that an engagement is in her future, so it’s not out of the ordinary to scroll some websites together and see what she likes and doesn’t like. 

You can then ask if she wants to pick out the exact one or if she trusts you enough to pick one on your own. 

We never even discussed rings at all, and I love mine. I looked at it like,  he got what he wanted me to have. She may want you to do that also. 
Just ask her.
 I have to say, that in this instance, I can’t imagine you would even want to see your father for a while, due to your own anger at after the way he treated your mom. 

And it’s not a taking sides thing, it’s more the way he went about leaving her. It was unnecessarily cruel of him. 

So you’re NTA for limiting contact, at least for a while, until you get your own anger and disappointment under control. 

After things settle down a bit, you can reach out under your terms to either see him with the kids or maybe just even have your H at your home while he visits. 

Hugs to your mom.
Are you that busy that you can’t look online and save some styles you like or just take a trip to a mall and look thru all the jewelry stores there to see what they have? 
Decide on a few styles you like, go back to the jeweler and pick one. 

There’s no need for a middleman.
Try to figure out why you are eating. 

Are you bored? Your life seems pretty active at school and when you’re home you’re probably bored. You need to schedule more activity during the day. 

Or you can drink a glass of water every time you reach for food. You might just be thirsty, and if not it will at least fill you enough that you won’t feel the need to eat right at that time. 

Also, remember you aren’t burning as many calories at home that you do at school. It may be that you’re not even eating so many calories, you’re just not offsetting them with exercise.
But he expects you to have 2-3 hours to clean after looking after the house and kids all day and going to school? 

Im not even sure what level of clean he’s looking for?  I get making sure the guest bathroom is clean for company, but you could dust on monday and by Tuesday night it’s back, not as much, but it’s there. The kids toys shouldn’t be scattered around the house, but that’s a 5 min task. 

Ask him what exactly he thinks will take hours.
Very very slight YTA just for phrasing. 

Instead of saying “normal moms…”

You should have said something more along the lines of “ you knew we were going clubbing, why didn’t you have your H watch the baby for a few hours”. (I’m assuming these were plans made in advance.)

Did she ever give a reason why her H couldn’t watch the baby? 

Im thinking this has less to do with whether she was invited or not, and more to do with her mindset- she feels she’s not back to her pre baby weight and has nothing to wear, she’s has a mindset that moms don’t do clubbing, and she’s tired so the last thing she wants to do is something active, she just hasn’t figured out a balance between being a mom and being her own person. Sometimes new moms get stuck in baby mode. 

She’s going to lose all her friends if she expects 7 other women are going to be happy with a social life that fully revolves around baby friendly activities.
So get more video proof. I’d put cameras in every direction. Ones that can pick up sound, so you have everything recorded. 

You put up with it for a few years, you can hang on another 6 months. 

It’s not you, but escalating isn’t the way to go about it. And you know the second you retaliate, the cops will be showing up at your door. You don’t need that in your life.
Think of it this way, is it fair to the girl you’re dating now to not be able to give her your all in this relationship? 

No, it’s not. 

You need to tell her what’s going on. 
She deserves to be with someone who wants to be with her completely. 
It’s a new thing so she likely isn’t too invested yet. 

And you need to take some time to get over your old relationship without dating.
Im not in this fight, but I found this, just because I was curious. 

https://www.iwf.org/2021/04/08/united-airlines-promises-to-train-pilots-based-on-their-sex-and-skin-color/

It’s from 2021 so I have no idea if it is/ was ever implemented. 
(Also, it’s from a woman’s forum so I was surprised by their stance)
I think they’re asking what have you been given that isn’t  sex, because in a committed relationship, sex will be happening. 

It’s just worded oddly. 

It can’t be off the table and also given. 

Stay home, make a nice dinner, both agree to dress up for dinner, (something your so really likes that you wouldn’t normally be comfortable going out in, him too tho- something you like to see him not that’s not  the usual) open a bottle of wine and spend the night connecting as a couple.
Ah, see, I learned something new. 
Thanks for the diff between the two.
Ah, learned something new today. 
Thanks for the distinction.
Excellent point. This is a key distinction. 

I perceive antisocial with being more aggressive? maybe,  at or when meeting new people. 

But someone who is or shy or introverted is just more uncomfortable amongst new people, but willing to go out of their comfort zone to make new connections. 

Big diff in advice to be given.
They won’t let you bring them on when you board. 
And they will take them from you when you reboard and store them from you until the end of the cruise if you buy them in port. 

So basically, no. 

But, I heard if you’re cruising Europe you can bring alcohol on when boarding and also from ports that they will let you keep - but you should confirm that.
Get a library card and use their app to borrow ebooks for your kindle. 
This way, you’re not paying for books you might not like. 

How about reading the book of a movie you enjoyed?  
There’s usually a lot more nuance in the book that you can’t get from the movie. And you already know you like the story. 
That might make you more willing to set aside time to read.
No it’s fine, but do you understand the point I was trying to explain?

Trying to explain why trans ppl get more hate than just LGBQ people?
What you’re missing is the baker wouldn’t make a cake for the lesbian couple because he was religious and said it goes against his religious and moral convictions. 

Idk anything about the gender one tho, but I’m guessing probably the same reason. But that’s a guess.
It’s not a matter of not “agreeing”with LGBTQ,  at this point we all should know that there are people who have diff sexualities. 

But trans ppl aren’t as simple as a diff sexuality, they are in a whole other place having more to do with gender than sexuality. So I think that confuses people who don’t understand how that can be so. Its as if they don’t understand it, it can’t be true, in a sense. 

Adding to that is young and really young kids claiming to be trans and all the medical treatments they are being given at such young ages, doesn’t sit well with a lot of people. There’s a feeling that it’s too much, too soon. 
Is it right or wrong? I have no idea. 

Then add in all the controversy of what bathroom to use, sports competition, moral issues like the baker, and other businesses situation and it just becomes an us vs them fight.  And this is what we’re seeing now.
I liked it.  I’m not a huge fan, I knew some of the songs. 

I thought it was simple, but at least, for the most part, it focused on her just doing what she was hired to do- sing her songs. 

I liked the floating platforms and the dancers around are were really good. 

But I also don’t like when there’s so much else going on that the main act kind of gets lost in the shuffle. When there’s too much going on all at once, sometimes the camera is one place and other things are going on in other places. That way you don’t really see the whole production.
The problem I see is that you’ve only been with your bf a few months. 
You admit yourself that you do not know him well enough, or know enough about him that you need to know. 
And this is why you never should have met his kids. If you start to know the things you need to and do not like what you learn and leave, those kids will be sad and confused. 

But I’m also confused about something. Is he a single dad because he seems to have his kids every day, with an hour to spare to see you. 
Where is the kids mom? 
Was this how it was when you first met?
Why can’t you spend the evenings at his house and spend time with him after his kids go to sleep?
Why would you even ever entertain the thought of sleeping with someone else’s boyfriend? 

This is just plain wrong- you are old enough to know that this is the cardinal rule. Nobody should have to tell you this. 

Stop hanging out with him alone and getting drunk. No good will ever come from this. 
He may sleep with you, but he’s going back to his gf.
Thats a bit harder to “fix” because it’s an issue, for you, but to him it’s not really an issue. 

Can you maybe schedule a few days a week? I know it sounds so stupid to have to schedule your sex life, but at least both of you are on the same page. And sometimes it works just by the anticipation. 
Also keep in mind, would you rather have sex for the sake of having it, or would you rather have really good sex?
Sometimes quality over quantity 

Also maybe don’t put too much pressure on him. Start with 2 times a week and work up to 3? Or however many works. 

But you should start to figure out if you can be in this relationship more long term. You’ve already spent 7 years and it’s not easy to leave when there’s so much good. But you don’t want it to get to a point where your resentment takes over either.
If it’s a matter of frequency then he doesn’t see it as a problem because he thinks his sex drive is perfectly ok - and it is. 

It’s just that yours and his do not match. 

If it’s more a matter of what you’re doing together, you need to ask why he isn’t willing to experiment. Some people just don’t like some sex acts and really shouldn’t be made to do them if it isn’t their thing.
You matched with her first, but your bro was texting with her before you started dating? 

How did that even happen? 
You both must have been at the very least texting or talking with her at the same time. And how did you find out bro was talking to her? 

Look, if you don’t see moving forward with her, just let her go.  Why drag it out any longer.
So does your ex usually pick your son up at 9pm so he can sleep at dads?  

Everything about this is just - off 

You pay your ex child support but you have him all day? 

Do yourself a favor and split custody with the ex 50/50, no one pays child support and then you’ll have time for your bf.
So don’t give her access to all the money. 

Sit her down and show her your finances. 

Take the 4800 for the month, minus all your household bills. By now you have an idea what the variable ones avg out to ( food, etc) 

Take the net $ that’s left and left, decide how much goes into emergency fund, long term savings and depending on what’s left, decide on a weekly amount she can use for herself. 

Open separate accounts for the emergency/ savings and one for her money. 

Leaving is impulsive. She doesn’t work and you have two small kids. Your finances are not going to be better supporting a separate household for yourself and paying alimony? ( maybe) And child support. 

You say all hell breaks loose when you discuss money, just tell her she can bitch and moan all she wants, it’s still not going to change the fact that she is being irresponsible.
Where was your mom for those 2 hours?
You should not have to sleep in the spare room unless you want to, or your gf is so sickly contagious that it’s dangerous for you to be in your shared bed. 

How long could it possibly take you to hang one load of laundry, and in that time your gf went upstairs, got ready for bed, and also fell asleep. 

Oh and conveniently, sometimes puts her glasses on your side of the bed, so it’s a guess each night. 

Either she was not sleeping yet and purposely set you up to have a fight, or she was sleeping and got unreasonably mad when you came to bed and woke her. 

She really couldn’t just wait for you to come up and you go to bed together? 
That’s pretty selfish in this instance considering she knew you were coming up pretty much right after her.
The thing you need to remember is this: 

When we start to date, we have no idea what were doing. We’re all fumbling around trying to figure out this whole bf/gf thing. So we date and we break up- a lot. Mostly with no rhyme or reason. 

Who knows what your bf is thinking. But dating you just isn’t working for him anymore. Doesn’t mean you did anything wrong. 

Stop being sad, look at this as a learning lesson. 
The lesson is- enjoy it while it lasts, take a day or two to mourn it, and move on. ( but that doesn’t mean on to yet another boy, just for the sake of having a boy) 

This too shall pass.
Most people realize that the 2 party system the US has is not working. I think mainly because there’s an us vs them mentality. Most elected officials don’t think for themselves and just go along with party lines. 
That’s not to say they don’t personally agree with some issues, but it is unrealistic to think one person agrees with every single platform either party has. 
And third party candidates have mostly been one off random candidates from one state here and there. That’s why the third party is looked at as a water vote. 

That out of the way, how does this sound-
 A third party, but with candidates in every state where an election is being held. With a pretty centrist platform. Take the most popular stances of each issue and endorse that, or whatever it is. 

National Elections take place every even-numbered year. Every four years the president, vice president, one-third of the Senate, and the entire House are up for election (on-year elections). On even-numbered years when there isn't a presidential election, one-third of the Senate and the whole House are included in the election (off-year elections).

(https://www.senate.gov/reference/Index/Elections.htm)

So next year this third party could  have people running who could theoretically change  the whole look of all branches of govt. 

I’m not gonna explain this correctly, so bear with me. 

How do we do this? We let people in every state know that we have ppl running in all the diff states. So me in state A, can say I want to vote for party 3 and I’d like their agenda to be implemented. I know one person from my state can’t do anything alone, but if a countrywide campaign can be implemented with a message of this party can get a majority of representatives  we can implement our platform. 
It might make people rethink the wasted vote of a third party.
Could be that you just don’t have an actual sexual attraction to that person. Her being good looking isn’t really the only criteria. 
Maybe you need to have an emotional
attraction to a partner as well. Sex is sometimes as much emotional as physical. 

And just wash your hands and clean under your fingernails.
For me, it’s not about trying to hold the family together. 

It’s more, the nephew is too angry for an 11 year old and I recognize that all is not well somewhere in his life. It could be his mom has poisoned him against his dad and his fam, it could be there’s more to the story between his mom and dad that even the OP doesn’t know, it could simply be that nephew is a troubled child   

But whatever the reason, if he grows and gets to a place where he wants to make amends with his dads family, he will have the knowledge that they always wanted him around and never actively excluded him. 

That’s just my take.
If nephew wouldn’t show up anyway, you might as well extend the invite. 

It keeps the peace with your brother, and if nephew ever realizes that this side of the fam is decent, you can always say that he was included and he never took you up on it. 

But if you can schedule on moms weekend, you’d be better off. 

As an aside-
I’m still confused how his mom wanted nothing to do with the father of her child’s family. What did she want to happen? She’d raise the child alone and dad would just be ok with that?  Dad needs to get some some help so the boy can stop being so angry.
NTA

it’s your money that you earned. 

It’s not as if you spend some of it, you’re putting an undue burden on your parents. 

The fact is- even with a full scholarship, there are day to day expenses that you need money for. 
Coffee with friends, a movie, gas,etc. 

Why don’t you explain this to your mom and ask for a monthly amount. Don’t divide all the money you have so it’s gone by the last month of school, Just try to figure out a nominal amount that you can get by with. 

You’ll have some spending money and you’ll also still have some savings when you graduate. (Unless something big comes up in the next few years)
I found it odd too. 

The woman tho, I heard they have more info but not releasing it just yet. Something about who the man is that was seen running away? 

The other guy it seems is a workplace issue. The guy who killed him was an ex employee? He was a gas? or electric co.? employee, so I’m not sure him being an elected official has anything to do with it. 

Now if the same guy killed both then we have a story.
Honestly, he sounds a bit too controlling for my tastes, but

We really don’t know you nor what your individual needs are. 

So if you say, his, what we see as controlling, but you see as taking anxiety inducing decisions off of you, then maybe it’s not as we see it. 

Have you tried to explain to your parents exactly how him making these decisions are actually helpful to you rather than harmful?  I’m getting the impression they aren’t seeing what value they add to your well being. 

This is also your first relationship, so you don’t really know how it should work do you? You have nothing to compare him against. The good and the bad. 

As far as staying home after you marry, it sounds lovely doesn’t it? Until he starts complaining that you’re hobbies are taking up too much of your free time and you’re not dedicating enough time on his needs. 
And framing it as you just aren’t using your time efficiently. 
Be on the look out for that please. That’s when you should reassess the whole him making decision ideas. 


Maybe you should work part time. A few hours a few days a week, just to retain some semblance of independence.
Maybe start with asking her to study, or out for coffee. 

You and she both should spend time together to see if you actually do like each other before you commit to something like the prom. ( idk any proms that are soon, so I’m basing this off the US version of a prom)
Don’t fall back into the it’s ok most days tho. 
Work it out now for everyone’s happiness, yours, theirs and your child. 

You may open a Pandora’s box, but wouldn’t you rather know that now than years from now?  Yes, you would.
Hey I’m on your side. 

I just meant not to bring up the money part of it in a “I paid for it” way. 
Def ok to say “why are you not done yet, it’s been 7 yrs” 

I would never hire someone to clean. That’s just a waste of money when someone is home all day with seemingly nothing else to do. 

And absolutely do not being up being able to find another partner. As tempting as that may be. 
But I would say, “I didn’t sign up to be and do everything in this relationship. I need an equal partner. And I have to know if you’re willing to step up and be a partner or this isn’t going to work for me”.

You’ve gotten some great ideas how to approach the things that need to be brought up. 
Please organize and use them. And let us know how it goes.
Yeah, no. 

No way my partner would be waking up mid day. That’s just disrespectful on a whole other level. I’d start waking them up when the rest of the household gets up in the morning. 

Your poor kid even recognizes that one parent is basically useless. 
Thats another point you can point out to your partner. ( “I need to sleep to get up for work and kid has in the past refused to even ask you to do a late pickup, knowing you will refuse. It’s affecting them and we cannot have that going forward, it’s not fair to our child”) 

I wouldn’t harp too much on the accounting course, but it needs to be mentioned. That may come off as a money thing, even if it’s not, instead of a “ it shouldn’t take 7 years to finish a 2 yr program thing”. 

Whoever cooks should be cleaning since they make the mess. Normally it’s the opposite, but your partner seems unusually messy during cooking. 

Have that chat. Give yourself some time to organize what you want to say and how you want to say it. 
You might as well just come out and ask, if they don’t want to be here anymore, since this is the impression 
they are clearly giving. 

Send child out to a friends house, I have a feeling this might not go so well.
That article was condemned by pretty much everyone that read it. 

Since I don’t know, what can they do to Clarkson? Can they make it so he can never write for a paper again,
fine him, charge him with a crime? 

Or will they just condemn it like everyone else.
OMG yes. 
Especially when it’s only a few months in. 

If you’re having this many, or this big of a problem after a few months, just get out! 

Why try to save a bad relationship?
Laid out like this, obviously the division of labor is wildly unfair. 

I’m curious tho, how did it get like this? 
You didn’t just move in and you were doing the lions share. Was it a gradual tapering off of them doing less and less? Did partner start out as a SAHP, which if chores went undone it wasn’t a big deal cause child care and rearing take a lot of time? But then did they just get used to not doing much? 
( this was me, but any mention by my partner that things weren’t getting done caused some small level of guilt, like I wasn’t holding up my end of the bargain, I wasn’t being a good partner, but that’s just me)

You need a serious sit down with your partner. 
Does partner have any health issues that may be contributing in any way? 
Do they have a hobby that they’re dedicating all their time to? 

And in a very non accusatory  way, you need to ask what the hell they do all day while you are at work. 
Kid is in school for most of the day. I can see having to drop off and pick up, but partner seems to basically do nothing. 

Make a list, divide the work, and specify specific days of the week things need to get done. 
There’s no reason laundry can’t be done every other day for instance.
It’s a nice thought but it really would not stop Brandon from drinking. 

The bigger problem is that Brandon does not recognize that he is an alcoholic, despite going thru rehab. 

It’s normal to relapse, but he seemingly has no plans to try to get back to sober. 

And it’s not that you don’t like the real him, you actually do like real Brandon, it’s drunk Brandon you don’t like. 

Maybe your fiancé should be having a come to Jesus talk with Brandon. 

It’s fine if he decides that wants to be a jobless drunk, but Brandon’s friends should  be able to decide if they want to be friends with a jobless drunk, regardless of how long the friendship has been.
YTA

im really curious why you adopted this child to begin with. 

You already had one son when you adopted and went on to have another, so it’s not a case of thinking you couldn’t get pregnant and then miraculously did and she was no longer your only hope for a family ( as some may think) 

It’s pretty obvious she isn’t treated as a D, but as an adopted D. 
She is your oldest child, why didn’t she get a car and pay for her school. Even if she got some scholarship, you think she had to take loans so why didn’t you just pick up the difference? 

Do you really think she does not know that she’s the not wanted child? She’s a part of this family in name only. 
I wonder if you did her any favors by adopting her. She would have been better off with a family that wanted to give her an actual living family and parents.
What’s the rush?  With this guy or any other?

You’re  in your early 20’s with already one marriage that didn’t make it ( totally understandable) and you’re still not untangled financially from the first guy. 

If you were with the first guy for 3 years and dating this guy for 1 year you’re only 23, you got married at what? 18 or 19?
This guy might be the best guy ever, but maybe you should just keep your separate space for a long while longer. Date him while being on your own for a while.

So that’s what you tell him - I’m not untangled yet and I’m not doing anything until that gets settled. And I’m not jumping into living with anyone  until I know them inside and out and  been thru good and bad and very bad.
But why, if you were happy with her and wanted to make a life with her, are you so compelled to talk to women online. 

You must realize that makes you pretty sleazy. 

That’s why she’s leaving you, not because of some grand scam she was trying to pull. 

She might have been happy to leave everyone and everything she has back home for a better life with you-
But you didn’t exactly treat her with enough respect to lay off the other women. 
I don’t really care that you never physically cheated, just the fact that it’s been going on for the whole duration of your marriage is a testament to what kind of man you really are. 
It just took her too long to find out. 

This is all on you.
I hate saying it, but you’re right.

She should have never been alone. 
The H knew she was having problems, I’m sure his and her family knew. Even if they never dreamed in a million years she would do something like this, ( because who would even think it) at least have someone with her just to take some of the stress of everyday life with 2 kids and a newborn. 

It’s just so tragically sad.
Is it possible that he’s starting to think that he’s leaving his 70 yo mom alone and that’s why he’s pushing for her to go? 
Idk if he has siblings left behind that can look after mom if she needs it. 

Has he explained why he doesn’t think your mom and sister can’t be trusted to come with you? 
That’s an odd thing to say. 

Is he afraid your mom and sis won’t contribute financially to the renting of the property? (Because apparently his mom won’t be, and he’s worried it will all fall to you guys) 
So maybe instead of renting both homes as a unit, you can each get separate rental agreements on your and their home, so you and H won’t be on the hook if they decide not to hold up their end?  

Idk, just throwing out ideas.
It’s not what they do or say, it’s what they do or say -in that moment-.

If they shut down someone being rude, snarky, or harassing the first time it happens, that goes a long way to show people that you have confidence in yourself and aren’t going to take any crap from anyone.
You know he’s kind of down in the dumps lately, I think it would be a really loving gesture for you to do something nice for him without expecting anything in return. 

You can agree to watching a movie together, but maybe you can make a surprise nice dinner for you two. Maybe his favorite just to cheer him up, or a dish you make really really well. Pick up a candy heart and share it as you watch the movie, buy a bag of those hearts with words on them and trade them back and forth. 
Basically make a cute, romantic night in. 

Express to him how much you value him for him, not for what he does for you. 

His situation won’t always be this way, so support him as you would want him to support you if the roles were reversed.
 NTA
And congratulations . You should be so proud!  🎉

have you explained to your parents about the HS grad party and the sweet 16? 

And why can’t they just let you have this ONE thing that you are paying for on your own. 

I would text all three of them and point these things out. 
You’re not asking for anything from any of them, you just want to be celebrated once in your life for your accomplishments. 

How they respond to the facts laid out in black and white should tell you all you need to know if they should be invited or not.
Well done India!
Let’s look at the two people in this scenario in a 2 yr relationship that is not 100% solid. 

You readily admit to mental health issues and what you are doing to help yourself get to a better place. Good for you in recognizing this should be your number 1 priority. 

She, on the other hand, also has some mental health issues and is doing nothing to try to get to a better place. 

Now, these MH issues have in some small way caused her to forget to take her pill, thus contributing - not solely- to the pregnancy. It is totally possible that she could have taken the pill perfectly and still have a pregnancy, but the chances are higher by her skipping pills. 

Do you really think that two 19 yo’s with mental health issues, who cannot afford to support themselves are ready and able to care for and raise a baby?  

That is the reasoning you needs to speak with his gf about. The actual practicalities of raising this child. Not your immediate feelings, not her immediate feelings, the actual nitty, gritty. 

Who is gonna work to support this little family? You, her, both of you? Then who is gonna watch the baby if you two both work? How are you going to afford daycare? 
You both work now and still can’t afford to move out of your parents house. 

Can either of you earn enough to support all 3 of you, rent, food, utilities, car payments, doctors, formula, clothes, etc. 

It sounds so exciting to have a baby, but the truth is, its the hardest job in the world to raise a healthy happy we’ll adjusted person. Because that’s what you will be doing for the next 18+ years. 

And if you decide to have this baby, please heed this-  my very unscientific conclusion from fam and friends is that women are more fertile after having the first baby- so lay off her!  (Keep that in the back of your mind). 

I have no opinion on what you and her should do, I just think you both need a serious sit down to discuss the actual realities of having or not having this child.
Have you explained to him that long explanations get lost on you? That you physically cannot keep your attention on a long monologue? 
I’m not so sure that eye contact is needed. Sometimes I have to “picture” what the other person is saying in order to get it. 

Ask him to break it up, and check that you’re following him. 

For ex: first i unscrew this, got it? Then I take this part off making sure I dont scratch it, got it?  And on and on. 

You’ll have to be honest tho when you don’t get it. And he may have to repeat himself, but he’ll have to be understanding about that.
Ah. Ok. That clears up a lot. 

I thought you lived with your bf family full time. And that you haven’t been in touch with your dad for a while. 

I am changing my judgement to YTA just for asking bf to skip the wedding. 

You’re NTA  for being upset that your bf didn’t get a plus one. I’d be upset at that for the fact that you’re together a long time and additionally, your bf is an adult and a plus one is usually how invites go for adults. Unless no other cousins were also  no plus ones. 

I’m sorry if I came off as harsh. Wasn’t my intention at all. 

Do you have any friends that you can spend that weekend with in your hometown that you can stay with? 
You can avoid your dad and go visit your mom.
YTA - maybe. 

I’m confused as to why it takes you days to deal with your moms anniversary day. 
I say this in a not mean way, but in a, you need to get a handle on it for your own mentally stable peace of mind. 

Please don’t come at me- Yes, I know everyone is different, and people grieve in their own way. 
I understand losing your mom was awful, being young, but you are an adult now and you need to find a way to deal with your feelings around this day without it seemingly being a multi day grief session. That is not healthy in any way. 
I lost my father as a grade schooler and my mom 10 years back so I am familiar with your feelings. 

His fam saying you can just stay in the hotel is leading me to think they’ve been around for this date prior and my thought that this is indeed a multi day thing is correct. They may have been thinking you being alone isn’t the best thing for you. 

your bf will be home on the day of moms passing, so that’s not an issue. 
He can support you however you need. 
Travel day is probably the next day on Friday, so you won’t be in a happy jolly mood, but you should be able to handle traveling. 

The wedding is on sat. Emotionally, you should be able to go to the wedding. Even if you’re not the most excited there. It’s a happy occasion, so celebrate along. 

Your dads bday is Tuesday and you will be home by then. But you don’t even talk to him so I don’t know why this day would even be on your radar. 

As far as the plus one-
That is a standard way of invited when being invited. I don’t know where you got the idea that you weren’t invited? Your bf is in the fam, he gets a plus one, he’s bringing his gf. 

There is a lot of emotional stuff surrounding these dates, you need to talk to someone who can help you move past your grief and anger in regards to your family.
Chocolate. 
That weird chocolate truffle thing.
And when the father treats the white grand baby better than the step grand baby  his wife will be all, “ well it’s his blood grand baby”. 

This will not end well at all. 

Idk if her dad can change his views and mind, but if he’s not all in, he’s out.
ESH

I think Amy is trying to stick it to her mom for making her wear dresses as a kid. 

Anyway, obviously the dress code is different, but it’s Amy’s wedding. 

But you’re not going to change Amy’s mind so do yourself a favor and just go with it. It’s one day, and unless you want to lose your D and her wife, you are going to have to bite the bullet here. 

Your wife can wear a pantsuit that has very wide, flowy pant legs that basically look like you’re wearing a dress. 
Something like this

These would look lovely with a dressy blouse.

Your having a baby this April, and getting married next year. 

Really, by next year you will be perfectly ok with not taking a 1 yo on your honeymoon. 

Now to his child. How long have you been together that you haven’t bonded with this child. I’m not saying you have to fall head over heels for her instantly, but by the time you marry this guy you should have stronger feeling then she’s a nice little girl!  

Marrying a guy with kids means you will be another parental figure in her life. If you aren’t willing to do that then you are doing all of you a huge disservice. He will, or at least should, put his D first and that means if you don’t get on board you’ll be the one sending your child for fortnight visits. 

I hate the thought that his first D will always be less to you. 
Don’t be that stepmom, be better, do better. 

Neither of these children should be going on the vacation that you’re calling a honeymoon.
You realize “waiting” until you each get your fill of sex with other people over a few years is never going to happen. 
I think you both have this romanticized idea in your heads that this is your person, when clearly it is not. 

You didn’t like the sex with him, but then had sex with 7 other guys, ( but only hooked up with 2? How does that work) and hated all those experiences too. Now suddenly the sex with him is good. Could it be that you realize sex for the sake of having sex is not your thing and you actually need an emotional connection to a person, not just an act. 
Whatever is going on with you two is not sex related. 

So while you both will be out there meeting others, one- or most likely- both of you will find someone else you will want to be with long term. 

You’ll both mature, change and find that the young love you have now is not the love that will sustain you for a lifetime. 

If it’s just a matter of being with other people, then pick a number that you think will satisfy this crazy idea and get it done now. 

Of course that has its own problems with jealousy, what you did, what he did, and with who. It will just cause more issues between you two and you’ll end up breaking up anyway. 

Just admit this relationship has run it’s course and move on. 

If by chance you both happen to meet up in the future and it works out, then great. But this isn’t something that you can or should plan your life around.
I love those shows!  I look at the ingredients and think - no way they’ll be able to incorporate, like, candy corn- and somehow they do. 

Maybe her partner should spend his time watching and getting some ideas.
 NTA

If he’s such a great chef, he can make great meals with whatever you buy. 

Like those cooking shows where they have to make something from random foods in a basket. 

When he gets a job and contributes to the household he can buy and cook whatever he wants. 

I don’t understand why he cannot grasp this.
You’re talking about a celebrity who she is in all likelihood never ever ever going to meet. It’s like being jealous of a ghost. 

And there is nothing wrong with finding strangers attractive.

Look, there was a time where I only had eyes for my partner, would actively look around and try to find someone who caught my eye ( not
to cheat, just to see if there was one)
And I couldn’t find one. 

Did I think my partner never found anyone else attractive- hell no!  Did I think there was anything wrong with me or them? No. I was secure enough in my partner to know I had nothing to worry about. 

It’s all about trust. Work on yours. 

It sort of seems that you might be a bit insecure, but in a way that you think your partner is ( I hate this expression) out of your league. 

She’s with you, she likes you. Enjoy it and as I said in my first post- stop sweating the small stuff.

If you booked with an agent then the cruise line will not be able to discuss your booking. It has to go thru the agent. 
So call them first to cancel. This way, depending on how far off the trip is, you will get refunded all or a portion of the cruise fare, but you will get refunded any port taxes and fees and any other pre paid add ons. 

Next would be the travel insurance. Idk who or what policy you have, but usually any 3rd party travel ins kicks in after your primary. 
So your travel ins may just tell you to submit all bills later on after you have outstanding bills from what your primary did not cover. 


Hope your wife will be okay.
I was the last in the fam to get one and I only got my first one just because everyone else in my fam had one. 

Kept it because I can’t even imagine trying to learn a new phone system. 
I know that’s a stupid reason  
I am very tech challenged!  Started with a 5, and my 8 is still doing just fine.

he never even realized you don’t shave, and he never thought you were unhygienic before. 

So his argument doesn’t make sense.
That is the stupidest sentence I have ever read!  

If you’re uncomfortable when you dress for any occasion, you’re doing it wrong.
Generally, community colleges will let you enroll regardless of GPA. 
unless there is an unusually weird amount of students enrolling that semester. 

Make an appointment with an admissions counselor at your local and see what they say. 
They have seen  and heard it all and won’t judge you. They are there to help you. 

Be prepared to take a bunch of remedial classes to bring you up to have the skills for 100 level college classes. 
(But that’s fine, I did a few when I was a returning student, they helped me refresh all the stuff I forgot years ago)

You can do this. You just need to start. 
Best of Luck to you.
Go to the financial aid office at your school. Explain everything to them and see if there are grants, loans, emergency aid that you can get. 

See if you can be an RA in the dorms for this or next semester, that way your room and maybe board will be covered. 
You can still keep your job too.
How is no one realizing that this teacher is taking 20 - 4th grade, 9 yo’s to a water park and is what?
Letting them all go off on their own wherever? 

Water parks are dangerous, no way any school I’ve ever had to deal with would allow that. There would be parents going and assigned a group of kids to be responsible for. 

As far as this situation, I would have made sure my kid didn’t have to babysit the boy no one likes, and only if that wasn’t done would I not let her go. 
And I wouldn’t have bought the VIP tix for the same day. I’d have done something else with my kid.
He has an older brother who is married and has a child. 
Someone said it is his step bro? Idk about that tho. 

I do remember seeing her posts tho. And the bro also posted about A scholarship or something? I dont remember exactly.
If you were my D, this is what I would tell you. 

You have seen how he is for a whole year already - Do you think he is going to suddenly wake up one day and be a considerate, non yelling, insulting bf?

Do you think if you just try harder to please him 24/7 then he won’t ever get mad at you and call you insulting names?  

I am telling you right now-

THAT WILL NEVER EVER HAPPEN! 

And that his not what being a partner is. You don’t change and compromise for anyone just so that won’t get mad at you. 

This is not love- you don’t love him, he certainly does not love you. 

Get away from him now. Before he hurts you worse. 

Stop dating,  I’m serious, you are way too young that this is your second abusive bf. 

You need to understand that you are worth way more than you have been getting. Having a bf is not the be all end all, find a few good friends to spend your time with, or hell, be alone for a bit. Enjoy your own company, find what makes you happy- that isn’t a boy. 

See what good relationships look like, and see what the crappy ones look like. 
Then, when you know what behavior you expect from a guy, you will be able to leave when the first bad behavior comes up.
So I just looked up port charges for GC here. I didn’t even know this  info was available but I took a shot and googled

https://www.caymanport.com/fee-structure/

It cost $7.26 per person plus another $36.75 for the ship 

So if we divide the 36.75 by the number of passengers, ( idk what ship so let’s say 3,000 passengers that comes to .012 cents per person) 

So $7.26 plus .02 thats $7.28 per person. 

the $10 credit per person works as far as a refund for port fees. 

NCL gave you a credit to your shipboard acct instead of a direct credit to your original form of payment.
The only problem I see is in the future., which most people don’t think about. 

He’s going to get to a point where he slows down and you wont be able to do some things together. 

Think of the activities you do now with him as a 45 yo. When you are 45, hell be closer to 60. He’s not going to have the energy for it. 

Then don’t discount his health. You may find yourself being his carer. And thats not an easy thing to do if you’re in the midst of a career, or are raising youngish kids, or both at the same time. 

I know 2 couples with at least a 15 year gap, and the men are both facing health issues and their wives are of course doing what needs to be done, but being a 50 something and scheduling your life around doctors and tests is not fun. And neither has any kids. 

Just something to think about.
She just started a new job and believe it or not, its a difficult one. 

Not just physically, but mentally, and add to that the fact that I’m sure shes stressed to no end wondering if shes doing this job right. 
All that combined is a recipe for exhaustion. 

She needs time. Time to feel like shes on a good footing with the job, time to build the confidence she needs to go into school every day knowing shes doing a good job. Time to learn all those shortcuts that veteran teachers know that cuts her at home work down. 

What she needs is a supportive bf who is willing to deal with this transition period of her life because he wants to support her to succeed. 

She doesn’t need a needy bf who jumps to a dating app the second his gf doesn’t give him the amount of attention he wants. 

I’d love to see what happens next year when you’re up to your eyeballs in textbooks and lack of sleep and she wants you to hang out. 

Are you going to put off studying to hang out? 
I didn’t think so. 

Frankly, you don’t deserve her. You’re too selfish.
 YTA

I am failing to see what is so wrong with him putting the ring in his mouth. 

Its really not a big deal.
NTA

its a perfectly normal question to ask. 

Your friend is hiding something. 
Let me guess- they met online and are long distance and he never actually met her.

Just passing on what i saw.
The CD was in OP’s name, effectively making it the legal property of OP. 

grandma verbally told OP to give that one CD to nephew. 

OP emailed nephew, nephew took a year to answer and then asked for gold. 

OP told nephew, why’d it take you so long? But ok I’ll send the check, but the original CD was cashed and spent in expenses so the $ is coming from me personally. 

Nephew responds give me my money, it shouldn’t take this long. Oh and send it to my dad. 

OP’s lawyer advised since the CD was never in nephews name, nor was the cd or nephew mentioned in grandmas will, OP legally doesn’t  have to give nephew any money.
I think I heard Costa Rica mentioned, but idk where I got that from so its not very helpful. 

And there’s nothing on the Costa Rica reditt either, so I’m starting to think there isn’t another one.
I saw a retired military somebody on fox ( dont slam me, they carried the shoot down live) who said biden wanted to shoot it down on wed and the military talked him out of it. 

This guy made a point of saying biden needs to have a little sit down with those guys and explain the chain of command. 

So I think there’s more to this whole incident than we know?
Yes. I keep trying to find one news source about that balloon. 

I cant find anything other than a blip that said US military was aware of one. 
Very strange.
This is what you’re unhappy about-

- he doesn’t tell you you’re cute or pretty every day 
- he doesn’t call you by your nickname
- he doesn’t ask you how you’re doing 
- he hasn’t asked you on a date since fall
- he says he’s not good at planning. 


You have not once said what it is that you do for him that you should be appreciated for. 

I’m sorry but you seem a bit insecure. Are you not confident in the fact that your bf likes your looks and wants to spend time with you? 

That might be why you’re going through rough patches. You expect him to act and be a certain way without thinking that maybe that’s just not him. Its easy to be so enamored in the beginning and then it tapers off. 

Thats not to say he should never give you compliments or plan something, but you want him to do all the work. Why cant you plan a date?
So see, you’re doing fine. You’re covering all scenarios and logically thinking things through. 

Just pay close attention over the next, say, 6 months. If he’s serious about you there is no reason you cannot start meeting his kids. Slowly at first, and gradually to where you all can spend weekend time together. Thats a big tell to me about his intentions.
Ooh his wife asked for the divorce. 
(Ill throw this out just cause I want you to think about things you wouldn’t think of.)

Some men just cannot be alone. His wife ending things, regardless of how he felt about you may have prematurely moved this relationship forward. And I’m not saying he wants back with her, I’m sure there were signs his marriage was in trouble. 

Im not saying this is true but roll that little nugget around a bit.
Ok so, I think it may have been much easier for you coming out of a marriage that you and your ex had already realized was over to go all in with the new guy, as opposed to him, who I’m gonna guess, sort of blindsided his wife with the divorce to an extent. 


So he’s dealing with guilt of hurting the ex, guilt about the kids while also trying to move on with you. Its been a year so he’s probably getting closer to the point of no guilt and ready to move on, and maybe knowing this trip was always going to be coming up ( which really was a stupid thing to do, the parents haven’t been together for a year, why make this trip? Why not just one of the parents take the kids? why this charade?)has hampered his moving on. But the trip will be done, he has no more reason to not wrap up his divorce and be all in. 

Also realize that his kids will always always cone first. You will not have what you did in your marriage, where its just the two of you and you can make plans on the fly and just go and be. Plans will be ruined if there’s an issue with the kids and you have to be  ok with that. 
Its the kiss of death if a relationship if you cannot handle all that. 

If after this trip he is not willing to have you meet the kids then id reassess his true intentions. 

But for the next few days while he’s gone, do something for yourself to occupy your time. It might be better if you two dont talk so much. A check in is enough. You dont want to get jealous and he doesn’t want to temper what he says to you.
And another excellent point to make. 

This thread is so fascinating, with all the ins and outs!
Something about this whole scenario just isnt sitting right with me. 

INFO please 

He’s separated yes?  As in, living apart, but not with you, from his soon to be ex wife, seeing his kids whenever the custody is they agree on?
Oh and there was no cheating by either of you? 


Then I can weigh in better.
Id agree with that -IF - China had relayed that info before this balloon was spotted. 

So they have a few weather balloon malfunctions, possible if they’re trying something new and perfectly reasonable, but just come out and say that before it enters into another country’s airspace. 

If they want to be believed they have to be transparent about it. 

Even then, we know the conspiracy theorists would be out in full force. 

But until it comes down or gets forced down, we wont know what it actually is, and even then we might not ever be told the full extent of its capabilities.
As I originally said, I would have believed it was a weather balloon that went off course, except that once it veered off and was clearly going to be entering close to or into another country’s airspace, any country, China should have said just that. Instead they said nothing. 

Now, its possible they tried to play that story with either the US or Canadian govt before it was spotted, by whoever spotted it first, but neither govt has said that was the case. 

Being that they didn’t just leads me to believe that it wasn’t just a wayward science balloon. Not to mention that there’s another one. And this one just traversed the country and is now over the Carolina’s, where I believe we have large military bases? ( could be wrong) 

There’s no doubt that most gov’ts don’t trust China, but them being transparent about it would have gone a very long way to minimize the evil China theories. 

I’ll believe the US and Canada before I believe anything China says. And thats just based in history, not just anti- China anything.

Have you spoken to his bf and explained why he’s not invited?

Brother might be feeling its a rejection of him/ his bf, but bf might just see the rationale. 

As long as you and bf have always gotten along and there is no animosity, he should understand and help to calm your bro’s thinking.
YTA

are you freakin kidding? 
Your son has been bullied and when he finally defends himself - not start, not instigate, but defends himself, you actually think its ok to punish him more? 

You are the absolute worst! 

Give me a break about this one instance ruining his future. No college gives a rats azz about one suspension that can very easily be explained away. 

Those parents want to press charges? Let them. And counter sue for harassment. 
Line up every single instance that your son has been bullied by these two over the years and absolutely obliterate them in court. 

Be a better advocate for your son.
He’s needed you in his corner for years and you haven’t stepped up- 
Do it now!  

Im so disgusted by you and I don’t even know you
 Never heard that! 

Ok I’ll wait for a third to show up somewhere else too.
I might believe the balloon somehow got blown way off course-

If there wasn’t another one over South America. 

Two just seems a little too much of a coincidence. 

I guess it might be possible both balloons got caught up in the same winds or jet stream, but… eh.
Im not sure that your love language actually is physical touch. 

Im thinking that you are just starving for some type of physical touch being that from your description of family, you haven’t ever had much much of it. 

Explain to your gf this and let her know its not necessarily sex that you’re looking for, its more non sexual physical touch and closeness. 
So you can hold hands while sitting next to each other while watching tv, you want to rub her arm or leg if you’re just lounging around, you’d like a hug hello or goodbye. Make sure shes ok with this level of touch tho. 

See if thats what you’re really looking for. It will satisfy you and take the pressure your gf is feeling off.

her wanting to spend money you don’t have is exactly why she is in debt. 

You cleared yours, probably by being diligent and prioritizing spending while she seems like shes a bit more carefree financially. 

You two need to discuss finances in brutal detail and figure out if you’re compatible on this topic. 

As a couple you both should know what’s going on with the finances and recognize that even though it may be an occasion, sometimes its just not a good time to spend more. 
She knows about all the expenses you told us about, how can she expect to spend another $700 for 1 night?
I said it before, they want the RF to admit to 

-an unconscious bias in the monarchy, as well as a plan to eradicate it

-they want then to admit they didnt do enough to stop bad press of TW
( even if her actions, whatever they were, were truthfully reported)

- then they want an apology for the above two things and to admit that the stupid duo were right about everything they claim. ( even tho they haven’t laid out any concrete proof) 

They wont get any of it because its all 
delusions of two disturbed people.
Did you pay with a credit card?
Sone cards have some level of insurance. 

Check that.
I totally understand keeping separate, but what happens when, for instance, you have a baby and one of you stay home. 

I’d imagine it would feel a little weird not having your own acct of money. 
I cant imagine the working spouse not being ok with the SAHP having access to their acct, but I was curious. 

Anybody experience that and what did you do?
I’m sorry you are going thru this. 

But now’s the time to be mad, not sad. 
Much easier to forget all about him when your’e so mad at what he put you thru. 

So turn your thinking around,- be grateful you only spent 3 years with him and you have the best thing to come out of your relationship, your D. 

It shows just how invested he was that he’s going away with his friends instead of trying to get you and his D back - be mad about that! 

He has an addiction, but tries to blame it in you? As if you drove him to the compulsion he has? Nope. Be pissed about that too. 

He lied for years, get mad about that! 

You are going to have an amazing life! And you’re gonna do it all by yourself. You don’t need him.
So I guess serious humanitarian content highlighting their save the world complex is out? 

Great, one more thing they won’t get right as they know nothing about romance or comedy.
I don’t understand who the victim is. 

My point was trying to say that she has a preconceived notion of what this country is like and the only way he may get her to change that is to show her. Sounds reasonable to me. 

She may go and hate it, but at least she was there to make an informed decision. By him cancelling the trip he may have, in her mind, validated what she has been thinking all this time. She can then think to herself, see he knows its awful, thats why he gave up trying to get me to go. 

I wouldn’t say he has to cure her of anything, more like getting her to be more open to exploring something out of her comfort zone. Its been over 10 years, maybe just putting up with her for another month wouldn’t have been the worst thing.
A mid range mobile will do the same things as a high end one. Talk text and data. 

What else would you use it for? You’re not really gonna be able to do schoolwork on it. 

So go better on the laptop.
 NAH

I also think it depends on how often you are trying to get the guys together. 
Something every weekend, thats not gonna happen. No mom wants the dad out having fun every weekend while she gets child care duty. 

Something like a dart league is a weekly commitment. Most working people ( not just dads) are probably reluctant to commit to that  as its just another thing to add to the list of somewhere I have to be on that night every week. 

Instead of just trying to get the guys together, invite the couples over with their kids to watch a game, play a game, or even just to hang out. 

The guys only should be an occasional thing.
He had the side with the outlet for the alarm clock since he got up first. 

Then we had to switch cause the baby cradle only fit on that side of the bed. Its been that way ever since.
Honestly, you sound so desperate to find a partner and that desperation will become apparent to anyone you happen to meet. Thats not a good thing. 

You need to figure out why you feel that the only way to be happy is with a partner. 

There are always times in everyone’s life where they are single. That in itself should not be as big a deal as you are making it out to be. 

Go out with friends, join a club, pick up a new hobby. Do something, anything just for yourself. Something that you enjoy. 

Stop expecting someone else to make you happy. 

You’re so young, enjoy this time of your life. Your person will come at the right time.
He doesn’t want to date you anymore. Thats the reason. 

but you’re gonna hang on waiting for him to come up with some kind of problem or issue he has with you or your relationship and think together you can fix it. Did you ever think he doesn’t want to fix it? Whatever it is? If there even is a thing. 

Or there’s no fixable reason. He outgrew the relationship, he’s bored, you’re not what he wants anymore, he met another and wants to pursue her, but wont cheat on you so he breaks up. 

Just move on. Stop trying to figure it out. He’s not worth any more aggravation. You’ll make yourself crazy.
Agree totally! 

Why would she, or anybody really, fight for and want to be with someone who doesn’t want to be with them? 

I’ve always had that attitude which is why I get over heart break pretty easily-  first I’m hurt and upset, then I realize they don’t want me, so I just move on. 

Which is what OP should be doing.
Yeah but there’s something about seeing a foreign country with a native. 
Thats when and how you see all the great local things on offer. 

Its just sad she wont experience that,especially with you, her H.
But you wont convince her if she never goes there. 

Best thing would have been to counter whatever she says to whoever with the good things. She moans about it and even her aunt telling her about going there didn’t convince her. 

She needs to see it to believe it and you just shut that down. 

But also, shes pretty awful to disparage your home country so viciously when she hasnt ever been there.
Oh ok. Then it’ll be fine. 

You don’t have to do anything. 
Let it cool, i’d wash it and you’re good.
Don’t touch it till it cools off. 

If there was nothing in the pan what happened to the pan?
Have you told him you don’t feel like you two are connecting since you’ve had the kids? 

You need to sit him down and lay it all out. 
Tell him he has to decide what his priorities are. Is it you and the kids or his sailing? 
If its his family then he needs to be present, not just for the kids, but for you as a woman and his wife. 

Explain he cannot possibly be giving his all to : his job, his kids, his wife and his hobby. Something gets pushed to the back burner and you feel like its you and that needs to change. 

Not a threat, just a statement of fact- you’re not getting what you need from him and if you’re not then why should he even be there?
Its only been a few months and you admit its not 100% so why are you still there? 

This should be the honeymoon phase where everything is great, 2 ppl finding out everything about the other, sharing stories of their lives, their families, etc. 

Not, constant back and forth, push and pull. 

Please find someone closer to your age, in the same stage of life as you, thinking about and going thru the same things as you. 
You’ll find it a much easier, happier relationship.
I didn’t go away to uni, but dont most people have a roommate or 2 or 3? 
I would think you start there. You’re all in the same boat, not knowing anyone so you pal around with the few you do know. 

You can expand that into the others on your floor. I heard keeping your door open the first week or so is a good way- I guess the more extroverted ppl pop their head in to say hi? Idk. 

Then you join a club or a team or volunteer to do something and you meet others that way. 

Eventually you find the few that you really click with and they become your closer friends.
You should have been leary of a guy who seeks you out and professes to have a crush when he’s never even met you. 

That screams scam to me. 

You don’t say how long you’ve been together but I would delay moving in.
Yes we all did. 

But you’ve been with him for 2 years! 
That alone should be enough to be able to say that you trust him. If you do not, then why on earth would you have moved in with him? 

You have to decide if you trust him or not because he is not going to put up with your constant insecurity forever. 

Thats not how a relationship works, you trust until they give you a reason not to, and he hasn’t. So count your blessings, stop looking for drama and have a stress free life with the guy who wants to be with you. 

Stop this, You are way too old for this kind of stuff. 

Even if the bag is back in there, do you really think his 11 yo son even wants them? Here’s a clue- No, he doesn’t.
Oh silly me - I totally discounted the happy part. 

I hope OP updates as each of your timelines comes to fruition.
Oh come on, shes actually going to make you move out over a guy who she just met?  
Thats ridiculous!  What’s he gonna want next?

She needs to tell B that he hasn’t been around long enough to start dictating who or what she can do with her apt and her life. 

Have a chat with A. Shes acting irrational- over a guy.
I agree. 

I cant imagine how he’d act if there was a big problem.
Perfectly fine. Take a class as an elective on what may interest you and you’ll find it.
You are someone’s perfect person, you just haven’t met him yet. 

Do not settle for anyone who is not all in for you. 

You will get over this one and move on to someone better.
Congratulations!  You earned it!  

What are you thinking of studying?
You will do great.

SM actually acknowledged that your dad put her before his OWN kids as if thats something to be proud of? 

Wow. And your dad has nothing to say about that?  He’s the biggest AH of  them all. 

SM would not be getting any apology from me ever for anything. She is a horrible mom. 

You need a little chat with dad about what she said.

Im not sure where she lives when shes not at yours so she can either remain there every day shes not spending time with her bf, or she gives it up and moves in with her partner and pays her share of expenses. 
Its one thing to spend time with a SO, its another when shes there for days at a time. 

There’s no reason she should be freeloading off you three. 

You need a roommate meeting and she either moves in or is only there when bf is there. And if shes visiting she doesn’t get to crank the ac, eat whatever she wants or treat it like its her home. Not that she can hang around all day while he’s at work.
Someone correct me if I’m wrong please- and I’ll delete this. 

I think the point is that piers got fired from what I think was a pretty big morning news show when he dared to say, probably amongst other things, that he didn’t believe what M claims. 

So the fact that he was in a sense, “markled”, ( lost his livelihood) and now he’s “back” because he has an interview with the PM, which is a big deal.
A couple of things off the top of my head -

If you can wait until after Labor Day, a lot more states schools are back in session which might cut down the number of kids. 

Idk how big the ship you mentioned is, but I would avoid any mega ship if your wife doesn’t like crowds. Id stay with somewhere around 3000 people or less. There may be less gimmicky things like rock walls or go carts or whatever riyal has. 

We just returned from a carnival cruise  out of Miami, and there were a bunch  of LGBT couples and groups. I dont know if it was the ship, ( celebration, very big), or the port, or that CCL has LGBT meet up’s on all their ships which is attractive to the demographic, but i didn’t see or hear anything disparaging. ( I realize I’m one person so that doesn’t mean much). 

This might cone off the wrong way 
but I don’t know how else to put it so please forgive if it offends, its absolutely not my intention- Idk if royal had a dedicated meet up but it might help to meet people like you and your wife ( see this part i didnt know how to phrase) who you can be comfortable hanging out with and sort of have your own gang of friends who are accepting. 

I know people hate carnival but I’ve been on them and NCL and really enjoy both lines. Carnival has really fun deck parties.
Id go back anyway. I cant possibly have another accident, right? Yup I’m going with that. 
We have 3 more booked for later this year. 😛

But yeah it seems they aren’t gonna bill me, which works for me!  Saves me from dealing with the insurance company.
Seriously needing evac is my absolute worst fear. 
Being so badly hurt that  they want me off the ship is terrifying!
Yeah had to do the report also. 

They even took pics of my sneakers, which I sort of understand, in a weird way. 

I would like to think its so they can see if there’s a pattern to where and how accidents happen. Idk.
That’s what I was thinking, since it happened on the ship.
Sounds like me- hurt on day 2. It def put a damper on the vacation.
Im sorry your dad went thru that. 

Its scary when you’re away from home and dealing with medical issues.
Thats what I expected to happen, its just really odd that they haven’t charged me yet. 

I have Allianz also so its good to know that it wont be a nightmare if I do have to claim.
Oh yeah I def misunderstood your comment. 
Sorry. 
Ill just wait and see what happens.
That is my worst fear and the reason for the outside travel insurance. 

It covers the usual trip cxl and delay, lost baggage, etc but I got it mainly for medical and evacuation.
I tripped and fell on stairs and broke my ankle, so really not their fault, not my fault, just a misstep. ( i wasnt tipsy and was wearing sneakers, it was just a freak thing) 

They did tell me upfront that they don’t take insurance, which I knew, and what all the charges would be for the doc and X-rays. After that i didn’t really care what the charge was for  the cast, just do what needs to be done. 

I did have to speak to security for an accident report, maybe that has some bearing also idk. 

I figured they’d put it on my ship acct because they didnt ask for my cc. 


I guess I’ll just keep waiting to see if maybe they direct charge my cc at some point, its been 6 days since I went to medical but only 2 days since debark.
Thanks, yeah my bill will def be higher than that so it cant be a threshold thing. 
I was expecting a charge to show up on my acct but it never did. Weird
 Nailed it in one!  
Perfect.
Im a bit confused. 

What exactly is he doing that is making you feel bad? 

The only clue I got was you feel uncomfortable and / or unwanted by him. Is this a result of the pregnancy? Is it a weight issue or what?
No way in hell would I ever see any doctor that sil has seen or is her babies primary doctor. That will only give her more ammunition. 

You have no idea if what shes telling you is really what her dr had said. 
Her baby is small, she has to find something to brag about. 

Both these babies are under a year old, do I believe her baby is some super specimen of muscles? Idk, I guess its possible- will he continue on that same path? Who knows. 

Don’t engage her at all. If she makes any kind of “off” comment, ask her straight up what shes trying to say. Put her on the spot.
I was going to point this out. 

He’s using the majority of the food budget on his food and she has to basically eat whatever fits the budget. 

Thats some bs right there. 

OP, make a new plan that takes food out of the shared acct. each of you will then pay for your own food order for the week. 
Thats the only fair way, he cannot hog the food budget and then make you feel bad that he has to add more money to it. Let him see exactly how much of that budget he has been spending. 

And stop eating crap food- you work, you can afford to feed yourself whatever you damn well want to eat!
This is some serious next level shit with the sister. 

I agree your H should be the one to shut his sister down- every time. 

But if he’s not around here’s some ideas. 

Her baby is younger, it is not supposed to and is not going to be at the same developmental point as any other baby born before it, including yours. 

How to deal with her?  Every single time she tries to make comparisons between babies, just repeat “ oh I’m positive both  kids will reach every milestone when they reach it, no rush”. 
Or something to that affect. 

Do not engage in the tit for tat - her baby does this, so you point out yours did or dies that. 
All that will do is make her compare more. 
Just be very meh about everything. She may just get tired of goading you when she sees you wont engage. 

Of course she may double down and get mean or snarky about you, your baby, or your relationship ship with your H. In that case, she went overboard and you are allowed to let loose on her.
This is what I think they want 

- the family to make a statement admitting to some kind of 
“Unconscious bias” within the monarchy, along with a pledge to stop it, 

- an apology for not making sure the press didn’t print anything disparaging against his wife, in other words, for not “protecting” her. 

- to be brought back to their half in/ half out as a way for the fam to make amends for being proven right about their accusations. 

Of course, none of this will ever happen, but the two of them somehow will keep pushing and pushing until they are proven “right”. 

But they haven’t proven any of the accusations they have made so I don’t know how they think their delusions will ever come to fruition. 

They absolutely have no leverage against the family. 
I’ve been out of the loop for the last 2 weeks, so I’m not even sure where their support or popularity is at this point. But if its low after all the interviews, and his book, they should seriously be looking at just working quietly on their humanitarian work- if there really is any-  and stop trying to get a pat on the back every time they deign to speak about any subject.
The thing is, the only real choice you have in that instance is whether you are going to be involved in the child’s life. 

The mom can take you to court for child support and then you will be required to pay every month for the upkeep of the child. 

So if you’re going to be paying anyway, you might as well just be involved. 

That child will grow up and might come looking for you. What possible explanation can you have for never being involved? 

You were too young? Well, you weren’t always that young. 
You werent ready to be a dad, well she probably wasn’t ready either, but she did it anyway. 

It seems so easy to just walk away, but will you really be able to just forget that your child is out there somewhere, maybe not having a great childhood because you just couldn’t be bothered to take any responsibility?
That is awesome !

Great job. 
How big is it?
She wasn’t technically stripped of US citizenship, she was never supposed to have it. ( if she legit ever did)

She is still a Yemeni citizen because her father was a diplomat of Yemen. 

Maybe she should ask Yemen to let her in. 

Too bad, so sad stay where you are.
Jellyrolls is a dueling piano bar. That’s a fun night out. 

The abracadabar is nice for a drink or two. 

I think the boardwalk has brought back the entertainment. Could be a magician, juggler, etc. They set up and put on a show for a bit. 

There’s a few boardwalk games for a fee, basketball throw, hit the lobster into the pot, water gun race. 

So basically walk the boardwalk and see what appeals to you. 

We absolutely love the boardwalk!  Enjoy.
Idk why, but I like this question. 

Originally H took the side with the outlet for the alarm clock cause he had to get up earlier than me. 

Then we moved and kept the same sides until the baby came. Then we had to switch cause the bassinet only fit next to “his” side of the bed. 
We just haven’t switched back.
YTA. 
All you accomplished was to make your d and h mad at you, and made your d miss her sisters wedding. 


I’m not a fan of the emo look, but that’s what your d likes. 

She put the dress on and added what she needed to be comfortable in it. Thigh high slits are fine on a formal dress- (have you seen what sweet 16 and prom dresses look like?!) I just would have wanted it to be finished, not just a scissor slit, if that’s what it was. 

No one was going to care- some ppl might have looked at her, commented to their so, and then went on with the festivities. 

I highly doubt your d was planning on parading around the hall so everyone could see how edgy she was.
But bower says it was violet that set them up. 

If the story about the insta crap was true, why would she send violet flowers?
I have a 2 problems with scobies. 
If I’m following this correctly

- the timeline. 

H says the baby was already born when the in labor statement was made. 

Ok, but did H or M even ever tell anyone that she was in labor?  
So for him to be all butt hurt that it was a “lie” was actually his own damn fault for not telling anyone. 

I am sure if the palace was told she’s in labor, they would have released that at that time. 

So the fact that she labored, gave birth, and was already home by the time the in labor statement came out points to me that they purposefully withheld that info from anyone. 

He wanted no press so he got no press. So why bitch about it?  

- the fact checking

He says there were things he didn’t put in the book that were told by the place but couldn’t be fact checked so he left them out. Ok that would be a good thing. 

But, when told by the harkens people about the titles, he took that at face value and reported they didn’t want title for Archie. So no additional fact checks in that one. 

So he takes what their comms team says as fact and it turns out to be false, but doesn’t take the palace’s statements as fact. Of course we don’t know which ones they are because we have to wait for his second stupid ass book. As if there’s some big revelation to be revealed.
This is exactly where I’m at. Even commenting that we really should do NCL more. We even have 2 cruise next certs that we have to use at some point. 

I really like NCL, but the CCL offers are just too good to pass up. And as you say, the diff is pretty small. 

I also like that I can see my CCL offers online and don’t have to call to find out what they are. 

With NCL I have to call, they look up my acct and tell me what my offer is, then, since it’s a casino offer, I have to pay that extra $20 pp/ per day admin fee. And honestly, for the time and money spent in the casino on NCL, my offers aren’t that good. 

So I’ll stick with CCL until I find an itinerary on NCL that I can’t get on CCL.
NTA
It’s a ridiculous caveat on the trust. 
Is it even legal? What if it stated you had to marry a certain woman? Could that be upheld? 

But really you should have never confided in your sib. 
Should have made like you were cheating. Kept the ruse going. Pretend fight and then make up. 

Now sib is gonna tell the lawyer and there’s gonna be issues. Or not- the lawyer might think it’s a ridiculous rule too and just overlook it. Can they do that?

I’m guessing this is about knees. 

And even an obese person needs those to walk. 

Painful knees while walking leads to less walking leads to weight gain. 
Sometimes it’s just a vicious never ending cycle. 

What if that painful knee was from a horrific accident that had someone laid up in a hospital for months? Should they have not eaten all that time to not gain any weight? 

Don’t judge, you probably have no idea what someone has been through.
YTA. 

It’s not for you to decide. They are the parents and they can figure out their own stuff. 
Pretty sure you just ruined your relationship with your future sil. 

the most logical solution is to move game night for the boys to brothers house. 

He keeps the kids and does what he needs to do in between playing.
He doesn’t even have to play he can just hang out with the guys. 
But at least everything he needs is in his own home. 
And his wife gets a needed time off to enjoy something just for herself. 

Who knows, he might even get some help with the twins if they both wake at the same time.
NTA for not wanting to spend v day as a double date. 

But  she really didn’t do anything wrong to you personally. 
Her parents enabled her and now her bf has to put up with her. 

Just tell your wife you want to spend the day with just her. That’s kind of the point if that particular holiday.
How did they even know you commented here? 
Do they go and look at every single person who has ever been on that site every day to see what they post? 

Sorry if this is a stupid Q, I don’t understand.
She cannot possibly think any kind of project that has anything to do with her time in the RF can help to worm herself back in!  

If anything the shut door will now be padlocked.
You’re assuming that anyone else knew. 

It’s not hard to announce a pregnancy, use the moon bumps all along, tell someone she went into labor when the surrogate actually did, and then present the baby. 

Do we know that she saw a royal dr? And there’s that weird remark from H that babies grow so much in2 weeks when they showed him publicly. 

And for all we know they could have contracted with a surrogate in a legal country. 

Idk where I stand on the real or fake pregnancies, but I wouldn’t put it past them to lie to everyone precisely because of the LOS issue. Gotta get that sweet, sweet royal heritage.
Oh I totally agree, we were young ( 23&26)

I’m happy to say it worked out tho, 33 years, 3 independent kids who are in no rush to marry, and we’re retired!  
We made it work, but we also were done with school, had a house and waited 4 years to start our family. 

Everyone has to do what works for them. I would never tell anyone to do what we did just because we did it.
So you shouldn’t. 

It’s actually very smart to wait if it’s for your education. I believe that a masters program only comes with a small stipend to live on, so how exactly would you and a wife, who I’m assuming is close to your age going to support a household? 
And of course the girl is going to be traditional also  and is going to want to have children too. The pressure from both families would be unbearable. 

Stick to your decision. I could not even imagine being married that young. ( and I married at 23!, but we were both already in our careers).
It’s not a big deal. That’s the point. 

H just wants to make it seem like it is. 

You know cause his witch of a wife is just so caring she would be able to comfort everyone - while taking copious notes on everyone and everything for her tell all. 🙄
I have found that the best way for me to retain info is to write it down. 

So in class, take notes. 

And then when you have to actually study for a test, re write what you need to know. Organize it so it makes sense to you. 

The act of writing it helps to retain it.
NTA for initially being angry, but at this point when she brings it up you’ve got to not engage with her. 
Just tell her you’re not having this convo again. It’s done and over and she can either get over it or get out. 

Why did she go thru your phone? 

7 mo in she has no right to info about your money. 

If she lost all trust in you, then that was the time to break up. 
You’ve been rocky since then, so you have to decide if this is what you want or not. 
Any relationship that is that much strife and aggravation isn’t worth it to me.
I didn’t mean to disparage your step mom, but it’s human nature for her to prioritize her bio kids. 

It’s worth at least a convo with your dad.
Don’t ask questions you don’t want the answer to!  Especially during sex with your wife- never mind you going soft, I would have kicked you out of the bed. 

But really, what she did  with her time and body before being committed to you is none of your concern. 

You are a grown man, stop pouting that you didn’t get the girl first. 
You were gone for years. Was she supposed to sit home pining for you?
YTA

The problem I see is that even if you are still contributing your 50% share to expenses, that money is coming out of somewhere/ either your savings or your retirement funds. 
Great that you have them, but at some point they will run short or be depleted. 
At that time you will be expecting your partner to pay all expenses. 

Do you realistically have enough of your own independent money to support half of this household for another 30 years? Because you very well could live that long. 

Your combined cash and investments seems like a lot, but half of that ( let’s say your half if it’s evenly contributed) is 750,000. 
750,000 divided over 30 years is only $25,000 per year. Obviously with no growth. 
Is that enough for you to cover your half for 30 yrs?
How about when your partner retires, will your own money be enough to travel if you feel like or to do whatever you two have talked about?  

You need to add some income to this partnership if you want it to remain happy and healthy.
Yea you should bring it up to your dad. 
Not in a confrontational way but more in a, maybe he doesn’t realize this, way 

He might be under the impression that step mom would be a decent person and split the inheritance when she passes equally, when there isn’t any guarantee of that. 
Point out that the majority of his and wife’s assets are from him  and not her. 
Ask him if he’d be ok with his bio kids being totally cut out when step mom passes and does he really think she’d have any sense of loyalty to kids that aren’t hers. 

The most equitable way is for him to leave half to step mom if he predeceases her and half to his bio kids. 
Then step mom can divvy up her assets to her kids when she passes.
You say he didn’t want another child and left his ex wife to completely raise his younger son by herself. 

Does this mean that he is involved with the first one?
Yes that’s what it means. The ship won’t actually leave Cape Town till 4 on sat. And then you dock in richards bay on Tuesday and the boat leaves the next day at 9 pm. So you can usually stay out as late as you want before returning to the ship to sleep. 

I’m not sure how embark would be tho. Do you actually have to board as usual, (which would mean be on board at least 2 hrs prior to departure time)do the muster and then are free to get off and explore.  Of course usually people get in the ship way before the 2 hrs prior. 

Might just want to ask that. You don’t want to show up at 5 pm, with your bags and check in was meant to be done earlier.
Just leave her alone about this topic. 

She’s 19, a lot can change as she gets older. 
I’m surprised one day with kids did it actually. Most people would have the attitude of “my kids won’t be like that” or recognize 4 kids is too many. 

Maybe she’s actually onto your little ploy and is screwing with you. That would be hysterical.
That quote from your dad is great!  

I’m filing that away to use if I need it.
You are being completely irrational on this issue. 

They don’t see each other on a regular basis, they live far away from each other so I’m guessing at this point they phone or text each other, probably when there’s something to say other than an ongoing keeping up with each others lives. 

Why is this one person so threatening to you?  I’m sure there’s other people that your bf has dated or hooked up with in the same city you live in where it would be more probable that you would run into. 
Could it be that you are jealous that he has such a lifelong friend who probably knows more about your bf than you do? K knows everything your bf has done and thought since grade school. It’s not a nice thought that someone else knows your partner that well but it’s also a testament that your bf can keep a relationship going for so long. That’s good for you in the long run. 

Your bf may say he’ll be ok cutting contact but somewhere in his mind he’s going to be sad that his one constant in his life is gone. That might lead to him unconsciously resenting you because you’re the reason for that severing of ties. 

You should meet K with a complete open mind. You may hate him for legit reasons, or you may just find that he’s a genuinely good friend to your bf. And your fears, whatever they are, will be alleviated. 

A lot for you to think about here. But don’t borrow problems that aren’t there.
That age gap? It’s gonna become a gaping chasm. 
I have a friend who married with a 20 year gap. She was spry and adventurous into her late 40’s (bad knees got her) he was all but housebound, happy to stay home with the pets, he was tired and the health issues started cropping up. 

That’s what you’ll get, caring for a 70 year old at 50. And if you have kids? 
You’ll have a 70 yo H and a teenager. 

He’s a 50 yo mean man with health issues who thinks he hit the jackpot 
with his much younger gf. 

And what do you get out of this? You get to be his nursemaid when his ills come up and you get to take the brunt of his nastiness. 

cut your losses, find someone closer to your age and in the same stage of life. You two can grow old and sickly together, but he’d probably be a lot nicer to you.
Who are the same forces that are controlling J Epstein? 
I thought he was top of the food chain?

You’re N. T. A for wanting bro out but 
I have a diff take. 

Your H bot the house. Are you an owner also? I understand being married but it will make a big diff to BIL if you tell him what’s gonna happen. The whole fam will be told YOU threw him out and it’s not even your house. ( just saying what BIL will say, not that it’s true)

You are more than expected to shut him down with any rude comments he may make. And shut him down hard! Find anything you can that he may be sensitive about and use it. 

But your  H is the one who should be handling his brother as far as moving out. You and him have to get on the same page, and he needs to deliver it to bro.
 NTA

he needs to find a new psych.  And get his own prescription. And if he has no insurance he’s going to have to it for the visits. 

It’s ridiculous that you’re sharing medicine. One of these months you are going to really need it and it’s not going to be there. Then it’s gonna be a big problem. 

And if he’s taking 3 a day how many are left for you? It’s nice that you might not need all of it, but why should you not have it when you do need it
That’s fair. Sorry I was trying to see if there’s a pattern of behavior. 

You know him best. Think back and ask yourself-
Is this how he always was?
If yes then in a way you allowed him to think you’d always do the work and he’d benefit from it. 
Then a division of chores needs to be struck and he has to agree to then. If he doesn’t, there’s your answer. He will not ever change. 

If he used to be a more involved partner-
Then you need to figure out what happened that he suddenly took a turn for the worse. 

Do a huge self reflection on the whole of your relationship, thru all of it. See if there were things you missed, or you overlooked thinking he’d be better or do better as time went on. 

You’re so young and it’s scary when your life is not turning out how you thought it would.  It can get better but he has to be willing. And he, at 27 should be acting like a H and father. Instead he’s acting like a teenager who has a part time job for gas money. 

Do not be afraid to break up if you think it’s the best for everyone involved, including your baby. I will add, if the issue with your fam was due to something about him and you chose him, it might be time to mend that relationship. Best of luck to you.
I’m gonna need to know what happened with your parents.
Where did you live before this apt? 

I really do not know why you would even entertain the idea of staying with him at this point. 

He doesn’t have a full time job, he doesn’t help you with anything, he’s semi neglectful with your 8 mo old probably because he’s too preoccupied with gaming and when you finally had the guts to call him out for all that- he pushes you. 

How much are you willing to put up with? How far is too far? 

My advice, go back to your parents, tell hubby he needs to become a self supporting stable adult if he wants any type of relationship with you. 

Then hold him to it. He needs a full time job, and he needs to be able to support an apt on his own. A couple sessions with a therapist would be a bonus. Maybe he’ll realize he’s a father and he needs to become a partner in this marriage.
You should have just told her you weren’t going  to see her again after you found out she had a bf. You don’t have to be mean about it, what she does is her business. 

You might have thought by blocking her it was a slight to her, but it didn’t slight her in the least. She’s looking for an explanation. Give it to her, tell her to leave your friends alone and then the block her.
This is a really nice picture. You’re very talented.
Who isn’t remembering your bday?

It’s crappy if your parents or sibs forget, but any relatives past that is whatever. 

If it’s your friends, why would they remember your bday?

In either case, if your bday is important to you, I can’t imagine why you had not said anything leading up to the week or day. 

Usually something is mentioned about plans that you’d like to do for the day
Honestly, your friend should just leave Jane alone. 
Like, who just thinks, “hm which of my friends can I experiment with?” 
Why would friend think Jane would be receptive to this idea? 

Add to it that she’s probably feeling emotionally vulnerable right now, not having her sister as her go to. 

Friend is coming off a bit creepy to me.  It’s giving me the ick.
Thanks
Please explain because I have no idea. 

Even if it’s court ordered, it doesn’t mean that they have to come to an agreement right? 
Samantha could just not agree to any kind of settlement and then it goes to court? 

Or can she agree to a settlement and then release any evidence she would have shown at trial? That wouldn’t be the worst thing, but then we won’t get to see the M testify.
This story gets even weirder. 

You hunted for 2 hours. You got the kids and then went home by when 7pm?

Did she cancel just so you could come home and she could fight with you over this?

Did the friend cancel and she thought she’d be home all night alone? (Which really is a good thing considering 2 small kids and being pregnant. Most of us would have been thrilled!)

Somethings off about her reasoning. 
Let this go this time but know you did nothing wrong. You tried to do something nice for your wife.
NTA

I’m not sure I’m understanding why your wife is upset?
She still went out with her friends no? So she got a kid free night out. Unless her friend also has kids and they were going to entertain each other. 

It seems to me that you both got to do something you wanted and the kids got time with the grand parents. Win win win for everybody.
If she has no underlying issue then honestly, I don’t wouldn’t have a problem with messy rooms. They have to live with it. 
( I have the king of messy kids- the clothes literally are on the floor right next to the laundry basket!) 

Don’t pick up her clothes, and if she doesn’t already, she should be doing her own laundry.  When she runs out of underwear she’ll figure it out. 

If she steps on her art supplies and ruins them, they won’t be replaced until the next gift giving occasion ( bday, Xmas), unless she buys it herself. 
If she can’t find something she needs amongst the rubble, she’ll have to plow thru it all to find it. 

The place I absolutely draw the line is any food stuff. 

So I would  literally close her door to the mess as long as the boundary becomes absolutely zero food or drink ( other than water) is allowed in her room. 

At some point I get life she will realize that being that messy is a gross way to live.
As much as H gives lip service to ending “ generational pain”, he just cannot see the harm he is doing to his own kids. 

His kids are going to grow up with a very angry dad who blames all his woes on anybody else, who has zero self esteem and a mom who can think of no one but herself. 
Meanwhile both parents are at least recreational drug users. 

Those things are going to make for two kids who feel unloved by both parents and anxious kids walking on eggshells around their dad at least. 

They think they’re so enlightened, but they have no clue how to raise happy, healthy, well adjusted kids. 

It’s a shame really, those kids could have had the best of everything
Those are going to be the longest years of your life. 

Maybe a sit down with d and bf is in order. There are certain things he just cannot say and do and demand while in your home. 
You all have to live together, and respecting each other is paramount.
Why exactly is your D’s 25 yo bf living with you?

Are they going to be able to support themselves after they marry or are you going to have to house them too? 

He needs to go. 

I love my 20 something kids but if they want to play house, they have to do it in their own house.  He’s been there a year already, what’s the plan?
Im not overly thrilled with this age gap. Not that you’re so old, but she’s too young for you. 

It’s 3 months, it’s not some long term thing happening. You should break up with her and tell her to go see her school counselor to get some help with what’s going on at home and her self harm. 

You cannot keep dating her because you’re afraid she’s going to hurt herself. She never said that so don’t add to the drama.
Let him keep walking. 

These are YOUR kids- you make the rules. If he doesn’t like it, too bad. 

Do not let your kids see that you are changing the rules because of what he says or does. They need to see you standing up for them.
NTA

Her son is having some issues, enough that his dad travel 5 hours to be there for and her biggest concern is she needs a massage? 

She needs her priorities straight. 

Leave at the agreed time and if she’s not in the car she takes the train home.
Do not rush into their room the second they make a sound on that stupid baby monitor!  ( of course go in when they are actually crying) 

Why? Because they will never learn to self soothe themselves back to sleep if you keep going in and bothering them while they’re sleeping! 

Learned the very hard way.
I kind of get the feeling H was too weak, meek, scared, idk, to actually think about distancing himself from the RF, and when he found a woman who was telling him all the ways it was possible, he jumped on it. She gave him ( in his mind) plausible reasons to leave and he didn’t have to do it all on his own. 

If he had thoughts of not having the life he was born into, ( cause his birth did come with an expectation) he couldn’t even fathom how he could make that a reality. But suddenly someone showed him how. 

That they made a complete and utter mess of it is another story.
You might want to post this in r/ texas. 
Someone who lives there may be able to answer. 

This forum is for help using reditt.
Wait tho, I thought megans friends initially leaked not the actual letter, but a paraphrasing of it, to people magazine and then her dad allowed some other publication to see it and they printed a big part of it? No? 

If that’s not what happened then what did?
No. It’s been 3 months, if you’re not into her chances are you won’t ever be. 

Would you want to be with someone who describes you like you describe being with her?  Someone who is repulsed by kissing you?

Let her go now before she gets even more invested in you. 

And since you’re young I’ll add, do not tell her you  dont and never did feel anything for her.  Just say it’s not working for you, you think she’s a great person, but not “your” person.
NTA

you need to do two things

- get a court order for child support
- petition the court to allow you to move out of state for school. 

He may not be involved now, but if you pick up and move, are you sure he won’t say you kidnapped the child? You don’t need more problems.
Your financial situation all stems from giving up any assets in the divorce. 
If he’s such a good guy, maybe you should ask him to give you back your half. 
See what he says, if he wants you out that’s how it can be done. And then you can get the therapy you need. 

What happened to your well paying job? 

As for Jenna and the friends, they’re out of line. Did you tell ex what they said? And why would he have those people over, knowing you’re in the house. He didn’t tell you they were coming and he didn’t tell them you’d be there. What’s his game?
YTA    for not giving your H a heads up. 

I think son is seeing how dad is with the sister and is feeling like dad isn’t  doing as much with him now, at this age, as he is with sister. It may just be that dad thinks son doesn’t need as much from him and sis does, just by virtue of their ages. 

But it may be bringing up abandonment issues for son- his bio dad didn’t want anything to do with him, and step dad was ok, but not as paternal with him, so he’s not really a son to a dad. 
Is it true? We don’t know, but son has the perception that it is. 

You said dad went to games, played with son, etc, so you need to figure out why your son all of a sudden feels dad is not dad enough. 

I think you did your son and your H a disservice by claiming rights to “your” son, so while H did as much as he did, he may have stopped himself doing more  because he was afraid he’d cross some line with you, not with the son he feels is his own. 

You need to let H know what’s going on so the two of them can talk about it. Your son might actually realize that the dad he wanted was and is actually the dad he got.

It’s not unreasonable to ask for quiet at a certain time of night. I dont know why that would bother you so much. 
Stomping up the stairs and slamming the door did not just bother James, but probably every other resident of the house. 

Taking out the trash is part of contributing to the upkeep of the home you live in. If you lived with anyone else or even alone, you would have to do some basic chores in the house. 

I don’t know how much of your stuff you had in the LR, but if it was becoming unwieldy then yeah, everyone else shouldn’t have to live around your stuff. 

Im not commenting on the parking bc I really can’t even figure out what’s going on there. 

Do you think you should just be able to do whatever you want, whenever you want when you share a house with others? It’s called respect for your roommates, you need to have some.
And she remembered that one convo exactly? 

It’s a dead giveaway that it didn’t happen like that. 
At least paraphrase it, say it went something like…

And I thought there was no conflict until they were at the fitting? Now we’re supposed to believe there was already a problem before the fitting? And that C started it? And that charlotte cried as soon as she put it on- she’s 3. She might not like the idea of trying any dress on, but she wasn’t crying over the fit of it. 

If C had the dress at home and it didn’t fit, wouldn’t she just get it altered.

Oh and of course this whole thing had 
Meg sobbing on the floor - again. 

Maybe she washes the floor with all the tears she sheds while she’s down there. Multitasking
Better to check it out. Hoping all turns out well.
That struck me as odd. 

Like are they sending contracts back and forth in a negotiation?  

This statement makes zero sense.
So I don’t think either of the two directly leaked to the press. But I do believe they had other people do it. 

So I’d like to see a journalist be a real journalist and piece together how the story got to them and that the only way it’s possible is thru the Sussex camp. 

They probably won’t come out and name names, but they can infer who the person was and that would only lead back to them. 
Example: if it came from scobie, they can say something about the book he wrote, or being their main mouthpiece or something. 

It won’t shut H up about leaks but he again will be shown to be the ass that he is for spouting off crap he doesn’t have a clue about.
You’re going to have to describe this painting a bit more. 

There must be something about it he finds offensive. Or maybe he just thinks it’s ugly.
But is it just that she’s not following the religion? 

Or is it more likely that he’s pointing out that she doesn’t have to be religious, but she shouldn’t be mocking his religion in his own home. 
If she didn’t want to pray she should have done the adult thing and respectfully decline, not make a mockery of it. 

The bf didn’t even blink and was willing to pray, probably
out of respect that these are his gf’s parents and we don’t know if he is religious or not. 

D is flouting her independence, which 19 yo’s will do and dad isn’t happy about how she’s going about it. 
That needs to be a conversation where dad recognizes her as an adult, and D equally acts like an adult. 

Her praying to her god bf should have been pretty cringy to everyone, bf included. He’s old enough to recognize the immaturity of his gf. He whispered to her probably to tell her to apologize. I wonder if he had anything to say to her when they got home.
And that’s your fault how exactly? 
Pretty sure he deals with this, idk, every year? Does he become unbearable to everyone or just you?

Anyway, NTA

So now, you’re already weak and can’t drive. I’m going to assume tomorrow won’t be any better because you dont have the meds you need to keep you stronger so is he gonna get them tomorrow? Or do you just wait for winter when it cools down a bit? 

He’s not really a good partner. If these meds are a life long thing how can you trust he’ll take care of you in the future, or if your condition gets worse?
I was thinking you were talking about booking thru DVC because you referenced the 11 month mark. Which is when as a dvc you can start booking. 

If you weren’t then disregard most everything I wrote because it will not apply. 

I haven’t made a cash stay at Disney but if the booking window only opens at the 11 mo mark, then the advice to be ready at exactly that day and even as close to the hour as possible would still apply. 

Sorry if I confused you.
I’m a little confused. 

They want to figure out why so many others of their own party ( but really it’s Jan 6 ppl and trump) are being investigated- as opposed to what? 
Just sweeping it under the rug and not investigating? Or are they saying these are not legitimate investigations and are more being done based on party politics? 

If you break the law you get investigated and probably/ usually/ maybe charged. 

I’m getting a little sick of Congress investigating anything. They investigate while ongoing investigations are being done by other law enforcement agencies. It’s just redundant.If I was an innocent witness, I’d be overwhelmed being grilled by LE and Congress.
As long as you have enough home points at either or both resorts, You should absolutely be ready to book at the exact hour at the 11 mo mark. 

(Check to make sure but- I’m pretty sure you can’t combine your poly and WL points to use at either resort at 11 mo. You’d have to use for instance, your poly points at poly at 11 mo and then add to the res using your WL points at the 7 mo mark. Because one of them isn’t your home resort at the other resort.). I hope that makes sense! 

Keep in mind if you’re looking around at 2023 summer availability to get an idea of how it is, it’s already past the 11 mo and close to the 7 mo mark so you won’t get an adequate comparison. 

If you’re looking at 11 mo out availability just to see what it looks like in 2023, it’s not a good comparison because it’s a diff month and season. (If I’m doing it right that puts you in late Nov, early Dec which is prime time)
What change exactly are they fighting for? 

Do they think just because they are an interracial couple they can eradicate racism by what? just being a couple?  
If it was that easy it would have been gone decades ago. 

Exactly what injustice has been done to them? Megan got some bad press? Well welcome to the world of a public figure. It happens to any and everyone who has a public profile. 

These two think that just because they WANT  to be seen as doing no wrong no one is allowed to call them out when they do wrong. 

Anybody else just getting bored of the whole thing? I come here to keep up but it’s just a never ending circle jerk. 
And if no one reported on them they’d just do something even more outrageous to be back in the news and start the whole cycle over again. 

( yes I realize how that sounds as I’m commenting on them but it’s just all so absurd 🤷‍♀️)
These two are so dramatic. 

Any visit they would have in the U.K. for any royal engagement, they’d take a private plane ( cause they could never fly commercial) and be driven to whatever royal house they’d be staying at. Their security guard they already employ could travel with them. 
Once there, they have regular security  for the house, compound, grounds, etc that’s already in place anyway. 
Then when they have to get to the engagement, they’d be traveling with all of the rest of the family that would have security. 

There is literally no way anyone could get to them- not that anyones coming! 

They really think they’re all that huh?
YWNBTA

it’s time you sit your mom down and lay out some facts that she either gets on board with or she doesn’t come. 

These people have done nothing wrong and have actually been good to you. I think it’s great that you can have at least some of her dads fam in her life. 

Tell your mom that going forward its joint everything and that includes your fil,  she doesn’t have to like everyone that you choose to be friends with but she sure has to respect your relationships with them. 
Her crying over this stuff is so over the top, its childish. The longer you allow it to go on the worse it will get.
7 months on and off, - this is not a relationship that’s going well, no? 

Cut your losses now. She’s gonna find something else to fly off the handle for and you’ll be equally as baffled as this time. 

And her following you is odd. She was probably worried you were snooping in her room, because you were taking longer than usual because of the spill. which then also explains why she sent you out and she stayed behind, to make sure everything was in its place. 
Do you want someone who doesn’t trust you?
Why are we even discussing KC paying her off?  
He owes her nothing, not even ransom to get his son back. 

If H suddenly decides he needs out, then he can go thru the divorce court on his own and they can fight it out.
So basically H just refuses to listen to any criticism of anything his bro and dad say about M, megxit, and bullying, 
But when the bro and dad refuse to listen to his counter argument, they’re in the wrong. 

He just refuses to believe that she can be anything but an angel. And that’s why he’s in the position he’s in. 

The 25 page bullying rebuttal is probably filled with excuses- she’s American, she didn’t know, that’s not how she does things, she’s “direct”, not rude, etc. 

But it doesn’t matter, she joined a family that has rules, regulations and a way things are done. You can’t come in and expect them to change for you. And that’s what they wanted, they wanted to “modernize”an institution that doesn’t need modernizing, because to the witch that means making the BRF a money making merchandiser. 

And once again, this is why the fam doesn’t want to talk to him, because there is nothing private.
I’m gonna be brutally honest with you-

You willingly got into a relationship with a man who cheats and leaves every relationship he’s ever had, and to placate him you decide to have an open relationship. Which really, in this situation is just you agreeing to let him cheat. 

How exactly did you think this was not going to end any other way than with him leaving you? 

Did you think as long as he was having sex with other women he would always come back to you? 
Why would you want a life of sharing the person you love with multiple others? 

And the worst part?  You brought your then 9 year old ( at the time, who grew up in this situation) along for the ride! 
Think about what you’ve been modeling to your D. 
Do you want her to hitch herself to men who cheat and leave? 
Or do you want to model a monogamous loving relationship which is what you should be striving for? 

You know what you have to do, find some self respect and leave his sorry ass. Stand up for yourself and show your D now, while she’s just starting to figure out relationships what she should and shouldn’t be accepting from a partner.
What’s wrong with his health? 
I haven’t heard of anything.
Everyone already thinks Andrew is  scum, so writing unflattering stories of Andrew insulting or upsetting either one of them isn’t going to elicit any sympathy for H&M. 

Or, Andrew knows way too much about her past antics 

Or, he’s not high enough on the pecking order, knocking him down a peg or two isn’t gonna elevate H to king, 

Or, he needs to stay in Beatrice’s good graces to get the inside scoop. 

Or, most probable, Andrew just doesn’t care enough to have any dealings with the lunatic fringe of the family. He saw the train wreck coming and noped out.
Seriously tho, where did he get the hair? 
Did he cut it off her head in the coffin?
Did she give it to him after a haircut?

And why would he even want it? 
Did he need it to make a witches potion? 

I’m so baffled by this hair in a box.
YTA. A Massive massive one. 

There is no excuse for a 7 yo to smear lipstick all over anything. 
Your D showed great restraint in only yelling at the little brat. 

The one who should be punished is Layla. She has been told repeatedly to leave your D’s stuff alone and she keeps repeating the offense with no consequence. 

You cannot expect your D to lock up everything she owns every single day and night in her own room that you moved her SS into because you wanted to marry her mother. Stop bending over backward to placate your wife and her kids. That’s ridiculous. 

What is wrong with you? How did you ever parent your own kids since it seems you’re clueless. 

Give your D back her phone, buy her a new dress and punish the 7 year old. 

Stop making your 16 yo teach the 7 yo what her mother should be teaching her. 
Oh and of course your wife thinks the punishment is fine, her little angel of a
d should never be made to cry!  


Be a better parent to your D.
Come on man, you went to the best schools from the age of 3. Are we to believe that you never ever had a lesson on Hitler and the Nazis?  

Does he really expect us to believe that he had absolutely zero idea that costume was not just offensive, but it’s one of those absolutely do not do things. 

The fam def paid way too much for his education.
At this point the longest or shortest ( idc) serving independent. 

Enough with D and R. 

It stops the circus that’s happening now.
I think willy and Harold are honestly just snarky nicknames that had for each other as kids. 

I could see Harry calling him Willy, as in “dick” and W calling him Harold because it’s like an old man name  
They’re were just making fun of each other as kids.
NTA
I agree, it wasn’t your secret to tell. 

Your wife is now realizing that her idea of honesty is telling everyone everything and that now that she sees the flip side of it, she will change her ways. This is a good thing. 

She should let your d know that she realizes why d wouldn’t tell her and that now that she sees the repercussions of her flawed strategy she will respect whatever d chooses to share with her. 

This could turn out to be a good thing.
Nono you got it all wrong! 

Megsie was the one wronged by all members of the family, the media, her ex husband, her ex bf’s, her dad, her siblings, in all things ever!   
They all caused the strife that was blamed on her!  

And she’ll keep saying it until we all agree with her.   🙄
Good point. You’re right. They probably laid it all out for him.
And leaving out the details is what makes him look like a whining child. 

I’m sure C had a legit reason for not wanting M there, (and even if it’s that he wanted just immediate family,) 

H can’t say what that reason he was given because it would make him look bad to argue about it. So he leaves it out thinking it will make C look like the bad guy, but of course that would never happen because C can dictate whatever the hell he wants in regards to his mothers death.
What’s meant by this:

“It’s not hard to see why Prince Harry and Meghan Markle decided to leave England amid all this drama and tension, and we haven’t even gotten into Harry and William’s physical fight—which you can read about in detail below:”

The drama and tension was started by Harry and Megan. With their over entitlement, with their feelings of superiority, their jealousy of every other working royal. 
Dont want drama and tension, don’t start it.
You need to keep working on your jealousy issues or they will come into play and ruin every other relationship you will have in the future. 

Take your jealousy issue as the lesson you learned from this relationship and use that thought as motivation to move on and be thankful that this happened at a young age instead of having a string of failed relationships. 

In the future, I would advise that you not spend all your time with a partner. It’s not healthy for anyone. 
It’s not sustainable in the long run. 

It’s not that you can’t move in because you’re so stuck on this o e girl, it’s that you have no idea what to do with the time you normally spent with her. 
Find a hobby, read a book, do a puzzle, anything so you don’t just sit like a lump on a log and pine away for someone that doesn’t want to be with you.
After the book, if there’s more vague crap, the palace can legitimately make a statement saying something to the affect that - 

even though the K will always have a fathers love for a son, its become quite obvious that H & M are doing their level best to distance themselves from the family. For the celebration of the coronation, the K has decided that he will adhere to their want of distance. 

Idk something diplomatic without coming out and saying no one wants them here. 

No one is ever going to think it has anything to do with race. That horse is dead, beaten, dug up, beat some more and reburied.
Most telling to me is this passage. 

“Harry then accused his brother of acting like an heir, unable to understand why his younger brother was not content to be a spare.”

This is the crux of H, he admits it. 

All of his moaning and it all comes down to the fact that he isn’t going to be king. 

Too bad, so sad. 30+ years and he still hasn’t come to terms with it.
I think being a global icon is her goal. 

She thought she hit the jackpot when she bagged the dimwit. She really thought that overnight her name would be recognizable to everyone and every possible door to fame and fortune would be opened for her. 

So basically she thought she’d be an icon for basically getting married. 

In reality, she’s half of a couple with a victim complex who people are sick of hearing from and about.
I think an invictus show would have been interesting to watch - 

IF and only IF- 

H was actually working with an organization to benefit and help veterans. If he did that and it got even minimal press, I think ppl would tune in. 

It seems to me that he hosts the games and then disappears. There’s zero follow up on the athletes, the help they get, nothing. 

Idk anything about invictus, are they an organization that puts these games on, do companies sponsor the games, is it a money making endeavor? What do the athletes get out of competing in these games? 
(I thought I saw somewhere that somehow the RF was instrumental in starting it?)

These are the answers I would have liked to see answered from a docu of the games. 

If it’s just disabled vets competing in sports then what sets them apart from the Para Olympics?  I guess there’s something to be said for it being all vets.
So many arguments can be avoided if we just talk to each other. 

Everyone in my house knows when I’m going into the kitchen to cook, did you not know she was - in the kitchen making supper?-  
Did you not go in and ask what she’s cooking?  Was supper supposed to be a surprise?  Notice you didn’t mention or even suggest having something hot since they were out in the cold all day?  

Was she tired from being out doing an activity all day and just wanted to make something quick and easy? Quite possible. Or she planned that meal before they went skating and already had the ingredients. 

This is so petty by both of you. 

You shouldn’t have made a face and she shouldn’t be mad that you wanted to eat something else that you went and made.
That is exactly what I said. 

Those kinds of opp sex relationships are the only ones that are acceptable
To cut contact with.
I’m not sure how unpopular this really is. 

If you cut contact with one or two of the opposite sex for an actual reason, like they’re you’re sexting partners who you don’t have an irl friendship with, then maybe it’s not a bad idea, if it’s your decision. 

But cutting all contact just because is ridiculous. 
Even more cringy is your new partner demanding that you cut contact with anyone of the opposite sex, can’t even like someone’s picture or make a comment, - those people need a huge dose of reality. But I think these cases are more a result of immaturity.
 Nope- one hit and I’m out. 
I don’t care what you said to him. 

It really is that simple.

I could see him saying he had no idea what was going to happen at the coronation and that he had no choice but to say those words since he was put on the spot. 

He’ll use the excuse that since nobody is talking to him, they didn’t explain what was going to happen at the coronation. He just showed up thinking it would be like a church service or something! 

Could you just imagine? The stupidly is endless.
I agree with checking but then why would the h not be experiencing any issues. It’s only her. 

If he goes out of the house to work and she stays home, could it affect her that much more, I don’t really know.
Honestly, it’s not that hard to poke your head into whatever room they’re in to say hello when you get to your bf house. You dont have to roam the house to find both of them, but if they’re in the living room or kitchen, its not that hard to do. 
My kids SO do that every time, and then they go to their room. 

The dog incident, you should have had a lighthearted comment about it- “ would have been nice to know before she eats my hand” or something. 

Did you say hi to his mom at work or were you waiting for her to engage you? If you’re still at work go over and say something, anything. Start the conversation. Maybe say you bf told you why she’s annoyed and apologize. Tell her you’ll do better from now on. 

This should blow over, but going forward make sure you say hello, it’s just common courtesy. 
And please don’t stay over so much, even if you don’t think it, it does disrupt the “flow” of the house.
I see where you’re coming from, I really do. And could understand where many people would have the same outlook as you. 

But the royal family is not a govt, it’s not a political body, they have no legislative power. 

they are however a focus of national identity and pride, with a huge focus on service. it is a thousands year old tradition that I would say has changed with the times as they are no longer the rulers of nations. 

Now, if Harry wants changes to the BRF or the monarchy, I have not seen one example of what he wants to change. 
Have you? Because if he did, I missed it. 

Being a rebellious teen is nothing new but it’s a far cry from airing every perceived slight you have ever had in your life. 

And again, what terrible attacks has Megan be subjected to? 

The paper that printed the “Compton” thing was chastised for it. 
The tiara issue is in line with protecting the actual “royal jewels”. 
The issue of who made who cry happened, it wasn’t some made up story. Someone let it slip, but M and Kate weren’t the only ones there. Something happened and neither you or me know the real story. 
The fact that M cut off her whole family is true. It’s human nature to want to know why and the media is right in trying to delve into why. She was a very popular person at the time and most people thought it was a horrible thing for her, as in, what could they have possibly done to her for her to take so drastic a measure. 

On the flip side, there is no video evidence that they are or were being relentlessly pursued by paparazzi, which they claim. 
There is no verifiable info that anyone said or made any racist overtures to her, which they claim. 
According to them the proposal could be two diff times, 
-they were married 3 days earlier ( proven lie), - they didn’t help with the finding freedom book, that’s a proven lie, - there were leaks I agree, I’m just not convinced every single one of them were coming from the palace. So what benefit could M&H have for leaking some themselves? Hmm…

There’s just a lot, I mean, a lot of discrepancies when they come out with their stories. Some probably have a grain of truth, but the embellishment goes way beyond. 

We’ll agree to disagree. And do it in a polite, civilized way. And that’s a good thing.
Ok, I’m gonna say this not to be mean but just as a thought since you haven’t given us much insight to your actual level of commitment. 

You were dating 3 months which isn’t very long. 
He’s been gone for most of your relationship. 

You two have barely spent any of these 11 months together. ( if you even saw him at all since his deployment) 

I’m thinking he may not be thinking this is as serious as you. 
Time alone is not a good judge of the seriousness of a relationship, especially when you are apart.

Do I think he likes you? Sure he does, but not enough to rework his whole life around you. 
But is he sitting in his bunk pining away for you? Maybe not. 

Sorry, again, not trying to be mean.
We’re you dating before he went in? 
How long were you dating before he got deployed.
Thank you for the award!
Here’s my take on all this-

I’d point out that these aren’t 2 young people. 
Even when they met he was 32 and she was 34. Hardly the age of naive, change the world attitude. 
Both of them have years of life experience, and know the ways of the world. 
And he’s been in this family, has known exactly how it was run and worked and I don’t ever recall him speaking out previous to Megan about any toxicity.  
Note- he could have, I wasn’t and still not obsessed with everything royal. 

They lie,(proven), they imply,(never a definitive explanation of this person said, I said), they never show any proof of the so called leaks or planted stories, racist behavior or snub by anyone. 

Makes it kind of hard to believe what they say. And a lot of it is just so freakin silly and stupid stuff that if it happened in (your) real life you’d be thinking why are we even having this conversation. 

It’s tiresome at this point, 3 years since they left. They’re not going to change the way the monarchy works. It’s not their job. It was never their job. 
I don’t know why they ever thought it was. 

Add to this their idea that they were going to be advocates of climate issues, humanitarian issues, woman’s issues, whatever else and they have done exactly zero on any of these fronts. 

They have literally not done anything but whine and complain, and collect awards they did not earn. 

That’s why people don’t like them, not because of some fan girling of the royal family.
So he drops the idea that the family? or the palace? planted stories when there was some kind of conflict. 

Ok then-
You would think, any journalist with any journalistic integrity’s next question would be-
What was the conflict about and what story was planted? Can you give me an example? 

But of course, it never gets asked. And we’re back to again, accusations with absolutely zero evidence to back it up. 

And this is exactly why I do not believe a word they say. 

I believe there were conflicts either between members of the fam or even the palace,( bc that’s just the nature of relationships at some point) but I truly think the two of them wanted something, wanted to do something or go somewhere and they were rebuffed for whatever reason. 

So true to form for egotistical people, they went immediately to a conspiracy against them instead of, like a normal person, trying to find a way to compromise and make it work. 

And there were no leaked stories, these two did something while out and about and the press wrote about
it. Whatever it was showed them in not the best light. But instead of realizing they shouldn’t have done that, or said that, they jump right to it must be a leak or a plant. 

These two are so delusional, it defies any sense of rationale.
A couple things stood out as I read. 

Since the ultimate goal is for him to get his own apt, he’s essentially moving into your apt temporarily,  in that case I think he could make it a point to just not put meat or fish in the refig. 
Will it be a pain sometimes, yes it will, but it’s your apt. He can eat meat when you two go out, or pick up something from fast food on occasion, or if he really gets an urge for a steak on a random day he can pick 1 steak( note- 1) on the way home from work and cook it. Or he can get 1 burger from the butcher in the grocery store, basically just enough for him to eat that one meal at home. 
Yes it’s not as convenient as having these all in the freezer, but it is what it is. 

It will work as long as he fully agrees to all of this, with out moaning about it. And you need to have this convo now- not in the spring. He needs to know this is a non negotiable and agree to it. 

And then once he gets his own apt, you have to be ok with him having meat in his refrigerator or freezer. 

I’d also have him buy his own pans to cook any meat in. Just for your comfort if you need that. 

Also keep in mind it might take him a while to actually find a job in his field. Does he have a plan B in case that doesn’t happen?
Oh I don’t either, but I was thinking that’s the incident  OP was referencing.
So if he insinuated William cheated, 
- do we think William will need to make some sort of statement or
- do we think it’ll be written off as just another lie?

If he insinuated William didn’t marry for love and there was another he wanted instead, was there even ever another steady long term girlfriend that he dated? Who would believe that? 

No way I believe William made any racist remark about what the baby would look like. I dont know many men who would even think about it, seems more like something women would chat about, (in a nice way)
Ah, thank you!  Some kind of id makes so much sense. 

I’d guess that when the ADA for service animals came out there probably weren’t as many people faking, and I’m sure way less people needing ESA’s, so it probably wasn’t seen as needed because at the time who would ever question such a thing.
I thought you weren’t allowed to ask what service is being done, but I didn’t even know there were any papers that can be shown. So I learned something, thanks for that info.
Isn’t it true that there are no “papers” that show an animal is a service animal. So anyone with a pet can claim whatever they want. 

So the problem is, there’s no legal way to ensure that a service animal is actually one. And that’s why emotional support animals are being seen everywhere. 

In my opinion, a true service dog needs to have some kind of official papers that should need to be shown upon request to allow the animal into places that pets normally aren’t. 

I don’t think that anyone who actually needs a service animal would be put off having to show that it is an actual service animal.
Anyone who could find fault with something I do every single day is not someone I’d want to be with. 
Does he never mess up? I bet he does but you don’t point it out and rag on him for it. 

You both have some issues you’re not dealing with and if you want this or any other relationship to work you’re both going to have to get help to get to a point that you’re both mentally stable.   You don’t mention having any therapy but you both should be seeing someone.
Idk what you mean about getting a huge boost about rejecting men,- 

but doesn’t it make sense that one can be wanting to find a partner, but isn’t willing to be with just anyone who happens to be male ( or female, it goes both ways) 

Everyone is only going to date people they are attracted to. If they don’t meet anyone who they like then why date them?
 NTA

but your wife saying that you shouldn’t teach your kids to act a certain way so people will like them is correct. 

But that’s not what you’re doing in this instance. You aren’t fundamentally changing who your d is, you’re pointing out that lateness, when boiled down, is really about not valuing the person you are meeting, and that friends will want to be valued and not made to seem like their time isn’t important. 

You wouldn’t ask your d to change her clothes, hair, hobbies or opinions to fit in- those are the things that make your d who she is. You’re just making her see that other peoples time is as important as hers. 

Try explaining it that way to your wife.
Listen to your mom. 
We always discount her opinion but ultimately they are right. 
She knows what she sees, she’s been thru it with your sisters. 

This relationship is just not working. 
It’s time to let it go for both of your sakes. 
It will be tough for a few months but you’ll get over him and be fine.
Yeah she’s being stupid. 
Maybe she enjoys the danger of it. Maybe she thinks is exciting. 
Whatever it is, you warned her. 

She’ll be crying soon because he dumps her and she caught feelings, 
Or she’ll be crying when she realizes he’s just using her for sex. 
Either way it’s gonna be ugly.
How does she know it’s really open? 

If she wants to continue with this guy she should ask to speak to his wife to make sure it is really an open marriage. 

In any event, why does she want to expend any energy on a man who is taken?
Why would you not immediately turn around and go home when he told you he was homeless. Was he homeless with his 2 kids that live with him? 
Like where did he think you were going to sleep? He had no car and 6 kids. 


Raise this baby alone. He is useless. 

He can’t even support himself, how do you think he’s going to support you?  You do not need the kind of support he is offering. 

You seemed to be doing ok before you blew all your money on him. 
Plus his kids are a mess. 

You will literally be moving into a nightmare. 
Please don’t do that to yourself and your child.
I have to know, the trip to England that you described, was that the only time you met him and was that when you got pregnant?
OMG, that sounds like pure hell. 
You have my sympathy. 

You’ve got a few months till Easter, really work on hubby to get him on board with a schedule that doesn’t 
have you running all the time.
When you want to talk about your struggles without her trying to fix it, you need to tell her you’re not looking for advice but to just open up to her because you trust her with these things and so she can understand where you’re coming from. 

As far as her opening up, maybe she doesn’t really have anything to open up about. Not everyone has or had struggles that they need or want to talk about. Or maybe she just doesn’t want to burden you with her stuff being aware that you have enough going on and doesn’t want you dwelling on her crap too. 

You can always go direct with her and tell her you want to develop a more intimate emotional connection and see what she says.
NTA

you need to have a conversation with your husband and decide what you want to do for all holidays next year. 
Decide on Easter, thanksgiving and both Xmas days. That’s four so it’s easy to split them between the 2 families. 

Don’t let him railroad you, hold your ground. If his parents have to see him every holiday then they can come to your house. 

Once you two have come to a decision, then you have HIM tell his mom what the plan going forward is. 

As an aside, I don’t know if Xmas eve is the holiday your family usually gets together for, and to add yet another wrench into the mix, you might want to do Xmas day at home so your kid(s) don’t have to leave their toys every Xmas. That’s the one thing my h always said sucked!  

As for this NYE, there would be no way in hell I would be having 5 pm dinner and then coming home and hosting a party. That’s insane. Send him to his moms for supper alone or with your son. They will survive not seeing you for a few hours.
Just have Kate send you your own invitation. Then you’ll be invited on your own, not included on your dad and sm’s invite. 

Then find another single fam member and share a room with them to cut your costs. 

You don’t think they want you to stay home to watch the 3 yo do you? 
That’s a big fat no!
Eatontown has the most retched people on the planet. 

I put all the docs I needed on the counter, spread out so she could see every one of them. 

That stupid miserable human wouldn’t pick my document off the counter. I had to pick them up and hand them to her one at a time. 

Haven’t been back since. I’ll go to Hazlet. Much more civilized there. 

But the inspection people are very nice. Especially the woman who works there.
NTA

but your bf and cousin sure are. 

What was he thinking? He doesn’t even know these people and he says crap like that?  

Your bf is disgusting. Why would you still want to date him.
YTA

If you can’t handle your mom being away while you open a letter how in the world are you going to survive being away at college? 

It’s past time that you learn to handle stuff on your own.
Try an audiobook. 

I also like to scan the radio to see what kind of music is played in diff parts of the country.
How old?

And have you never spent any time with these kids before?

Are they always a bit rambunctious? Or is it maybe being off of school and holidays and their schedules being out of wack have them a bit crazier than normal? 

You need to decide if you want to be with your bf bad enough to actually try to have a relationship with his kids. Actually, if you’re married, you’re already a step parent. Doesn’t mean it’s all on you but you can’t just ditch out whenever he has them. That’s a shitty thing to do. They won’t always be small and by the time they are old enough, they won’t want anything to do with you.
So I kind of agree with you but just because I don’t like oranges. 

And I’m not a fan of mixed fruit salad. There’s always one fruit that gets mushy and then it’s mixed in with the other still good fruit.

Ok yeah his reactions are sketchy. 

Can you ask for a family meeting just to clear the air a bit? Obviously you don’t want to live with any tension in the house, you want your mom to be happy but this whole situation is out of left field. 

Other than that, I’m out of ideas.
Since you’re getting nowhere with your mom, have you tried talking to him?  
Just at least to get a sense of him. 
If he’s a decent person he’ll understand if you preface with something like- “this is all new and odd to me, having my mom move a guy in so can we just have a chat about what’s going on here, considering I didn’t even know you two were having this ldr”. 

Like, what kind of job did he have, maybe he’s early retired and actually has some money? Or it could be he never had much of a career, which is a red flag. 
How olds the D? Does she live with the mom, is he planning on keeping up visits? Is he responsible at least to his D? 
Does he have family, siblings and does he get along with them. 

Then after a bit you can ask if he has any plan to get his own apt and job, you know sort of just live in the same city and date. You never really “know” a person just from online talking, he might realize he doesn’t actually like your mom. 

Can’t hurt to try. He might not even want to talk to you, which would be weird, or he may be fine with your obvious inquiry as to what’s going on. 
It’s def a strange turn of events in your moms part.
Okra. 
I tried to expand my veggie eating but okra was just gross!
Thank you!
Is he planning on getting a job at some point, his own apt? 

For arguments sake, let’s say your mom and him really like each other, fine, his lease is up so they decide to have him move closer so they can date 
This is all ok as long as he stays with her, but only until he can get a job, apt, and support himself. 

If this is what’s going on I’d say it’s crappy that she just sprung him on you, did you even know she was talking to this guy? 
Like did she mention it at all?
What a wonderful find. 

For my bridal shower my mom gave me a set of embroidered pillow cases that my grandma made for me. 

I had no idea they existed. It was a really nice sentimental surprise, she had been gone for a while by then. 

Oh and it’s been 33 years and I never used them. Idk why not, I think I just wanted them to stay nice.
Are you saying you are seeing something diff?

If so, I’d like to hear yours please 

I dont know anything about how tarot works but it would be interesting to see what differs.
While I agree she had to learn it somewhere, but I’m not convinced it’s from her dad. 

She seemed to have a regular upbringing by her dad, albeit one where she was spoiled which would give her an inflated opinion of herself. 

But once she decided to act is where I think she got the transactional idea. 
I would think it happens a lot in Hollywood, you do this for me, I do this for you. 

It started with Trevor  
I absolutely think she married Trevor for that transactional relationship- what he can do for her career, and all she had to do in return was be with him. When she had no use for him anymore he was discarded. 

Then it carried into everyone else she seemed to be “friends”with. 
Sophie, Markus, Corey. 

In every one of these relationships she was trying to do something that these people all were somewhat related to. 
Sophie and Markus for highbrow connections
Corey when she wanted to be a food blogger or whatever the heck she was trying to do. 

So with H, it was a case of this person has int’l recognition, is widely thought of as a decent person concerned with the environment and veterans and I want that too. 

Just a thought.
I think it’s a matter of access. 
If you always brought a person “ into the fold” , they can be family based 
on the person  bringing them in. 

My adult kids  have brought people around sporadically,  but if I know my kid is invested  in this relationship, I treat them as one of the fam. 
That’s what you do, you bring them In based on your child. 
But I welcome everyone.
NTA

it’s not like he helps with anything else involving your apt, so why would he think he’d have to help with your nephews?  

Seriously, he’s nothing but a mooch. 
All he pays for his his car and insurance - so basically just his stuff. 

Why are you allowing him to freeload off of you?
NTA

I don’t even know why there was any awkwardness. 

Wife had friends over, husband leaves to give the girls time to hang out. 

Now, if you told your wife in front of Jamie that you didn’t want her there, then it would be awkward, but I’m assuming that didn’t happen because, based on the rest of the post Jamie would have started something. 

Your wife really needs to start standing up to Jamie tho. The part about you and W not taking someone else’s grief seriously is just so out of line. And your wife’s voice raising thing is something you would think Jamie would know by now.
How old is the brother? 

Does your bf hang out with him on his own? 

If he’s a bunch younger than you guys he might not want to hang out with “ old” ppl ( not that you’re old, but to him maybe) 

If he’s closer in age, then it’s up to your bf to plan a get together so you two can get to know each other better. 

Either way I say just go, be nice. 
Don’t try to force a connection if it’s not there.
I just don’t understand why this wasn’t a conversation. 

Does he frequently make plans that you’re not invited to? 
Why can’t you and d go?  Brother is married so it’s not a boys thing?

Especially that he’s gone for NYE, since we were dating we’ve always spent NYE together. 

I don’t like your h at all.
NTA

You are already committed to be groomsman in the friends wedding. 

That’s a perfectly viable reason to miss the cousins wedding.
NTA 

But the second you walked in and saw the other dogs your H should have been the one to ask him mom what the deal was. 

Not you, him. 

It’s now days later, you and h are upset at her, she’s probably pissed because she didn’t see her son again and is of course blaming you, and the fact that she lied to you about no dogs coming this year has still not been addressed. 

It’s not gonna get better no matter what you do, but H should be pointing out any snubs or nastiness from his mom every single time.
I agree on the counseling. 
At this point your normal is explosive arguing and neither of you have any idea how to get out of this cycle. 

But also, as an idea, think back to your last argument that spiraled out of control and dissect it from beginning to end, try to recall exactly what was said and by who. 
Do this just for yourself, not to find who was to blame, but to try to see where the disagreement went off the rails. 
It’s always a good idea to have some kind of understanding of how things turn bad. 

Again, not to place blame, but to analyze  what the dynamic is like between the two of you and if you could have a do over, what would you have said instead that may have changed the course of the argument. 

A sort of self reflection.
He knows, but she doesn’t. 

It’s not like he’s leaking this crap. 
He has no idea half the time what she’s orchestrating. 

That doesn’t absolve him of going along with all of it after the fact tho. 
And I’ll bet once he figures out that it’s her she admits it, but what’s he gonna do? He can’t contradict her once it’s out there so he has to play the game. Her game.
I agree. 

There is no way back for them. 

He might be brought back, but not to the life he had. 

He’ll be treated like Andrew. Living a life far away from any royal duties. He may be invited to select things like Xmas church service, but that’s it. 
We’ll see him sporadically riding a horse or something. 

I’m not even sure if the fam will let the kids back if she gets unsupervised visits. H can’t be anywhere near her alone once / if he’s free of her grasp. 
Too much risk that he’ll say something that she’ll exploit
Just have her cut down on both the riding lessons and the rock climbing, unless she is competing in either sport. 

Neither of those two need to be done more than once if not competitive and money is an issue. 
She already knows how to ride and climb. After that it’s just for practice. 

Plus I think learning sign language is awesome.
You have got to be kidding with this!  

Your bf wants nothing more to do with you, you’re a cheater. 

Leave him alone. You can’t get him back. You don’t deserve him.
I couldn’t read the article so sorry if this was in it. 

It might be effective depending on what happens when you test positive. If you’re quarantined until you test negative, then maybe it will be effective. 


I think the bigger issue is since China isn’t very forthcoming with any data, they may have variants caused by mutations that the rest of the world hasn’t even seen yet. 

My biggest worry is a variant that is more dangerous that starts to spread. We’ll be back to the exact place we were at the beginning.
This is less about you and your sister and more about what your parents should be saying to your sister. 

They need to get her petty jealousy under control. 

She made her choice of schools and you made yours. It isn’t as if your parents denied her the choice. They need to explain that to her and tell her to knock off the rivalry. 

Your mom can’t stay neutral when this is affecting the whole household and you dad needs to do more than just be pissed at sister.
Maybe because he said they bonded over their shared military service. 
We don’t really know that OP even knew his grandpa had any money, or if he did, he assumed it would go to gramps child, ( op’s parent). 

OP was at his lowest and sought out the person who could relate to what he was going thru after his deployment. His visits could have started for that exact purpose, but turned into wanting to make sure his grandpa wasn’t alone in his last years. 
It’s possible he actually enjoyed visiting. 

I don’t think we can understand what OP went thru on deployment, and how having that outlet was probably vital to his well being. 

For all we know, grandpa might have wanted OP to have the money knowing he wouldn’t be around forever and wanted to ensure OP had the financial resources to get the help he needed in the future.
It’s happening whether you fear it or not, so just don’t dwell on it. 

Concentrate on the excitement of the baby. 

And like the other poster said, you don’t care about anything but getting that baby out of you. You’re just done being pregnant.
Obviously this relationship is not working.  Why would you want to put more effort in? 

Break up but take some time to get yourself straightened out. Nobody wants a sad depressed partner who won’t talk to them. 

Once you’re happy with and by yourself you can be a good partner to someone.
If he says he’s not very experienced I think in this instance you should believe him. 

It’s possible he thinks you expect him to be good at sex given his age, and since he doesn’t have much experience he knows he’s not and that makes him overthink and get nervous. 

You’ve also only been dating for 3 months, and as close as you are, he might still need to be even more comfortable with you to be intimate. 

Don’t stress over it, and don’t rush either.
The problem with roaches in an apt building is that even if your gf bombs her place with the strongest stuff she can find, she’s gonna get them back again because her neighbors will still have them. And roaches will eventually get back to hers. 
That’s why the whole building needs to be treated at the same time. And even then there’s no guarantee. 

Why didn’t you use the same stuff on your gf apt that you used on your place? 

Roaches aside, you’re mean to your gf. The coat incident was inexcusable.
I agree. I love a loaded salad. It’s a complete meal.
YTA

So you make your gf leave your place after seeing one roach, and that made her cry, but then call her back to open presents?  

Then you gift her a used coat and when she doesn’t want to wear it to this party you make her feel bad about it and tell her you’ll give it to someone else?  Of course she’s gonna cry. 

What’s wrong with you?  Do you even like your gf?  

She cannot help the roach problem, you do know that right? I’m sorry one hitched a ride over to your place, but it happens. 

Then you get insulted she won’t wear the coat because she wants to wear the other one she also just got and you go off on her?  
Leave her alone or be a nicer person.
Ok so not a therapist. Makes the scene a bit better at least. 

But also, not really therapy. More like a self help audiobook. 

Thanks.
I didn’t watch past episode 1, but what kind of therapy is this? 

And what ethical therapist would agree to have another person in a session taping it?  
What kind of explanation could they possibly give to the therapist to make them agree to this?
There are two things going on here, and they are both on her to address 

First, the physical pain she is having is clearly not normal. She needs to see a gyno and see what is available as far as treatment is concerned. Has she never seen a gyno or just never brought up this problem? 

The second is her mentally, she needs to address the fact that she cannot open up to you due to whatever happened to her. 
This is non negotiable, sex is as much mental as it is physical and she needs to address both of these for you two to have a healthy sex life. 

You need to let her know that a healthy sex life is something you are not willing to forgo, and that it’s up to her to get the help she needs or you don’t see this relationship lasting. 
It’s just that simple. 
( this is not a blame thing, it’s just a fact that she is the one with the issues, and she’s not addressing them)
I also thought that at 20, it’s cute to wear your bf initial. 

At 24, and after 4 years you grow out of the cute phase.
The thing is, he’s not really criticizing, 

In your example, he is saying that you should automatically know what he needs- ????  
Like are you supposed to read his mind?  He’s an ass just for that comment alone. 

That’s not bad communication, that’s a normal every day question that people would ask another when they see them a bit out of sorts. 

And you had nothing to apologize for, you did nothing wrong. 


But I do agree with him that once you know what the problem is, it’s better to ask to help instead of solve the problem for him. Those two statements aren’t really interchangeable. 

Overall his ego and self importance is way over the top. He’s not “being honest”. He’s trying so hard to prove to you and everyone else that he’s so much better than you and them, and when you and they don’t come to that realization he outright tells them and you. 

I give you credit for sticking it out for all those years.
Yup I did. 

So of course I had to read the whole thing.
Can I point out that “we” haven’t gained a new wealth, your bf has access to his savings acct. 

Otherwise, you are NTA, but your sister owes an apology to your bf.
 NTA

what kind of weird crap is this?  

Im guessing you had no boyfriends until now? And he’s not even really a bf, you’re just hanging out. ( but not really cause you haven’t even seen him)  just the fact that you physically leave the house freaks out your dad. So of course the solution is to make you live elsewhere. 

There’s got to be more to this- are you a deeply religious family, is it usual to have an arranged marriage, is the boy a diff religion, race, anything?  

And what’s with your mom not thinking your dad is a complete and utter wackadoodle and telling him so? 

I’d say run as far and fast as you can cause your parents are nuts!  Grandmas is looking better and better. But I know you can’t do that.
Don’t get “stuff” just for the sake of having. 

Pick walk art, knick backs that actually have some meaning to them or you’ll end up with useless clutter. 
Every wall or shelf doesn’t have to be full. 

Buy what you need and use what you buy. Once
What is wrong with your son?  There must be something because 10 year olds aren’t usually this cruel. And what’s with him opening gifts before Xmas?  Yeah, somethings not right here. 

I’m worried what he’s going to do to his sister to get back at her for him not getting any gifts.
That’s how I saw it. 

Once her dad got the letter it became his property and he should be allowed to do with it whatever he wants.
Can someone explain the court case where she sued the mail about the letter? 

Did the court find in her favor without a trial? 

And then when Knauf gave his evidence, which clearly showed she lied to the court, did the court really just chalk it up to her not remembering writing a slew of emails? 
Thanks.
Awesome!  Thanks. Putting it on my list.
Do you mean it’s not a fun ship?  In general, what are the entertainment options?  

I really like the look of this ship but I want some fun activities. Not all out crazy, but I don’t want the ship to be quiet by 10 pm. 
How’s the casino if you went?

Thanks.
So you hate your lying   cheating secretive bf, and you think your biggest issue is trying to figure out how not to have sex with him? 

Do you think he’s suddenly going to have an epiphany of “ wow my gf wont have sex with me, better change my ways so she doesn’t leave me?”

He’s not going to therapy, he’s not going to change, and he’s not leaving. 
The quicker you admit this, the better you will be.
Yeah? I’ve always thought the opposite. 

I always wondered how many people they actually convert, or even convince to check out the religion. 

They really don’t start the conversation with a compelling argument. It’s usually a boring “can I talk to you about…” 

I think they like having to go on these missions just to see diff areas of the country.
He’ll tell you he appreciates all you do so that you’ll keep doing everything. 

This right here is what you will be dealing with if you marry him. He will not suddenly begin to pull his weight, and his video game addiction will not just stop. 

Think long  and hard about if that’s what you want in 3,5,10 years.
Nothing else to be said. You said it perfectly. 

This is what she needs to hear and what she needs to do.
Congratulations!  You should be proud of yourself. I’m proud of you too.
If the filled bread is put in a panini press I call that a panini. 

If I grill the bread filled with ham and cheese in a pan on the stove top then it’s a grilled ham and cheese. 

Toast to me is just toasted bread topped with something ( butter, jelly,etc) and is eaten one slice at a time, not put together like a sandwich. 

And a sandwich is just two slices of bread with a filling, whether it’s toasted or not.
There is absolutely no reason for your wife to get that worked up over something so trivial. Ten minutes is not going to make a difference. Did she even feel bad about co ti king to blow up at you?  

Partners can only take so much abuse before they snap and you did. But at least you recognize that it’s not a point you want to get to ever again, so that’s good. 

Time for some serious lay down the rules talk. If she does this frequently, explain that it’s not making a happy home for anyone especially your children. She should not be ranting and raving over everything. 

If it’s a one off find out why this day in particular she was so obsessed with d being ready at the exact time and by making a huge deal of it, I’m sure she didn’t leave when she wanted to anyway. 

So what exactly did she achieve? She achieved having her h disgusted by the her behavior and ultimately his own.
 NTA
How cheap is he that £40 is a big deal? 

He knew it was going to be too big, so it’s not really a surprise. 
You didn’t have another bag which he also knew so what did he expect you to do? Magically produce another bag out of nowhere. 
Your H is an ass.
I’m leaning toward you being the AH but not on purpose, you’re young and probably haven’t had to make big decisions yet between a so and your mom and it’s overwhelming. 

You’ve only been together 7 mo, you see each other all the time over the course of the year, and you’re both pretty young. 

I sympathize with your gf, it’s obviously a terrible situation, but she has family that can help her deal with grieving, and while it would be great to be there for her it’s not like she will be alone. 
plus I’m guessing this is the first time you’re meeting her family. They might not want an outsider around at this time. 

On the other hand, your mother is alone and I’m sure was looking forward to your visit. It’s one of the few times she gets to see you all year. 

Go home and spend the holiday with your mom. Your gf has support. But I would do anything for my mom and would never leave her alone on a holiday. Yes it’s only one day, but the thought of my mom celebrating all alone with no joy on the day would kill me. 

Of course my thought is that you actually like and get along with your mom. If you dont get along and dread going home ever, then take the out and stay away. 

I think they are both trying to guilt you into doing what they want. Make up your own mind. What do you think is the right thing to do, in your heart and your mind.

EDIT:  I just saw your mom could spend Xmas with your aunt and uncle. And isn’t alone alone. 
So no judgement still but I’d go home anyway.
how long are you with your gf and also do you go to the same school or only see her occasionally?
Why are you even going to your dads if he treats you badly? You’re old enough to decide where you want to be for holidays. 

Where is your mom spending Xmas? 
I would think your mom would love to spend the first xmas after her husband passed with people who also  loved him. 
Also, is your mom the mother of your sis and nephew that passed?  Even more reason to spend it with her.
YTA. They’re both your nephews, treat them the same or when the older one finally figures it out he won’t want anything to do with you because of your disdain for him. 

You might think the 20 yo is just being a bum and not actually “finding himself”, but he may actually be trying to figure it out. 

From experience ( not mine tho) 
Some guys don’t want college, but they also cannot see themselves sitting in an office all day, but they also can’t see themselves doing an outside trade job. 
Yes, it’s irrational ( as it was to me to hear ) to you because there aren’t many other alternatives, but at some point they get a spark of something and it all comes together for them. 

Give him time, you don’t have to like it,  it he’s not your kid.
I literally laughed out loud at that! 

So I guess Chris isn’t allowed out of the bed until she gets her cuddles in. 

What a ridiculously immature thing to think as a 26 yo, never mind text to the mother of his child.
You’re not a loser. Nobody is a loser. 


Do you have a roommate? Why aren’t you friend(ly) with him? 

Join a club at your school. Or an intramural team or volunteer somewhere on campus.

Or just start saying hi and talking to every  person you see in your dorm building. 
Why haven’t you done this the first week you were on campus when literally every club was looking for people. 

You’re not gonna make friends if you shut yourself away. Nobody is gonna come knocking on your door and say hi I want to be your friend. 

And don’t worry so much about attracting girls because with your attitude of thinking of yourself as a loser, girls sense that and they want no part of it. 
The gym is good as long as you go to better yourself and not just to attract someone. 

Get out there and just do something. The pieces will all fall into place.
We just did a dinner out with immediate family, godparents and grandparents.
Your argument against judging by todays standard is spot on. 

You don’t have to like what the person did or stood for in their time, but the fact remains that it was acceptable in their time, it happened and was celebrated. 

Key point is - at that time -  

Better to show those statues and have a discussion about the person, the act, the time in history than to lock them away and never discuss to understand what was going on at that time. 

That is history. For good or bad.

Yes. 

And honestly, if they would drop the titles and go on their merry way without any mention of his mom, his family, her family, the press, I would wish them well in their merchandising endeavors. ( well I’d really be rooting for failure but..)

Just go do whatever the hell you want to do as just H and/ or M. Write a blog, do a reality show, pick a cause and champion it, (just please no more podcasts, that was painful)- just leave everyone else the hell alone and live your freakin life already.
I’ve been keeping up. Saw a bunch of clips. Read a bunch. My post just tipped the iceberg as you probably know. 

Can’t wait for the fallout from the book!
Only the first episode. 
Did I miss something?
We loved that ride!  Sad to see it go. 
And we dont really like the new railroad thing. 

Some rides are just classic and shouldn’t be messed with.
Oh where to start?
This might get long. 

Try to figure out how they met, there’s been about 3 diff versions
2 diff versions of the proposal, and one that she filmed and live streamed to a friend- who does that?
Now they might want these things to be private, but then why even talk about it on a Netflix show and out out diff versions. 
Pretty strong evidence that she had been planning to merchandise her and H and the royal connection since before they were married. 
She lies about her childhood, dumps her dad who raised her and suddenly her mom is in the picture to capitalize on her mixed race when up until then she was self identifying as white. That rubs ppl the wrong way. 
Add in her admission of wanting to harm herself while pregnant, but then not getting any help, while being principals in a MH foundation. Never mind H admitting he didn’t know how to get her help and the fam would not help when they didn’t really ask for it. 
M being on a royal tour complaining that she’s “not getting paid for this”

Then she and Harry are saying she was discriminated against based on her race, if it happened they are right to call it out, but they have not given one instance of it. It’s all vague, cryptic statements. 


She claims being harassed by paparazzi but there is no evidence of that, she claims the fam leaked stories to the press, yet no evidence, she didn’t like negative stories in the press and wanted the fam to get them taken down, the fam doesn’t have that power but she took it as they wanted to slam her. 

Add in H harping on all day long about his dead mom and his generational pain and it’s just become a clown show at this point and a lot of his behavior has come out since he’s been with her. So what has she said or done to him to make him turn on his family. 

She wants to be a globally known brand. She wants fame and money and status. She’s been trying to do this for almost all of her adult life. It hasn’t happened even with her marrying into a very famous and influential family and she’s grasping at whatever will keep her name in the spotlight.
He’s just a middle aged man who gained weight and is in his own home where he can be comfortable. 

We all have spent days just lounging around looking sloppy, and so have our partners. 

He looks presentable when he needs to. Cut him some slack on this one.
NTA

this is an absolute nothing. Your gf is being ridiculous. Good lord it’s like middle school. 

Your gf is getting upset over your passcode?  Read that again- your passcode on your phone! 

You must be the most perfect man on the planet if THIS is the thing she’s choosing to get upset about. 

I don’t care if you’re good or bad with tech, or know how to change it, there is no reason to and that’s what you should tell her.
Mazda 3 

We’re on our third one. 

The 2009 is still being driven by first kid. 
2014 is now the second kid’s car 
2017  is ours.
How else are we supposed supposed to “hear” his generational pain if he’s not the one speaking?  
How will we know how tortured his life was? 

Maybe he’ll choke up a bit at times,really try to pull at the heartstrings. 

If we’re really lucky we might get an actual sob.
YTA for putting up with that loser and his freeloading sister and her kids. 

Why are you with him?  He obviously doesn’t give a crap about you. 

Give yourself the biggest gift this year- your independence from him.
You just started talking and you’re already spoiling her?  In what way? 

She comes with a lot going on - living with baby daddy, not financially independent and has 2 very very young kids. You cannot possibly want to take on all of that. Can you afford to support all 4 of you and more importantly- do you even want to?  

I’m getting not on the up and up vibes from her. I’d pass on this one, there really isn’t any upside for you.
I dont get angry or upset, it just causes unconscious eye rolling, which id like to avoid. 

Any Q’s where someone wants their SO to basically have zero contact with anyone of the opposite sex, no talking no friends on SM. 

Friends from childhood- gone
Lab partners - gone
Study buddies - gone 
Co workers they talk to - gone
Exes - gone. 

There’s only one person who they should cut contact with and that would be an affair partner and you. 

You aren’t mature enough, no matter your age, to be in a relationship if you have this view.

Edit. And as soon as I posted the next feed is my bf is still friends with his ex! 
Insert eyeroll🙄
The driving might just be an age thing, as stupid as that sounds. But teens speed. I might also let whoever that minor in the car with him that asking him to go faster is a def no go. 

The more concerning part for me is when you said that when things are going well in life he feels uncomfortable. 

If he doesn’t know, now might be a good time to open up about his moms behavior over the years. Is your ex actually diagnosed or are her issues your best guess? 
If diagnosed it might help to move your son to be more open to therapy if he can see what his future may look like if he doesn’t get a handle on it now. 

It’s tough because you don’t want him to think that you think ( in his teen mind) he’s crazy or mental or insane, or any other euphemism he might use, so tread carefully.
And why isn’t Knauf just releasing these writings? 

I also find it hysterical that they seem to think Knauf is biased because he was working for William- 

They left and the guy had no job, he was obviously good at whatever he did, enough that the dumb dumb duo used him as their go between with amid the scabies. 

So the royal household or office or whatever gave him another job, was he supposed to just disappear into oblivion after being used by the despicable duo?
No, not normally. 
They might thank their parents and their guests for coming, but this?

This is just cringy. 

If you have to convince anyone that you have a grand love story than you don’t have one.
Unless she just doesn’t. 

What’s gonna happen, the RF won’t allow a scene to be made. 

They will once again do and say and get away with whatever they want. 

Best the fam can do is have them sit in the cheap seats, along with other non family members.
Maybe think of it this way, you were the handful and got the attention you needed, enough so that you can’t even remember what you were doing to warrant all that extra support. And wasn’t it nice that your parents were there to do that? H

Now it’s your bro needing the extra and you’re upset but you need not be because his time needing the extra will end at some point. 

Then all will go back to normal with your parents being annoyingly up your butt again!  Cause that’s what we do. 

It’s hard trying to be the all for everyone. At any given time one kid or the other will need more and we have to give it, and yes, sometimes at the expense of the other kid. But it all will even out in the end. 

If you get to the point where you have a problem or issue that seriously needs to be addressed then you voice that to your mom or dad and ask for some one on one time outside of the house to concentrate on that one issue. If they say no then you reiterate that this is important, and you’re not just being whiny. 

But I will say that just feeling like they aren’t validating your existence isn’t really serious if- and that’s only if- your bros issues are a serious thing, I don’t know what he’s dealing with.
It should revive itself once the kids get a little bigger. 
But, you have to keep it somewhat going or it becomes the new norm. 

Like it’s not gonna be, ok the kids are all somewhat self sufficient enough to not be all energy consuming and you’ll both have this unbridled passion for each other. 

It needs to be a constant, even if it’s a once a month type thing now, that’s at least a constant. Then it becomes twice a month and then once a week or whatever.
Is there anyway to heat the M&M tube enough to soften the butter and banana enough that you can get the cylinder out? Maybe boil some water and put the tube in it for a few seconds. 
Or try to cut the tube with a scissor. 

I am kind of curious how this situation happened if you don’t mind sharing.
Maybe some scratch offs, small keychains, packs of sports cards, mini candies.
I wouldn’t buy one, but if you get an actual card then I could see people buying it. 

Just for the historical implication of it. 
There’s no doubt all his ridiculousness will be written about at some point. Might be kind of worth it to have one? Maybe?  

that’s the only reason I bought the $5 campaign buttons. Just to have a little piece of history, because he’s just that absurd. ( please dont slam me for this, yes I know it was another $5 in his coffers but whatever)
Do these two actually believe anyone gives a rats ass where they are at any given point in time? 

In case they or their minions follow along here, NO. 

THE ANSWER IS NO! 
Nobody cares. Go away.
While I agree there will be headlines either way, but what will they look 
like?

Will it be they were snubbed and rightly so? ( which seems to be the way it’s going with the response to the docuwhine) or because of what the book says, or whatever else they just feel like vaguely moaning about. 
Or 

Will it be the RF or KC is too soft on his wayward son, and what will it take to finally be done with them? How far is too far? He literally called his father a liar - what he lied about is still anybody guess as they never give any concrete statements. So I guess KC can use that as an excuse.

We’ve got a few months, so let’s see what else happens.
Lady Hussey really should have declined to even meet her. 

What did she get out of it - nothing, the damage has already been done. It’s not like Marlene took the blame and admitted it was all a set up. 

There’s no way I would ever even want to make all nice with that conniving grifter.
For me, the gospel choir at the wedding would have been a beautiful addition if, and only if, Megan or even just her mom had a long-standing relationship with a church that actually has a gospel choir. Hell, even if she used to go as a child ( and stopped as an adult) to a church with one. Maybe she did and I missed that little fact. 

I could be wrong, but I equate gospel choirs with a predominantly black church. Which I actually like, I think it makes the service, idk, less boring and it adds to the service. Let’s face it, church service is boring. 

So the fact they added the choir literally just to play into her WOC persona just didn’t sit well with me, as much as I enjoyed watching it.
I agree but his gf already doesn’t want to stay at borgata. 

We stay and play at B even tho we haven’t “won” there
Oh, this made me think of something. 

Maybe it wasn’t leaks to make them look bad, but merely something they were doing in an official capacity, but like everything else she does, she missteps during it and that’s what gets picked up by the journalists? 

So for example, if they visited a hospital of sick kids, she refuses to touch or hug the kids,  - the paper would say yeah they visited but she was repulsed by sick kids or something like that. 

So the story was bad, but not by any fault of the family or palace.
Stay at borgata for the free room and go over to ocean to play. 

If you’re going very soon be prepared that borgata is in the midst of renovating some slot areas. There are a bunch of closed off sections so it looks messy. 
If your gf doesn’t really want to go anyway, she’ll def not like it once she sees it.
But she’ll pick and choose select lines from long posts that are someone commenting things like, what if, is it possible, allegedly, and I heard a rumor that…

And then say, see they’re spreading all these lies. 

She’s not gonna show a post saying they did this on this day and then said this on this day, what’s the truth? 
Or posts that point out evidence of her obvious lies.
Of course it’s gayle, he won’t be asked about anything that’s been revealed as being a lie, or deceitful. 

She’ll lob softball q’s that have been answered ad nauseam, in three diff ways. Maybe he’ll have a fourth answer. 

Who at this point will even watch this drivel?  

Unless it’s live and a respectable hard hitting journalist, I think I’m busy cleaning bathrooms that day.
I love this idea!  

Maybe explain a bit more to the child in an age appropriate way about why actually being called mom ( because she does actually have a live mom, even tho she doesn’t see her) might not be the best name as opposed to whatever other name they come up with. Just so the little girl doesn’t feel totally rejected.
It’s possible his collar is visible when he’s carrying Lilly that way. 

If the collar is not buttoned all the way up, like if you are wearing a tie, they are actually roomy, plus the front of the shirt would just slide up. 

Plus she’s a small child, she can def fit between his collar and his neck. 

I don’t know if it’s photo shopped or not, but the collar is not a smoking gun to me.
But what kind of stupid ass would sign an NDA after breaking up? 

And if it was while they were together, again, what kind of stupid ass would sign an NDA while dating a nobody? 

I think they don’t want to get pulled into her crazy.
I think you’re getting ahead of yourself here. 

Let’s say that someone legitimately not mentally ill gets “kidnapped” (gmafb). They will be placed, assessed and have you ever thought that maybe just maybe they will be referred to somewhere that will help address whatever their issue is, since it’s not MH. This is a good thing. 

You seem to think an actual mental health provider is going to hold people that dont need their services, when in actuality, those providers want to free up space for the ones that they can actually help. 

Stop looking for abuse everywhere. Give the program a chance before you condemn it. 
You say if they want to help then get to the root cause - well that’s exactly what they are trying to do.
We were one of the million that actually watched the show. We liked it too. But even back then I remember I didn’t like her character. And it wasn’t personal to her, just didn’t like her storyline. 

But it never registered to me that she was mixed race. I wasn’t looking for it, I dont remember it being in any plot line and I just didn’t make the connection until her dad was introduced and then was like - ? Huh? She’s black? Then happily went back to watching. And even now I don’t remember if there was any substantial plot regarding her race. But I could be wrong there.
All this is for nothing if they’re not even invited. 

Would anyone really be surprised if they weren’t?  

Don’t announce they’re not invited, and maybe use their PR to ask media to not even mention the are they/ aren’t they invited. 

Im sure M will make it known, but if the UK press doesn’t report it, how much traction can they get?  After a while the US press will realize they as a whole are a non story.
No one treated her like a black person…- 

Because no one even knew she was half black!  Kind of what happens when you yourself hide that info. 

Of course when she starts to date H did anyone care to want to know anything about her background. As would have happened with anyone he dated, let’s be real, the press would have dug into anyones background and found the worst things they could. 

But notice, she has no instances of HOW she was treated differently.

The Compton and chimp thing was over the line no doubt, but as pointed out, those were condemned by the press against the press.
If they release any recordings, even if it’s so called shocking, people who don’t really have an opinion either way will suddenly have one and it won’t be in their favor. 

Regular every day people know that families aren’t perfect and have their dirty laundry, but we don’t air it.
Same. Kraft is great when I want quick. But homemade is a treat to myself.

Sorry but YWBTA to demolish it. 
The prudent thing to do is to sell it and split the proceeds among the kids. 

I can sort of understand your attachment to the home you built but really, you’ll be dead, you won’t know or care who will be living there. 

And think about it this way-
 from your description, whoever buys it will be wealthy and will go in and change it to how they like it, and that might upset you to think about, but it’s going to become someone else’s dream house. Another family that will raise their children to have the happy childhood that you were able to give your kids. That legacy alone should give you some peace. 

The worst part of this whole story is that your kids are already fighting over who “deserves” the house more. 

I’m sorry? What? Here I was thinking your kids had an awesome upbringing going and then we see that they have turned into greedy self serving adults. 
Cause let’s face it, one of them will get the house, maybe live there till they realize it’s too expensive to maintain it and then they’ll sell it anyway and keep that windfall. 
In the process their sibling relationships will fail. 

Stipulate to sell the house. If one of your kids can afford it, they are more than welcome to bid on it.
Well that blows my theory out. Thanks tho, it’s good for me to know going forward.
I probably wouldn’t be able to do a perfectly proper curtsy if I was put on the spot, ( which is a ridiculous claim that she didn’t even know the Q was going to be there) but I’d sure as hell try to do something genuine looking. 

The Q seemed to have a funny side so if it came out looking like a baby deer learning to walk, she’d probably laugh it off. I’d be mortified but I’d apologize anyway, and promise to learn- the diff is I would actually learn how. 

But that witch of a champion of women feels it’s beneath her to, even to the most esteemed woman in the world.
My theory is that when you first start out it allows for typos and small errors like missing accent marks. 

As you progress, it marks them wrong because it “thinks” you should know that by now. 
As of now, I haven’t been marked wrong for the accent marks yet, and I hope it doesn’t happen in the future. 

I’m only unit 6, so still early, and I may be wrong, but words that I misspell are usually many letters so it’s easy to misspell when starting out, but the ones that I’ve seen for a while get marked wrong.
She can’t get specific because everything they said happened, didn’t. 

It’s too easy to go back to that person and have them refute it all. 

And they think they’re smarter than literally every single other person on the planet and that we wouldn’t see right thru that. 

At this point, they can have a public ccv camera that recorded literally any mundane thing that they did and I still wouldn’t believe it happened if it came from them.  

They have lost all credibility, and rightly so.
Or she just doesn’t like the name Harry. She thinks William got the “cooler” name?  H isn’t a very oooular name in the US I dont think. 

Who knows in her deluded mind. 

Do you think she calls him hazbeen when she’s raging at him?  That would be priceless!
I do agree with taking some time to cool off, if you say thats what you’re doing and it’s a short amount of time, walk around the block, go for a drive, but OP also says she went and stayed with her parents- for a few weeks-  

That’s not really a cooling off period, seems more like trying to solve that problem from afar. And we don’t know if H took a small time to cool off or he’s still gone. 

But again, a short cooling off period is sometimes a good thing.
Especially that both of them have left the home after an argument. 

That is not a healthy way to resolve conflict.
Love that last line!  It’s so simple, but so true.
YTA

Of course your son would be upset with you. 

Do you really think he would tell you he’s gay if he’s not? Or if he’s not sure?  He has a boyfriend even!  

How your son looks or his hobbies and interests have absolutely no bearing in regard to his sexuality. I don’t know why you would even think that. 

You owe him a huge apology. If he’d even accept it. 
Be a better parent
I’m sorry, but I am failing to see what you are so mad about. 

Are you mad because they lied to you all these years?  

Well, I’d be willing to bet that there have been a lot of people who over the years have lied to you about one thing or another. This lie really has no bearing on your life. It hasn’t made it better and it def hasn’t made it worse. This is an absolute nothing. I find it extremely hard to believe if you have never lied to anyone. Why was it ok for you to tell a lie but not anyone else? 

Or are you mad about the age gap being what it is?

In which case, that really is not your business. They were both adults when they got together and that’s really the only thing that matters. 
They have stayed together so that in itself should show you that they are happy together. 
Now, you may feel a bit weirded out by the gap but that is your personal moral code and you have no right to impose or pass judgement on anyone, even if it’s your dad. 

It seems you are taking this news way too personal, as if something was “done” to you. Your life was a happy one with Sam in it, why would you purposefully make problems when there really isn’t one?
Why are you even looking at 3 br homes?  
Your realtor should not even be showing you them. 

Keep looking, you will find a 4 bed that will call to you just as much as this one and you will be grateful when 2 teen girls are not fighting over space.
I have 5 siblings. I can honestly say I have rarely bought any of them gifts for their bday. And I like and get along and hang out with all of them. 

It just isn’t a thing. Occasionally if it’s a big bday and they’re having a party for it then I’ll get a gift. (25,30,50th)

As far as I’m concerned parents get gifts for everything. 

If this is your partners only sib then an Xmas gift is ok since she’d be left out when every one is opening gifts. 
But I’d stop the bday gifts.
Ah, thank you. I was obviously confused. 


I thought the prince title could never be removed. And I thought the king couldn’t remove the duke title, that it had to be done by parliament. And that this bill would give the king the power. 
Good to know parliament can at least do some stripping of titles at some point. 

I’ll refrain from commenting till I understand the whole issue, it does get confusing. 

Personally, I’d like both titles stripped from H. He hasn’t lived up to either of them. 

As far as Andrew, as long as he keeps himself hidden away, I can wait for his turn in the next round. ( not that I condone anything he has done, but he’s at least staying within the bounds the Q set for him).
Parliament doing the stripping would be the best thing that could happen. 

Maybe KC can put out a weakly worded statement in opposition, just to appear to give a sh*t, but if it comes from above him there’s nothing he can do about it. 

Maybe parliament can throw around some key words- treason, grievous harm, prosecute etc.
You’re not the only one who doesn’t drink. Just don’t make a big deal out of it or talk about those that do. 

Go to the parties, grab a soda, and have fun. Nobody is going to know or care.
Since I have no experience in nursing, but frequently am the visitor to a patient frequently admitted. ( chronic issues)

I like the idea that I can go in to visit and connect with a nurse to give me the daily update. Too often, I have no idea what the diagnosis actually is and the waiting for a nurse to have the time to come in and advise is usually long. I don’t think that aspect harms patient care. Many times I have questions later on and this would be helpful. 

I don’t have an issue with a virtual doing paperwork things like discharges, but maybe the actual on site nurse should have to sign off on the paperwork that’s been prepared. That’s a good check and balance in case something has been missed or overlooked by the virtual that isn’t actually seeing the medical state of a patient. 

I’m not sure about admission assessments- I would think there’s a lot of nuances that in person can pick up on. I would think patients, especially older folks would downplay their illness, pain, uncomfort, but in house might pick up on all this. 

The idea of a virtual monitoring labs or electronic monitoring info may prove helpful, but only if it’s being done in a timely manner. Sort of like, what good is a lab report that needs immediate action if it’s not being looked at immediately no matter whose looking. 
Theres always a fear with this that virtual nurses will evolve into doing too much and things will slip thru the cracks. Almost like how if an in house nurse is so busy, the virtuals will eventually become too overloaded as well, because really, they still need to be paid and it does seem that hospitals are all about cutting expenses anyway. 

Do you think a program like this could eventually lead to too few actual nurses on the floor and what could that mean for patient care? 

Thanks for posting, it’s certainly an interesting idea.
Those eco warriors, don’t you just love them? 

But if it was a borrowed plane it’s ok right?  All the carbon footprints are someone else’s. 

Oh it’s for security they say?  Yes well, they’re doing such good things in the world, someone just must be after them to stop them from ridding the world of all those racists! 

Did I miss any other excuses?
If they were editing based on public opinion, there would be no show. 

What they should be doing is taking what they say and present the other factual side of the whole damn story.
NTA

Stay at your brothers and don’t even answer her texts. 

She needs to learn that she can’t keep pushing. She’s going to have to figure out a way to not need constant attention from you. 

Take your time to figure out what you want to say, then text her with that. 

Don’t get into a pissing match with her about your action of leaving, just concentrate on her actions. Her actions had consequences. Too bad, so sad.
YTA

seriously, how long are you going to coddle the 24 yo? 

She obviously has horrible taste in men and if I had to guess your and her dads marriage wasn’t great and that’s part of the reason why. 

She needs help but in the professional way, not mommy cleaning up after the fact. 

Do you not remember when your older kids were in hs and how important dances, proms, plays, sporting events were?  

You have done this all 4 times but your D is doing all this for the first time!  Think about that for a bit.
 That’s the kinda the point. 

It was 1 day that you specifically asked for and he couldn’t even just handle it and not moan about it. 

And this 1 day was when you were going to give birth to his child. 

But good luck today, may your labor be quick and painless. (My third was the easiest delivery, and the easiest baby too)
NTA

Your H really couldn’t help ( and I hate that he even thinks he’s helping when it’s his kids!) get the kids situated ONE morning? 

I was a SAHM for all my kids. I readily volunteered for all night stuff because my H had to get up early for work. 
But if I had a bad night or couldn’t settle the baby and woke him, he never bitched and moaned about it, he got up did what he had to do and went back to sleep. 
Was he a bit more tired at work, I’m sure, but we’ve all been tired at work for whatever reason. 

I don’t understand a partner that moans when they have to do one teeny tiny thing other than what has been deemed “their chores or their part”. 

Like seriously, are we partners or are we two people who share space and children?
I read one article where H said “there’s a hierarchy of the family”

He cannot be that stupid. 

Like, yeah duh! 

You’ve been doing this your whole life and just figured out that the monarch comes first, the heir second and so on down the line.  

I really think the dumb duo mean-
“We wanted to do something and they told us no because C’s or W’s thing takes precedent”.
The first snow of the year is always so beautiful isn’t it?  

I hope your pups  enjoyed it
I hate saying this because what’s done is done but - you bothered to read about the failure rate about bcp’s  but that still didn’t register to you that you should have been using condoms also. I don’t fault you for believing her when she said she was on the pill but oh man, she’s something else. 

So that out of the way, I’m not judging cause this is just way to big to judge on teenagers. 

Has she even said that she wants to keep the baby? That’s what you need to ask. 

Then what you do is tell your parents that she’s pregnant. 

You cannot handle this by yourself. 

Again, in case you didn’t get it the first time:

You cannot handle this by yourself. 

You, her and both sets of parents need to sit down and figure out what you are all going to do. 

You cannot make her get an abortion, you may voice your stance that you are not ready to be a dad, but she will do what she wants. 
This is why you need adult, parental guidance.
I’m a little confused with this story but why don’t you write the letter but not send it. 

Give it to a friend to destroy. 

Maybe just the act of doing it will be enough.
YTA
Just for the fact that they are coming on Xmas day and also staying for 2 nights. 

Isn’t that enough? 

Honestly I’m surprised they’re not spending the holiday with her dad and/ or her siblings. 
( we did that the first Xmas after my mom passed, I usually swap years with my in-laws and it was their “turn”, but I just felt I had to be with my fam - and it was hard!)
But also that before this move, she only moved 20 min away yet they haven’t seen her in ages. 

There’s is def a reason she doesn’t want to see them.
I’m more curious about the tweet! Never saw that before. 

I’d say the acct was hacked, just based on the way it sounds, but really, some random hacker had months to figure out how to get into the acct just to tweet this? 

What are the chances some hacker was invested in their story so much to spend their time doing this as opposed to, idk, literally getting into any other legitimately important persons acct?  

Maybe some palace insider just wanted to give them grief (whether true or not) and planned to tweet and delete on the off chance someone got a screen shot of it. 

Or M did it just to be able to say the RF wanted to ruin her by putting it out there. 

Idk why but I find this hysterical.
There is no excuse for what he did. You really have no idea what he did with those recordings. Id be gone. 

Whatever you do, one thing would be certain for me- never another intimate video call, or even a phone call.
Ooh, attacking American values,  that’s a new one. 

It’s not enough the fam didn’t like her, now let’s have them hating a whole country.
The only thing that might be somewhat new would be the people who didn’t want them to marry. 

We know William tried to slow H down, but were there any others, maybe Charles or Camilla suggested they wait to see if she fits with the fam or if she’s up to the kind of life of service that’s expected?  Or simply if she really just wanted H. 

I’m sure they’ll spin it to because they’re racist, when we see now that all those objections would be true. 

One things for sure- H and M will not be telling any stories with any kind of detail that could show any kind of slight against them. 
Such as, we were working with A to do a named project and person B did this and then said X. 

It’ll all be very superficial- “I got the impression someone was trying to ruin a project ( no name) that we were trying to  start up” 

(I hope that’s understandable, it made sense when I thought it.)
That’s weird. That’s what fixed mine. 

I am not techie at all so I’d say uninstall and reinstall but
Only if you remember your login. 

Sorry I’m out of ideas.
Update the app.
We need to know what your mom said.
I had the same. 

Update your app. It fixed it for me.
So like if he didn’t even know the woman was pregnant? 
Yeah I’d be ok with that.  Good point.
Oh geez, could you just imagine, he asks for a test and he’s the one with random offspring out there! 😳

Way to shoot yourself in the foot!  
Karma’s a bitch.
One more thought, if you have friends that will vouch for you, maybe you can ask them to co sign on a lease? 

That might solve the credit issue. 
Then when the lease comes due and you fix the credit issue you can ask the landlord if they will do another credit check to see if you’d be good on your own. 

Sorry just throwing ideas out there.
Def not a prude. It’s just an unusual situation. Wanting to see his accomplishment, and also what makes this photographer so good at what they do and what they can capture, what feelings the photos elicit. 

As I said, have someone cover what you don’t want to see. 
It would then be like what he shows in a bathing suit. 

But at least you’d be able to appreciate the art aspects of the photos.
Good point about objects blocking his bits. 

if that was the case she wouldn’t be worried about viewing the pics. But we really don’t know either way, you’re right.

that cousin tho- wow!  I really have no words. 

You take care of yourself and when you feel back to fighting weight you give that rude, condescending, ah of a relation a huge verbal ass whooping. 

Family harmony be damned. She needs to be called out and called out loudly. She needs to be ostracized by the family.
You have an income that would afford you a pretty good life. 
Air bnb’s are gonna cut into that I would think pretty quickly. 

Instead of trying to get an apt that would have a credit check, maybe try to find a roommate situation. 

After that, you need to build more credit. CC might not be viable but a monthly subscription to a magazine would help. ( I did that when I first started out) 

And don’t stop with the credit companies. Fight until you get an answer from them of what documentation you need to accept the name change. And then get it to them.  Maybe check with a lawyer if what they are doing is even legal, and send your docs with a letter from the lawyer.
“She knows there’s a racial divide still in America and she plays off that”

This is EXACTLY why she plays it up so much. 

Don’t you know, she can single handily cure the world of racism if she could just let everyone in the whole wide world know that she, and she alone, is calling out racism. 

Oh and that pesky resume listing her as white?  Well the racists in all of Hollywood would never ever cast her if they knew she wasn’t lily white! 

She’s got NOTHING ELSE to be victimized for.


I’d want to see them for the art aspect of it. But, as a mom of grown boys, I’m with you where it seems, idk the word, - ick? No. Strange? Maybe. Just some things moms don’t need to see- yes! 

This will sound weird, but maybe have someone cover his bits so that you can still see the pictures.
YTA

you’re jealous of a then 15 yo when your bf was what? 23. 

Get over it already, you’re punishing a young woman who may have had a teenage crush. 

I am curious tho how he even met her and were they friends in a sense that at 23 he was hanging out with teens?  
That would say a lot more about your bf than this girl.
At this point,  30+ years and all kids are adults now and never ever having this convo,
Go for it!  Knowing it’s a total and absolute waste of money. 

Although I’d probably ask to do something like a 23 and me for all of us, this way we’ll get all the ancestry in addition to the bio relationship. 
( kind of curious if all the kids ancestry would be exactly alike)
Two birds, one stone.
You know you should get out but why should you leave?  If he’s done then he can get out. 

but I’d worry about my name being on the lease. 

If it’s just your name, then he leaves. 

If it’s both of your names then don’t go anywhere until you can figure out something with the landlord to get your name off.
If he stops paying you’ll be on the hook for it.
OMG, just plan to have a meal with each parent and their so if you have to meet them. Pick a restaurant, have a meal, then D can go home with gma or gpa for her visit. 

Do you not talk with or visit when you drop off your D?  Just how amicable is your relationship with each parent?
I’d be more concerned that since your dad is wanted in that country, if they have been keeping tabs on him, the govt might just know that his wife and D are arriving. 

But I have no idea what country you’re talking about. T might be turkey, in which case, I don’t know if I’d be that comfortable going. 

Just use the vacay money to bring a few relatives to you.

Other than the house, which I agree would cost them a lot of money each month, and the Nannie’s, what else do they do that they pay for?

They’re not jetting around the world on humanitarian missions in which they’d need transport and lodging. 

They’re not invited to award shows, or hell, even dinner parties with the A listers in which they’d need to buy something new to wear. 

I don’t pay too much attention to their day to day, but they’ve gone out to dinner what? 2 times?  Oh and can’t forget he Uvalde visit. 

So if they weren’t so full of themselves and had to have a huge home for 4 of them, they’d probably be doing ok.

Edit - nope they wouldn’t be ok. 

Did some digging. Their monthly expenses are estimated at about $360,000 plus repaying the frogmore renovations of £18,000 per month ( idk maybe $20,000)
And this is not including landscaping maintenance which I couldn’t find.

These 2 are screwed.
I have no doubt that she can have a platonic relationship with a guy, especially if he’s a family friend, ( someone’s son that her parents were friends with and therefore they grew up together) 

But if you know for a fact she lied, you need to talk about it. Why did she lie? 

You say you’re young, how young? 

When we are just starting on our dating journey it is possible we lie because we dont want to upset out bf/ gf. Of course our inexperience leads us to believe the other person will not know, but with social media it always comes out. 

Talk to her in a non accusatory way -
You know her best, is she coming across as truthful, does she seem like she’s lying or trying to hide anything from you? 
What is her reasoning to deceive you while snapping from another guys bed? ( seriously? where was he)

Honestly, if your gut is saying there’s more to this, there probably is. Trust it

If you’re not long term, I’d say just cut your losses and move on. 

Of course, I’m of an age where we didn’t have SM so a lot of this is just bizarre to me.
Love or need of her? 

If he ditches her where’s he gonna go?
Yeah what stakes? 

There are no stakes, it’s not a competition. There’s nothing to lose!  

Just go live your f’n life and stop making every freakin thing about your what? 72 days as a royal
 
She really is a waste of life.
I’m sorry, there is absolutely zero reasons why this bill should not be pushed thru and voted on. 

It should be obvious to anyone in parliament that these two are not good for the UK, never mind the RF. 

And I’d be ok with a bill that strips the prince title too - unless it’s better to try the second born son for treason. 
In which case I’m ok with that too. 

Whatever it takes to get them distanced for the RF.
Don’t you want to spend the holiday with your family? 

If you think this is a long term thing you may as well get used to switching off. Or just spend it with your own family again and meet up later. 

Don’t tell him you hate spending time with his family, we all grow up getting used to our own family’s way of doing things. 

Try to find something you can relate to with his mom, I know it’s hard, you have nothing in common with a middle aged woman. 
Keep it light, tv shows, local news, maybe your job, places you’ve visited, etc. 
and I’m sure you know, no religion or politics.
Who was taking all these pics?  

They’re not official royal duty pics, so what? They had someone follow them around while they were dating, before they got engaged, during wedding planning?  And the RF allowed this? 

Did she plan on a doc that early on? 
That’s some serious long con.
And adding in-
“ you know, because no one protected my mum and we all know how that ended”. 🙄
I’m gonna watch it. Have to see how they spin literally everything to their advantage.
But how else will they get sympathy if they don’t play up how badly they are suffering if we don’t see it?
Oh yeah. I read the daily mail every morning. 
The amount of articles is unbelievable! 

Clicked one ( but only one since I read here about not giving them clicks) to read Harry saying something about not knowing what goes on behind closed doors. 

Ironic no?   Considering what probably goes on behind their door!

I can just imagine TW waking this morning screeching to hazbeen-  “ look I’M everywhere!
Just tell her she agreed to the $100 Amazon budget, and then spent more with her sis. 

If she wants more it has to come out of her separate account. 

It’s kind of silly to buy so much the first year. Half the fun is adding on each year and seeing how your tastes are going to change each year.
I’m going to assume your parents have met the bf and like him. 
That is literally half the battle. 

But Oh boy, this has disaster written all over it. And I hate to say it but if it goes badly I think it’ll be your parents fault. 

Off the top of my head-

First off- you have got to beat into your parents head that they are absolutely NOT allowed to talk about their wealth. AT ALL!  NO WAY NO HOW. 

make them understand that saying anything that might reflect badly on his parents is just not done in polite society. 

Then forewarn his parents about how your parents are. Maybe explain that your values aren’t theirs and ask them to please don’t get into it with them, and to not take anything they may say personally, as much as they would want to.

Who knows tho, maybe they will all get along and all your worries are for nothing. 
Good luck!
Sorry I don’t care how close friends they are, those kind of flirty messages are never  “their way of communication”. 

If you have to live constantly checking his phone, he’s not worth it. You’ll never get to a place where you trust him again, therefore leading to never giving your all to this partner. And a relationship needs those things. 

It’s really not that hard to not flirt with others if you are truly invested in the one you’re with.
NTA

should have done it long ago and just not said anything. 

She probably wouldn’t have even noticed 

And really? She won’t come over anymore- second problem solved.
Keep the album. Especially if you have kids. 

Both my parents are now passed. 

My sister happened to take my parents wedding album home from visiting my step dad one day. 

She brought it over and it was really nice to see them when they were young and in love. 
(They divorced when I was small, and my dad passed a few years later.)

And putting faces to grandparents I don’t really remember. 

They are memories you cannot capture from any other pics that might be floating around.
My truth. 

Your truth is your perception of a situation, or your opinion, or just you lying. 

There is only THE truth.
As bizarre as it is that he talked about his book and recounted stories, it’s even more bizarre to me that he’d get mad when others tried to change the subject. 

Like what? These aren’t his friends he can get drunk and vent to, these are business associates. 

But I guess when you have no friends you’ll vent to anyone you can get and if he hadn’t made this situation all on his own it would be really sad. - but he did, so it’s not.
Are you upset that he put down single and that he may get in trouble for it? 

Or are you upset that you’re not on the house? And think if he put down married you would somehow own half the house?
NAH


It seems to me that you haven’t had so much as a conversation with your mom about any of this. 
Somehow she found out on her own, so can you really blame her for being a little salty about the whole situation? 

She may be in denial, or feel ( as many parents do) that you’re just labeling yourself because it’s popular to do so, or she may be just hurt that you didn’t come to her when you had this revelation. 

Stop the passive/ aggressive crap, that shows your immaturity and could actually reinforce your moms thinking that you just want a trendy label. 

Have a real honest down to earth talk with your mom. 
Stay calm and explain to her what’s going on with you. Even if she gets excited or nasty or dismissive.  Hold your ground calmly. 

She may not jump on board right away either, but you’re not making any progress as it is. 

And when she agrees to your pronouns, give her some leeway if she slips up - 14 years is a long time to call you she/ her and now she’s going to have to think before she addresses you every. Single. Time.
Honestly I would think a nanny would be a useless expense. And it’s not cheap. 

He’s home all day anyway, he can take care of the baby. And does he not think the baby needs him? 

It is inconceivable that this man is writing all day every day. 
Most days he’s probably not doing any writing at all. That’s how the writing process works. 

Why does he not want to care and nurture his child?  

Go to the office. Someone in this marriage has  to sustain this family.
Just spend what you can easily afford on something that you think she would like. 

Don’t forget that after the engagement there’s a wedding and a honeymoon. 

If you blow all your money on one ring, you have to scrimp and save for the rest that comes after.
Yes you are crazy. 

Your bf and his friend actually asked to vacation at your deceased dads house - without you!  

Then when you rightly said no, they change their trip, conveniently to where you are also going to be vacationing?  But you’re all not going together?  Why is that?

Oh it gets better, the friend—- not even your bf ask again to stay at your dads house, oh but again, you’re not there, but she’s bringing her friend!  

Just tell them both to go to hell. 
I do not believe you and bf are so in love that you have to bend over backward to appease not only him, but his friend also. 

And why do you think that?  
Because she stood up to some ah that made fun of your accent?  

How about you just start standing up for yourself, to ppl who make fun of you and to these two users.
NTA for not entertaining his ridiculousness. 
It’s absurd that he would even ask you to give him advice on his relationship. You’re not a couples counselor. 

Do away with both of them. Like literally don’t even pick up her calls or
texts. 

They aren’t even your friends, you know her because she is friends with your bf’s cousin. Which at best make you acquaintances. 

She picked him, and wants to stay, so let her deal with her own messed up life.
NTA

But I want to know how old frank is. 

This is not your situation to manage. 
And you don’t know or even like this guy. If Rory and frank want to see each other they have to figure out a way. 

Every time she wants to see him you’re gonna somehow get your parents to go visit family in queens?  Oh and you’re just gonna conveniently being your best friend? And then what, disappear for a few hours to go see frank?  
Oh and her parents are strict about boys, so add to this absurd scenario her parents finding out. 

See how stupid this sounds. 

Really, why can’t you guys just find some nice boys where you live?  
You’re 15, you’re supposed to be figuring out all this dating crap with other teens from school or a club or anywhere closer.
And, as per usual, the revenge dress will fail because it will be I’ll fitting.
The issue is not that you can’t lose weight. 
You don’t have to lose weight. 

The issue is-

you know you’re at a healthy weight, but you want to lose more weight to be skinnier. You need to explore WHY you feel the need to be even smaller than you are. 

Do you see the difference?  

Did you tell the therapist that you are not happy with how you look and that is the reason you want to lose weight? Have you explained the binging, purging and excessive exercise? 
If you did, and their advice was to eat more veggies, you need a diff therapist.
Your weight is perfectly fine. You know this, you acknowledge you’re at a healthy weight. 

Do your parents know about your past  issues with your weight?  If not, now is a good time to tell them. 
And if they do, now is a good time to tell them. 
If they don’t make sure you see at the least your regular dr, if not a therapist, then tell a guidance counselor at school. 

You need to get a handle on this now,  before you do irreversible damage to your health.
Ok I’m looking at this a bit differently than the other 2 commenters because it’s not just her whose saying she regrets not being with others, you said it too. 

I think her coworker was totally out of line with his behaviors, I can’t even imagine what he was thinking, so I’m not gonna comment on that. That’s a while diff issue. 

You say that it was rocky at the beginning but it’s better and you love each other now.  
I think you need to check in with your wife about that and also do a brutally honest assessment of your own feelings. 

If yours was truly a loving, partnership marriage there really should be no reason to need validation from others- on either side. 

Your start was tough because maybe you didn’t really know each other that well, but after 7 years you both should know if this is “your person” or not. 

It shouldn’t be we stay together for the son, or we’re just comfortable in our day to day, or it’ll cause too much upheaval to split up, or any other superficial excuse you could both come up with. 

You both should be staying together because this is actually the person you want to be with. If it’s not, you’re both just prolonging the inevitable. 

Not that I think 28 is old by any stretch, but having wild times that you both think you missed out on just isn’t going to be the same at 28-30 as opposed to 21-25. And having sex with other people just for the sake of having sex with other people is a really crappy reason. 

It’s time for some real honest soul searching by both of you. Neither of you can try to spare the others feelings in this. If it’s not working, it’s not working.

Is she gonna tell all about her early life, where her dear mother was thru her childhood, all about what her dad has done for her, the story about Trevor, or even better, cheating on Corey with H?  

We’re gonna get her spin  from age 37 thru 41. 

Get out of here with this nonsense. What publisher would agree to any of this knowing how neither one of them can actually deliver on what they promise.
Are you really saying that H would go back to his family and “eliminate” his brother and all 3 of his kids just so he  and his wife can take the throne?  

I hate them too but that’s just way no to crazy land.
WTH did I just read? 

I’m gonna need to know what the argument was about that made you take a break for a week. 

So without that, some observations -

You seem to have a lot of control over him. You read his messages and his journal and decide who he can talk too. Does he always do what you want him to? 

And that crap about him having to break up with you? - No. put your big girl panties on and make a decision. That’s middle school level maturity. 

You don’t want a marriage, you want a proposal and wedding so you can pretend you have some great love story that survived through all your ( perceived) struggles. 

And your solution to this is to set an arbitrary date at which point if he doesn’t want to get married you will leave?  I think my eyes are stuck in the back of my head from that hard roll. 

You two both have A LOT of growing up to do. And I think it should be done separately.
You are a grown man, why are you moaning to your parents about your job when you readily admit that you bore everyone about it. There’s only so much a person can take. 

Figure your shit out, for everyone’s sake. 

Make up with your parents and get some help. You sound insufferable.
I’m sorry, I don’t understand this at all. 

Godparents where I come from are not expected to raise or even help raise the child. 
It’s a religious thing for baptism, I never expected anything from my kids godparents. 

She is saying she expects you to be all in with this kid from day one. Then no, I’d decline. That’s mom and dads job. Of course everyone needs some help occasionally, so then it’s grandparents, siblings and friends very occasionally. 

How does she treat the godparents of her first child? Are they bending over backwards for this child? And does she talk badly about them if they don’t?  

I’d tell her you just don’t feel you will have the time and energy to help raise her child, and in addition, you feel very strongly that you plan on focusing on your child when you have them and aren’t going to worry about anyone else’s household. 

She’s a selfish person and as you know a selfish friend. This decision might finally get you free of her.
Think how much hurt you’re setting yourself up for in the future. 

People who love you do not tell you they don’t love you, talk shit to their family about you, get an apt behind your back and seemingly try to get with their co worker. 

He doesn’t really want to be with you, he’s just too much of a coward to break up so he does everything he can do to try to get you to break up with him so he’s not the bad guy. 

Give him what he wants.
Exactly how will it keep you busy and away from him?  

Is he expecting you to go outside to his car and it’ll take you a while to pick the lock with a Bobbie pin?  

Locking your stuff away is a sure fire way for you to KEEP engaging with him. 

Why exactly are you with him, he seems to treat you crappy.
You’re missing the barbells. 

Your practice, mistakes and stories.
Nothing about this makes sense-
They include you when you’re single, while some of them are attached, but then start excluding you when you get attached. 

If it was that their partners felt threatened cause you’re the young “chickie”, ( no offense to you, just how older so’s would view it) I’d think the partners would be glad you found your own man. 

They tell you when they got a raise or new car, is it possible they are a bit salty that you, as the young, newish one is making the same money as them and they’ve been their longer it have more experience?  Obviously it’s not your problem, but they have to take their angst out on someone? 

You need to speak with the ones that you were friendly with and ask what the deal is. That’s the only way you’re gonna figure out why the sudden cold shoulder.
Your partner recounted to you the horrible things you said, and you don’t remember saying them. 

Think about what you said- is there any truth to it at all, even a little? 

You broke up once, are you sure you
both agree those issues are resolved?
Think back, was anything you said related to that time? 

All this to say, take some time and be brutally honest about if he is really the one you want to be with.  

Maybe this whole thing is pointing to a reevaluation.
I always wondered if a meeting with both sets of parents and both kids and a school psychologist to mediate would be helpful. 

Get it all out in front of everyone, why do you pick on or bully or throw things or whatever. And no letting the bully not answer. 

I think younger kids would probably stop the behavior but middle and high school is a toss up, depending on what the parents of the bully are like. 
Trash parents make trash kids. 

If that fails then yes my kid would be learning to fight.  I’ll give you one chance, but I’ll be dammed if my kid is gonna be fodder for some insecure bully.
ESH. You both sound unorganized. 

I don’t mean to sound judgmental at all, my first didn’t sleep thru the night until maybe 9 months so I understand what you’re going thru but -

Why is your home always a mess? 
Two adults and a 6 mo old who doesn’t even crawl yet, never mind play with toys. 

Your wife didn’t need to put together the high chair right that minute. And how long did it take? Seems like it was hours. 
You could have made supper while the baby sat in a playpen, or a baby chair. Or just take the initiative and order something. 

First babies are hard for the fact that you’re tired, you’re figuring out a new normal and a new schedule. 

Put the baby in a baby seat or a swing or a playpen, or whatever you use, and go about doing what you need to do. If you’re cleaning the LR, have them in the room with you and just chat away at them while you clean. If you’re making bottles, bring them in the kitchen and do the same. They will be fine if they fuss a bit, it’s what they do. 

As far as the formula, I’m not even sure what your wife was upset about, she had to tend to a crying baby while you went downstairs to make a bottle?  Maybe her job should be to make sure there are enough pre made bottles made to last thru the night?
You can then clean and make them to last thru the day.
NTA

They are your assets and can go to whoever you want. I’d think Dan would know why he wasn’t included. 

If your son is old enough and has had a good relationship with his uncle before he cut off contact, maybe one of your other sibs can give him Dan’s number and your son can text him. 

But be warned- you don’t speak to your dad, your brother has turned against you, do you really want your son conversing with someone who is going to talk bad about you?  You don’t know what Dan is going to say or if your son is going to decide you’re the bad guy.   Be careful what you wish for.
This is the only answer. 

People cannot be “won” in a fight. 

If they don’t want you, accept it and move on.

This person has accused you of despicable things, and then went - oops, sorry, didn’t mean to totally screw with your life, ( cause really, I’m sure the whole school heard the accusation) let’s be friends again. 
How does this person even have any friends left after what they did? 

Nope, how could you ever trust this person ever again?  
I’d stay as far away from this person as possible.
As long as you find a dress that you absolutely love within your moms budget, ( and I am sure you can) I would just tell MIL that while you appreciate her offer, you really want your mom to be the one to buy your dress. It’s a mother/ daughter thing, and that doesn’t take away any good strong feelings toward her, and you appreciate all the help she has offered for the wedding. 

She should be able to understand that M/D bond and respect it. 

Also can I give 2 pieces of advice? -

- plan your wedding for what you and fiancé want. His mom might want top tier everything, or every option on the menu, but figure out if these are things that you really want. Sometimes less really is more. 

- go dress shopping with just your mom. You will know which dress is “yours”. It’s a feeling when you see yourself in it. Your dress shouldn’t be decided by a committee. Too many opinions will cloud your judgement. ( I’ve watched too much say yes to the dress, but I honestly believe this) 

Congratulations and don’t stress about planning, this should be a happy fun time.
How long have you been dating? 
Have you guys even talked about what the future would look like once the baby is here? We’re you planning on being a couple? 


Look, I think it’s unreasonable that she’d choose to spend t’giving with another guy, (is it just the two of them or is she going to his family’s holiday) since I would think you two were in a committed relationship, but idk her situation. Are you working that day? Does she not have family close or friends she could spend it with?  Did you two even talk about what you were doing for that holiday? 

Her idea that two guys can’t hang out alone is off the wall to begin with. I don’t even know how she’d go right to must be gay. 

You need to make some decisions:
-Do you want to be with her?
- do you just want to coparent and not be a couple?

Take today to decide and then contact her to tell her what you decided. You’re old enough to make these decisions about what’s best for you. 

Either way, I’d def get a paternity test and have everything go thru the courts. Especially since you’re military and could be moved at any time. Protect yourself and your rights to your child.
Talk about division of chores, but realize that at times, things won’t get done. It’s ok if some chores like dusting or vacuuming don’t get done on sat every single week. It’ll keep. 

Just be flexible with almost everything. You’ll eventually find a rhythm that will work for you both.
I think there’s more to this. 

What did your friend mean about making better decisions? About you, the pregnancy, the family friend? 

What would make her jump to you are gay?  Unless your friend texted more than what you know. 

Really, just let her go, don’t even try to contact her. 

If you think it’s your child, go thru the courts for paternity testing, visitation and support. Don’t even try to work this out with her, you’ll be in for months of crazy.

Him having no one to hang out with isn’t your problem. 
He moved to a place he knew no one, that’s what happens. 

You broke up when you were a junior in college, you’ve moved on and it’s time he did too. 

But you have to tell him or he’ll keep trying to force his way into your life.
It’s not odd that he moved to your city, but did he have a job lined up, other friends or at least a reason other than he likes it? 
he’s free to live wherever he wants, but it does seem like he moved to be closer to you and that’s creepy. 

Here’s the thing - you do not have to be friends or even talk to anyone you don’t want to. 

So if you don’t want to talk to or be friends with the ex just tell him. Don’t explain why, this isn’t a conversation, this is you stating. Call him or text him,  it make it short- I don’t want to talk to you anymore, we are not friends, goodbye. Then hang up and block him (if you called.)
Do you just let that talk to you that way or so you answer them back? 

Say it firmly and let them know in no uncertain terms that if they say anything else about your food you will not be back. 

I realize they’re your parents but at this point it should be more of a reciprocal adult relationship, not a parent/ child one. They should treat you accordingly.
The thing is, you can never be absolutely certain that a partner is not going to cheat. 

It’s only been 3 weeks. The hurt over his cheating is in the forefront of your every thought. Your fear will be brought into any new relationship you have. 

Maybe you shouldn’t be looking to date and give yourself time to just be. 

Eventually you will find someone who you want to be with and the fear you have now will be lessened to the point that you won’t be in paranoid mode. 

Paranoid mode, which is not at all healthy, will only lead to you questioning everything your partner says, everything they do and it will drive them away- nobody wants to be looked at with constant suspicion for just living their life. 

Don’t let this fear take over your life, this too will pass.
Sorry no. 

No one needs to placate their partner to the detriment of their own well being.
Your wife is insane. 

Divorce over an over cooked chicken sandwich?  I can’t even….

Is she frequently this absurd? Have there been other issues that she goes insane over if you don’t cave in to?

For me, I’d just agree to the divorce to save myself from the crazy. 

I am curious tho, did she eat her whole sandwich? How about the sister?
YTA

You certainly have a very high opinion of your family don’t you? Most times when I meet someone like you, I can’t quite figure out why. 

the fastest way to keep them together is to make them be apart. 

And really, you are a grown woman and you really are entertaining the thought that your 16 yo is going to be with this guy for the long term? 

We all thought that at 16 and it never does. ( for the majority anyway). 

Leave them alone, your D will decide if and when she’s had enough.
Why doesn’t he want your dads money?  Is there any bad blood there? 
How does your dad treat your H older kids?  

Have you told your H that it’s almost insulting that he won’t allow you to help, she’s as much your D  as his at this point. 

And if it’s a trust, then it’s your money not your dads no? 


You can also go along with Leah taking out the loans, - she won’t have to even start paying them back till 6 mo after she graduates. At that time, maybe your H will soften his stance and you can pay off the loans.
I thought I heard/ read that your phone does listen to what you talk about, but if you turn Siri off it can’t? 

Anybody know if it’s true?
There’s a lot of anxiousness when they leave the house in the beginning. 
A lot of texts saying they arrived wherever. 

Then after a bit, it becomes commonplace. 

And you’re actually glad you don’t have to stay up late to pick them up from wherever they went.
Go on the trip. 
Memories with your friends will last a lifetime. 

You cannot know what the future holds, you or your gf will get to uni and the distance and freedom may cause one of you to want to explore what else is out there.
Why will it take him time to figure it out? 
Does he not read newspapers or magazines?
Does he not have friends who know what’s going on with them? 
Hell, if he’s so close, you’d think he’d try to keep up with what’s being put out there. 

I just can’t figure out what the end game was supposed to be with this display. 

The connection to Diana can only go so far. He may have a soft spot for Harry, but she has been instrumental in Harry’s misery. 
Elton should sing about that.
I’m pretty sure this is illegal. 

Why would you even want to be married to someone under these circumstances?  You will be putting your relationship life on hold for the foreseeable future. Are you really willing to not have a real relationship with someone you love? 
It does not benefit your life in any way. 

I say just tell her you’re not comfortable with this and the answer is no.
Nope.  There’s nothing to discuss. 

In my book, this is a no coming back from, break up thing.
Brooke Sivendra- Royals series and the James Thomas series is awesome, 

Anything by Megan March. 

Christin  Harber has a delta series that’s pretty good.
I could be wrong but, even up until the baby shower, I think the perception of H and by extension M, was that they were all about championing causes. 

I could see the Clooney’s being somewhat in that circle. They have a justice foundation and have a charity geared toward Sudan. 

Now, why Amal was invited was probably more to do with M wanting to appear to be friends and cash in on that status but I would think Amal would be a little more busy to attend. 

Once they realized that these two were more interested in what can be done for themselves, they knew they didn’t want to be involved with them. 

More a case of they came, they saw, and ditched them.
Thank you for the duomo tips.
Why do you have a problem with him hanging out with his friend? 

I’m a little confused why he needs to be home when you get home. 

It’s his day off, he can enjoy it without you,  just like you can do what you want on your day off. 

You don’t need to be attached at the hip.
Wait- your bf was cheating on his ex for 6 months with you?

That’s why you don’t trust him to be out of your site.
I agree she did something related to the embassy that her uncle had a hand in arranging. 

But Bower says her dad paid for the “ study programme”. And her sister says she wasn’t employed by the embassy but was at a school attached to the embassy that arranged work study. 

So really which is it-

- did her dad pay for a program? But what kind of program is only 5-6 weeks? Or did he fund her living arrangements? 

- is the sister embellishing her recollection to make MM look even more like a fool? 

That being said, I certainly believe whatever she was doing there had nothing to do with any diplomatic relations whatsoever. So basically just another lie to try and make herself seem more important. Which of course backfired.
I’m not really seeing what it is that you need to work on? 

You got a little lazy once you moved in and played games for longer than she would like?   Ok, it happens, she points it out and you adjust. 

Porn? Once? And you have to tell your gf about it? This is just silly. If the urge strikes and you need a little help finishing, why can’t you do that? Does she have to control every orgasm you have? ( I don’t even watch but have no issue with it)

So she’s stressed, if she can’t handle a relationship and regular life stress at the same time, it kinda seems like she needs to do some work, not you.
NTA

if she’s as good a friend as you say then she would presumably already know your financial situation and she wouldn’t be hurt by you not coming. 

She may be disappointed that you can’t be there, but she shouldn’t have any bad feelings toward you. 

You need to get her on the phone and explain exactly what you told us here. That you are upset you can’t be there, but it’s your last month of school, and you just don’t have the money to fly home in jan and then in Feb when you have to leave the school. 
Ask if when you are home in Feb can you celebrate her marriage, see all the pics and get all the details of the day. 

I hope she’s understanding of your situation.
It’s only been a few months and he’s cheated already? 

It’s like he didn’t even try to be faithful. 
Is that what you want to have in the back of your mind all the time? 

You guys were friends before, maybe you should go back to that before you get in too deep. 

And of course, don’t snoop. If your gut is telling you something is off, trust it and confront him.
 NTA at all 

It doesn’t matter what BIL thought he was doing, he was way out of line. 

Did no one say anything to him at the time? Your sis, your parents?  Not even your husband? 

What exactly would you be apologizing for? Not sending him his own gold plated invite?  Ridiculous. 

And wedding invites are always addressed to the couple, not each individual. 
Your sis and her husband can go pound sand. Do you even really want them there?
His reaction was way way over the top! Does he do that a lot? 

Please don’t change anything on yourself because he doesn’t like it. 

Today it’s eyebrows, what’s tomorrow going to be?  Weight, boobs, clothes? 

You’ll get to a point where you won’t even recognize yourself.
NTA

i would think your parents would want you to go to the competition because of all the hard work you’ve put into it. 

Your sisters graduation is important, but it’s important to her and your parents mostly. 
Not that you aren’t happy and proud for her, but it’s not like graduation will be ruined if you’re not there. 

Send your sis a text explaining how much this competition means to you and that it’s not that you’re not thrilled for her but this is a one time thing for you.

Signed,
The sister who didn’t go to her older sisters graduation. 😀
It also depends on your age and life circumstances. 

If you live at home and are a student and it’s just for spending money, then sure why not. 

If you are supporting yourself then you have to figure out how much of that salary you actually take home and decide if it’s enough to live on. 

Since you say it’s a bit above min wage then maybe it’s not the worst job to take, even if it’s just to get some experience or if you’re in a spot where you need a job, any job.
Maybe one of these

This is an argument I would have. 

He’s known this for 2 months, and being that you scheduled this so far in advance, I’ll assume you had to give that much notice and can’t just Willy- nilly change your days. 

I’m getting the feeling that you placate him more often than not and he feels entitled to dictate what he wants.
But did you tell him you were taking those days and THEN he decided to schedule all this private stuff. 

That’s the key here. 

If he knew you were taking those days then he’s wrong for scheduling on those same days. I would tell him too bad, he has to reschedule as your days were already set. 

And no way I would be leaving my home for his stuff. He can lock himself in a room away from where you’re going to be.
I didn’t even know he was in baywatch. 
So I went and looked him up. 

He’s slightly more attractive then than he is now, but still does nothing for me. 

Sorry. I know it’s just me. 

But him now just always looks dirty, like he needs a shower.
So then tell him you cannot be with someone who is so irresponsible with money and break up. 

Tell him to call you when he has figured it out.
Jason mamoa. 

Def successful and fit but he’s just ugly to me.
Yeah you should tell her. But I wouldn’t make a big thing out of it. 

Since you’re the same age she might assume  you’re gonna graduate at the same time, better to know now if she’s ok with this ( and I cannot imagine why she wouldn’t be). 

You’re just dating, so I would think there would be a lot of conversations and do wonder why this hasn’t come up before.
I think we all figured he would announce,  he’s already come out to moan that Arizona was  taken away from lake. 

I’m more curious to see who in the near future is going to support him and what the RNC is going to say and do.
Sorry but I find it incredibly weird that you collect nudes. Like why?

And then to trade them like one would trade baseball cards says to me that your attitude about the girls who post or sell nudes is that they are “ lesser” or maybe not be deserving of respect. 

You think nothing if trading some other girls pics but god forbid you send your gf’s pics anywhere. She’s better than that. GMAFB

You’re not a horny teenage boy who can’t control himself and needs to troll the internet for exciting pictures to get you off,  you’re supposed to be more mature than that. But we know that’s not the case don’t we? 

Take a long hard think about that.
The absolute fact is that if he wanted to be with you more than his gf, he would have broken up with her as soon as he realized that. 

He hasn’t so he doesn’t. 

He talks a big game, wants to respect your values and boundaries but always trying to push them- so right there, I don’t trust anything he says. 

Do you think he won’t do and say the things he’s doing and saying to you if you guys are dating? Unlikely. 

Don’t hang out solo with him. Make sure you have a trusted friend with you when you hang out with him who will stop you from doing anything stupid. 

Are you that hung up on him or is he just nice enough and is there at this moment?
There’s nothing to figure out. 
You only know this guy a few months, how close friends can you be? 

This guy is still with his gf. Just the idea that he would even make a move on you shows you his character. 

Do you really want to be with a guy who while he has a gf is telling you he’s not sure he wants to be with her while also trying to get with you?

You really have no idea what is going on with his gf- he can tell you anything he wants, you have no idea how to verify it. 

Your idea is solid- he breaks up with gf, he takes some time to get over her while you two stay strictly platonic friends while you figure out if YOU want to be with HIM. 

Don’t compromise your values for anyone. If they can’t wait, they are not worthy.
Have you two ever even met in real life?
LDR is just not for you. 

It’s perfectly ok for you to tell him you cannot continue this relationship. 

Wish him well and get on with your life.
Then B has to tell C that they have no interest and to stop asking A to set it up.
I feel like you’re missing a fundamental basis of marriage, which is trust. You married this person so I’d like to think it was because you love and trust him. 

Apparently not because you really stretched his innocent question about tinder for his friend to thinking he’s going to cheat. 

Seriously, I can’t even do the mental gymnastics it would take to get to that conclusion. 

If he was going to cheat I’m positive he would not be asking you which dating app to use!  

Calm down, crappy ridiculous arguments like the one you had will eventually be the death of your marriage if you continue these silly arguments. 

You, your husband and your marriage will be much happier if you just trust in the fact that you married each other in good faith, with the idea that it’s forever. 

Stop looking for the end before it’s even had a chance to start.
YTA

In addition to being an absolute dirtbag and disgust me. 

You obviously have no respect for your gf and only think of her in terms of what she can do for you. 

I don’t care how bad the construction industry is in your area, you get another job, any job, you don’t pimp out your gf. 

I hope your friend tells and I hope she kicks you to the curb. 
You don’t deserve her.
Keep that money. 

It may seem trivial to you, but when you were little I am sure you brought joy to that woman by just spending time with her and sharing your amusing stories. 
And she showed you how much she appreciated your company by gifting you in her will.
You have to do what is best for you. 
And this is not what you want anymore. 
Why would you  put what he wants above what you want?  

First thing, find a new job. It’s ridiculous that your job is threatened just because you work for his relative. 
Get that straightened out first. Then work on an apt. In the meantime save as much money as you can. 

As far as being heartbroken, will you really be?  You’re in an admittedly not healthy relationship, it’s quite possible that you will feel relief, as opposed to heartbreak. 

Will you miss him or will you miss the routine that you have been in?  Those are two very diff things. 

Ultimately you will be fine. Just the fact that you recognize that you two are not compatible is huge. I would think most people would just keep going along to get along. 

You know what you have to do, just get it started. Life is too short to be stuck with someone just because.
NTA for not wanting to change your schedule, 

but you really should have pointed out that you were hired for 25% travel and as of now it has been 100% travel. 

If I was you I would call into the person that hired me and find out what the deal is. 

If they want you to permanently work in the far place, which it seems they do, then you have to decide if this is a job you want to keep.
 NTA for being livid about him quitting before having a new job but-

You’re having another baby, who is going to take care of this baby? 
For the first one, he did and you went to work. Maybe he’s thinking it would be the same way but of course he should be working up until the baby is born to have a bit of a money cushion. 

And have you thought about how you’re going to handle 2 kids on your own?  You will still have day care needs, and someone to watch the other child before and after school. And what do you do if you get deployed again?  Can you count on him to stay in your area after you send him packing or is he gonna run home and then you’re literally in your own. 

You guys need to talk about all of this, your job, his job, your budget, child care. 

Don’t just go scorched earth until you have had this conversation.
Oh gosh, didn’t even realize that!  
Caught ever other typo, I think, except for the one that made a funny difference.
I’m not sure if this is sarcastic or not- 

And idk about magical rights, but there are provisions for parents to give medical decision authorization to another person for either a limited time period or until the parent can be contacted. 

If I take my child’s friend with us on vacation, their parents gives me the authorization to approve medical care if something were to happen to them while on vacation or until the parent can be contacted. 

Service members do the same thing if they are going to deployed or otherwise out of contact. 

Single people may do it if they have no family and are having a risky surgery. Better to designate someone who knows your wishes than leave it to an anonymous medical team.
I think he has shown you enough of what he is really like. I’m not convinced his drinking was to numb the pain of hurting anyone. That would mean he actually had any empathy, which he seems to be lacking toward you. 
He was the one who blew up his life and family, ( and I wonder why he did that since that was left out) you just happened to be there so he wasn’t alone. 

Anyone who would treat you bad while your father is right there helping you move out is absolutely not the person I would ever give another chance to. 

He’s obviously some years older than you, let him go. There are more stable, less baggage guys closer to your age that you can build a solid life with. Why are you even trying with this one?  
This is a def case of “parents know best”.
NTA, but your friend sure is. 

She doesn’t have to give you guardianship, but she needs to sign something that says you have all right to make magical decisions for the baby if/ when she cannot be contacted. 
I’d probably get it notarized while I’m at it. 

So there’s that, now as far as holding her hostage?  Oh no, she’s got that backwards. 

Let’s look at this - her parents want nothing to do with her when she gets pregnant, then they say, yeah come back into the fold- but without the baby. 

So your friend is just having it all isn’t she?  She gets to dump ( yes, I say dump, because that’s exactly what she’s doing) the baby on you whenever she feels like going home. 

And then when she’s good and ready to come back she resumes care of HER CHILD. 

You are a saint for agreeing to any of this. 

She needs to decide, is she a mother to the child who she decided to keep full well knowing how her parents would react, or is she going to pretend he doesn’t exist to make her parents happy? 
This baby isn’t going to disappear, you will be watching this boy for years to come because if her parents don’t accept him now what makes you think that will ever change. 

Are you ok with that?
Honestly, you guys were young when you got together it’s possible this has just run it’s course. 

He might realize he misses you or he might enjoy being free of commitment and enjoy being single for the first time in his adult life. 

I suggest you also enjoy being single and free.  
Hang out with friends, find ways to be ok with being single. 

You shouldn’t be of a mindset that this is the only guy for you. Most of us have felt that way but it’s rarely true.
Spend less than you make, cut out any expenses you don’t absolutely need and invest the leftover. 
Put it in a mutual fund, not individual stocks. 

It may seem like such a small amount to invest, but give it time. Once you start to see even a small increase in value it will spur you to keep at it. 

Once you are comfortable with the amount you can put away each month, have that amount auto deposited each month from your paycheck and you won’t even miss it. 

It may be a slow journey but it will be worth it.
Girl, seriously, you are a fool. 

Love is blind maybe- but deaf, dumb and stupid?  No! 

You moved to be with an absolute loser who can’t support himself, never mind helping to support a kid. 

What is it about him that you can’t see he is using you?  

I give him credit for being there for the child if he’s the only dad the child ever knew, but at the same time, he’s not really is he?  

You’re the one supporting him and the child. 

The ex’s finances have absolutely nothing to do with anything. These two will figure out what they need to do about the child without any help from you. Stop being their ATM. And if they don’t? That’s their problem. 

Have you ever figured out how much he is really contributing to the household you two share?  

Wake up and get out.
Here’s an article showing their mortgage payment. 
According to this their mortgage is 9.5 million, with a monthly payment of $40,000

You’re still in school so there is nothing wrong with living home. 

Why can’t she come over and hang out in your room? Or you can go to hers. 
You can watch movies and cuddle. 
No need to always be going out somewhere. 

I’m sure she is well aware of why you live at home and why you don’t have unlimited money, and she still wants to hang out so don’t stress so much.
Could be 2 reasons

Someone on govt assistance might be easier to take advantage of since donors are paid. 

Or

The payments to a donor may make them ineligible to continue on assistance.
It’s only been a few months and even though you talk a lot, it’s hard to really get to know a person that way. 

Don’t you feel that there are just some things that don’t translate well over the phone?  How does a person act in social settings, how do they talk to their family, friends and even their child? Are they messy or neat? Do they have any odd quirks that def would not mesh with your life? 

And more importantly, will they and their child or you and your child get along with both other people?  It’s not enough that you like her kid so far, but what if she resents moving and leaving everything she knows and comes to resent you or your son? What if your son resents having strangers move in?  

My advice, keep doing what you’re doing for a few more months. Then bring your son to meet them. Then talk to your son and have an honest conversation with him. And she should have one with her kid. How do they feel?  If they’re ok so far, have them come to you and have the same convo again. 

I’m guessing both kids are relatively young, so it is either going to be easier cause they aren’t as aware, or harder cause to the kids, you and her are their while world and they won’t take well with sharing their parent. 

Just some things to think about, but please please do not upheave either child unless everyone, especially the kids are ok with it. Put your kids feelings before your own.
Did you really not realize that marrying someone after 2 weeks wasn’t going to work? 

Seriously, if you don’t mind answering, 

I’d love to know what was going thru your head at the time as it seems a lot of military have these quick marriages. 
Did no one try to talk you out if it?
So it’s ok that your D is getting sloppy two hundred seconds because he can take care of her and give you grand babies. You realize a 35 yo man who is still able to attract a 19 yo has been around the block more times than you could probably count. 

But your oh so precious S is so special that he can’t saddle himself with a woman who may have had previous lovers. What if she can provvide for him?  You do realize she can still have babies don’t you? 

Hypocritical much?
I found this

https://www.crisistextline.org/text-us/

It’s a free text crisis service. 
They are trained professionals. 

Maybe try them? Check them out.
Go to someone at your school. Guidance counselor, teacher, there is usually someone in every school who is there for the students. 

If that fails, walk into a hospital and tell them you need to talk to a mental health worker. 

Best of luck to you.
I don’t know about your scenario, but if a parent was willing to do that, why don’t they just add your car onto their policy and you pay whatever the increase would be to your parents when the bill comes in. It might be cheaper that way.
NTA. 
but maybe she has some weird aversion to doing the dishes, like everyone has their one household thing that they hate doing. 
Ask her. Then you can swap out a different chore that she can do instead of the dishes. You do dishes and she does one that you currently do. 

I do wonder tho, why you, even while working full time, we’re doing all of the household chores while she was working part time? 

Have  you guys talked about the changes that we’re going to take place since you’ve been sick? Does she feel that since she’s working full time she doesn’t have to do anything else? You know, like you were doing for however long. 

Seems like this marriage has been unequal from the get go. 

I’m sorry you got so sick. I hope you get well enough to go back to your job. It must feel awful, especially being in the health fuel, that the thing that was supposed to help protect you actually harmed you.
NTA for trying. 

Your bro seems to resent your mom because of the divorce. He needs to know, if he doesn’t already, that it was your dad who forced the divorce. Your mom was not willing to just forgive and forget the affair so him being mad at mom is not sensible. Make sure there isn’t more to it than that. 

Now, if you’re still gonna talk to mom you need to let her know that bro is not a baby, and he’s also not a very affectionate person. It’s nothing personal to her, it’s just the way he is. ( even if it is just toward her). 
He’s a teen boy- the last thing he wants is to hug his mommy. If she needs affection that badly she should find a boyfriend. 

I do agree they both that they both need therapy.
What could employees of a sandwich shop possibly divulge?  Mayo or mustard?  

I could see it not wanting to be known where they honeymooned, but that’s a 2 week NDA at most. 

These two are so over the top it’s absurd.
I’m not sure you were being selfish- 

You thought of her and what she was feeling and what would be better for her instead of clinging to her because you need her as you go through a really serious time in your life. 

Are you sure you broke up with her because you want to be with someone who is all in for you ( that would be selfish) or did you do it because somewhere in your mind you know that it’s unfair to ask her to be your nurse maid, support person and girlfriend yet again? ( that would be selfless) 

It might seem like you made the decision for her but she probably would not have made this decision on her own. How do you leave the person you love when they are literally fighting for their life? The guilt would be astounding. 

I wish you a full recovery and a wonderful life.
It’s not hate, its disappointment- in you and the friend. 

You have been in a committed relationship for 2 years with a guy who obviously trusts you ( and his friend) and both of you broke that trust. And for what? A couple minutes of Funtime. 

What’s best for your baby is that it is recognized by its real father so that it can grow up knowing where they came from. Whether that father wants to be a part of their life or not. 

You can’t decide paternity based on who is in a better position to raise the child or who you would rather be with. 
There are multiple stories on Reddit where kids found out who there real dad was later in life and their whole world was blown up. Do you think that’s good for your child? 

You know your bf best, how do you think he’s going to react when he finds out the whole story?  Maybe he won’t care and will stay and raise the child with you. Maybe he’ll break up with you, but either way he needs to know. 

Saying nothing is not the solution. 
Secrets will come out at some point.
There is no other advice to give. You have to be an adult and fess up. 

He should be able to decide if he wants to stay with a gf who cheated and also whether he wants to stay friends with the guy who would sleep with his gf. 


And really? His friend? On a trip where the bf was there?  How did that even happen? Where was bf when you were sleeping with his friend 3 times. 

I hope it’s the friends baby and the bf breaks up with you and dumps his friend. 

you and the friend deserve each other.
But how did she react when you pointed out you thought you weren’t doing gifts since she got you nothing?

It’s very telling if she expects you to be giving to her and she has no obligation to reciprocate. 

If she is mad then that’s her problem, not yours. She’ll get over it. 

But have the holiday gift talk soon. Save yourself any future grief.
Usually I’d say it’s pretty standard to get and give your SO a bday gift. 

But you two are young, do you guys even have disposable income to be able to afford gifts?  

Being that your bday is before hers, there should have been a simple conversation about gifts, either a price limit, or an agreement to not exchange at all. 

Here’s a thought, instead of gifts, agree to do something for both of your bdays. Supper and a movie, an experience you both want to do, etc. 

This way, you’re both spending the same amount of money and nobody can get their feelings hurt over something pretty trivial. 

You best have this conversation before the holidays come around. 

I am curious, did you say to her that she didn’t get you anything so you just assumed you weren’t exchanging gifts this year?  What was her reply?
Are you saying that you and your partner are still willing to hang out with them but you just want her inappropriate behavior acknowledged?

So does that mean the rest of the friend group is not willing? As in does not want to hang out with them at all?  

If this is the case, then it is Eric and Amy that have lost all their friends, not just you and partner.
If you watch tv while on the couch you could get up and move during every commercial. Walk in place, walk around the house, use empty gallon milk jugs refilled with water and use as barbells. It’s not much but it makes me feel like I’m doing something. 
You can also buy one of those foot pedal things to do while you sit there. 

You’d have to be watching regular tv tho, so if not, set a timer and do it every 10 minutes for a minute.
We’re there any people dancing? 

Did the B & G even dance to Italian rap? Maybe they like it? If they were club people maybe they wanted it that way. 
I agree it does sound awful tho even if I was a club person I’d want to dance to something I know.
NTA
mistakes happen, but you still paid for something that you didn’t get. 

You’re in the group chat so you should have just answered his message to everyone that you didn’t realize that you didn’t actually order but still paid, thinking you did order and just wanted to figure out why there wasn’t one for you. 

And everyone didn’t need to know anything about what happened. Why would they? 
I’m sure you talk to some other team members and would have mentioned to them what happened- you know, like normal people do. And the committee could care less about uniform ordering I’m sure.
That’s why I said to explain what went on with your bro. So that your parents don’t have a negative idea about you- which is ridiculous anyway, they raised you, they know who you are and what you’re like. Why would they ignore what they see and know just because their other kid says so?  

Look, you are probably still in school, so while it’s great that you are interested in learning computer stuff, it cannot be the only thing you do besides school. Explain to your parents that all learning and studying is just as unhealthy as all gaming. You need balance.
Just tell your parents what really happened. What he said, you said and explain it to them. Clear the air so they stop thinking of you as the problem child. 

You get $50 every time you help him, can’t you buy your own graphics card?
Your partner is not there to make you happy, fulfill all your hopes and dreams, and jump at your every whim, 

Stop sweating the small stuff. Work out the big things. 

Small = it’s ok if your SO didn’t vacuum on Tuesday like they said they would, it’ll get done at some point. 

Big= stayed out all night and you had no idea where they were. 

Treat each other like you want to be treated in return. It’s a partnership, not a competition of who is the better person.
After what he said about the dishes I wouldn’t wash another one ever again. Fuck him!  

Know your place? You know your place and it isn’t with this AH. 
Stop this behavior?  Oh yeah I’m stopping everything with you!  

You have a job and an apt ready to go- take the leap, what’s the absolute worst that could happen?  

You need to change your mindset from scared to mad. Mad enough that you just say fuck it and fuck him. Call today and make sure you can get that apt, then when he leaves for work tomorrow, pack your stuff and leave. 

You can leave a note, but don’t explain anything just say I’m not coming back and don’t contact me. Then block him and get on with your life. 

You can do this- you did it before him and you’ll do it after him.
Yes, whatever this event is for its most likely nothing TW and her husband have done anything for - because-

They don’t do anything. 

So I’d ask, what have you done for - insert event name-  

And watch her try to word salad her way out of answering. And then counter her answer, and around and around we go. Until then just saying so basically you do nothing for anyone, got it!
I agree it’s not any of the parents fault. 
The kid is responsible for their actions, and knows by this age right from wrong. 

Has the child acknowledged what they did wrong and what was the reasoning for it? 

Punishment should fit, you took money so you earn it back to pay it back. 
Weekend chores around the house. 
$1200 is a lot of money. What did they do with it? 

Lying is tough to punish because its more a trust issue. ( IE, I can’t trust what you say to be true) idk what they lied about so these are example-

Maybe once they are allowed back out with friends, you make sure they can be tracked, you confirm with other parents that who and where they are going is true. 
If schoolwork is not being done then you arrange with the school to be informed of all assignments and you have them show you the work. 

Things of that nature, until you can be relatively sure the lying has stopped, or at least, not for the big things cause the mundane stuff doesn’t really matter in the scheme of things. 

You’ve been advocating trying to help this child for a long time to no avail, maybe now their parents will listen.
As the stepmom, I’d be asking the kids dad what he was going to do about his wayward kid.

I’d also ask the dad to try and figure out why said child is doing these things. You can’t just blindly punish if you don’t know what’s going on with the kid. 

Oh and I’d also lock up anything of mine that has any value to it.
This. 

I can sort if understand the idea that if Harry comes, she has to also- as much as I think it’s ridiculous. 

But let’s look at them as a regular family, there are some where one’s spouse is not welcome to family things. 

It’s no secret the RF has no good will left toward MM, so while it may cause a bit of a stir that he’d be going and not her, she’ll be the one to save face and put out a statement saying she declined to go so at least one parent could spend Archie’s bday with him, or some other bull that makes her look not as left out.
Ok that’s odd then. 
You need to ask him to explain what his aversion to meeting these people is.
How is he supposed to get to know them if he doesn’t hang out with them? 

His logic is flawed. There must be another reason. Does he have any other friends except you?  Is he shy or have social anxiety?  If this is the case maybe have him meet one person for a very short time and then another person until he’s somewhat comfortable with hanging out with these people.

The problem I see you having is that this person, it seems, is withholding work related things from you because you don’t agree with her opinion of MM. 

If you outrank her, then it’s time for a chat.  She needs to know that regardless of her feelings about you, based on your feelings of this topic, the idea of withholding work related information is not acceptable and it needs to stop now. 

You may want to wait to see if it happens again, give her the benefit of the doubt, but if it happens again then it’s time to take action. 

It kind of sucks that she’s giving you attitude, and you might want to mention that too. Usually adults can be civil even if we disagree, and this is such an insignificant thing for her to be so invested in.
But she really doesn’t have to “let him go” does she? 
He can just file and move out, or share the house till it’s done. 

It’s not like they both have to agree to a divorce. 

Now, she may try to make his life a living hell, try to smear him with whatever lies, or truths she can get out there, but after a while, who is going to want to listen to her same old, same old? 

And maybe the RF will leak some of the more unsavory things they know about her to ruin her credibility even more.
Yeah I won’t read them in the hopes the DM will stop writing about these two. 

I just come here to see what’s new. 
So thank you everyone.
It seems to me that he doesn’t even have a communication style. 

What’s with the ignoring you? Nope, you need to say out loud that you will not stand by and be ignored. 

You ask for a hug and kiss and he just moves you aside? With no explanation at all?  We’re you offended by this? Did you voice that to him? And he did what? Said nothing?  And then continued to ignore you hours and days later?  

Why are you still there?  He clearly doesn’t have any problem not talking to you, so give him no one to talk to. 

There’s a lot more going on than a diff of communication styles.
We are one of the few that actually watched and liked Suits. 

That said, even as we watched, her character was the one we always said we didn’t like. She added nothing to the story lines. We watched for the scheming of the rest of the shows characters.
I think we should all print this article and mail it to Harry. 

You know, in case he missed reading it.
Those are really cute!
Do I think it’s a big deal that he played longer than an hour? No not really. I am not a gamer at all, but I can understand the idea that sometimes you cannot just put a time limit on gaming. Things happen in a game, teams are set up and you can’t just drop out, etc. 

And your post made it seem as if he has been prioritizing you over his gaming for the past few months, which to you is great- but it probably really bothered him but he was trying to keep the peace with you. That is not sustainable for any relationship, with any hobby or outside interest. 

I think you are more upset that his hobby is gaming. If his hobby was long distance cycling would you be as upset that he goes on hours long rides every day? Probably not, because you’d see that as a “good” hobby, as opposed to gaming, which I suspect you see as a “bad” or childish hobby. But that’s not for you to decide for someone else. 

And sorry, but your family was quite frankly absolutely in the wrong. Adults don’t admonish other adults for their likes and dislikes. We accept that people are individuals and will like what they like. If I was him I wouldn’t want to stay involved with you knowing how your family was so dismissive and rude. 

Let him be to find someone who doesn’t mind his hobby or who will actively participate with him in it. 
You’re not the one for him.
I thought the same thing. 

He wants to get you a PS5 so that he can also play on it. 

I’d let him know directly that you want a gaming laptop for YOUR birthday. 

You can buy the PS 5 together as a joint holiday gift to each other.
As far as I can see, your bf will do something nice for you but then needs you to do something nice for him- like tit  for tat. And you will do that just to make him happy. Yikes! 

This guy wouldn’t do all the dishes, just his ( in his mind) half. Who does that? In what world does this seem like a normal thing to do? And to boot, you were sick!  

And then he proceeded to only do his half of the chores?  Uh uh no way is this ok. 

Seriously, I dont care how long you are together, he sounds like a nightmare to be with. 

I’ll bet he never does anything for you just for the sake of doing something to make you happy, but you do that for him. 

This is a seriously unbalanced relationship and you’re on the losing side.  Ask yourself why you want to be with this guy, what is he adding to your life?
There’s a carnival ship that leaves Port Canaveral on sept 21,  2023 ending in Barcelona on Oct 4

Then on Oct 28 there’s a trans back from rome to Tampa ( Nov 12). 

So you can have 24 days to bop around Europe and then sail back to the US. 

All diff airports, ( and I have no idea where you’re starting from) but it might be something to look about.
I can’t imagine she was fired because it’s not like she wrote the article in a vacuum. 
Someone higher up would have had to see the finished article and approve it for publication. 
So if Allyson gets put on unpaid leave, the approvee would get worse. 
Anyone know if someone higher up at the cut is also gone?
Do we think Harry will even attempt to defend himself and expose what she’s really like?  
Or is he gonna be just as spineless as he is now?
NTA

Your bro’s relationship may not be an actual sugar baby one, but are you afraid that maybe she likes him just a little bit more since he is comfortable? 

Im sure she likes him, don’t get me wrong, but does she also have a career, is she established in her own right? 
Maybe that’s why you’re bothered by the comments, somewhere you feel she’s not kidding.
I don’t know if this is something you can come to as middle ground. 

She has said what she needs is to be left alone to study, you have to be able to do just that - leave her alone when she says she needs to study. There is no middle ground there. 

If your usual way of trying to be supportive is to constantly *doing* something for your partner then you’re going to have to figure out how to not do something and reassure yourself that this is what she wants. 

It’s going to be a long lot of years if you can’t come to terms with this. 

You might need to find something to do all the days she’s busy. You’re a music major, so do music - play, learn a new instrument, compose, whatever it is that you’re wanting to make as your career. 

When you two are together just enjoy the time together whatever you do.
