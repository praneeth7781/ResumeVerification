Has anything taken over that spot? I used to work there and it was such a neat building/space overall, it’s a shame it closed!
Roadside Attraction is sort of near Rontoms, and has a cool, laid-back, not too loud atmosphere that isn’t super romantic or explicitly “date-y” - I’ve loved hanging there alone, with friends, with my partner, and we’ve taken his folks there on a weekday afternoon even. Lots of indoor seating options with a good variety of tunes - but not too loud - and arguably one of the best outdoor patios in Portland. Plus you’re close to a lot of other spots with a good variety of atmospheres if you want to move elsewhere. (The bar directly next door I’ve only been to once or twice but I remember it being quiet and chill, and you’re close to Hawthorne, Belmont, Division, etc. The Nest is semi close and another fun spot that isn’t super romantic but is definitely a vibe close to what you describe.)
They did this for us last week at Port Orleans FQ! I believe this is standard at most of the on property hotels - if your room doesn’t come with a microwave, it is available upon request, when available. It was great to heat up our Ohana leftovers without having to walk to the main building!
Is there a particular part of town you'd like to go with? (This will help folks narrow it down quite a bit.)

&#x200B;

I'm a big fan of Roadside Attraction in SE - beautiful, super cool, reasonably quiet outdoor patio, and it's never insanely loud inside, plenty of room to spread out in little alcoves. Cash only though - ATM readily available, however - so keep that in mind.

The Nest can be a fun spot too - lots of different rooms to spread out in and find some privacy, decent outdoor seating, and they have pool and some random games laying around if you want an activity. There's some other bars within walking distance, but I wouldn't call most of them quiet/as good for conversation.
Him wanting better communicating and better behaviors during arguments for the both of you isn't him "punishing you" and the fact that you're looking at it that way says ***everything*** about your emotional maturity - or lack thereof. 

I also wouldn't want to travel with someone I am currently not seeing functional, healthy, mature communication and conflict resolution with. Most people wouldn't. You don't want to shell out money, arrange a trip, be out of town, and if a fight breaks out, have to deal with the unpleasant, unhealthy ways those unfold. It's not just about the "walking away" it seems like - he wants to get to a place where you're both communicating and resolving problems together better *as a couple* before being in a position where you're away from home together for extended periods.   
Traveling together makes it difficult to take space - be that a few minutes to a few hours of a break, or be it a few days, you are largely "stuck" together, and being "in a fight" can ruin a lot of plans, travel responsibilities, etc. Travel is stressful enough as it is, it's perfectly mature and reasonable to want to get to a better place together before putting yourself repeatedly in that situation.

The fact that you're looking at things as a "how much good do I have to do before I'm rewarded with what I want" instead of as the two of you *working together* to improve your relationship and communication - not just for your wants/desire to travel, but for the *longevity of your relationship* and bond as a couple - is incredibly self-centered and immature.   
The fact that you're even asking if you should discuss this further with him or just walk away entirely for someone who will go along with your desires makes it seem like you really don't value this relationship/him much, either.
Yeah, growing up in Hillsboro, the shitty speaker/freezer vans you describe were decently consistent in the few summer months we get, but that was about it. Definitely no nicer trucks - and I honestly haven't even heard a single shitty one in all my years in inner SE, either.
I hope it does too! It would've been a great benefit for those of us who are child-less and don't want to run to the lockers a bunch/are hindered by disabilities, too.
It is!

You definitely want to make sure and ship all your stuff at once, because you will be charged a fee every time otherwise - it always caps at $39.95, and if you forget one thing/find an impulse buy after it's usually no more than $5-10, but to get the most out of the tiered shipping you definitely want to just wait and send it all together at once.

&#x200B;

For those who aren't familiar with the offering, another few points:

The other thing to remember is that you need to have all your receipts at time of shipping - so if you're typically unorganized with those, are prone to throwing them away, etc. you'll want to prepare. We bring a tiny baggy and neatly fold all receipts into it as we go so none get lost/damaged/forgotten about. They *can* look up receipts if you've misplaced one, but it can take a while, and if you paid cash it's a lot harder.

Another note is that you can only ship "Disney items" - so Mitsukoshi in the Japan pavilion, the China gift shop, and a few other Epcot/Disney Springs locations cannot be shipped if they are not "Disney owned"/considered Disney merch. You also cannot ship popcorn buckets or Oga's Cantina specialty glasses - like the Rancor flight - and I believe Trader Sam's/other dining location specialty mugs cannot be shipped either.   
But those are really the only exceptions, and *nearly* everything on property is able to be shipped. 

A final note - you always want to believe nothing will happen with your shipped items, but in the rare case that something is damaged/lost/stolen during transit, if it is out of stock, it will be refunded to you rather than replaced - so if it's something extremely rare/hard to get, you may want to consider that if you'd be devastated if something happened. This also means that if you pay in cash, you will receive that money back to a gift card - whereas debit/credit is back to your original payment method - so that's something to think about when planning merch purchases, also.
Agreed - I went once in 2013 for one ridiculously stressful, busy day, and twice as a decently young kid, so I never experienced some of those now-gone amenities. But hey - it's *still* awesome, and there are still a lot of great benefits to enjoy!

We love the ship-to-home merch service, and use it every time. It would be amazing if they did the parks-to-resorts delivery again - and maybe they will one day, my understanding is it's still a staffing issue - but not having it doesn't really bother us much, since we never experienced it prior.   
We just plan our merch shopping around runs to the locker, and then it's a quick ride back to the on-property resort with our hauls. We load it all up on the last day of the trip and take it to the resort gift shop, and they ship everything all at once for $39.95 - and it's insured so if it shows up damaged, or gets lost/stolen in transit, they will refund/replace depending on stock. Can't imagine trying to pack everything up in a suitcase and worrying about more fragile items. It rocks!
Definitely not. Has never been free. It’s based on total value of items, and caps at a $39.95 shipping charge - which is why you’d be best off waiting to ship all trip merch at once, but it is an option for any number of items at most shops on property.
Parks to room is simply not an option now.
Your first point is not accurate, as this is no longer available at Disney World as far as I’m aware - still has not been brought back or given a timeline for returning. Only ship to home is available.
If his mutt and current job come first, that’s his choice, and well within his rights to prioritize what matters to him. But that leaves you down the list, and if it were me, I wouldn’t be jumping through hoops and moving to accommodate someone who can’t even make me a priority over a fucking *dog* and scheduling conflicts. 
Your family will be there when you break up, would you rather be close to them, or have to try to move a third time when this doesn’t work out? 
If his job is a priority, perhaps yours should be too - meaning don’t quit to run back and accommodate him.
I guess for me, as a diagnosed Narcoleptic, I don't really see the point in what you're suggesting.

I suppose if you *don't* have Narcolepsy, and the testing there rules it out, you can stop pushing for a sleep study in the US/direct your energy elsewhere - so in that regard, it may be useful.

But if you *do* have Narcolepsy - or IH - and the test results will be useless back home for treatment/medication/a legitimate diagnosis, then you've just wasted time/money/energy and will no doubt be more frustrated having to continue to push for proper coverage in the US.

If it were me, I would continue to push for a proper sleep study in the US.  
It's not impossible to get covered if your doctors genuinely feel it is appropriate and you are genuinely showing symptoms.   
Yes, you will have to rule a lot of other things out first, but that's a good thing - and frankly, we *all* had to go through it, you are not special in that regard, there's no "cheat code" to jump through the steps.  
A proper diagnosis in the US will be needed to get proper treatment - and to have those medications covered. Some of us were able to begin certain medications - like lower doses of stimulants - before a completed study, and while the process can be long and unpleasant to get the study approved/scheduled/completed/get the results back, it is worth it when you consider that it means you will be able to receive lifelong care for these issues.   


It sounds like there's a chance that this sudden onset of symptoms came from something else/may not be Narcolepsy - unless I'm misunderstanding what you're saying, I apologize!   
I would continue to explore everything else it could possibly be. You don't ***want*** to have Narcolepsy. There are many other things that cause similar symptoms, and I would pray that you find the answer in one of them, because it's truly a crippling life sentence to have this disease.

If you don't feel your doctor is listening to you fully, or you feel they are creating unnecessary barriers to getting a sleep study scheduled and covered, I suggest getting a second - and third - opinion. You don't have to stay with a doctor you feel isn't best serving your needs - and there are doctors out there who will be more than happy to help you get a study scheduled if you truly seem to be showing the signs.
I would think that there's definitely a difference when you were a resident of a place and receiving consistent care and monitoring vs. somewhere you decided to seek out specifically to motivate a diagnosis, as a tourist. And there is a HUGE difference between a short term disability claim and a full, valid diagnosis for which you will receive medication and continued insurance coverage. I would not assume these situations to be similar whatsoever.

You definitely need to speak with your insurance first, at minimum. I would also speak with any doctor(s)/specialist(s) you plan on seeing for this/medication management. I would not be the least bit surprised if they tell you that, no, testing you receive as a tourist of a foreign country with different regulations, testing standards, and practices is not valid for American insurance and medication.
You more than likely will find a lot of resistance from your insurance and any American doctors you see if you try to bring those test results/a perceived diagnosis to them form Mexico. I can all but guarantee most doctors will require you to test again in a facility they approve/work with before giving you controlled substance medications, and your insurance may require this as well. 

I’m happy to be wrong about this, but given some of my own experiences with trying to get care outside of the usual options, this was the biggest barrier. Any care outside of the country was rendered useless and testing needed to be redone to be considered valid.
I would speak with your American insurance and care team to see what they would think of this first. Unless you’re going to attempt to get 100% of your care in Mexico 100% of the time - and somehow manage to get all your medication from there consistently too - this may not be the “hack” you think it is.
This is it for me 😂 if it was in a desirable location, and the taxes and such weren’t crazy, possibly. But any money is too much money for me to live in GA.
Oh believe me, I’m guilty of trying to cram way too much in every time, but I’ve been getting better at it!
I get this panic like “what if we never come back?? What if _____ is gone???” and I’ve had to learn to set my expectations more realistically and prioritize a couple of “musts” and leave the rest to chance so I can relax and actually *enjoy.* 
I knew there was a good chance we’d miss Grogu entirely given the randomness of his appearances so promised myself it wouldn’t ruin my trip if we missed him, but I was pretty bummed after two days in the heat wave with no sightings. In the end, Disney magic works out sometimes, and I’m glad we saw him! (But wish Disney set up his meet a bit better 🥶)
Haha, thank you! 😂 
It was definitely a bit of an ordeal, but worth it to me! No shame!
Shula’s was great, but pricey. 
Sanaa is a must do steak every trip, plus the bread service and beauty of AKL! 
For steak-similar, the Kona braised short ribs at Kona Cafe are always a must-do for us, too. 

People are ignoring “outside the parks” with Le Cellier but I wanted to comment on that anyway and say we were massively disappointed in Le Cellier and would never go back. Wildly overpriced, terrible atmosphere, awful service, and mediocre food. The steak wasn’t *bad* - and we loved the poutine - but for the overall price it wasn’t worth it even remotely and we’ve had better elsewhere on property for half the cost - wasn’t worth eating up park time.
We have *both* attempted to reach out to each other, but it never went very far. It’s clear that too much time has passed - about 3 years or so - and the hurt was too big on both sides to have just let it pass. 
I’ve tried to initiate talking about things, but it was never followed through on. He did as well - first in fact - but then fell out of contact again for months, and clearly wasn’t interested in making time when I followed up. 
He wished me well at Christmas which I wasn’t expecting, but it was very brief and felt odd. Some things just can’t be fixed.
I always mean to try the chicken but pass on it because the steak is so dang good! Sanaa is fantastic! I regret not making a trip over there on my visit last week.
That bums me out to hear! We ate there December 2022 and again last week and it was worth every penny, absolutely fantastic!

Kona is a good choice too - the short rib is one of my favorite dishes on earth - but I miss the endless noodles over there.
I agree with all of this - set the boundary and offer her an opportunity to chat if you feel you miss the friendship and want to hear her out. 
This will give you the final, ultimate closure - she either can’t agree with the boundary and you know it’s truly over and for the best, or you both talk and work through some things and either end up in each others lives again, or decide to part ways having hashed it out. 
I wouldn’t put a big apology in a letter, myself, and would prefer to say it to the person - she may be feeling the same way, but only she/you can know that as you move forward, guessing/assuming does nothing productive here. 


My situation was very different, but I’ll add anyway:
During the pandemic, I had a falling out with a dear friend of mine, who I had known since I was 8, over 20 years, who I went to for everything - and them me - and who was like family, we knew each others parents, etc. 
As a result, we no longer speak, and the friendship has largely ended. 
We messaged a couple times a year ago and both acknowledged we missed each other, wish things would’ve gone differently, wanted to catch up sometime… and it just faded out and never came to be. 
I think we both realize our wrongs during that time, but also still feel hurt by the other person and can’t just put it aside and ask to go back to the friendship. 
That said, I would give anything to repair that relationship. If they sent me a letter like you describe, I would absolutely give them a chance, and if it didn’t work out, at least I’d know we both gave it a shot. 
A friendship of that length means something, and it’s clear you do miss it, at least a bit. In my opinion it’s worth the risk of chatting - and setting your boundaries - and giving repair a chance, if only to know that there was no real opportunity in the first place.
They were there this last Monday! 

But let me tell you, it was a *pain* trying to see them last week.

I am *obsessed* with Grogu. This entire trip was about meeting him. We had 2 Hollywood Studios days booked and ended up having to squeeze a third in on our flight home day because we failed to meet him the first two. 


He has no set times. As a rule of thumb, if it’s raining *at all* or a storm is brewing, he isn’t coming out. 
Originally I was told he doesn’t come out after 5, but from my three days last week, I would say he doesn’t come out after 4. 

He comes out about once an hour, *maybe,* if all conditions are right, and he comes out for *maybe* 10-15 minutes at a time. No line, no PhotoPass, he has a handler and Mando picks who he wants to interact with/get a photo with. You can’t touch/hold Grogu, but he’s AMAZING and makes faces and noises and is PERFECT. 

Mando *always* will come out from the alcove in between Rise of the Resistance and the Market. That’s where he exits to go backstage as well. 

He sometimes goes into the Market, but when I saw him Monday, he came out the alcove, walked to the umbrellas/seating across from the market near the bushes - on the other side of the ships/Rise area - and interacted with guests for just shy of 10 minutes, then went back in. Didn’t go towards the Market at all. 

I sat in the heat for 4 hours last Tuesday in the same spot, right by where he comes out from the back, waiting for him only for him to never show - and ruined the rest of my night because I overheated and got very sick 😂😬

Thursday I missed him by literally 5 minutes at 3:30, and he never came out again.

Monday I saw him at 1:29, he went back in at 1:38, and he never came out again - it started lightly sprinkling at 2:30, I sat there after he left until it became actual rain at 2:45 and rained the rest of the day so there was no point in trying for another encounter. 

Cast members all said they have no idea what times he comes out and it is entirely random - it’s never “always” 30 after, for example. But they all echoed that you need to get there early - starting at 11 or 12 at least, and for your best shots, they said - and you need to sit planted by that alcove because the second you leave and do something else for a second, you are likely to just miss him. 

It’s a hassle and I hate that they don’t schedule such an amazing character that so many of us want to meet. If they were smart, he’d be in the Launch Bay, where he’s protected from the elements, kids can’t rush the animatronic and cause problems, and everyone gets a chance.

That said, it was worth it to me. I felt like a little kid, I was literally squealing with joy. I had my “11 inch Grogu plush” in a little bag with some vacation flair on, and Mando said “Grogu approves” and took photos with us while Grogu smiled and made happy sounds. 
Literally a moment I’ll never forget, I’m *still* riding the high of that encounter.
I'm sorry to hear you had to have an encounter like that, but I'm so glad they were able to get you the care you needed, and you had a good experience with them!

That was my thought, too - in my city, you're lucky if anyone shows up at all during an emergency, and if they do, it's an hour or more at least. Disney is on top of emergencies instantly, you have great odds and great care available to you there.
“People with Narcolepsy *also* have severe, painful insomnia as a *symptom* of this horrible disease. And the sleep we do get isn’t really sleep - I’m medically incapable of *ever* getting restful, restorative sleep. I’m severely, *severely* disabled by this life-ruining, debilitating prison sentence of a disease. It’s pretty insensitive to act like there are any benefits to this, and no, I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.”
Ha, I didn’t even notice, thank you!! ♥️
Aww thank you ♥️♥️ I try my best when I can!
I’m so glad it helped and that you’re feeling better today!! It’s amazing what a good night of rest can do!
I hope you have a fantastic day and that you’re able to quickly replace such a scary experience with some happy memories and feelings today! 
Take care ♥️
Not at all. The Taun Taun has buzz button foam, which causes a tingling, the Bespin Fizz wasn’t so much something you’d feel in your mouth as a dry ice effect.
I’m sorry you had to witness that. Seeing someone in that state can be very scary and traumatic, especially if you’ve never been in a situation like that before. 
If there’s someone you can talk to - family, support system, therapist - please do when you can, everyone processes these things differently and it can sit with you for a while in some very dark and upsetting ways. 



The truth of life is that there are no guarantees - everything can end at any moment, with no warning. 


This is something that used to really scare me, and I spent many years depressed over that lack of control and the fragility of everything.


These days, it is something I keep in mind, and is why I choose to cherish each moment. 


I don’t wait to do things that I feel are important - like traveling to Disney with my partner, for example. 


There is no guarantee of tomorrow, and I want to live my life to the fullest, and leave my loved ones with good memories to reflect on when I am gone. 



I’m not going to try to put a happy spin on someone having an emergency like this at Disney, but at the very least, there are worse places to have an emergency/go. 



If it were me, I would choose to imagine that he pulled through. 


Disney is very on top of emergencies in the parks, and there’s no doubt in my mind he received the fastest, best care available, and that those with him were cared for and given every courtesy possible to make it through the scary event. 



While you could possibly reach out to guest services - especially if you’re still on property/will be tomorrow - and explain what happened and ask for some comfort or information, I highly doubt they would tell you - or be allowed to tell you - if he had indeed passed/what the actual outcome was. However, knowing Disney, they will do everything they can to comfort you and try to put you in a better mindset about the event. It’s worth reaching out for that peace of mind, even if they’re limited in what info they’re allowed to share. 



Please be kind to yourself and try not to dwell on what you saw. 

The worst thing you can do for yourself in a situation like this is ruminate on these thoughts or try to replay the scene in your head. Instead, take deep breaths, try to distract yourself with positive memories from the day, get some rest, and try to shift this negative energy into positive by focusing on your loved ones and the wonderful place you are in, and make more happy memories together tomorrow. 


Best wishes to you ♥️
Ah yes, just spend the crazy amount it costs to move out of state, and come to Portland, a place you’re completely unfamiliar with, where the cost of living sucks, housing inventory is a mess, and the city seriously sucks. Perfect solution when you’re already broke!
If you don’t think massive corporations who make money off each guest having the best experience possible want to be able to fit as many guests of as many sizes as possible on their rides, I don’t know what to tell you.
They’re doing the best they can with what is physically possible and safe. Do we not recall recent news of a very large individual dying on a ride he never should’ve been on due to safety standards? Just because it doesn’t agree with your views doesn’t mean safety standards aren’t real, this is ridiculous. 

Disney as a business is motivated to give the best experience to as many guests as possible so they keep spending money.  Not being able to fit on rides doesn’t achieve this. If it was possible, they’d do it. In fact, there are *very very few* rides at Disney, again for example, that large people *can’t* fit on. A local carnival doesn’t have the funding nor resources that a company like Disney does and will have more limitations as a result, this again is a no brainer. 
Your lack of logic doesn’t trump facts, sorry safety standards aren’t “inclusive” enough for your liking but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a reason for them or companies just aren’t “trying hard enough” and to think otherwise is childish and delusional.
Disney is an example, someone else mentioned them as an example as well. If *Disney* - one of the largest companies on earth with amusement park rides - has limitations for weight and size due to ride safety, despite wanting to serve the most guests as possible, you better believe small carnivals like this one have the same if not more limitations given scale and budget. 

Think of how much better the world could be if people accepted that not everything is “judgmental” or “not inclusive enough” and that *in reality* there are limitations and safety regulations - and just because you don’t like them doesn’t mean they aren’t *real* and necessary.
As if places like Disney wouldn’t want to be able to fit the most *paying guests* possible, given the limitations of engineering for their rides to operate safely. It’s not about judging people’s bodies, you people are delusional.
Ahh yes, *safety regulation,* how dare they! Inclusivity is *waaaay* more important! 🙄🙄
100% agree. 

“All the mental/emotional baggage I feel I need to now carry” - *good grief.* OP, seriously, seek therapy. 
You’d think he just told you something criminal the way you’re acting. You have some serious insecurities you need to address, and *none of them* are on him or about his actions, it’s all internal *with you.*

The man has had sex before… oh no!!! But wait… So have you. 
It doesn’t matter how many partners anyone has had, their value as a partner hasn’t changed, and it doesn’t mean they can’t value a current relationship just as strong as someone with less experience. This is such a judgmental, close minded, childish mindset to have. 
If he’s been a great partner for 8 months up to this point, what difference does *things in the past* make to that? 
He hasn’t cheated on you. He’s still the same person he was before you knew. 
If he still wanted to be out there having those same types of encounters I promise you he would - he determined it wasn’t for him and he values you and your dynamic which is why he’s *in a relationship with you now.* 

If your sexual boundaries are that you will only pursue a relationship with someone who has remained sexually sheltered and “pure enough” by your standards, that’s fine - it’s your right to set whatever standards you want for a partner, however based in insecurity they may be - and if that’s the case for you, then yes, you need to break up and pursue someone who has kept to themselves enough to meet your ideals. But don’t make it about him or what he’s done - it’s 100% about you and your close minded views on past sexual encounters. 
If that makes you incompatible, it is what it is, but he didn’t do anything wrong. 

The older you get, you’re going to find that men you’re dating have *gasp* had sex with other women. Probably a good number of them, and explored a bit along the way. It’s part of life, and you’re going to be hard pressed to find men as you approach your 30’s who have hardly been with anyone - unless you seek out very religious partners, but they probably wouldn’t accept *your* sexual explorations, so… 🤷‍♀️

Just because someone has a lot of sex doesn’t mean they don’t value it or seek connection through it or any of that. It doesn’t mean they can’t be monogamous, either. Your own insecurities are blowing this out of proportion and assigning meaning to something where it isn’t - he’s had a lot of sex, all that means is… he’s had a lot of sex.
If he’s a good man, and respects you, and loves you, that’s what’s important. 

I highly suggest you seek therapy. Most people don’t jump from “my partner of 8 months has revealed their normal, sexually active past to me…” to “this is heavy baggage and I’m breaking down and feeling sick and this means he can’t value sex at all and is incapable of monogamy.”
Their email address usually is quick to respond, I would write in with your reference number and other info and ask for the tracking number, which they can give you alongside an estimated arrival date. MyChoice is easy and free to set up as well if you’re worried about it - my area is a package theft hub so I always have to be on top of it.
Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. It worked for me searching via reference number in July 2020, it hasn’t worked since and I’ve shipped from the parks maybe 8 times since. I’ve had to either call/email or use UPS MyChoice every time.
If you go to tracking on UPS.com, it should have a “track by reference number” in blue and underlined below the tracking box. If it doesn’t work, you’ll need to reach out to them or sign up for MyChoice - easy and free, and then you’ll get an email and it’ll show on your account dashboard when it ships and is scheduled for delivery.
You said it isn’t Disney - so did it ship from a DS shop, or Mitsukoshi? 
Or did you ship it via Disney? (Did they give you one of those forms with a “reference number” and Disney merchandising contact info in the upper left, or was it something else?)

If you shipped it with Mitsukoshi, there should be a tracking number somewhere on the receipt or form they gave you. If not, reach out to them via email and ask for tracking.
If it was Disney, you don’t get a tracking number unless you call them or email them and ask - but if you have UPS MyChoice or sign up for it with the address/name/email you gave them, UPS will automatically email you when the package ships and let you know when it’s coming.
If it was on Disney property, it’s “with Disney” even if they aren’t directly running the merchandising - they surely aren’t allowing a store to run in Disney Springs or Epcot that is ripping off customers, this is a no brainer.


I’m assuming you’re talking about Mitsukoshi, which again is a legitimate business that Disney ensures isn’t scamming customers out of *their parks pavilion* and which has a legitimate customer service website/email/contact. 
I’ve had countless things shipped by them with no issues, and they replaced our swords at no cost in rapid time when something was damaged by UPS.
Then literally why would you purchase in the first place if you’re just going to assume it’s a scam and won’t ship?

And I doubt you’ve had this experience with *Disney* because they definitely always ship and their merchandising department is beyond on top of things and helpful.
And what has given you *any* indication that that could’ve *possibly* happened?
Why on earth would buying an item from the park and paying to ship it home - something people do daily if not hourly there - make you think you’ve been ripped off? This is such an unnecessarily accusatory post for a simple, legitimate business transaction and you have zero reason to believe anything suspicious has happened.
Man, must be nice!

Mushrooms make me abundantly more aware of just how terrible my health is. *Nothing* breaks through the severity of my Narcolepsy.
It 100% is. So many options, and all of them knock DLR out of the park.
Yeah, it’s very much a luck thing. I’ve never once gotten sick at Disney, even visiting during the more pandemic-y times - and can’t think of a time I’ve gotten sick from travel *anywhere* for that matter. 


My immune system is terrible, I generally get sick frequently throughout the year to varying degrees - but always at home when I’m doing little/nothing - and I have severe disabilities including one that compromises my immune system.


Was on a direct flight from the west coast two rows away from a child with the most disgusting sounding cough of all time over a week ago, still fine now - it’s impossible to predict who will get sick or why, and frankly I don’t worry about it. When you spend your entire life disabled and exhausted 24/7, it’s easier to accept that you can’t control things, and just take it as it comes instead of wasting what little enjoyable time you have worrying.
Which isn’t to say that I don’t wash my hands or anything, I do maintain regular hygiene habits, but I’m long done with masking, I don’t sanitize constantly, and I’m not trying to create a bubble around me in public - or panicking when others seem “unclean” in my vicinity.

The whole “everything is filthy!!1!1!1! Clean constantly!1!1!1” is just not how I choose to live. You can’t eradicate 100% of the germs around you, and many people still get sick even with all the over the top “prevention measures” - I’m on vacation to relax and get away, not glove up and spend a week in a neurotic episode over a potential germ.
If you’re not into role play, it seems like it wouldn’t be that much of a value for you. (I haven’t gone, but from everything I’ve watched and read.)


Part of why we decided not to go when we originally had booked for December was the fact that we are not big role play people - improv isn’t our thing and we cringe at a lot of that stuff in the moment and can’t just dive into it - and the itinerary really relies on you being engaged in the story fully 24/7. We do get into costuming for GE, but the level of interactive improv on the Starcruiser seemed a bit much for our comfort levels. 

Coupled with the exhausting schedule - I have Narcolepsy, I can’t get up at 8am and be gogogogo - it wasn’t justifiable for us, even though we’re a 10000 on the fan scale. 

I regret canceling a bit now that it’s closing, because it does look amazing and there may never be another thing like it - and we love GE - but for the cost it seems you need to be *very* into role play to get your moneys worth of the experience.
People acting like it made things complicated or confusing, or like it was forcing them to overplan boggle my mind.
It takes 5 seconds to make a park pass reservation. It’s easy, straightforward, and they explain it - and tell you you need it - in countless places. 
Dining and fast pass reservations have been a thing for *ages* - you weren’t just able to waltz in and do everything without putting a single thought to it before, nor is it realistic to think that’s how a vacation like this would ever work. Adding a quick “I want to visit this park first” reservation to it doesn’t somehow make it a huge hassle.
I don’t mean this to taunt you, rather I’m hoping that putting things very bluntly will motivate some self reflection on your part. 


How little self respect must you have to *not only* stay with someone who can’t even accomplish the most basic human upkeep and maintenance, but consider staying with them if they *lie* to you about it on top of that? 

Showering and not smelling like shit is the bare minimum. It’s not a wild boundary or expectation to have or set. 99% of people do this without needing to think about it - it’s just a given, a core part of their routine.
How you can even stand to be around someone like this is beyond me, it’s *disgusting.* Rewarding this filth/goblin with sex and affection is truly mind-boggling - 99% of people would *run* from this man the second he refused to shower/use deodorant the first time, not reward him with sex and a relationship. 

The fact that you’re even asking “what if he lies” says a lot here. You need to do some soul searching and figure out why you’re okay with these behaviors and are *willingly choosing* a relationship with someone most people wouldn’t want to share an enclosed space with. You even say it doesn’t seem mental health related - that’s even more of a reason you should’ve laid down a firm ultimatum about cleanliness standards long ago, and left if it didn’t improve. 
Therapy sounds like a good path for you.
Uh, yeah. It absolutely is.

I am fucking disabled. I’m at a major disadvantage vs those who are not disabled. I’m weaker physically, mentally, and can do far less. My life is substantially harder and I am substantially more miserable. If that’s not a “weakness” I don’t know what is.
I’m sick of people trying to reframe disabilities as a positive, or “not that bad” or something that “makes you, you” or any of that. 
It’s a horrible, constantly draining curse. It’s a lifelong prison sentence. There is no positive here and it’s not offensive to me when people see it that way - because that’s the way it is.
This is *not* the case for Tron, as I said. 

They *may* be flexible in some circumstances - they were for me, but I had a DAS related reason for being late - but don’t bet on it, it is being strictly enforced in most cases. Watched them turn people away numerous times and it has been posted many times here that this is the case.
This is blatantly false. 

You have a one hour window after your group is called, and for Tron it is absolutely being enforced in many/most cases. They are more flexible with early group numbers as long as you head to Tron the second you get into the park, but even then some people have been turned away.
If it was a value resort, you’d *never* stay there. Would be booked up forever - or the theming would be lackluster and not as appealing, like AOA/All Stars.
Stimulant medications used for Narcolepsy treatment are also a problem with this. Wide variance in side effects and effectiveness - some generics I’m fine, others I will have 30 debilitating migraine days in a row, and fall asleep in the shower/driving/walking/doing anything.
It makes DLR feel so tiny and lackluster to me, honestly. I had leaving Disneyland and being in a pretty unappealing stretch of Anaheim. Part of the appeal and magic of WDW is being immersed in the experience and having beautifully maintained, wonderful resorts/food/places to relax all around you vs walking out to all the gross chaos.
100%! It’s such an abusive ride 😭 
I always do it because “oh it’s Space Mountain, I have to!” and I *always* regret it. The Disneyland SM isn’t even the best ride on earth but in comparison to WDW… 
Feels like I’m trying to hoist myself up and crawl out of the crypt on the exit. Always glad there’s stuff to see in the edit hall because I spend a solid 5-10 collecting my sanity there 😂
Everest is definitely something to work your way up to if you’re “coaster resistant” 😅

The commenter you responded to is probably good to give it a go, but OP, it wouldn’t be my first or second choice for overcoming a fear of coasters.
I ride it every trip, and every trip I hoist myself out of the ride car, stumble to the exit, and say “I think that took 20 years off my life.”
It’s a beautiful ride, but the backwards sensation is intense - for me/some, at least! - and the Yeti sounds/overall pace makes me *very* tense 😂
That said, it’s very fun, and I never skip it, but it’s definitely a lot to handle! 


Also on a side note, Space Mountain - WDW version, anyway - while not as “intense” feels like it takes *50 years* off my life, and leaves me feeling shaken and abused 😂
Oh 100%. I am pretty anti-kids in general, so I’m usually very good at weaving in and out and dodging them, but man… wish it wasn’t like an obstacle course - where children are the obstacles - 99% of the time. That’s why late/closing time is the best!
This comment was a… wild… ride… 

Ahem…

That’s a pretty hilarious story, though! I love Mr. Toads and loved it as a kid, but I’m also a weirdo and my parents had no concept of “age appropriate” so that may be why. I’m pretty surprised it has survived with the hell-scene, but I’m glad it’s still there.
No lies detected, I am with you 😂
Agreeing with the person you asked - the empty, beautifully lit, peaceful park on the way out after close is so special. You can really take in the lights and the music, and slow down - and not have people running into you or ramming you with strollers - and it’s just really comforting and relaxing. 
Plus you can get some great photos without the crowds in the background!
There are too many things to factor in to call “lower cost of living” in itself a net positive. 

You have to factor in things like having family nearby, established support circle nearby, general absurd cost of moving to a new state, losing benefits moving to a new state - such as expanded Medicaid in some states, or food stamps - not being able to establish a healthcare team of comparable accessibility or quality in a new place, etc. etc. etc. 

I rely on Medicaid to survive, and live in a high cost of living area. I’m barely making it and it’s only getting worse all the time. But I can’t move somewhere without expanded Medicaid, nor can I move somewhere I’d lose my food stamps, access to my specialists - it can take *years* to get in and established with new care teams/medical groups for all kinds of things - and that’s just the tip of it. 
The rent may be lower but I’ll drown either way, so yeah, that’s why a lot of us stay put. This whole “move to lower cost of living areas” is the *illusion* of choice for many of us poor folks - it’s not ever truly on the table.
All the time. 

Sometimes it hits me harder or longer than others, but it *never* fails to throw a blanket of sadness over me, no matter what I’m doing.

I lost my stepdad very unexpectedly last January, and it has been hard to come to terms with the finality of this loss, and all the missed opportunities I should’ve taken when he was alive to do more and spend more time together. 


This week, a few times, it was “I would’ve loved to have gifted him ____” 

Last week I was driving to the store and heard a song from a musician he really liked that I was excited to show him. 

I had a really bad one a few weeks back when I was daydreaming about how cool it would be to get to go on a trip with him and my mom some day… but that day won’t come… and my mom will never get to have those experiences with him again… and how must she feel every day if this is how I’m feeling now?

It happens all the time. It never feels good. I try to treasure that they are still on my mind, and imagine how they would’ve felt about the thing I wanted to share, but it hardly makes it any easier.

I’m so sorry for your loss.
Insomnia is 100% possible with Narcolepsy, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise, or act like you may not really have it because you can’t fall asleep at 8pm. 🙄🙄

A huge part of this shitty illness is not being able to sleep *when you want to,* but being exhausted/needing sleep at inappropriate/unwanted times.
In some places there’s fee caps. Or like here in Portland, for as horrible as this shithole city is, they at least have a first come first serve ordinance for applications.
100%. “Doing better” is knowing that you are *not* in a place to provide a stable, financially secure, “better” life to a child, whatsoever.

I’m not saying children raised in poverty can’t have a good life, but as someone who lived through it as a kid… the bad moments were far more frequent than *any* good. I can truly say I would’ve rather not known life, given the choice, than deal with the instability, food insecurity, financial worries, etc. 
Growing up poor often means starting life as an adult poor, too - I was set up for a lifetime of pain and suffering, especially ending up disabled. My mom is *still* struggling and impoverished. 

The way to do better here is to know that it’s not the time to “do” at all.
I absolutely would, it has been a dream of mine since I was a kid.

I know that the "outsider" perspective is *a lot* different than what it is actually like to work there, but I've worked plenty of majorly shitty, public-facing jobs, and I understand the downsides of working at a place like Disney, with so many guests, shitty entitlement, etc.

When I was a kid, I dreamed of being an Imagineer. I would've loved to work with animatronics, ride development, attraction decor type stuff. But I also grew up poor, and I'm disabled, so it was never really going to be on the table for me. 

I would *still* love to work in the parks, but I am heavily tattooed, and have a severe disability, so the opportunity won't ever arise for me.

That said, in "imagination land" I would move to Florida/California in a *heartbeat* to work at Disney, assuming I could find a reasonable place to live close enough to commute from.  
Florida would be tough for me with the extreme climate - I've lived in the Pacific Northwest for over a decade, hot ain't a thing like there over here - but I have really good friends there that I wish weren't on the opposite side of the country from me.  
I lived in San Diego as a kid, and would ***love*** to move back, so Disneyland would probably be the better hypothetical choice for me, but the cost of living is *nuts*, and I ***MUCH*** prefer World to Land, no competition. 

&#x200B;

Sure, the pay isn't great, and cast members *definitely* deserve *so much more,* but it's not impossible to make work - especially if you work up to or land a higher paying role.

I obviously can't say from experience, but my thought would be that it doesn't "ruin the magic" it just changes what the magic means - *you* become the magic, and providing that to guests is I'm sure what makes some of the shittier aspects easier to deal with, even if only a little.  
I've had some really great talks about it with some cast members - usually PhotoPass or Oga's staff when they're not busy and can chat for longer periods - and there are those who definitely don't visit the parks as much because of aspects of the job, but there are just as many I've talked to who *genuinely* seem to love everything about working there, visit often, etc.  
Funny enough, I ran into a PhotoPass guy we had at Hollywood Studios a couple days later when we were walking around Pop Century. He was there with his lady, they were grabbing lunch at Disney Springs I believe, might've been popping into the parks for a ride or something. They seemed just as cheery and thrilled to be on property as he did joyfully making our photo experience special. Everything in life is what you make it, truly.
I have had luck asking a cast member for alternatives when the LL is too long and will defeat the purpose of DAS for me, and they will often allow me to go in the “wheelchair entrance” - there still may be a small wait, but it’s much more manageable and I’m not crammed in with hundreds of LL folks. 

Not always, but it doesn’t hurt to ask.
Sometimes they’ve offered to allow my partner to wait in the line while I wait out front, and then the cast member bring me through the queue when he’s a few guests away from boarding, but this hasn’t worked for my needs so we haven’t tried it.
It still wouldn’t be instant access. You waited on the app already. DAS people have to wait *twice,* and potentially twice as long if not more.
The purpose of DAS, in part, is to allow people who can’t wait in a traditional line to still access attractions. 
Having them wait in a physical line that can be horrendous because it’s the damn lightning lane line defeats this purpose entirely, especially when we’ve already had to wait in the “virtual line” when we book the attraction.
For those of us who can’t wait in a longer traditional line, it’s a nightmare - having waited a long time already on the app just to turn up and *still* have it be inaccessible for you because of your disabilities *sucks.*
Yep, exactly! 

I take a controlled substance medication. It is necessary for my survival - and honestly the safety of others if I’m out and about, potentially - and is the only way I can function *at all.* My illness is cripplingly severe, a horrible disability I wouldn’t inflict on my worst enemy, and is still barely manageable with medication, but without the meds I would have no life at all, and likely would’ve died years ago. 

I 100% need the medication, I have a legitimate, diagnosed illness with more than enough medical records to “prove” or validate the severity of my symptoms and disability, and have used it for many years 100% responsibly. 


But even though there’s no question my need for the medication is legitimate and consistent, because it’s a controlled substance, I have to be *extremely* careful at all times when visiting a doctor/urgent care/hospital for *anything.*
There is such a stigma against these medications, and some medical “professionals” have such a shitty view towards them and the patients who take them, that you have to be constantly aware that a worker may take *anything* you say and spin it against you at any time in a way that seriously fucks up your treatment plan, may keep you from getting the meds you need, and that you’ll be very limited in ways to fight back against.
Not just obvious things like mentions of drug use or mental health woes - *anything.* 
The laws around these meds in many ways create serious, terrible barriers for people who *genuinely* need them in an attempt to keep people who don’t from having them either. I’m not saying there shouldn’t be regulations to keep them from misuse, but the general attitude towards these meds/people using them *sucks.* 
Those of us who *need* them are in constant worry of doing *anything* “wrong” that could cause a doctor to ruin my life over stigma/prejudices.
And for those people, a cartoony card is going to make a difference? 
How would that play out? “I know you’re being rude and denying I have a disability, but here, read this!”
This, 100%.

I don't care how "great the owner is" or how much time and effort gets put into training.

***IT ISN'T WORTH THE RISK.***

There are *how many* other dog breeds available? **No one** *needs* one of these.

When something happens and it mauls/kills another person, pet, child, etc. - it's *too late.*

And it happens **CONSTANTLY.**

It's ***always*** the pit that was "trained well" or "never hurt a fly" or "is lovely, sweet, kind, gentle, and a giant baby."

Your *want* to take a chance on this breed is **not,** ***EVER***, somehow more important than the lives and safety of the people and pets around you - because "unforeseen events" ***do*** happen, *all the time*, and there's no taking that back.

YOU as an owner are ***NEVER*** going to out love, out train, out discipline, out socialize, out whatever else **GENETICS** AND ***BREED TRAITS.***

Breed traits exist. Gameness exists. The general lack of self-preservation and "oh time to stop" in these animals exists.

If you live in the middle of nowhere with a fence that can't be crawled/jumped over/under, without any living humans/pets around you, then sure, feel free to take a chance like this. Whatever.

But the amount of people who see no problem with this level of selfish entitlement, deciding to take a risk like this at the potential expense of everyone around them... ugh.

&#x200B;

**Edit:** Before it happens, let me just state - I am **not** going to argue with *anyone* about this. I'm not here to debate your *feelings* on how "great" the breed is, or who is "really at fault" for whatever. Don't care, save your breath. Pit bull literally mauled people, that's the facts in this post - and in *endless* posts every day, because it's happening *constantly*, and it's ***always*** brutal and if you're thinking about arguing with me to defend these things given *all that... OOooof.*
I'm not sure if links are allowed here - if it gets removed before you see it, let me know and I will DM it to you. But [this is the group I personally use.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DVCRental/) I have used them 15 times, with a handful of different owners, and have never had any issues - if you have any questions/would like some recommendations for owners/properties, let me know!

&#x200B;

You are correct, due to the nature of these types of reservations, David's does not allow cancellations/refunds. You will be *very* hard pressed to find a DVC rental service offering cancellations - and I'd be cautious if I did see one, as it would make me question the legitimacy.

The "workaround" for this would be to get travel insurance - David's suggests you do this, I believe on the page outlining their cancelation policy.

Alternatively, if you have any credit cards that offer extra purchase protections, or travel protections, you may be able to feel more "safe" in your booking by using one of those cards to pay for the reservation. (Many cards offer some type of purchase and possibly even travel protection, it's a good idea to research this just to see what is available to you.)

I personally have never had to deal with this, because I haven't had to cancel a trip. (Partially why I prefer to wait to book until closer to, I will usually book flights much earlier, park passes, dining, etc. but wait on the non-refundables until I know for sure it will all come together.)Like you said, things do happen though - travel insurance is *never* a *bad* idea. Perhaps you would feel more comfortable booking something that can be canceled until your kiddo is a bit older/you aren't as concerned, but again, there are many things you just can't plan for, so it's definitely a "risk" to take.

Some DVC owners may allow you to cancel the reservation so long as you leave enough time for them to "resell" and book someone else, but I haven't seen that super often. Some may be accommodating in case of legitimate emergency, but don't advertise that leniency to avoid cancelations. All depends on who you deal with.
I used David's to stay at the Polynesian in December of 2020, and they were *great*. Completely legitimate, no hidden fees or hassle, everything just as it says on the website. Great customer service - at least in my experience - and the process, though it asks a lot of questions, is very easy. Being able to put in for multiple resorts and know the price estimate before hand is really nice, and they have killer deals on confirmed reservations sometimes.

We had an *amazing* stay with zero mishaps, and got an absolutely unreal price for our visit. I highly recommend them, and would absolutely use them again.

I *personally* go direct through DVC owners now, using a very active Facebook group, but that's *not* in *any way* because of anything David's Vacation Rental did or didn't do - I've just found better availability, and *sometimes* better prices when booking more "last minute" - say, 3-5 months out - through renting direct - and sometimes not even, David's usually has better prices on the resorts that we prefer, but they are not always as available, and you should probably book 6ish months in advance, whereas sometimes I prefer to wait on dropping that much cash until I've planned everything else out 100%. 

  
I always check David's before committing to any direct rentals, and will absolutely opt to book with them next time if they have the price/availability I need.

  
With direct booking, you also run the risk of dealing with someone unsavory, or who causes a problem - intentionally or otherwise. Even though you can read their reviews/vouches, things can always happen, whereas it's a lot *less* likely for a company who has been around for a  long time like David's to pull something unpleasant. 

There are plenty of other rental sites out there, but personally I have always found David's to have the best prices, best policies, and least hassle.
100%. 


Life, for any of us, can end in an instant - you can’t take the money with you, and I promise you will regret experiences not had and enjoyed more than you’ll regret not saving the money. 


Don’t look at it as “not the best financial decision” - you’ve earned it, and you deserve the break. Take it while you can - there is no guarantee of tomorrow, so the perfect and responsible time to take it is when you have the extra money and you and your family are in good health and able to travel. 


During the pandemic, the unemployment payments were the first time I experienced consistent, livable income in my life. 
Should I have done a better job of saving during that time? Probably, from a purely finance perspective. 
But as someone who has lived their entire live in abject poverty, and who has always been severely disabled, I took the opportunity to go on a couple trips with my partner, knowing I may never have the extra money to do it again.
I have zero regrets. I look back on those memories so fondly, and they make it easier to get through this awful life. My extra savings would have lasted longer had I not, but that few months of delaying the inevitable would’ve done little for me.
Mouse Dining is one of many services that does this. It’s a small fee and works wonderfully, couldn’t be easier to set up.
*No one* wants to be subjected to your “overtired pint sized *terror*” during their already uncomfortable and stressful travel day. You’re not the only one on the plane, have some courtesy, *please.*
Are you really pretending not to know how inflation and rising prices - not a concept exclusive to Disney - work? 
?????? 

And no, it didn’t cost her $99 in 2006, and yes, prices on *everything* have raised since 2006, in case you’ve forgotten.
Exactly.

The total price may seem “large” at first glance, but when you break down how many day/multi-day passes you’d buy before breaking even, it isn’t bad *at all* if you go even remotely often - or even if you’re just taking a couple trips a year, or one long trip. 
Plus the parking, discounts, park hopper, etc. - it’s only a bad deal if you’re not going to visit more than say, 5-10 days in that year. Sure you’re paying up front, but hey - that’s the trade.
I absolutely hate kids. Can’t stand them. Don’t enjoy interacting with them whatsoever and have zero patience for it. 


I enjoy the parks just fine, and feel no guilt or shame about it. However, I also don’t interact with kids while there, and keep my disdain to myself, so it’s not a problem. 

As long as you aren’t actively “acting out” towards/around them, no one needs to know your personal views and it’s no one’s business - there isn’t a rule that you have to adore those little shits to be admitted into the park, just that you’re respectful of everyone around you, which isn’t hard. 

There’s nothing “wrong” with a preference or a feeling on something like this, as long as you aren’t mistreating others as a result. Anyone who says otherwise, frankly, matters not. Enjoy your trips to the park, you belong there just as much as every other paid guest.
The stigma against Adderall/stimulant medication is *insane.* 
So many shitty, judgmental, and blatantly incorrect comments I’ve seen on posts about the shortages… and articles and posts are always focused on fucking ADHD patients, never people with Narcolepsy 🙄 
My partner and I both have prescriptions for it and the tones people take when he calls around to check pharmacy stock is insane. 
Everyone with a *legitimate prescription* just trying to *get the medication they need to survive* must be tweaker drug seekers, right? Infuriating. 
It’s your job to provide medications, not to decide if you think someone’s treatment plan is viable. If you don’t agree with stimulant medications existing, you’re a piece of shit, especially if you let that show in your interactions  on the job 🤷‍♀️
As someone who has spent the last year watching my mom grieve her husband, my stepdad, who died by suicide, there is no “normal” when a person close to you dies. The kinds of comments and mourning behaviors expressed in the OP are perfectly “common” reactions for some, when someone close to them dies, even if they may be uncomfortable or cringeworthy to others. 

It’s also not “weird” or uncommon to grieve the loss of a pet. I hate dogs, but I’m also not a sociopath so I understand that death hurts and losing a pet you were very attached to, regardless of how flawed that relationship was, can be painful and traumatic to someone. 

The real problem here is that the mom obviously treated her human child as second to the dog, isn’t getting proper therapy to process this loss if it’s as hard for her to process as she is claiming, and that she is still a controlling mess to her adult son from a distance.
I'm starting to wonder which is "right" after this post.... I personally keep a TON of cash around, because I don't trust banks to "have my back" and quickly resolve fraud/problems, nor do I want to be relying on them in an emergency - or having to explain to my landlord why rent is "on hold" because of a banking error/locked account/etc.

But I'm probably also *way* too paranoid, and I'm willing to admit that.
Don't leave anything in your car you'd be upset about having stolen, just as a smart rule of thumb. (At least not in most areas these days, I'd think, but I'm in a city with a HUGE car theft/property crime problem)

*I'd* be more upset having $100 stolen out of my car, so I'm willing to risk the potential of being at a drive thru or gas station without my wallet - which has happened a total of once in my entire life, and I can always use a cardless ATM as well.  
If my car/city was more secure, and I cared less about $100, it wouldn't be unwise to have some emergency cash around. Maybe $20\~ makes more sense, $100 and my ass would be CHAPPED, $20 I'd just be miffed.
To each their own! Not everywhere is for everyone! 

I’ve paid money to go there, and quite enjoyed it. Again, comparing it to where I live, it was a welcome break and I enjoyed everything I did - again, as a tourist. 
There’s a lot to do there, and a lot of it is very enjoyable.
Yeah! They're getting one in Grapevine that is set to open in a couple months, actually!   
Texas will actually be getting a second one as well, though it will be in Houston - I believe next year. 

I've only been to the Vegas one, but I loved it, and looking forward to checking out the Santa Fe and Denver locations someday - as well as the Texas locations when they open!
It’s not “bad” at all. There’s areas that aren’t great, but that goes for everywhere. I like it a hell of a lot better than where I live - Portland - that’s for sure. 
There’s some really cool venues/pockets with lots to do. They’re getting a Meow Wolf soon - well, Grapevine, but close enough - which is a neat thing. 
It’s *hardly* a bad place to visit.
And, here in the PNW, it isnt legally permitted for dogs to be in restaurants, bars, or grocery stores. 
It’s insane, everywhere I go there’s a damn mutt inside where it legally doesn’t belong, and nothing is done about it. 
People constantly asking “what are some dog friendly bars/restaurants I can bring my dog into?”
Well, technically *fucking none,* but these entitled, self-absorbed idiots don’t believe any rules apply to them.
And he was. 

He explained that you get added room, food, and drink, but that comparatively to the baseline offerings, it isn’t much of an increase, because Alaska is already comfortable.
He mentions that the quality of food and drink isn’t high enough to justify the cost in most situations but that it isn’t bad. 

*No shit* it’s going to be “in his opinion” - just like everyone else’s comments are.
If OP just wants to know what the offerings are, zero opinion on quality, he can *read the Alaska website.*
And yet somehow that’s a perfectly reasonable thing to mention in a review of first class/what to expect. If the expected experience doesn’t feel worth the upgrade/cost, it’s worth noting and setting expectations accordingly. 🤨🙄
Because it truly doesn’t matter at higher reforges. I’m over 30 reforges on chain blades, and I roll through 10-50 escalations crazy quick - solo or with a random team - and I prefer to bring my shock blades because the teleport saves me some running, and the distance between matches gets old. 
I haven’t died in an escalation in a *long* time, though, and pull my weight - and then some a lot of the time - so I’m not the kind of player you’re asking about, it seems. 

You’d have to ask each individual player why. 
They could be trying something new, could’ve gotten bad advice for their level, don’t have another weapon, want to use the special specifically, are trying to complete a challenge, etc. etc. 
There’s always “skip matchmaking” if it’s annoying enough to you 😬
Truly doesn’t matter, for me. My symptoms are at the absolute worst end of severe regardless of the whether.

If it’s miserable, dark, gloomy, cold, and shitty - how Oregon is 98% of the time - the seasonal depression, lack of Vitamin D/sunlight, and overall darkness make things worse.

If it’s hot, the heat is exhausting, the seasonal allergies suck, the dryness and dehydration are tiring, and it fucks with my sleep schedule and gives me migraines - which make me that much more tired. Exertion of any kind in the heat is made that much harder and more draining. 

Basically there’s no winning.
When the *hell* will this start being enforced? 
I’m so sick of dogs in restaurants, bars, grocery stores, etc. 
My local city subreddit has people *seeking out* places that’ll allow their shitty mutts inside, and you’re downvoted into oblivion for reminding them - in perfectly plain language with no hints of dog-free mentality, I should mention - that it’s literally not legal and they are violating health codes. 
A “dog friendly” bar/restaurant/store shouldn’t exist because it’s *not allowed to exist,* but these people are so fucking entitled and the rules never apply to them.
So is Oga’s, by a landslide.
Why would they not just do fingerprints like WDW does? Solves this problem very easily.
I lived in Dallas and Midland/Odessa for a while, I feel you! 

Dallas was a lot better than living in Portland, but Midland… that small town Texas “community” coupled with the heat and humidity… nightmarish. I still have bad dreams about walking through 115 degree heat with pocket change I scraped together to fill containers with water at the outside stations, with the air stinking of oil. Was a weird place to live.
Not to hijack this post, but I'm curious:

What's the cost of living like there these days?

I was born in Laguna Hills and grew up in Oceanside/Orange County/San Diego, but sadly my parents made the mistake of moving to Portland, Oregon in my early teens, and I am once again stuck here now well into adulthood.

I have such fond memories of San Diego, and have visited as an adult and loved it, but it just seems way out of my ability financially - even with as bad as Portland has gotten, too.
If you're on Medicaid, your options will likely be limited by the Medicaid policies/options in any given state.

I live in Oregon, and I fucking hate this pitiful slice of hell, but I don't foresee myself ever being able to move because I rely on Oregon Health Plan - our Medicaid - and food stamps, etc.

When moving out of state, your eligibility will change, the coverage of the program will change, and you're going to have to find all new doctors - and hope they have availability, provide a good quality of care, will prescribe the same medications so you don't have to go through a hellish adjustment period, etc.   
In a lot of places, I wouldn't bank on that being an easy transition, if even possible *at all.*

Then you factor in new cost of living, transportation issues - a lot of places in the south, for example, are not so easy to get around/navigate.

Anywhere that doesn't get very cold in the winter is going to cost you that much more - and hopefully you like 110 degrees all summer!

Community doesn't just exist for you because you show up somewhere and place the responsibility on them to come together and take care of your needs.   
A religious organization or tight community group existing somewhere prior to you moving does not mean they will accept you with open arms and take care of you in the ways you are seeking.  
In order to find these types of community groups, you often need to be *very* active in them, have a lot to provide/bring to the table yourself, and "fit in" swimmingly with the types of personalities in the group - not be overly needy or negative, etc.  
This isn't easy, and it's why *a lot* of people don't have that "community" feeling around them.   
It can take years in one place to find a group anything remotely close to what you're describing, and again, ***you*** need to bring a lot to the table from the start to really integrate into a close community and establish yourself to where they are rushing to your aid. 

There are religious organizations and community groups in Denver that operate the way you're describing. Why you aren't finding yourself included in those groups is anyone's guess - but it's not Denver's fault, so to speak, and will likely happen to your everywhere until all the right variables come together at the right time for you to find that spot you "fit" with a group you enjoy.

This isn't to get you down or be negative - just some perspective. In Portland/Seattle the "Pacific Northwest freeze"/"Seattle Freeze" is a big thing - people aren't very friendly, they're passive aggressive, it's really hard to find friends/a community group. And yet many have that close community here, because they did the work, found a spot they fit in, and it just all fell into place. On the flipside, many don't, and it's very isolating for a lot of us.  
I have lived in over 15 cities across the US, there are some more enjoyable than others, some where people are friendlier *on the surface* \- people are more bubbly in the south than they are in the Pacific Northwest, but that doesn't mean they're genuinely nice/friendly people, or people you want to be in a group with - but the only factor you can control in any given place is yourself.  
If you want a solid support group, it's going to take time.   


No one wants a dead-weight, or a negative-Nancy - not saying you are one, please don't take this the wrong way! - so people are generally attracted to positive, upbeat, self-sufficient folks who seem like they will bring good energy to a gathering, and who will contribute instead of constantly needing.  
I know how hard that is when you're disabled - I'm a 24/7 rain cloud, I can't help it - but doing your best to develop those qualities to the best of your ability, and bringing that to groups of similar people who will understand where you're at better - a support group for people with disabilities, for example, vs. a church group with people of all ages/demographics who may not take to you/understand where you're coming from - is a good place to start.
Amazing, I’m so glad that’s an option! I know a ton of people are coming out with negative reviews of Tron, but I’m a lifelong Tron fan, and will just be happy to get to ride it even if it isn’t the long, immersive experience people would prefer from the ride. So excited!! Thank you!!

Thank you so much! 
I’ll be eligible for the extra hours at Epcot and Magic Kingdom next month so wanted to know if it was wise to plan for the morning queue *and* potentially riding it a second time in the evening, since I’m only doing one day at both. That’s great to hear!
Does the extended evening hours queue work the same as the 7am and 1pm? I've not encountered it yet - I've done the evening hours but not in a park with a virtual queue so far - and don't see much posted about it.

I'm guessing if you get the normal queue in the morning, and have already had your group called, you can't then enter the evening hours queue, or does it provide the opportunity to ride twice that day potentially?
Yep, OP sounds *fucking awful.* 

Stereotypical “have you tried to diet/exercise/work harder/eat better/stop being depressed???” bullshit from someone who doesn’t really want their partner to improve their symptoms and difficult health woes, but just wants the person to “get/be better” in ways that are more convenient and appealing *to them.*  


WOW OP, you mean your constant insistence that she exercise and motivate to your liking, buying her a gym membership/equipment when she’s trying to battle depression and a new and scary health diagnosis, and having zero understanding of mental health issues isn’t causing her to *jump enthusiastically onto your dick?!*
Color me surprised.
If you feel compelled to do so, you could reach out more directly via email or perhaps a message on social media to see where to direct a more personalized, in-depth cast compliment.

I kind of dislike the in-app cast compliments, and was disappointed with the feature when they rolled it out - there's no way to personalize them or go into any detail, and maybe that's because that's what Disney wants, but I feel like leaving a general "they did good" that's the same for all cast doesn't give them the full recognition they deserve when they go above and beyond to levels like in your post. 

I'm so sorry to hear about your father in law, and I hope you and your family are able to grieve and heal together peacefully. This will no doubt be a wonderful memory your kids carry with them for the rest of their lives, both because of *you,* and because of the amazing magic of the cast members.
I’d add to this that things usually don’t work out when you move “backwards” - from living together to “starting over” dating - and it can be difficult-to-impossible to reframe the phase of the relationship both in the short term and long term.
Setting new boundaries and adjusting when you take a step back can be difficult and something that causes a lot of fighting. 
When you’re already fighting this much, things are unlikely to survive.
Agreed. This could easily be the case for OPs partner - only way to figure it out is to sit down and have a specific discussion about it and how it makes him feel and what her thoughts are.
I will often be scrolling my phone aimlessly or cleaning or doing something with my hands when my partner is talking to me. I’m listening actively, I respond when it warrants it and I engage actively, and my partner doesn’t take offense because I’m an active participant even if I’m not sitting there still, staring at him, doing nothing else.
I have ADHD and Narcolepsy, I will fall asleep or completely zone out if I’m just sitting and looking at someone while trying to listen. I have to multitask to stay focused on them.
UPS *will* charge you to change the delivery location - even to a neighbors house or a different location than your damn porch sometimes - and to change the delivery date, but they *won’t* do this unprompted, won’t reach out to you and ask you to pay for it, and you have to go in and request to make those changes yourself on their website via your tracking.
* People don't want to be fired, especially when cost of living and inflation are so bad right now - and getting worse all the time - that people are living in a lot more desperate situations than ever before. The employees that *want to* tell these nutters to leave know that their boss will not stand up for them when Karen and her stinky mutt go to management, claim it was a service dog, etc.  
The "customers are always right" mentality is still very present in a lot of workplaces, and it's not worth the risk.   
Dog owners are the worst kind of entitled, and you know they aren't just going to go "okay fine" and leave when a minimum wage employee tells them to leave.
* People don't want to be accosted by customers, or their stinky ass dogs.   
9 times out of 10 when I see a dog in public, it's a fucking piece of shit pit bull, and quite frankly, I wouldn't approach the owner either. No one gets paid enough to have one of these nutjobs go off on them - and potentially have their dog follow trend.  
There's so few consequences when a dog attacks that these owners aren't that concerned with the outcome if piss-fingers were to pop off at the Kroger.
* A large amount of employees are dog nutters themselves, and don't want the dogs to leave, despite it being illegal. Or they know their coworkers are, and will gang up on them. Or their boss is a nutter - or has said "don't confront the nutters" for one reason or another. 

The real problem is that there is no enforcement of these laws by a more powerful entity than a minimum wage employee or their boss. 

Nutter-run/owned businesses get away with it because there are no consequences. Some of these places even *encourage* dogs even though they legally aren't permitted to be in the business.   
Nutters get away with it because they're the loudest, most entitled, most unhinged group, so while the right thing to do is say "get out, it's the law" it's often not worth the fallout.
In many places, it isn’t *legal.* In many places, dogs *are not* allowed in grocery stores or places where food is served.

The owners/employees disregard these things because they’re either dog nutters themselves, or they don’t want to deal with the entitled mob that is dog-people.
If only it worked that way! The problem would almost certainly follow 🥲
Stimulant medications - also used for Narcolepsy - are *very* different from *street meth.* 
Don’t compare the two.
Something that is universally true for disabilities of all kinds, visible and invisible, across all ages groups, is that people are *fucking rude* and *absolutely awful.* 
It doesn’t make it feel any better, but know you’re not alone, and we’ve all dealt with it and deal with it in some way *all the time.* 


I am not a wheelchair user right now, but regardless, one thing that has helped me to better process the looks/comments is to just really call it what it is.
In my head I will go, “wow. This *ableist,* judgmental piece of trash has so little going on in their empty, pathetic head, that they’re taking time out of their day to stare at me, and size me up. They think it’s okay to openly judge a person with a disability, that’s *disgusting.* What a pitiful, empty life they must have. How sad.”
Because that’s how it is - people staring at you, being close-minded, and judging you for having a disability aren’t *good people.* They’re scumbags, and the lowest of the low - as if you don’t have enough to deal with, having to dodge their shitty attitude too. 
People like that aren’t worth your time, attention, or energy. 
It takes a while to get past it, but eventually you just stop caring. You don’t even notice them anymore, most of the time. 

Shitty people are everywhere and will never go away. It’s part of life for everyone. Don’t let them win by staying home and hiding out - these people aren’t thinking about you after they leave wherever they encountered you and go about their day, so don’t hold yourself hostage to worrying about encountering *them.*
This 100%!

Your mother is a grown ass adult, OP. If she can’t be polite and respectful, that’s *her* wrong, not your wife’s for “being sensitive” when someone is being cruel and shitty.

You didn’t marry *your fucking mother,* you married *your wife.*
She is *your partner,* and your *other half.* 

If you don’t have enough respect for her to treat her as a priority, just say that - stop playing like she had equal hands in something that was 100% caused by your shitty, immature mom acting like a petulant child. 

My mom has caused issues in my relationship in the past. As such, she’s not invited to our home. It’s that simple. I had no qualms about saying, “because you can’t behave, this is off the table, for my sanity and the sake of my partner.”
Grow a damn pair and be an adult, OP. It’s this simple.
Skating around the issue is disrespectful to your wife, and looking for ways to lie about why they can’t stay is only pushing the issue into the future - where it will be a much, *much* bigger issue when you run out of lies.
Right?? 

And it’s always an attitude of “well, she *is* my mother…”

Like, hello… this is your fucking wife! If she doesn’t take priority… oof.
Thank you so much! That does help a lot, I really appreciate it! I know there's tons of guides out there to look up and explore - and I really should do that, heh - but this makes it easy to get started playing around. You rock! 

Best of luck with your room! I'm sure it'll look great no matter what you decide on!
This reminds me I seriously need to learn how to use Procreate 🤣 I have no idea what I’m doing and can’t fathom how to make anything like this using it! 
I know that’s not the point of the post, but you did a great job on these example images, I expected a paid app was behind it!
Amazing!! Congratulations! 
I love that bathroom, the tub by the window just really speaks to me 😭

I spotted some Ugly Dolls in your room, I haven’t seen those anywhere in some time, I still have my collection and it tickled me to see yours! 
You have a great sense of style, I love your decor and this is just such a cute layout overall. So jealous!! Enjoy!

Did I miss where this is located? (It’s okay if you don’t want to share, just curious! I haven’t seen many places this style, it’s lovely!)
Absolutely not. Go to the Narcolepsy subreddit for half a second and you’ll find a good majority of us take these medications.
Modafinil and similar medications are useless horseshit for a lot of us with *severe* Narcolepsy. 
Just because these medications have been around for a long time doesn’t mean they’re “older” and no longer used - they’re still extremely common and some of the *only* treatment options we have. 
You’ve been called out for being blatantly wrong and misinformed multiple times here, I don’t know what you’re trying to do here or what you think you’re trying to prove but I promise you, you don’t know better than an actual Narcoleptic who is taking these medications. 👋
I’ve been on Adderall for 15 years for Narcolepsy, and it was an option before that, and still is. Nothing has “changed.”
They still prescribe Dexedrine for Narcolepsy, what are you talking about? 
Adderall and Ritalin commonly as well, Vyvanse too.
Magical moments of all kinds happen constantly - it’s what makes Disney such a special place! 

My partner and I - both adults, no kids - have had a couple moments similar to this, believe it or not. 
We get really into visiting Galaxy’s Edge - Star Wars was a huge part of both of our childhoods and we are huge fans as adults - and put a lot of effort into our SW-themed “outfits” to visit that part of the park, since they have much looser “costume” rules there than the rest of the parks. 
One visit, a PhotoPass cast member cleared the entire area in front of the ship where Kylo Ren and his troopers come out, and took photos of us when the characters came out, keeping other guests from walking in the shot and allowing us some one-on-one interaction with them! 
Another, Chewbacca came out with a handler, and they came straight for us to say hello to my plush Grogu I was carrying, give us hugs, and take photos - cast let other guests meet him after, of course, but we were so shocked that they held other guests off/away until our interaction was done.

In those types of magical moments, you completely forget that you’re an adult at a theme park - it’s just pure, worry-free, simple joy. It takes me back to being a kid visiting Disneyland with my family - some of the only really great memories of my childhood that I have.

She will remember this for the rest of her life, I’m sure! Thank you for sharing ♥️ these stories remind me why I love Disney parks and cast so much. 
I hope you left them cast compliments too!
He’s *19,* unqualified, and asking Reddit how to manage. He’d *going* to bullshit his employees, who I feel bad for, because this is a terrible management situation to be working under.
You’re not going to get your symptoms treated without a diagnosis. That’s how it works - they have to figure out what your symptoms are caused by and diagnose it to proceed with proper treatment.
You may be able to get some form of medication beforehand if you explain your symptoms to them and how they’re disrupting your life, but not all doctors will do this, and you run the risk of being taken off those meds if you aren’t given a diagnosis that lines up with those meds - and depending on what they are, you’d have to stop taking them for 2+ weeks for the sleep study anyway.

You are not “special” in this regard - everyone had to wait some amount of time, everyone had to have testing done, everyone had to receive a diagnosis of the actual disorder *before being treated for it.* In many cases people wait a year or more for this process to conclude, that’s just how it goes. 
Yes, it’s frustrating, but it’s protocol.
Your diagnosis determines your treatment options. It’s not “academic” - it’s literally what they use to proceed with treatment.
It seems you don't really have much of an understanding of what Narcolepsy is and what the symptoms actually are.

"Constant naps" is *hardly* what Narcolepsy is. A quick search will tell you that excessive daytime sleepiness/excessive sleepiness, fragmented sleep/poor quality of overnight sleep, and "sleep attacks" are some of the main symptoms. "Constant naps" isn't really a symptom, it's a product of the condition for some sufferers, and a way some may deal with the exhaustion.

If you're tired "all the time" and aren't sleeping well at night, you would be wise to seek treatment *for those things.* Doing so is all part of treating Narcolepsy, which goes hand in hand with treating cataplexy - assuming you have either of those things and receive a proper diagnosis. 

Unfortunately yes, you will need a sleep study to further pursue a diagnosis, and more than likely yes, you will have to "jump through hoops" to get treatment. Narcolepsy/cataplexy are both decently "uncommon" problems and there aren't a ton of treatment options available. What is available doesn't work for everyone - and sadly, for some of us, doesn't work much *at all.*  
Finding a doctor/specialist that knows what they're doing/talking about when it comes to N1/N2 is decently difficult, and it can be hard to achieve proper, productive medication management that provides true relief from symptoms.  
It is a lifelong struggle for which there is no cure, and finding a balance - and battling tolerance for relevant medications - is a constant uphill battle.

The road to diagnosis can be, on its own, an insanely long and difficult one, but in the end it's worth it to know what's truly going on, and have a chance to treat it - even if only a little.

No one is *supposed to* feel "tired all the time" and have awful, fragmented sleep. It's not a small symptom, even if it seems your cataplexy is the more unmanageable side. It is worth it to get to the bottom of 100% of the symptoms, and try to treat all of them if you can. "Tired all the time" *is* a severe symptom, even if it may not seem like it because you're "used to it" or have dealt with it for so long.

Best of luck in your journey ahead.
Right?? 

It would take *zero* time for me to breakup if the person I was seeing ended up having a secret child they hid for 6 months.
Unless you’re having a one night stand, this is something you *absolutely* disclose, no matter how “hard” or “complicated” - especially once it’s getting into “dating” and “feelings” territory and not just hooking up.
No breakup needed, he’s already done the work for her - not responding, ignoring her and moving on with his life, he’s already made it clear he’s done now that she’s questioning his *real* relationship and family and isn’t just the easy side piece.
You literally used the term “emotionally cheated” in your post title - clearly you recognize that emotional cheating exists, and that she did it, so I don’t know why you keep asking as if it somehow makes it “better” if she just sexted and emotionally connected with her ex instead of physically fucking. 
If you genuinely believe she hasn’t physically cheated, you’re either being willfully ignorant or you’re incredibly naive. She’s “trickle-truthing” you by claiming she sexted, met her ex, went on hookup sites and set up potentially fuck meets on Craigslist but “never did anything physical” - you’d have to be a fool to believe all that occurred but she stopped short of physical cheating. 

The fact that she was on Seeking Arrangements really adds to what you’ve said in this comment - you paid off her debts, bought her a house and funded her every want… You have played the roll of a sugar daddy, for her, which clearly she was looking for - by using SA - and it sounds like you were possibly not the only one, or you just won out over other candidates. 

She absolutely used you for money, and she absolutely cheated on you multiple times in multiple ways. Even if it *was* just emotional cheating - you’re going to accept that? That she cares more for her ex than you, sexts with him, meets up with him behind your back - that’s all okay with you? 

This relationship should’ve been over when you found out about the ex - all this other stuff is just reinforcing that you need to cut your losses before she milks any more support out of you.
By expressing frustration, I meant that I *literally just said,* “Oh no, that’s a bummer that no one has turned it in, I was buying some emergency clothes after our flight for tomorrow got canceled. Should I check back tomorrow do you think, or fill out the lost and found form to be contacted?” 
There was no frustration in my voice whatsoever. So no, I doubt it was “only because I expressed frustration” - someone stole my bag off a counter, seems like something they’d try to help *anyone* with if within their power to do so.
Is the playlist actually *in* Oga's now, or just released on streaming? All I've seen is that it's out for streaming, which is pretty underwhelming if there's no indication of when it'll be in Oga's. I love Oga's but a fresh playlist is desperately needed after multiple visits.
Didn’t pay attention to the ages on first read - seeing this… you’re 100% right. 
This isn’t a relationship, she’s a fuck-piece. Constant sneaking away for quickies in public/when hanging with friends, constant public sexual displays… yep.
Someone snatched a bag with a spirit jersey and two shirts I had just bought off the bathroom counter when I turned away to get a paper towel on my last Disneyland visit in May 2022. Reported to lost and found, and nothing had been turned in, and I expressed my frustration since our flight had been canceled and we had bought them to have clean clothes for the next unexpected resort day. 

They offered me a voucher to purchase the shirts with again, and said that they couldn’t replace the spirit jersey - policy regarding the jerseys specifically due to “social media nonsense trying to get free jerseys, we’re still ironing that out” - but came back out with two brand new sweaters with tags, and said “if you take these to the World of Disney store, they’ll exchange them without a receipt and you can use that value to buy another jersey/anything else you need.”

Went above and beyond, I was so impressed by how hard they worked to make things right!
Agreed - OP is taking this as a personal attack and looking down on her partner because of it, instead of realizing she isn’t the only person who was shaken by this assault and having some understanding for the person who has had to shoulder 100% of her trauma processing and grief for the last *two weeks.* 

When your loved one is assaulted, it can be very traumatic for you as well. It’s normal for people to feel scared, confused, erratic, guilty, out of control, overwhelmed, self-loathing, etc. after a situation like this - especially if it occurred while they were there with you. 

It doesn’t sound like the partner tried to guilt OP or leave her because of the incident - it sounds like he was expressing fear and guilt over not protecting her and stopping the event that she’s so torn up about now, and was coming from a place of feeling he needed to punish himself for his inability to prevent this, or needing to push away and disconnect to protect both her from his shortcomings and himself from the pain of seeing a loved one harmed like this again. 

Did he do that in the most productive, healthy way? No, not at all. 
But *most people* don’t just suddenly experience a rare, unexpected traumatic situation and manage to handle it 100% perfectly right off the bat. No one is perfect and unless you already have years of therapy behind you, you’re probably going to have an outburst or two when you’re deeply shaken and frightened. 

He let his fears and anxieties and guilt build up for *two weeks* while tending to OP, and like most at some point do, he reached his boiling point, and some of it spilled out in an unhealthy way. He realized this pretty quickly and apologized to OP and explained and “took it back” - what more does she want from this?! 
Is she the only one allowed to feel any fear/emotions and be upset over this?
Ohana, Space 220, and I'd say Oga's as well depending on what time of day - if you want to do a late reservation, for example, where you get to stay in the park after closing and get to walk out with no one around for some awesome photos, you'll have a harder time getting that time slot vs. a late morning/weird lunch hour slot. (Though there's always the walk up list, and it's not as crazy to get as it once was, it can still fill up fast.)
Agreed! 

I get the appeal for *some* kids, but I *also* feel like the movie is very dated for todays kids - I’m not ripping on the movie, but it doesn’t seem like one that has remained a “must play” for a lot of families/it isn’t reflected as much in merchandising on property, so it’s probably not as relevant to a lot of younger kids these days, either. 

I’m shocked it was ever in that spot in the first place, frankly, but by now it’s *crazy* there hasn’t been an update. 
For such a beautiful, detail-rich park that seeks to teach about animals and cultures… the park icon not reflecting that is such a shame.
Because Shanghai has a ton of other attractions, is a different park, and is a whole new Disney experience in a foreign country? 
Why even ride Pirates at Disneyland and World? I doubt many people book entire trips and travel to a distant park for *one attraction…*
Yeah, Bugs Life has never made sense to me. The beautiful park icon being used for a dated show that’s unappealing to many and doesn’t really reflect the vibe of the tree/park is so odd.
Cars doesn’t fit into Tomorrowland whatsoever, though?
I’m sorry you’re dealing with the same hell! But thank you - it does help to know it isn’t just me, as much as I hate to hear others are suffering similarly.
My question has been, do you need to get the VQ to buy an ILL for Tron, or does the ILL bypass the need for VQ? 

I’ve seen people say both and I’m not sure which it is. I’ve never needed ILL, and have gotten a VQ for ROTR and Cosmic Rewind every time I’ve visited with zero issues, but we’re only doing one MK day and Tron is a must for me, and part of why we’re visiting, so I don’t want to screw up. 

If we have to get a VQ group either way there’s no reason for us to buy ILL, but I just wanted to be 100% sure 🥲
Would you rather wait another month or more for a potentially much more accurate test, or risk an inaccurate test that leads to no diagnosis, or that you have to retake - and wait that much longer for? 
Sleep studies are *miserable.* Don’t put yourself through it more than once if you can help it. If you’re concerned that this will impact it severely, reschedule.
I saw the Markus thing in the inbox message too, so I wasn't sure if they just wrote it wrong, or if mine was with Ozz because I had already completed the title/crown thing in past years. Seems it *was* an error on their part, heh

Glad you figured it out!
Have you completed "Slayer Path Node 2" like it mentions in the Springtide Overview?

Have you completed the quests Honest Ozz has available? (I got the quest to complete the Pufflehop Rescue Mission from him, after a quest to break behemoth parts, but I've also gotten the crown/title/all cosmetics from past years, so perhaps that's why?)
It depends on your luggage situation. 
If you’re flying Southwest, for example, and have the extra free checked bags, go for it. If you’re like me, and fly an airline where you have to pay to check bags, unless you’re a *very* light packer with your other items, it’s a better plan to just buy them there.

I always order Walmart, Amazon, or Instacart grocery delivery before I even depart for my trip - and schedule it to get there the day I do.
No delivery fee, no worrying about things getting smashed during flight - bread would definitely not survive well the way TSA treats my bags lol - and it shows up before I do on my travel day, so there’s no waiting around for it. Plus, I can get drinks for the room/to bring into the park, which is a huge bonus.
The OP is wondering if women and men who are straight can live together and not be “with” each other in some capacity. 


The comment you’re responding to is stating that bisexual people, who are attracted to both males and females, are capable of having roommates and not fucking them - since they’re attracted to both genders, they’re comparing their situation to the OPs question.
Ooooof. I wish I could say it was good... Heh...

* Wake up anywhere between 2pm and 4:30pm. No amount of alarms/anything else will change this. Sometimes 5 if I'm especially dead, every once and a while I'll get lucky and get a 1-1:30 wake up. 
* Regardless of when I wake up, I'm not going to be functional for at least the first 3-4 hours minimum of my day. So I might be awake, but just rolling around in bed trying to look at my phone, or I might move to the couch, but still just be in a haze.   
Sleep inertia lasts 2-4 hours on average. Lately I am having vision issues upon waking - can't see shit for the first few hours of the day, eyes completely blurry.   
Usually I'll have a headache, sometimes a migraine - so either Excedrine or Imatrex.  
Basically just in a half-sleep state staring off and on at my phone/the wall.
* 3-4 hours after I wake, I'll shower.
* 4-5 hours after I wake, I may eat a light meal.
* 6 or so hours after I wake up, I will attempt to check my email on my desktop, look at my to-do list, try to pick 3 or 4 things to attempt to get done that day.
* From around 9:30-10pm to maybe 12-1am I will feel "semi-functional" - which is the best I can hope for these days, and the "highest" level of functioning I will reach - during which time I will maybe answer some emails, catch up on messages from friends/family, possibly clean my bathroom/do some laundry/pick up around the house/schedule appointments/etc.
* From 1-1:30ish to around 2:30-3am I will not be wound down enough to sleep, but not functional enough to accomplish anything of value. I'll keep trying to truck along through to-do list tasks, but it's mostly automatic behaviors and I end up complicating simple tasks because my brain is too foggy/heavy to do anything properly.
* 3amish I'll go to bed. I'll either take 45-60 minutes to fall asleep, or I'll crash instantly - no way to predict which it'll be, no rhyme or reason as to why. I will get up a few times throughout the night to use the bathroom.
* Next day this hell-cycle begins again. Every day of my life.

This is not living, and it's hardly surviving. Severe Narcolepsy is a prison sentence, and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.
Very much agree with your comment, super level-headed take.

To add:

* Everyone grieves differently, and some people - especially those who don't have a lot of experience with loss, or who process loss by wanting to distract/escape rather than grieve - may lean more into trying to take their/your mind of things, or trying to provide an "up" to pull you out of the "down."  
Was this wildly inappropriate?   
Yes and no.   
Given that she didn't know - and hadn't established through past experiences with you - that you would appreciate this/find it appropriate, this wasn't a good move on her part, and was *more* than a little tone deaf.  
The level she took it to - she didn't just initiate/offer "simple" sex, she made a whole event/show out of things - was in *very* poor taste, and would definitely upset a lot of people were they in your shoes.   
If she can't see that - your "upsetting" reaction aside - I would question her perspective, and if we were on the same page on a lot of things.   
That said, if she doesn't have much experience with loss/grief, or had reason to think this would be a good way to distract/help you feel better, it's understandable that she made a bad judgement call, but her intentions were good/coming from a good place, and you guys just need to have a chat about boundaries/grief-processing so similar doesn't happen in the future.
* From personal experience with my partner, while something like she did would not have been cool, we *have* processed grief/loss by engaging sexually/intimately in the past. When our cat was tragically killed, when his grandma passed, when I had to clean up my step-dads suicide... We didn't make a "showy" display of seduction out of it, but we *did* have sex the evening of the loss, and throughout the first handful of days after, more as a way to reconnect with speaking, burn some stress/frantic energy, and feel a bit of endorphin/good-chemicals release in light of the horrible circumstances at hand.   
Though her approach, again, was *awful*, this may have been where she was coming from, and what she was hoping to assist with - giving you a release. 
* No one can blame you for your reaction, OP. No one can blame you for being upset with her, feeling it was tone deaf - it was - and not knowing how to process that on top of what you already have on your plate to mourn and deal with.   
That said, if you were name-calling, yelling, and being harsh/cruel, that's still not okay, despite what she may have done. You yelling doesn't cancel out her wrong, but her wrong doesn't cancel out yours either. Both sides need an apology, and to apologize.
I'm not saying I will be returning "at night" *once it's dark*.   
Considering sometimes I am unable to get into the park by 1pm, either, the 7am virtual queue is my best and only opportunity to grab a boarding group, as the 1pm has to be done *inside* the park and may not be an option.

Again, I ***understand*** why they're being strict on it, but it's pretty upsetting if they're going to be *so* strict on it that someone with a legitimate reason for not arriving in the parks earlier, but who is obviously *not* trying to skate around the rules just to ride *at night*, is never going to be able to ride.   
I can also understand the complaints of those who are locals but cannot arrive at the parks until say, 5pm/after their work shift, but who are allowed to enter the virtual queue at 7 - it would be an unfair policy for them, as well, and I'm curious to see how they handle those folks longer term. It would seem that having a virtual queue that can be "entered from anywhere" at 7am makes less sense with this, now.
I so deeply hope they’ll be accommodating for people in specific circumstances. I understand the reasoning here, but sometimes you can’t just teleport into the park at the time your group is called. 
I have DAS for a reason - and there have been times on past visits when I *couldn’t* get into the park until mid/late afternoon no matter what I did, as my disability gets in the way constantly. 
8-9am is impossible, period, and I’m going to be beyond crushed if I manage to get a boarding group but it gets called right away in the first few opening hours and I’m turned away when I do finally make it in. 
We’re visiting in mid-May, for likely the last time due to my illness, and Tron is most of the reason. 

On my last visit, my Guardians boarding group was called before the park technically opened, but I was accommodated at 5pm when we finally made it in and rushed straight to the ride 🥲
Because it *isn’t legal here.* 

Maybe stop looking for a bar where you can *break the rules,* and abide by them like everyone else is supposed to.
You have my support! Loved everything I saw on your profile and will be excited to see what you do in the future! Major talent and skill for sure, I could watch this for hours!
This is incredible! I expected to tap your profile and see that you were employed with Meow Wolf or something, this is superior to many of their exhibitions. Well done.
I'm assuming my question(s) are not appropriate for an individual thread, and instead belong here, but please point me in the right direction if this is not it!

&#x200B;

I am looking for some help with a dress I own, as I don't want to style it poorly, or look like a mess wearing it.   
(Dress, and sandals which are mentioned later, are located [here!)](https://imgur.com/a/RSuqOSK)

&#x200B;

**First** off, I could *really* use some help choosing what type and color of "slip" or under-garment to wear with this.  
I have never worn/owned a "see-through" dress before - the product page describes this as "slightly see-through elastic tulle" but as you can see from the photos, there's nothing "*slightly*" about it, it's see-through - and don't want to pick the wrong color of slip dress for the pattern/color scheme. I am very pale, and tan colored items tend to look odd on me, but I'm unsure if white or black would look equally strange, especially with bright sun/light shining on the outfit, or if I'm overthinking it too much.  
In the photos provided, you'll see the model is wearing white panties, and presumably a matching bra - this is ***not*** an option for where I'll be wearing this dress, it needs to be "appropriate" and more modest than having my underwear/bra visible. (A "cleavage-cut" so to speak would be fine, especially as it's under the dress, it doesn't need to be a turtleneck, but needs slightly more coverage than the photos.)  


**Secondly**, I have no idea what type of shoes to match with this color scheme/pattern.  
I've never been great at that - black shoes with everything is my unfortunate go-to - and I don't have much of an eye for what stands out *too* much.  
I was going to be lazy and just toss on the black sandals with gold accents pictured in my Imgur album, but I'm afraid the gold/black clashes with the light colors of the dress.   
What would be a good fit here?   
I'm open to just about anything, with the caveat that they need to be somewhat reasonable for a *long* day of wear - no thin heel, no heel over 2 inches, platforms are fine but lets keep it 2-3 inches as well tops, ideally something that will allow tights to be worn underneath so no "split-toe" sandals.

&#x200B;

**Third**, what color tights would be appropriate under this?  
(I have a lot of distracting leg tattoos, including a colorful full leg sleeve, so for both appearance and personal comfort - I never wear dresses without nylons under, and don't wish to start here - I want to find something that doesn't clash.)  
I'm assuming anything with a pattern is a "no" - would I want something white, or black, or just a sheer nylon? Something two-tone? I get the feeling black will be too harsh?

&#x200B;

And **lastly**, what "color" of accessories would you stick with?  
Gold jewelry, or silver? What general range of colors would you stick with for a purse?

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance! I know this was a lot, and I probably sound super silly, but I really adore this dress and want to enjoy it and not look back on photos later and go "I look like a toddler, oops."
And? $30 for a 12” pizza is still *outrageous* regardless of any of those factors. As has been continuously mentioned on this post.
Agreed! We did the lounge, and it was still insanely overpriced for the overall atmosphere, 100% one and done.
The entire restaurant/lounge is *tiny* which makes it underwhelming even with the “space windows” - which again are sadly very underwhelming, though neat. 
The ride up/down is cool, as is the entry hallway, but beyond that… 
The bartender we had was fast, attentive, and very friendly, but kept trying to upsell us on drinks and things in a very “non-Disney” way - I know Space 220 isn’t technically “Disney run” so that’s probably why. 
The drinks were fine, but overpriced - we enjoyed the “moon rocks” shots, they *were* fun, but again, insanely overpriced - and the lounge food was fast and tasted fine, but nothing to write home about.
A cat isn’t going to eat a toddler. A cat won’t maul a human to death. 
You can feel strongly about people keeping cats inside - I agree - and acknowledge that they’re dangerous to native animals, but they are *nowhere* near the threat a pit bull is to absolutely *everything.* 
They aren’t comparable on any level.
She can’t possibly know it’s sleep apnea without a test, which is all I said. The way the OP is worded it sounds like the doctor, after doing zero testing, simply said “it isn’t Narcolepsy, it’s sleep apnea.” - something she can’t possibly know or conclude without further testing, that she probably isn’t even capable of doing herself and would need to further refer OP out for.
Anytime you feel outright dismissed by a doctor, and as though they haven't listened at all, it is perfectly reasonable - and your best plan of action - to seek a second opinion elsewhere.

There's a different kind of "feeling" to the whole arrangement, given that it's a medical scenario, but a doctor is no different than a mechanic, hairdresser, etc. in that you are "hiring" them, so to speak, to address your concerns and needs.  
You wouldn't keep going to a mechanic who blatantly ignores that your headlight is out and tells you it's "not a big deal" just like you wouldn't keep going back to a hairdresser who dyes your hair green when you asked for a trim.  
You have valid, legitimate woes that you want to seek help for - be that testing, a diagnosis, treatment, a referral to a specialist, etc. - and if this doctor won't take them seriously and help you pursue them, move on, get a second - and/or third - opinion, and go from there.

Ultimately, in the end, it *could* be nothing. (I'm not saying that it is, or that you should feel like it might be, don't take this the wrong way.)  
But the ***only*** way for you and your medical care team to know that is through exploring all the possibilities - testing, a sleep study, possible referral to a specialist(s), possible medication/treatment plans, etc.  
A doctor who hears your legitimate concerns about problems that are legitimately causing you discomfort and distress and goes "lol it's nothing" or "it's \_\_\_\_ even though we have done zero testing or exploration to determine a cause" is **not** a good doctor. Period.

I'm assuming you haven't had any testing done for sleep apnea? (Correct me if I'm wrong, that's just the assumption I'm making based on the wording of your post.)  
How exactly did this doctor come to that conclusion without running any tests? If she believes that to be true, why would she not be pursuing treatment ***for that?***  
Any doctor that refers to my legitimate, distressing symptoms as "scary bumps in the night" is not only a piece of shit I would **never** see again, but is a doctor I would be complaining about to the right departments/entities. 

Like you said, no one here can know if what you're experiencing might be Narcolepsy or not, but you deserve to pursue answers/a diagnosis for your woes. Definitely seek a second opinion and find yourself a doctor you feel comfortable with, who listens to you, hears you, acknowledges you, and takes you seriously.
u/whypayday2isagoodgam,

Rule #1, please. If you don't have anything respectful/civil to contribute, best not to comment at all.
u/Prestigious-Flow-465

*Enough.* Rule #1 should go without saying, but here is your reminder and first and final warning - if you can't behave yourself and remain respectful and civil in your commenting here, you *will* receive a ban.
If you’re prone to watery eyes *at all* don’t bother with Thrive. 

I loved it at first and it looked great, but the second you yawn too much - causing your eyes to water - or are outside in the wind - again, watery eyes - its coming *right off* in gross, messy little black tubes all over your face. 
I don’t wear foundation, but if I did, it would’ve been completely ruined by the tube shedding. Still annoying to have to wipe it all off with a makeup wipe when I’m in the middle of doing things, and then either have no mascara or reapply it.
Exactly! Not only have I *never* done this, I can't even *imagine* doing it, there's just no circumstances under which I wouldn't care if my partner was satisfied, fulfilled, and "got his" during a sexual interaction. It takes a very selfish, careless kind of person/mindset to do that to someone, nonetheless do it every time, come up with justifications for it, and manipulate to keep it going every time.
As someone who has witnessed *two* suicides, and cleaned up the brutal aftermath of another, I hope they leave it. 

Things are going to trigger you in this world. Period. If we cater to *every* single *potential* trigger there would be little left, because there will always be *someone* taking issue or *choosing* to be triggered by something. 

You know what *really* needs to be done about potential triggers? 
*Therapy.* It isn’t the responsibility of the world and everyone around you to “save” you from a potential trigger. It’s *yours* and *yours alone.* 
It is up to the individual to avoid a trigger - don’t look up on the HM, problem solved. Done. People do it every day - or work through the trigger so it is no longer a crippling issue - therapy, breathing, coping skills, there’s thousands of books out there to work you through this if therapy isn’t an option.

Getting real tired of anything remotely “bothersome” being erased to cater to the types that can’t be bothered to help themselves yet expect the world around them to do 100% of the work 100% of the time.
Then she isn’t a sub, she isn’t asking you to dom, you aren’t having good sex, and she’s selfish at best/selfish *and* manipulative at worst. End of story. 

It would be one thing if you’d never brought this up before, but given that you have and there’s always excuses, it’s obvious she’s aware of the problem and simply doesn’t care. 
You’re not her sexual partner, she’s treating you like a glorified sex toy. You’re her dildo that follows instructions. 

She’s not a sub when everything is under her control, her demand, and her instruction. There’s boundaries and likes and then there’s this - there’s submission going on, but it sure isn’t from her. 


I engage in extremely rough, dominant sex with my partner - I’m the sub in this dynamic. 
It works because we *both* love it, and are *both* getting off equally from it. 
There’s certain things he does that are things *I* am particularly fond of, but *he* also enjoys them and gets off from them. There are things I do for him that are more for his pleasure, but I get off equally from that. It’s a 50/50, but no one is displeased or left unfulfilled by *any* of the acts. 
He finishes *every* time - if not multiple times for longer sessions - and I make sure of this. I *want* him to come. I can’t even imagine being so selfish and terrible that I’d let my partner do everything for me, and not even care enough to make sure he got his. 
That shows how little your partner cares about you - you aren’t her equal in this partnership, she’s treating you like her pet.
Agreed! Which is how I - and you, I’d say - know that we’re monogamous. 


It sounds like OP probably isn’t, or at least isn’t *enough* to be the type who should be in a fully monogamous partnership with a fully monogamous person - nonetheless ever marry one, someday. 


I’ve had partners before my current - as in, this isn’t my first sexual partner - and the thought of my current being my last, always and forever, doesn’t bother me at all. No negative thoughts or feelings about that at all, no “but I’d miss out on ___” - nothing. 


It excites me to think about how much great sex we’ll continue to have for many years to come, how much more we’ll explore together, and how much we’ll grow and gain even more comfort with each other.


The sex we’re having now vs 7 years ago is a lot more wild, and it’s *awesome* - not that it was ever bad at the beginning, it has always been amazing to me, but we’ve become so much more comfortable with each other in that way, and explore so much more than we used to! 


The thought of the future as exclusive sexual partners excites me, and I look forward to seeing how much more we explore and the new things we’ll try together. 


Thinking about sleeping with other people doesn’t interest me at all. I don’t miss the “new partner” phase where it’s awkward and you’re not in tune with each other yet, or comfortable enough to try much out. 
I don’t miss the “unpartnered phase” where I’m single, don’t have anyone to share intimacy or sex with - or am trying to find a partner and dealing with the woes of that life stage - and I don’t have any interest in finding another sexual partner, I’m fully satisfied with my partner, there’s nothing I am missing or think I could find “better” in someone else. 

But I’m also monogamous. It sounds like the problem for OP is monogamy.
Heh, I actually love the gold one on the left in the first photo, and the one in the second photo, and would wear them as normal everyday clothes if they weren’t swim material, but your comment made me chuckle because I’ve been realizing my wardrobe is very Star Wars/Star Trek leaning these days 😂
Yep, it’s *nuts!*

I’m not paying $15 for *half* of an already tiny quesadilla that will leave me still hungry, with the option to sit outside - if I’m lucky, I’ll more likely have to stand or go back to my car - in shit weather, with some homeless nut taking a shit and then hassling me for my food/money. 

I miss when food trucks were cheap. I miss when *everything* was *cheaper* for that matter.
100% agree.

I mean, it’s a cool bar regardless of the 21+ hours, and the drinks are fun, but that sweet, sweet *no kids* window is *amazing.* Literally a *godsend.* Especially for those of us *happily* childfree. 

The fact that more *bars* on property aren’t 21+ is really a problem, and a shame. 
Abracadabar should absolutely be 21+. The resort lounges after 8pm should absolutely be 21+. Period. (Maybe the compromise for OPs example would be Oga’s being 21+ for reservations after say 6:30-7pm, even. I 100% agree it should be 21+, at least a portion of the time.) 

Nothing like paying $18 pre-tax-and-tip for a cocktail, to sit at the bar top in a nice lounge at a deluxe resort, just to have some loud, sticky, whiny little kid in a bathrobe and wet swimsuit smelling like chlorine, burnt popcorn, and stale peanut butter come in and start *screaming* about wanting this/needing that/did you see this/give me that. 
🤢🤢🤢

Adults only spaces are *desperately* lacking on property. 
I’m not saying invest in a new Pleasure Island - but please, do!! - but capping minors at 8pm across the property in lounges/bars, and maybe having some “adults only” hours at a few pools/jacuzzis in the evening would be *amazing.* 
Trader Sam’s is clearly thriving with these restrictions, let’s expand, shall we? 
You can’t effectively capitalize on and advertise to “adult guests” while still treating them like the outlier by making every space obnoxiously kid-filled/kids-allowed. Know what your audience wants, please lord 🥲
Not even remotely. They don’t wake me up at all or give me *any* energy or noticeable relief from exhaustion.
They *do* make me feel like absolute shit though, and will likely trigger a headache - if not a migraine - and completely ruin my day. 
Coffee is a big no, also. Most I can do is a soda.

The only time I’ll drink any form of an energy drink is the *very* rare occasion I’m at a bar with friends - the only alcoholic drink I can have is a vodka/Redbull. Have to have caffeine immediately combating the alcohol or I’ll fall asleep mid sentence at the bar. The comedown and hangover the next day - even if I only have one - is hell on earth. I don’t get to have nights out really, anymore.
I wasn’t aware there have been *multiple* gun related incidents at Sandy Hut and the Vern, that’s really unfortunate! 

I was pretty surprised by the Gold Dust shooting - not somewhere I would’ve expected that to happen at. Saw some of the security video from a friend who is closely connected to the owner, and it was pretty nuts.


I feel for all the staff across those locations - I believe they own Lay Low and Double Barrel as well, but haven’t heard anything newsworthy from there - and hope they can stay safe and see a reduction in these happenings. They deserve to be safe at work, as does every customer coming in, and they deserve *good,* well-paid security. 


Alibi - and all those spots - get wild on the weekend, it shouldn’t take gun violence to get solid security, and it’s a damn shame it hasn’t happened for the other locations either. 
I wonder if these have all been random incidents, or gang/drug related?
Sure, she can’t go back in time, but she already got all the advice possible on this *before* she had the damn kid. She already knows what this guy is about, and that her attempts aren’t working. 
How much more validation does she need? 

Either do something about it - which if your nagging isn’t working, means leaving if it’s something you can’t tolerate - or stop complaining about it since it isn’t important enough to make major changes over. That’s it. Those are the options.
So many places around town I would’ve never imagined this kind of thing happening at that I now can’t say that about, it’s pretty wild. 
Hoping everyone is fine and those who witnessed the event are able to process it okay - as someone who has witnessed similar, it does weird things to your psyche.
“Do not pick up the bags yourself”


I *certainly* wasn’t tempted, but thank you.
And you’re still alive and well. You weren’t mauled to death, or fucking *eaten.* 
A small dog/Chihuahua doesn’t have the capacity to eat *your* arm down to the bone, rip through your neck and kill you without anyone being able to get it off, or pull apart a child and rip it in half.
I usually go “and *I* like to take medication that is best for *my* health situation, not what the rest of your patients are subjected to based on your preconceived notions. If you don’t want to work with me, I’ll take my business elsewhere.”
To put it simply? Like ***absolute fucking shit.*** Every single time, and without fail.

To add a little detail? I have ***never***, not **once** in my life, felt rested. **Ever**. Even in my earliest memories.

9 times out of 10 I will have a headache - various levels, from low-grade to migraine. Always brain fog, so bad that it somehow feels ***physically*** painful, can hardly form a thought nonetheless do much of anything, extremely irritable, sore/in random pain, often nauseas, anxious beyond all reason, and constantly fighting the indescribably powerful pull to go back to sleep - or "sleep inertia" I suppose. I've started having intermittent vision issues now, too, which are most prominent when waking up, so sometimes I can't even see the first 1-3 hours of the day, just blurriness. 

Whether these feelings settle a little bit after an hour or two and become a tiny bit more manageable, or whether they stay at their worst through the entire day is always a 50/50 toss up, and determines if I'll waste yet another day of my life in agony, or if I'll have 2-4 "working hours" where I can shower, accomplish *anything*, and then repeat.

This disease is a lifelong prison sentence, I wouldn't wish it on anyone.
There is ***no*** "cure" for Narcolepsy. 

I have tried micro-dosing mushrooms in the past, in an attempt to promote wakefulness/alertness/combat the attention issues of Narcolepsy, and "stretch out" my stimulant medication more by ideally gaining more energy.

It did absolutely none of these things, and if anything made me more tired, made me feel shittier when it "wore off" and did anything but improve my memory issues and attention span. 

Taking psychedelics at higher doses - where you'd have a full "trip experience" so to speak - only proved to suck out what little energy I had left, and leave me depleted for days at a time. They also had terrible effects on my memory, but that's probably not a common "side effect" for everyone, just my anecdotal experience.

When you read about potential mental health benefits to mushrooms, it is almost always regarding PTSD, depression, anxiety, etc.

I see no evidence of benefits for Narcolepsy whatsoever - I question their efficacy for depression and anxiety, frankly, as well - and quite honestly, I don't have time and energy to waste on something that isn't intended for this disease. I surely don't have any energy to spare, that's for sure.
The mods on r/Portland are some of the worst across Reddit, I'm not surprised.
That's Portland for ya - more "choosing beggars" here than I've seen anywhere else, across all walks of life too.

Disgusting, I hope they sink and fail real fast, and join the countless other bland bars that close down faster than they opened.
>replace a few terms such as “juggling” with something that invokes less mental images of clowns

This absolutely killed me, well done.
Agreed! 

I use DAS, and sometimes there’s just no way I’m getting to the park early, or by a certain time, or rushing to a specific ride at the drop of a hat. 
I need ample time to get somewhere, especially if I’m doing something else, and mornings can be difficult when trying to get going out of the resort/make it into the park.

With Rise and Cosmic Rewind, we had no issues showing up late - even 5+ hours later from time the group was called once, since we were group 5 and called right around the park opening - and they were always *really understanding,* especially if we checked in first but had to come back later due to a dining reservation and not wanting to be charged. 

I’m hoping this is just for the unexpected soft open, and not a permanent strict “no” for all riders going forward. It’s one thing if a guest is purposefully pushing it to ride at night, but if you have a dining reservation, or got stuck on a ride, or are coming from a good length of distance, or have a DAS-related reason… it really should still be honored.
Your doctor will make that decision with you based on your medical history and concerns - make sure to be 100% honest about *all* medications/“self medicating” you’re doing, as well as concerns you have about stopping, and how disruptive it may be to your mental health and life.
You may not have to stop *everything* or for “very long” or you might - if your doctor feels it will impact the results. None of us can know, but your doctor should listen to your concerns and consider your existing conditions ahead of your study - if you feel they aren’t in general, second opinion/new doctor may be in order, but most of us had to go off critical medication before our appointments and spend 2-4 weeks in misery, so that seems to be par for the course with these dumb tests!
I wish you the best of luck, and I’m sorry to hear you’re having to do this again!
What is *your* doctor/the lab instructing for *your* MSLT?

What everyone else had to do is irrelevant to your study - your doctor/sleep team will specify what your exact instructions are for the study, and will expect you to follow them 100%, or notify them if that will be a problem and see if there are any adjustments that can be made. (There may not be.)

You should ask your doctor/sleep team about "self medication" with marijuana before your study, and whether or not marijuana usage is allowed - and if not, how long you will need to abstain for before your test. Make sure to inform them of any/all medications you are taking, and get individual guidance for each.

From what I gather, the majority of people seem to be instructed to cease the majority of medications 2-4 weeks prior to the test - this includes SSRIs, stimulants, etc. Sometimes the timeframe varies - especially with SSRIs that you have to gradually come off of/gradually go back on - and sometimes certain medications are okay while others are not.   
They will almost certainly be giving you a UA, meaning you will not sneak "self medicating" or failure to follow instructions past the sleep lab. 

It is important to follow 100% of the instructions you are given in order to achieve the best study results - and not have the results invalidated, inconclusive, unusable, etc.

I was told no medications 2 weeks prior, absolutely no marijuana, which wasn't a concern for me, as I don't use it - for the record, I am in a legal state - and was even told no caffeine/Excedrin/light sleeping meds the few days before.
Aww, thank you! That means a lot - I’m glad it resonated with you in some way ♥️
No days are "good" and certainly none are "better" - it's merely how many hours I have that I can do *anything*, vs the rest of the time where I am essentially a walking zombie.

I will say that my Narcolepsy/symptoms are extremely severe, and that medication - while better than nothing - hardly does anything for me. There are people who have it a lot better than I do with N, or who have more success with medication - this disease is very complicated and difficult, and impacts everyone very differently and at very different levels.

But for me, much like you said, I have always had a baseline tiredness that never goes away - this is a constant, and has been there since my earliest childhood memories, I have never felt "good" or "normal" or "rested" in my life.  
No matter how much sleep I get, or how quality that sleep is, I always feel like shit. I never wake up rested, I'm never not exhausted, and I feel like I'm constantly walking uphill through molasses just trying to process a simple thought, nonetheless complete a task.  
Sleep hygiene, diet, exercise - none of that shit matters, not even remotely.

Some days I will have 2-3, maybe even 4 hours, where I'm half functional - in those hours, I try to squeeze in as much as I can to try to stay afloat, from making calls/scheduling appointments, to keeping the house clean, answering emails, etc.  
Some days I get less than that, and move from the bed to the couch, to the couch to the shower, the shower to the bed, maybe to my desk chair - where I get nothing done, and stare blankly at my screen, later wondering how 3 hours melted away - and then suddenly the day is over, and it felt like 5 minutes.

Narcolepsy is horrifically portrayed in "Hollywood" and in stereotypes.   
Most of us are not randomly passing out in full slumber mid sentence - sleep attacks are a thing, and yes I get them, but they don't look like the "movie interpretation" of Narcolepsy. Any media portrayal of the disease I have seen has made me want to punch through a wall, and has been horribly insulting. Narcolepsy is a very misunderstood and badly stereotyped illness, and it's a damn shame.

Could you have it? Sure. Can't know till you go through the sleep study process and meet with the right doctors. But it is a fairly rare disease, and there are a lot of things that cause the chronic fatigue, exhaustion, and need for naps that you're describing - and for your sake, I hope it's not Narcolepsy, because I wouldn't wish this lifelong curse on anyone.  


Regardless of what it is, it's obviously not "normal" and is something you should continue to speak with doctors about and seek answers to - there are a lot of different things that cause chronic fatigue or "being extra sleepy" and it's worth investigation and seeing if you can remedy it.

Unfortunately, Narcolepsy is not curable, and for a lot of us, the treatment options suck and hardly help. There is no "normal" for us, nor any hope to return to it. Not being capable of getting restful, restorative sleep is the core of Narcolepsy, and it's miserable. It felt like I was being cursed when I was diagnosed, but then comes acceptance, and then comes understanding - it may not change how bad it sucks, but it sure does feel good to know there's a damn reason for it, and I'm not just lazy/sleepy for no reason. 

Best of luck to you.
Not necessarily. He worked up from low level cashier to a higher position. 
It is not uncommon for retail/grocery chains and such to “cut” higher paid/higher level positions - and either replace with lower paid/easier to manipulate workers, or expect existing workers to cover the slack of an eliminated position to boost profits/cut payroll spending - despite still needing low level employees to fill shit jobs with constant turnover.
I wouldn’t say that building was “thriving” in terms of bathroom and kitchen cleanliness. It wasn’t bad like it was in the article/became after management issues, but I stayed there for a few weeks during summer 2017 on a couch of a friend who lived there, and the shared public bathrooms were *gross* - and that was just toilet/sink, I can’t imagine a shared shower space like this article describes, hell nah. 
Not abandoned level gross, but they weren’t what I’d call “thriving” level of clean, nor something I’d feel good about having to *pay* to live around/deal with constantly. 
The kitchens were a lot better than the bathrooms, but still pretty grimy and the consensus was “don’t leave dishes/anything in here you don’t want to say goodbye to” and it was always an ordeal trying to make a meal in any level of peace/comfort. 

Maybe these types of setups work for someone who isn’t home often, or super young folks in their first living situation outside of parents home/while in college, but to think this will work on a large scale for anyone else is delusional levels of optimistic. 

The rent would have to be comparable, if not lower, than renting a room in a *very* cheap house-share - since in that setup, you’d be sharing a kitchen and bathroom with less people than you would in this proposal, so you’d have to incentivize the extra inconveniences - and they’d need a cleaning crew in twice a day at least. 

The buildings would also need a dedicated security crew to keep non-residents/their visitors out, and the rentals would need to be decently sound proof and *very* comfortable/updated to make this at all appealing to renters. 
I don’t see any of that happening, but I guess we shall see!
Yeah, it’s the extra driving/travel to Seattle that kills it for me anytime its cheaper. It’s a 3-3.5 hour drive from where I’m at in Portland, and then you have to factor in parking for the duration of your trip *or* the cost of a train/bus/flight each way, and you’re adding an extra 3+ hours of travel time to each travel day - with plenty that can go wrong - so it’s never really viable.
It would have to be a solid $1,000 of savings to be worth the additional craziness.
Thank you so much! I'm guessing you'd order from them again? No complaints?

There isn't a ton of info out there on them still, but they seem to have great deals, so if they're legit they're definitely a hidden gem! I really appreciate you responding, you're amazing! Thank you!!
I know this comment is 5 months old, and I apologize for bothering you, but have you ever purchased from Baltini, yourself?

I'm on the fence about ordering from them because there isn't much out there about them - except for a ton of bad reviews/people questioning if they're a real company - but there's a few items I can't seem to find anywhere else, so I'm tempted to give them a chance!

Thank you!
I did! I ended up emailing them a big PDF, but I still have the scans, if you’re looking for them!
It's one of the very few "treatment routes" for Narcoleptics, and is indeed a medication prescribed for Narcolepsy, so clearly it does indeed benefit some of us to some extent. 

There is no "perfect medication" that will work for 100% of Narcoleptics 100% of the time - but that can be said of a lot of different medications/diseases.   
Medication management is often a long, difficult road, and requires a lot of trial and error before the "right" or "best" option is found.

I have been on stimulants for over a decade, and they are the ***only*** option for me. As far as "wakefulness medications" go, anything less than a stimulant might as well be a sugar pill.  
Even then, I need an extremely high dose to combat how severe my symptoms are, and to give me any semblance of a functioning life day to day.  
Of all the "wakefulness" medications I've tried, the *only* ones that work even remotely are Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.   
You will see plenty of posts if you search this subreddit agreeing that these medications work - and you will also see plenty of posts of people who did not have luck with these specific prescriptions, and found something else to be more helpful, or who are still searching.

You have ***no way*** of knowing what will or won't work for you until you ***try it.***   
You may get lucky, and find that Modafinil and/or Adderall work for you right away!   
You might find that they don't work at all, and you need to try something else entirely, or that the side effects aren't agreeable for you.  
You may also find that they don't work *enough*, but that you *are* noticing *some* improvement - so you might need to adjust your dose, try a different type of stimulant, try a combination of multiple medications, switch from IR to XR or XR to IR, etc.  
Medication management is usually not an easy road, and it *definitely* takes some patience - but I promise you that it is well worth it once you find something that works for you and gives you some relief from this horrible curse of a disease.  
Medication management is also, for many of us, a lifelong battle - with stimulants, and some other medications, a lot of people tend to build up a "tolerance" meaning the medication may become less effective over time, or you may need to adjust your dosage to a higher amount to receive the same benefits. This isn't a "bad thing" - it's just how medications work, and it's part of having to deal with Narcolepsy and medication management for the disease. Your doctor is there to help you find the right combinations for you, and keep the dosage effective and doing the best it can for you over time.

If it weren't for stimulants, I would have no life at all. I would be sleeping 24 hours a day every single day. When I don't take my medication, I might as well be in a coma.   
Stimulants are *absolutely* a life saving medication for Narcolepsy.
Then what exactly are you confused about here? 

If she had rejected you because she wasn’t into *you,* and made that clear, then I could see where you’d be feeling concerned she’s only asking you out because you saved her father. 

But clearly that’s not what happened, she didn’t want a relationship with *anyone* at the time, and her dad not finding you to be a savory character would only further complicate things going forward, so it simply wasn’t on the table - with you, or with *anyone* for that matter. 

I wouldn’t go into this with “she’s only asking me out because of what I did” on your mind. There’s no reason to be paranoid about that, *at all,* with the information you’ve provided, and those kinds of insecurities and worries will only serve to complicate things and cloud your judgement and enjoyment of what could be a great date/relationship with someone you really like - don’t cloud a good thing with negativity before it has even started.
Anesthesia is ***horrible*** for me. I can't wake up to save my life - it takes an abnormal amount of time for them to be able to "pull me out" and get me to where it's safe for me to be discharged, and even then, I feel worse than *anything*.   
Can take *days* for me to be able to do anything but sleep - will have to quite literally crawl to the bathroom, usually can't keep my eyes open to eat, etc.
u/Inrisd,

If you can't follow Rule #1 and be respectful in your comments/dealings with other users, you will receive a ban.
I mean, it's *not* a "greedy request" but it isn't a "realistic request" for many of us, unfortunately, which is probably why those were the majority of responses you received.

Many of consider ourselves disabled because of this awful disease, or at least consider it to be very debilitating. I personally cannot work anymore at all because of the severity Narcolepsy, which has very much become a degenerative issue and crippled me in nearly all aspects of my life.  
High-paying - which usually means demanding or significantly skilled - jobs just aren't realistic or doable for a lot of us because of N.

It *shouldn't* be a "big ask" for us to be able to support ourselves and be comfortable, but the "system" isn't really made for people with illnesses like ours, and so a lot of us are stuck in poverty, barely able to stay afloat. Until there is significant reform of the disability system, or a serious shift in the job market - living wages for entry level/less demanding positions, for example - it's going to be a lifelong uphill battle for most of us, sadly.
The way some of the people on this sub act, I think you're onto something with that sentiment.

It seems like some of these people are not only so willfully ignorant/blind to the realities around us, but have convinced themselves that stepping on needles and shit and being attacked by unhinged homeless zombies is ***awesome*** and something that the rest of us are *wrong* for being upset about.

Absolutely insane.
My sleep doctor has offered it to me, and sees it as the same medication as Adderall essentially, I am free to switch between the two at any time for any reason, just have to ask.

It's absolutely prescribed still, by all kinds of doctors - psych, sleep doctor, neurologist, primary care. etc.

She can absolutely send a prescription in for it. Reach out to your sleep doctor, don't let this nonsense keep you from the medication you need.

(But be prepared for there to be shortages of it, too.)
Right, because the only logical explanation for me not wanting the same homeless, pantsless lunatic to try to attack me twice in one night and not have my personal property burglarized is that I “belong in Texas” - good job! Big brains on this guy!
Have fun being an ignorant, brainless enabler.
It isn’t lazy to want work life balance. It isn’t lazy to want to be able to *actually live your fucking life* instead of wasting away in a miserable work environment - have you ever been to a typical CVS? Grim as hell - for shit pay.
Yeah, I was. It was summertime, on a weekend, so more busy than usual, but this is exactly how it went, and I *really* don’t give a remote fuck if you choose to believe me or not, it changes nothing. 
If you think it’s outlandish that something like this would occur, you’re really ignorant to the daily happenings in Portland.

I know very clearly where The Nines is. I used to work a block away. That area isn’t a “staycation paradise” by any stretch of the imagination just because it isn’t Old Town.
You’re joking, right? 

Where exactly are we supposed to go *out of the US?*
It’s next to impossible to immigrate to another country - especially if you aren’t in a highly desirable field, are poor, are disabled, etc. - and that’s before you factor in the costs to even get there and move, possibility of not being able to speak the language, get medical care, enter the job market, etc.

This has to be a joke.
I have no problem trying to help small businesses, I just feel like this is tasteless and gimmicky, and will not have that effect. 
My opinion is just that, and doesn’t really matter one way or another, but my experiences in downtown in the last few years were *not* welcoming and did *not* leave me feeling positive or wanting to come back anytime soon. A gimmicky scratch-it contest wouldn’t have changed that *at all.* And if anything would’ve felt humorously insulting - ah yes, please bait me back with a staycation amongst the very problems I choose not to go downtown to not have to deal with on a “night out!”

*A lot* needs to change and clean up downtown before it’s going to be appealing to repeat guests again, IMO, and this is a premature promotion that will only continue to highlight why, no matter how nice the business may be, people aren’t frequenting them due to where they’re located. 

I don’t see how converting to residential would suddenly solve the core issues downtown, personally, and it’s wildly impractical, but I’m not saying I have the answers either.
You knows its bad when they have to come up with silly gimmicks like this to try to bait people to go downtown. 

No, I don’t want a “staycation” at the Nines - even for free - because that means having to *stay downtown* and deal with that general environment.
*Nothing* is getting me to cross the river to hang out in Old Town right now, either. 

Hell, last time I went downtown - to see a show at the Roseland, which I wouldn’t have done had it not been the bands final tour - I was nearly assaulted by a woman with no pants on in broad daylight *fucking twice,* had my car broken into *in a garage,* and was chased by some methy zombie on my way back to my vehicle after the show. 

No thanks. This kind of thing is premature - until there have been massive changes and things have “cleaned up” a lot, so to speak, trying to bait people to go downtown, only to be met with more of the same tired nonsense, is not going to be a welcoming, enjoyable experience.

Oh absolutely. 100%. Not even just every year, it feels like it gets worse all the time.

I *absolutely* consider my Narcolepsy to be quite literally a "degenerative" issue in many ways - especially where both long and short term memory are concerned, and with mental ability overall.

I *absolutely* get worse at an increasingly fast rate where many things are concerned. Memory, attention span, mental ability, focus, absentmindedness, brain fog, overall fatigue, all of it - and more, yay!

I would say that as a result of Narcolepsy essentially rendering me incapable of ever achieving restful, restorative sleep, it doesn't matter what "phase" of sleep I'm primarily getting, none of it does anything good anyway. None of it "counts" or helps.  
I used to have great short and long term memory, and now I might as well have neither - so I don't think any of my Narcoleptic sleep is doing either any favors, sadly.

I wish I could tell you what you can do to "fight it" but for many of us there's *nothing* you *can* do. There is no cure for Narcolepsy, and there is no "slowdown" for a lot of this.   
Through medication management you may find relief/more relief, but there is no real return to "normal" for a lot of us - not to say that's the case for you, but it's something to be prepared for. I wish I would've prepared for the harsh realities of this a lot earlier.  
   
You can try your best to develop coping skills and routines that help you manage and stay afloat as these things change, but it's ***really, really*** hard, especially as it worsens.   
You just have to take it as it comes and hope that at the end of the day you haven't overlooked something too important.   
I make a lot of lists, but I can't remember to look at them half the time anyway, and if I do, I don't have the mental ability, focus, or energy to complete them anyway, so it's not really helpful, I guess.  
Just be patient and kind to yourself, as much as you can - this disease puts a lot of us 1,000,000,000 steps behind everyone else as a "baseline" and that's extremely crippling, we can't expect to operate on the same levels as someone who is privileged enough not to be suffering from this disease.   
So you might have to take it slower, and sometimes you might forget things or lose focus or have "wasted" days/weeks/months - and that sucks, but that's just how this disease is.   
ADHD and Narcolepsy are comorbid problems, and share many of the same symptoms - researching good coping skills and behavioral strategies to tackle these symptoms will help you a lot. But the thing I've found that has helped the most is to ***slow down.***  
No one wants to have to slow down, or adjust to these awful realities, but you're going to have to do it one way or another - willingly or not, at a certain point, your brain and body will say, "look... we can't do this... chill...." so it's a lot better to be accepting of that and work with it willingly than to have everything shut down on you unexpectedly because you're trying to push push push when that's just not possible with Narcolepsy most of the time.  


For example - I will forget what I'm doing while I'm doing it all the time - this is humiliating, it makes me want to curl up in a ball and sob uncontrollably and catastrophize to the extreme, and it makes it insanely hard to do *anything.*  
But I have come to accept that I can't change this - this is a part of Narcolepsy, and I can't get rid of that, and I can't go back. So I try my best to take certain tasks and parts of my day slowly, one thing at a time, keep reminding myself of what absolutely has to get done and tackling that one at a time first, and then moving forward.  
I feel like a dementia patient sometimes, but at least I can showered, eat, keep my place somewhat organized, and occasionally get some other things done each day. I might forget what I picked up my phone for, or why I walked into a room, but at least I have my priorities lined out!  
And once you get into that routine, it's easier to at least keep running through the key activities you need to tackle - automatic behaviors aren't "fun" but at least you can steer them in a productive direction sometimes.

I'm sorry that you're going through this. I wouldn't wish this curse of a disease on anyone. I was diagnosed a lot younger than you, but it became really isolating and I felt like my entire world fell apart right around your age, when I was able to really digest the full reality of the diagnosis and symptoms - and how they had already worsened so much, despite being so young - and how that was going to impact me as a "real adult" on my own.  
I would recommend seeking out a therapist if that is an affordable and practical option for you - it can really help to have someone to talk through these things with, and to process the really difficult, heavy emotions that come with having such a debilitating, difficult, lifelong illness. (Especially with all the bad stigma, lack of understanding, and negativity people will give Narcoleptics over their disease/symptoms)

It really helped me when I finally was able to say, "This is a disability. I have a disability. A lifelong, severe disability."  
It felt like a prison sentence yet also an intense rush of relief and freedom at the same time. I hate that I have it, I hate what it does to me, I hate that I can't get rid of it. But it is real, it is hard, and I am struggling with a legitimate disability - I can be patient with myself, others can be patient with me, and it's okay if I can't operate on the same level as "everyone else my age" because *I am not them,* and can't be no matter how "hard" I work at it.

I wish you the best in your journey. It may seem bleak now, but I would say that you are fortunate to have found out your diagnosis by age 20 - there are many posts here of people much older just getting diagnosed/still seeking testing who wasted many, many formative years flopping around like a fish out of water just trying to survive with no idea what was going on. You have a lot brighter road ahead of you as a result of knowing the "why" behind your woes.
Very much agree.

Unfortunately, unless you can literally relocate to a bubble, a reactive animal like this just doesn't have a place in society at a certain point.

While ***some*** reactive animals *can* be trained enough to be safe, just as many ***can't***, and ***no one*** deserves to have their or their pets/loved ones safety - and potentially lives - put at risk by a dangerous, bite-prone animal in the meantime.   
While you can muzzle a dog while it's in public, extremely reactive dogs are very escape-prone - I could link you 100 stories of pitbulls escaping, chewing their way out of houses, etc. to attack - so taking precautions solely while in public settings just isn't enough if the behavior remains.  
And is a dog that would need to be muzzled 100% of the time to be "safe" going to be a very happy dog? One that has to be on a tight leash, constantly watched and redirected and reprimanded? No, I don't think so.

Don't let the assholes dissuade you from what you know you need to do, OP.   
Your safety, life, and financial stability come first, period - if you can't keep those in order, you won't be able to provide for a pet either, and you have to put yourself first regardless. What comes second to that is the safety of those around you - keeping an aggressive, dangerous animal is an extreme hazard to everyone else, and they don't deserve to have their pets wellness jeopardized as a result.

You are not required to keep a dangerous dog just to prove to a bunch of judgmental strangers that you're a "good pet owner" - if they're so concerned, maybe they should come pick up the dog and take it on, along with all the consequences that come with it?

It sounds like you genuinely tried your best despite being lied to - which is enough to warrant taking the dog back to the shelter in the first place, guilt free - and there is nothing good that will come of being guilted into continuing down this road that you *know* ends in more disaster. 

No one wants an animal to be put down, keep returning to a shelter, or to deal with these behavioral issues - it's sad, and it sucks to see animals suffer or lose an opportunity to have a long, healthy life.  
But it's part of life. And when a dog reaches a certain point of reactivity and aggression,  it's perfectly normal, acceptable, and *the right thing to do* in cases like this where it harms another person/their pet.  
That dog didn't deserve to be bit - and could've ended up much worse - nor did another person deserve to see their pet suffer and incur costs and trauma as a result. Why people feel the need to jump on threads like this and go "that dog you're trying to rehome deserves better" is fucking beyond me - **no it doesn't,** it *isn't* the victim here, *the animal it injured and that pets owner is.*

Best of luck to you OP.
They quite literally mention a pitbull rescue in their post, which would indicate that the dog is a pitbull.

Why is that pit people need to jump in to "save them from stereotypes" when even a slight mention of the breed occurs? Almost like the behaviors speak for themselves...
Yep, this is the only answer that matters, call the people who deal with this professionally instead of asking for anecdotes on Reddit. 

I know this post isn’t about stimulants, but Japan’s strictness on those medications means I’ll never be able to fulfill a lifelong dream of visiting 🥲 such a shame some countries have such strict medication bans, but so it goes!
Right? 

No, I absolutely *cannot* live a normal life with this curse. No amount of medication is fixing that - and believe me, I’ve tried. 
It’s not easy, never has been, and absolutely never will be - and it gets worse all the time, and almost certainly will for the rest of my life. 


I am also not privileged beyond reason like OP here with his “multiple 7 figure businesses” which makes surviving that much more of a constant, horrible battle. 

But sure, that’s nice, OP. I’m glad it’s possible for *you,* but that’s not the norm - especially if your symptoms are anywhere near severe - and the wording of this post really invalidates those of us desperately trying to stay afloat and make it through this miserable life. And trust me, we don’t need any more invalidating, we get plenty.
Finally getting a diagnosis is both relieving and crushing for a lot of us, I can relate!

It’s nice to know what the cause is, and to be validated in how you’re feeling - you aren’t just lazy, or weak, or depressed, or not getting enough sleep, etc. it’s a legitimate and serious illness - but it can be very hard to come to terms with the fact that this is the rest of your life now, and you’re at a disadvantage as a result of something you didn’t ask for. 

Some people have great outcomes with treatment, and that may be you, too.
My N is extremely severe, and treatment is bleak for me - stimulant medication can only do so much, and it’s not much at all, with fast building tolerance - but that’s not to say it won’t be better for you. 
One thing I wish I had known and accepted much earlier on, though, was that there is no cure, and for some, treatment just won’t ever do much - there will be no “rested” or “normal” again for some of us. Yes, it’s depressing and sucks, but accepting that it *could* be like that let’s you prepare, process, and expect the worst - but hope for the best. You’ll do a lot better taking things as they come and managing the ups and downs - the process of finding medication that works for you/you can tolerate can be very long and difficult - if you look at things honestly at the start, and set your expectations accordingly.

I wish you the best going forward, and hope your outcomes are better than mine! It can be a very stressful, isolating road, but you’re not alone.
Many of us with N who are being treated still do not ever feel “finally rested” unfortunately. It is a complicated illness, with not that many treatment options - many of which aren’t great - and it can get more severe with time. Be prepared for a lot of trial and error and the potential to never truly be “rested” again. There is no *cure* for Narcolepsy.
I kept waiting for this post to get to where she was asking you to be the *"bad boy"* and... *it just never did.*

Unless I'm missing something - or you're leaving some key pieces out - it doesn't sound like that *at all.* 

What it reads like is that she's just asking you to initiate, ideally more spontaneously, with more *general passion,* and for you to show her that you are attracted to her and *want* her in a more physical, *obvious* way.

She's not asking you for anything *that* wild, it doesn't seem like?   
None of this says "degrade me, tie me up, slap me around" - not that there's anything wrong with that, I enjoy rougher domination type stuff myself, and have a perfectly respectful, reliable partner who is happy to step into that role sexually, I just don't see that in your post anywhere - it more seems that she's saying, "I want to feel deeply wanted, arousing, sexy, and sexually desired by my partner, ideally with some level of spontaneity."

If you can't see yourself initiating rather tame spontaneous sex with your partner that makes her feel like you're "wild" about her, because you picture her as "someone you want to have kids with/marry" there's a lot to that, and that road probably leads to some form of therapy for you.

The person you settle down and have kids with isn't your mother, or a sibling.   
There's no rule that says that role has to be set aside for some "clean" and virtuous entity that doesn't have a dirty side and that you can't get dirty with, or it won't "work" or "be right" somehow.  
Not being able to see someone you're sexually crazy about as a viable long term partner is - as you've acknowledged - not a good complex to have, and likely a hang-up that will take a bit of work - be it with a therapist, or in a more self-guided therapy routine - because I would hazard a guess that it will come out and cause turbulence in the relationship more than just now, and in more ways than just this.

You are entitled to your own sexual boundaries and desires, and if being in a more "dominant" role isn't for you anymore, or isn't something you're seeking in this relationship, that's totally fine, and it's okay to express that. Kudos to you for making an attempt at giving her something she has expressed wanting, but at the same time, it sounds like you're forcing yourself into a role you aren't thrilled about and don't feel very connected with, already psyching yourself out that you probably won't be that fulfilled by it, just to check a box off for her.  
In the long run, that's not going to play out the way you seem to think it is - she'll almost certainly not be enjoying it if you aren't truly into it, and honestly, it sounds like you're misreading what she was asking of you, and are going into "detached sex-fiend, doesn't give a fuck mode" when from what you've written here, she's just asking for you to express your sexual attraction and lust for her in a bit more vocal, commanding way.  
Again, all I have to go off is your post, but it really seems like by "dominating" she's just asking you to be a bit more "in the lead" or "in control" and more expressive of your attraction and sexual desire for her. Seeing her doing something - that you've agreed upon prior, like in the conversation you mention - and thinking, "god, she's gorgeous, I'm so lucky to be with such a beautiful, sexy woman" can transition quite easily into vocalizing those thoughts, and walking up to her and groping her and starting to initiate some foreplay/sex. Nothing about that screams "bad boy" or "sex you don't have with long term, valuable partners" - if anything, you're lifting her up, boosting her confidence and sexual confidence, and strengthening your sex life by having more frequent, fun sexual encounters together.

&#x200B;

>"And it feels a little demanding on her end when we have such a wonderful relationship outside of sex to ALSO say the bedroom needs to be perfect too, although of course she should ask for what she wants and I appreciate her honesty."

Ugh, this *killed* me.   
In case no one else has reminded you yet, let me make it clear - **she doesn't have to settle.**  
Just because you have "such a wonderful relationship" she doesn't have to put aside her sexual needs and desires and settle for "meh" because "everything else is great!"   
Don't think for one second that it's "demanding" for someone to expect a compatible, fulfilling sexual relationship that meets their needs and sexual appetites just because everything else is going smoothly. That attitude is going to get you nowhere good, and very fast.
Just because a lot of us have had to do it doesn’t mean it’s okay or should be acceptable. Closing and then opening is fucking *horrible* and *shouldn’t* be permitted. Check what sub you’re on, jesus.

For what should be ***very*** obvious reasons, we aren't going to allow the "debating" of personal opinions regarding rape jokes and their comedic validity. 

This is not an appropriate topic for the subreddit, nor does it stay on-topic to Smite - Rule #5 - and as such, comments further exploring this will be removed.
There’s also a Ritalin shortage in some areas, from what I’ve read. Doesn’t seem as bad as the Adderall shortage, but not a guarantee either. 


It’s a toss up too, they’re honestly not really comparable in effect for some people. Ritalin does nothing for me energy wise - just makes me feel heavy and terrible.
It's definitely worth checking out for those who haven't!

They occasionally do a late night hours event - for those of us who don't get going earlier in the day - where they stay open until 10 or 11, which gives you even more time to check it out - and you'll definitely need to set aside a good chunk of time to see it all, this place is *huge*!

There's some parking out front/right across from the entrance too, which if not full, really takes the hassle out of visiting. They have a really great selection of all kinds of stuff - some typical to vintage malls, some you don't see very often - and everything was really well arranged, put together, and it felt very "clean" and cared for. It was a really enjoyable environment to browse around in, and I'll definitely be back! (Took us a solid 2-3 hours to get through every booth at a leisurely pace, but we like to *really* browse.)
I would say it's pretty on par with a lot of "vintage malls" and "thrift stores" in Portland, honestly. Not to say that some of the prices aren't ridiculous - because I *definitely* rolled my eyes at a fair amount of tags there - but I wouldn't say its any worse than anywhere else here - Portland has its own special brand of silly pricing for "vintage" and "thrifts" honestly.

That said, it's still a really cool place to check out. Tons of booths with some really neat stuff, and some prices will surprise you in a good way, too.
Very cool! Enjoy! I've always been intrigued by the craft, but it seems costly/a bit intense to get into, but I love seeing the amazing stained glass things people create! I hope you have a good time and enjoy the learning experience!
Yep, sounds about right. Just watched her little tantrum - you can tell she really thinks she did something there, but she looks like a pathetic, petulant child having an outburst. Ahhhh Portland, gotta love it.
You’ll have to do what everyone else has to do right now - call around.

Stock changes constantly. A place that had it for one commenter will likely now be out as other people filled there. 

I’m fortunate to get mine through Kaiser, so handle everything with them and don’t have to branch out, but my partner is also prescribed it, and it’s the same thing every month. He gets up early and starts calling the pharmacies he used to regularly go to first, asking what mg they have, only to be told none, and then moves through the list, calling all the Costcos - from Portland to Vancouver to Hillsboro and Tigard/Beaverton - then Fred Meyer - starting closest to us and branching out - then Safeway, etc. 

There’s a national shortage, no one has a mystery “in” right now, stock fluctuates constantly - hell, sometimes they’ll have run out by the time my partner makes a mad dash over with his paper prescription.  

You can try to have your doctor change the dosage breakdown - same daily dose, different mg pills to achieve that - but you’re still up against a shortage impacting all mgs.
I’ve heard name brand - if you can afford it or get an authorization with your insurance - isn’t as impacted, but have also heard it is, so who knows.
I get mine for Narcolepsy via mail through Kaiser, no problems. YMMV outside of Kaiser, but it’s certainly legal.
Exactly 👏👏 

You’re not more entitled to sitting because you *chose* to have kids. Your kids aren’t more entitled to sitting because they’re kids - hell, if anything, they’re probably better equipped to stand than some of the rest of us. 
If sitting is important/necessary to you, and you don’t get there in time to be seated on the bus that comes, you can *wait for another bus.* 

First come, first served.

I’m a lady, but as a heavily tattooed, “younger-looking” person, I am so endlessly tired of the dirty looks from entitled moms and their bratty kids. 
I have an “invisible”disability, and I absolutely need to sit, but I have straight up heard garbage moms trash talking me because “that disrespectful *expletive* won’t move, why even come to Disney if you look like that this place is for kids my kids need to sit!!” on numerous occasions.
So neither your BFF or his brother is a neurologist or sleep specialist? Hmm, yeah. Not sure why they’re surprised they’re not someone’s go-to for Narcolepsy.
Leave it to… *u/FeetPicsAddict*… to drop a super unpopular, unfun take.

Although I will say - I think those of us who want these characters would be thrilled to see them even just at Launch Bay. Why they don’t do that is beyond me.
This is *such* a good point, and I somehow didn’t even think of it as a solution either. 

This is the perfect balance - doesn’t invalidate the Starcruiser in its current form/storyline when cruisers are visiting, and allows for a fair distribution of character interactions most fans want the rest of the time. 

I want to meet Grogu more than words can describe but I’m simply *not* going to Disneyland again at this point.
You said it!

Have also had a doctor say “well it must not be *that bad* if you aren’t willing to take ____” as if miserable side effects aren’t a reasonable deterrent 🙄
Like wo, I’m miserable *already,* maybe I can’t risk a mile-long list of additional misery either??? 
Totally feel ya!
It’s crazy how little many doctors seem to care about the sexual side effects of those types of medications. 

Literally have experienced *multiple* doctors say “Well yes, the sexual side effects are a real and not uncommon risk, but that hardly seems as important as managing depression/anxiety” and “well yes but if you’re genuinely experiencing anxiety/depression, it seems like that should be a far higher priority than anything to do with sex.” 

It’s not that doctors don’t know about these side effects - or at least a lot of them seem to - it’s that they don’t really care/don’t see it as important/feel like you should be fine with it if the medication works otherwise. 

As if losing sexual desire, pleasure, arousal, etc. - and for some people losing those things seemingly permanently or for a *very* long time - isn’t a serious problem in and of itself that can cause depression, anxiety, serious relationship problems, etc. 🙄 

I mean, yeah, when you’re going through a mental health crisis/dealing with prolonged mental health issues those things *do* tend to need to take priority, but the general attitude around it is really unhelpful and alienating. 

/endrant 🥶😅

Rule #1 - if you don't have anything nice to say, best not to say it. This is a warning.
So your argument against higher wages is that if it costs *you* more, it’s not okay? 

So you think you should be able to go enjoy WDW, have cast members working for your enjoyment and being on top of their game, but those people don’t deserve a living wage if it impacts *you?*

Gross.
Wait *what?* They switched your Adderall?

Are you normally prescribed Armodafinil? They can’t just make a switch to a different medication on their own.
AH YES “IM A TRANSPLANT AND WHERE IM FROM I PERCEIVE TO BE WORSE SO THEREFORE YALL HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT AND IT CANT POSSIBLY BE BAD FOR *YOU* HERE” MY FAVORITE
It is pretty depressing out there, I don’t disagree! 

There are a few pockets that have been more recently “cleaned up” or “developed” - they’ve tried to make “downtown” Hillsboro, literally a 3 block stretch, more inviting and “happening” and while it’s cute and nicer than it was, it’s still pretty sad, small-town stuff. 
A lot of payday loan strip mall dirty building wasteland strips, as well as a mix of dingy older neighborhoods and cookie cutter newer suburban HOA developments. 
It’s pretty safe - there’s some pockets of tomfoolery but not more than anywhere else - but very boring and depressing.
Interesting! I rented in Gresham once many years ago, and was almost shot - like, a matter of seconds and it would’ve been me - in my doorway… twice. No hyperbole. Shit was like the Wild West up there long before Portland got to the level of bad it is now. I’m semi surprised NE was worse for you! 

I prefer Seattle to Portland, but know they share many of the same issues, so wouldn’t want to make that relocation mistake 😉
I will say Seattle is remarkably nicer in comparison, regardless. 

I grew up in Hillsboro, and have been in various sections of Portland proper for over a decade. It’s absolutely a wasteland of filth and insanity now, and I can’t wait to leave someday. 
I’ve been fucked with and put in direct danger more times here than any other major city I’ve been in, and I’ve traveled *a lot* - and have lived in other major metros, as well. 
This list is definitely beyond wrong.

Unfortunately Hillsboro and Happy Valley aren’t exactly the peak of safety and cleanliness either these days, but they’re remarkably tame - and better - comparably. 
Gresham on the other hand… that’s *never* been a “safe” suburb.
Which suburbs, even?! Sadly, I live in Portland *now.* This list made me chuckle.
Exactly.

If ***you*** want something, it is up to ***you*** \- as a fucking grown adult - to ***ask*** for it. No one is going to read your mind, and no one should be expected to, either.

If your needs weren't met, communicate that. If you need something specific, communicate that. Otherwise, the *only* person you have to blame for not getting what you want is *you*. (And acting like a petulant child by being sour over it, when *you* couldn't communicate like an adult, or because "now that I had to ask I don't want it anymore!" is pitiful.)

Now, if you've talked to a partner about this multiple times, and have expressed that you need \_\_\_\_ during \_\_\_\_ and need them to make a point of doing so in the future, and they continue to ignore those requests, that's another story.   
But assuming that every single man is going to read your mind, assume what your exact needs are at the exact time without being told, and will live up to your expectations without any communication... Well, there's a reason you're continuously disappointed - and it's because *it just doesn't work that way.*
Same. Some of the nightmare neighbors I’ve had… I can’t imagine *buying* a unit that shares a building/wall. 

Sure, you can get stuck with awful neighbors in a stand-alone home, but you’re not *literally connected* to them. It’s a different beast, but still a bit more privacy/options. 

I’ve lived in duplexes and unless the insulation is literally the best on the planet, *fuck no* would I buy and sign up to live indefinitely with whoever ends up above/below/beside me. 

I’m living in a townhouse right now, and I *love* it - great insulation so the neighbors I share a wall with never hear me nor I them, and the neighbor across the shared patio space is generally quiet and very kind, so it all works out. 
However, before the neighbors across the patio moved in, we had a 3+ month battle trying to get our landlord to get rid of the tenants that moved in - and decided they were entitled to making all the noise in the world and having a constant stream of 20-something party-assholes over.
They’d set up a fucking dinner table in the patio space - which our landlord explained to them should be treated as if an “incredible fence” was in the middle, it was not 100% shared between us, our side was ours and theirs, theirs - basically right in front of our kitchen window and blocking our patio doors, host loud parties with “woo!!! Shots!!” every 2 minutes, etc.
One of the pair was a “professional DJ” so anytime they played music - on their “pro equipment” of course - it would vibrate my entire house. I could hear that shit in my upstairs shower when bathing, windows closed on both houses, and I wanted to kill them. It was nonstop. I could somehow hear her talking in my upstairs bedroom with my TV on - all windows closed - and her partner joked he had “measured the decibels of her voice, she’s so loud lol!” when I confronted them. 

Fortunately they were evicted - they had crossed the landlord too many times and this was the last phase of last straws - but god, I can’t imagine what it would’ve been like had I owned this townhouse and they were staying put. 
Not that moving when leasing is easy as pie, but it’s a lot less of a mess than when you own.
I want to preface this by saying that my intention here is ***not*** to be a "Negative Nelly" or try to shut down your hopes and goals before they even start. 

Like you said, no one knows what the outcome of your sleep appointment(s) will be, if you will even receive a related diagnosis, or what a treatment plan may look like for you. 

  
Given that, all I can do is speak to some of the variables and possibilities, and try to give you the perspective of someone who *does* have Narcolepsy, and what that journey has looked like for *me.*  
Even if you *do* receive a Narcolepsy - or IH - diagnosis, your symptoms, journey, and treatment may - and *probably* will - look very, or even completely different from mine.

  
I'm not here trying to spread a message of doom and gloom, and hope that you don't digest my comment and take it as that - rather, I want to share my perspective from my experience, which may or may not ever be relevant to you, purely because I *wish* someone had told me these things when *I* was first figuring it out.

  
I got a whole lot of "stay positive" and "there's treatment out there, you'll be fine if you just do x/y/z" and "sometimes you just have to roll with the punches and do it even if you're miserable!" - **none** of which helped.   
***No one*** prepared me for the ***real*** realities of this ***awful*** disease - I am diagnosed with Narcolepsy, specifically - and how *debilitating* and *crippling* it *truly* can be for those of us with severe symptoms.   
It took many years and many appointments before someone was finally honest with me about the true realities for many of us with N. I was made to think that there would be a return to "normal" and that I wouldn't always be behind everyone else, struggling to keep up and balance my life. For many of us, there is no "normal" and there is no "back on top."  


Now, again, every Narcoleptic is different. Some people don't have that severe of symptoms. Some people respond well to medications - especially when their symptoms weren't ever that bad to begin with - and the impact to their day to day life is minimal.

For a lot of us, however, that couldn't be further from reality.

There is ***no cure*** for Narcolepsy/IH. 

It ***does not*** "just go away" and you **don't** just "return to normal" - which is to say, "successful treatment" may ***not*** mean "elimination of symptoms" or "return to pre-symptomatic state of being" and instead means "decent/*slight* management/minimizing of ***some*** symptoms."

You mention "once I’m sleeping and able to live like a normal person" - something that you *may* have to accept down the road is that this will never happen.   
N/IH means you ***do not*** sleep "like a normal person" - though it can be minimized through medication for *some people*, this is not something that just "goes away" or "stops" for most sufferers. 

The road to diagnosis can be years long, requiring stressful, uncomfortable, and sometimes inconclusive testing - that may need to be done multiple times and can be very disruptive to your life, not to mention ungodly expensive in some cases.  
These diseases are still fairly rare and the research/treatment plans available are not as plentiful as we would like. As such, the treatment options available can be cumbersome, unpleasant, and extremely time consuming to get "right" - and even then, many of us find that no matter what medication we're on, nothing really breaks through the symptoms, and at best provides very, *very* **slight** "help" but never relief.   
These medications come with their own list of other problems/side effects, can be very expensive, difficult to get, and hard to balance. And, like all medication management, it can be a long road of trial and error trying to find the right combination - and a painful road of trying to fight the build up of tolerance once you do find something that works.

My sleep doctor once put it to me in a way I really did *not* want to hear, but in hindsight wished I would've heard much sooner.  
I expressed to him my frustration with N, and how behind I felt all the time. That I was sick of trying to balance work, college, and all the other responsibilities I had to try to keep my life in order and stay afloat. That I was sick of starting 100 steps behind everyone else, so exhausted, fatigued, and brain fogged that I could barely function.  
I expected some sort of "well, eventually this will improve, we just need to \_\_\_\_" or something to that effect, but instead he said, essentially:   
"Well, I hate to break it to you, *but you have Narcolepsy.* There's nothing you can do to *erase* that. We *can* keep working on medication management, but you're never going to ***not*** be Narcoleptic. As much as that might suck to accept, acceptance is necessary - and acceptance means *accepting* that you simply *cannot* do the same things as everyone else like everyone else. You *have to* manage your expectations of your life and realize that you have a disease that will, in some ways, hold you back. Whether that means you have to do things slower, or whether that means you have to manage your schedule differently... Maybe that means you can't go to school full time and work full time simultaneously. No one wants to limit themselves, but if you don't, you **will** crash and burn. Because like it or not, you are dealing with a lifelong health problem that is going to be there, actively working against you regardless. So you can either accept that and make adjustments so you can manage it, or you can pretend that it's not a factor, and continue to wonder why you're feeling exhausted, sick, and terrible all the time while everything falls apart."  


Of course, I was not happy with that conversation at first, and instinctually wanted to go "you're wrong, I can do whatever I want just like everyone else!" but the more I thought about it, the more I realized how right he was.  
It's unfortunate, and no one wants to face that reality, but when you're diagnosed with a disease - like N/IH - that impacts your ability to get restful, restorative sleep, and leaves you with extreme fatigue, brain fog, memory problems, hallucinations, and all kinds of other comorbid problems and disorders, like it or not, you are not operating on the same "normal" level as a person without N/IH, and it will only harm you to try to pretend and live as though you are.

Before this gets too too long - this is all to say that:

A diagnosis - and treatment plan - does not likely mean a "return to normal." Expecting that it does is setting yourself up for major heartache and disappointment in the future.  
Though you may well find that medication and treatment help a great deal, and you are only dealing with some slight symptoms here and there, you should also be prepared for a long, difficult, stressful road of trying to figure all this out - and a future where medication doesn't really help *that much*, potentially.

Being prepared for the worst case scenario like that is the best thing you can do for yourself. Strive to find the best treatment possible, hope that it works out that way, but if it doesn't?  
Start thinking *now* about what that future looks like. How will you manage that? What will you have to do to adjust and stay afloat and progress in your life if that is the hand you're dealt? What support would you need to be able to adapt and make it through if that's the case? What can you do now to make things easier on yourself in the short, medium, and long term if your symptoms persist as they are now?  


These are all things I wish I would've spent my time focusing on and preparing for - and getting started on immediately - instead of waiting for some "potential" treatment or diagnosis down the road and going over hypotheticals in my head about a potential time in the future where I'd "get my life going again" - because that future never really came the way I had hoped for.

If you can't express your viewpoints in a constructive, civil manner, they will continue to be removed for violating Rule #1 - constructive discussion is one thing, berating other users and responding with disrespectful, antagonistic comments is another, and the latter will not be tolerated here.

Consider this a warning before a temp ban in the future.
u/ActivityLiving4517

If you don't have anything civil and polite to say, move along. Rule #1.

Likewise, u/barbarianlover, no need to engage when someone is being childish.

If you can't be civil, you will receive a temp ban - this is a warning. If you don't have anything nice to say, move along.
This was my answer as well! 

Let’s start by giving some love to and adding to the *existing* pavilions. That Mt Fuji ride would be amazing! So sad it never came to be.
Not everyone can afford to move. Some people have jobs, doctors, sick/aging family close by with needs, etc.
Some people live in poverty and can barely afford to keep a roof over their head, nonetheless the thousands it costs to uproot and start over elsewhere - or move further and spend out the ass to commute. 

The answer to “violent, criminal homeless people turning the city into an open air drug market and asylum” isn’t “well just leave then.”
It’s a problem that needs solving.
I’ve noticed that too! I love visiting different parts of Florida - people seem much friendlier, much healthier and happier mentally and physically, and the overall “vibe” is a lot less angry and depressed and dirty. 

The politics side does suck, but it’s not how everyone there feels or lives.
I have gay friends and trans friends there who love it and have solid communities around them. A few Portland friends have moved there and said they’d never look back.
But it’s a major move, won’t be cheap, and is a major climate adjustment, so it’s a lot to consider!
I'm so sorry for your loss!

What a sweet set up he had - it's so obvious how much you loved him, and how close you both were. I'm sure he cherished being able to be so close to you all the time - I love seeing when folks create little spaces to be closer to their pets through their daily routine, instead of just setting their bed in a corner and calling it good.

When I lost my little dude last summer, it was so rough coming home and seeing little pieces of him everywhere. The house felt so empty and cold, and he was missing every direction I looked.   
For me at least, it helped to keep some of those little spaces or pieces still around, as a tribute. It will sting for a while, whether you leave anything up or not, to look at those spaces where your friend should still be, but eventually it will be a cherished memory to look back on. Hang in there <3
I'm curious what "literally nothing" really is like, versus how it works at the beginning. 

I'm not saying this is what's going on for you, merely posing it as a possibility, because it seems to happen to a lot of people.

When you first start a stimulant medication, though it doesn't have the same "adjustment period" and "build up in your system" phase as say, anti-depressants, there is still an adjustment period where your body/brain are getting used to the medication and the effects are "settling in" so to speak.

So at the beginning, you might feel *great,* and then about a week later, it doesn't feel *as great,* and then a few weeks later you aren't really noticing it at all, because it doesn't feel like it did in week one.   
That doesn't mean it isn't doing anything, it just means you aren't *feeling* the medication in the same stimulating, noticeable way. Which is the point - you aren't going to feel that "buzzy, lifted" feeling past the first week or so of taking a stimulant - at the right dose as directed for a legitimate illness, anyway.

People tend to confuse this with tolerance and with the medication not working *"at all"* and ceasing to be effective, when it's more that the medication has "settled in" and you are getting passive benefits, but not in the same "jolt" as when it is fresh in your system.

Now, that doesn't mean that you're at the right dose, or that there isn't a better medication combo out there, or something you should add in addition to it. Just that it's important to adjust our expectations of what these medications are for and what they're really supposed to do in our systems.  
Stimulants aren't ever going to make you feel truly rested or awake or alert. They're supposed to help take the edge off a bit, definitely, and make it easier to stay focused/alert/fight through that excessive sleepiness and brain fog a bit.   
But they're also not miracle drugs - for the majority of us with N/IH, they're ***not*** going to break through ***all*** of our symptoms, or even *most* of them, and they're not going to magically erase the tiredness and heaviness when we're on them. We're still going to have to deal with all the awful shit that comes with these diseases, just maybe a *little* less so, or with a *little* bit more "power" to push through it.

We're still going to be exhausted. We're still going to really struggle. It's just an *aid*, not a pause button.  
Likewise, it's very important to still be practicing good sleep hygiene, eating/hydrating super well, and generally taking good care of ourselves, because if we aren't, stimulants will do less than nothing.

Are you truly feeling *zero* improvement/effect after those few weeks, or is it just not as noticeable/as much of a "boost" when you take it? There's a big difference between "nothing at all" and "something but not strongly detectable" and it's an important difference to recognize. 

If none of that rings true for you, I apologize! Just wanted to offer a different perspective, as I see a lot of people having unrealistic expectations of what stimulants and medication can really do, and feeling that because they can't "feel" anything when they take it, their meds must just not be working at all. 

&#x200B;

If it's not the above, I would definitely recommend continuing to try different medication combinations, and keeping a journal of your time on them to recognize patterns.

It would likely be very helpful for both you and your doctors to be able to see the timeline when you're taking these medications. Things like:

* How it feels at the start
* How long it is effective each day/you notice benefits
* The schedule you're taking them on, and what you're eating/drinking/doing around those times
* When you're eating/hydrating in relation to your medication schedule 
* Sleep/exercise/work schedules
* When you start noticing it becoming less effective, and exactly what that looks like each day

Having a timeline to look at might help you/them to draw conclusions about what is going on. Is it your diet? Other medications you're taking? Sleep hygiene? What else is happening in your life when the effects start to dwindle? Is there any correlation, or none at all?

It might just be that you metabolize these medications faster than average, or maybe food/drink you consume is playing a part in that, or your sleep hygiene is very poor and thus stimulants aren't going to stay consistently effective no matter how many you take - there's a lot of things that can play into this.

It sounds "weird" but believe it or not, in some cases, taking higher doses can make you *more* tired/be *less* effective. Especially if within the period of a month you're rushing straight to 60mg - that might be counterproductive, and what's causing the problem. 

You can't possibly decide in the course of a month or less that multiple different doses of a medication is "wrong" or "right" - you need to give it time to "settle" and to develop a routine for even just a short time to have a conclusive, accurate answer one way or another.

You might be someone that benefits from ER and IR combos - ER to keep a "level" all day, but IR "boosters" periodically during times you are prone to "crash" or use up more energy. Or you may prefer exclusively IR, so you can tailor the "release" of your meds to the times you need the boost the most. But either way, it takes time to figure out the  best combo, and you have to be willing to be patient.

It sucks, but the fact of the matter is, those of us with N/IH are ***always*** going to be struggling and suffering from the exhaustion/sleepiness, brain fog/mental symptoms, etc. - the cycle ***never*** ends, this is a lifelong diagnosis with lifelong challenges.  
The sooner you accept that this is a long trek and not a short race the better - yeah, it ***fucking*** ***sucks*** to have to deal with for ***any*** length of time, and no one wants to be exhausted/going through the hassle and rollercoaster that is finding the right medication that'll work long term.   
But it's absolutely worth the hassle, energy, struggle, and exhaustion that it takes to *be patient* and do it right instead of jumping around just trying to make something stick. This might take a while for you to figure out, and it's probably going to suck a lot in the interim. We can all relate, I promise.  
Just be kind to yourself, be patient, and remember that in the grand scheme of things, this "phase" is very short compared to the rest of your life.   
It sucks to have to accept, but the fact is - it doesn't matter how much of a "rush" *you* are in. This shit *takes time*, there's no way around that.   
None of us have wanted to put our lives on hold to deal with this disease, but I can confidently say most of us have had to - or will have to - at one point or another. That's just how it works - it's not fair, we didn't ask for this, but that's what life with a disease like this is like. It's largely not "on your terms" - you have to roll with the punches.  


If you haven't already, reaching out to your academic advisor and/or disability services center at your college would likely be a good idea, since you mention worrying about dropping out. Letting them know that you are diagnosed, dealing with the long and harsh struggle of medication management/treatment, and would like to make them aware in case you need accommodations - and thinking of what accommodations might help you in case you need them going forward - would be a great start, especially as they may have some suggestions for you/be willing to work with you on certain things.  
N/IH are ***very much*** a disability for many of us. 

&#x200B;

Best of luck to you!
Thank you *so* much for such a kind, caring response! You're amazing!

So, it's funny you should mention the high heat - after another comment recommended going in and asking to purchase some of the sauce, my partner made the trek for me, and picked up a small container of it. I tried to use it with some chicken I tend to toss in the slow cooker, and I found that it didn't taste anything like the sauce I was used to - so I immediately figured they either changed suppliers/recipes, or it was a "me" problem because I am a horribly inexperienced "cook."

I would love to be able to recreate the pork/yakisoba noodle wok that NS had, and it sounds like the key to doing that will be cooking it the same way to get the sauce hot enough? If you have any tips to try to recreate this, I would be so, so grateful!  
I don't know what it is, but I feel like we all have that one "thing" that we crave constantly, and always go back to - I hate that mine is the pork/yakisoba NS wok, but I have eaten those for a solid decade and I think going to get them after various doctors appointments/surgeries kind of trained my body to crave it as "comfort/healing food" so to speak.

I'm guessing I will need to figure out buying some kind of wok dish to cook this in, to start, as well, but any tips for this complete novice would be amazing. Thank you again, you come off so warm and kind in your comment and it really touched me.
If the shoe fits… 🤷‍♀️
Because some irrational, entitled “guest” calling and demanding they call the authorities because they “smell something they don’t like” isn’t how they enforce any of their policies.
If the hotel was full, there is nothing they can do about moving you, *obviously.*
I’m certain they investigated the issue - whether you were made aware of it or not, they don’t owe you a personal view of their every move because you called to whine - and when they determined there was no problem/nothing that could be done due to lack of evidence or issue, they moved along to the next responsibility. 

Implying that Disney is “full of druggies” and Disney is actively aware of their presence and willfully enabling it is so hilariously delusional. You clearly live a life of great privilege if *Disney* seems “full of druggies” to you.
All of this! You said it!

The "sleep" is the simplest of the issues, honestly. And seemingly the only one that 90% of websites about Narcolepsy want to mention - and that most doctors want to focus on, and that anyone "learning" about the disease care to retain.

Yeah, the sleep side of things fucking sucks, don't get me wrong.

But the memory loss? I have no short term/working memory. I might as well have a degenerative brain disorder, or early onset Alzheimer's. I'm losing my past, and I can't form a present. 

The physical and mental pain? It ***fucking hurts*** to have Narcolepsy. My head always feels heavy, exhausted, foggy, and actually in physical pain. My body is always achy. It takes me longer to recover from sleeping wrong/becoming sore. Sometimes the process of chewing is so painfully exhausting I can't even fathom eating. Standing up long enough to shower can be a burning sensation when I'm at my most tired.

The attention and focus issues. The automatic behaviors. The microsleeps. The mood problems. 

I'm a fucking useless zombie 95% of the day - if I'm lucky.

I'm so sick of seeing Narcolepsy information only mention 3-5 fucking symptoms. Every piece of literature out there paints us like sluggish, sleepy oafs that have weird dreams and sleep paralysis, but beyond being tired, should function fine during the day.

RIDICULOUS.

And god, the stigma with medication, you said it! If I read one more fucking complaint from posts across Reddit regarding the stimulant shortage ripping on stimulant users - and acting like ADHD people are the only ones who get this medication - my head is going to explode.
God, this one really hurts.

Money issues aside - since I'm so cripplingly disabled by Narcolepsy I will be living in abject poverty for the rest of my life - when I *have* been able to vacation/get away, the stress and exhaustion makes it hard to get anywhere near my "moneys worth" out of the experience.

I end up feeling more depressed than anything when I try to "get away" because it's harder and harder all the time to get up and have any semblance of a day - whether at home or anywhere else. 

I had so many dreams of travel, and accepting that none of them will ever happen - both due to this fucked up country damning disabled people to a life of poverty, and due to all the terrors of Narcolepsy - has been absolutely crushing.

I have wanted to visit Japan ever since I was a young child. I knew deep down I'd never be able to afford it, but I at least kept the dream alive as a "but what if!"  
But when I learned that you can't bring stimulant medication into the country, I had an actual sobbing breakdown.  
It was written in stone at that moment that I will ***never*** achieve that dream. Someone could hand me $50,000 tomorrow, and it will still never happen.  
This is just one of many dreams I've had that "moment" about, and it fucking sucks.

Narcolepsy has stolen every dream, every desire, and every goal I've ever had from me. 

I would love to vacation again some day, but I know it's just a waste. I'll sleep through most of it, and even if I don't, I won't remember most of it anyway.
They really should expand this - and do it at OM as well. The hours are super short, and it’s super infrequent.
Not everyone wants the experience of going to a children’s machine or a zoo when visiting Meow Wolf 🥲
Unfortunately no - I would be laughed out of the pharmacy or my doctors office if I even attempted to ask for extras of a controlled substance. Not only is it not legally permitted, you’re more than likely going to be marked as a drug seeker - which is something that can impact your ability to get your life-saving medications for the rest of your life - for even asking, no matter how reasonable the explanation might be, such as relating to something like this.

I have fortunately been able to obtain a few months extra of things like my migraine medications and such, but where the important stuff is concerned, sadly our laws around controlled substances are really, frankly, stupid.

As I am painfully impoverished - always have been, and always will be, yay America! - collecting a surplus of anything isn’t really realistically feasible. Food stamps barely supplies enough to survive the month you’re receiving benefits for, stockpiling is out of the question. And with inflation, it’ll only become less and less doable for folks like myself who aren’t well-off. Having the space to store things like water or extra food or supplies would also be a major problem - comfortable, spacious housing isn’t exactly abundant, here.

I do appreciate your seemingly optimistic and well-informed outlook on things. You’re right - people need to prepare, and there needs to be a plan in place to help those who couldn’t stockpile and don’t have the resources should an event like this happen.
Unfortunately, for those of us who are poor and disabled - and who have difficult medical needs - it won’t really matter what the plan is, we will be forgotten because there will be too much else to manage, and it will be too hard to cover our needs.
Definitely thought it said Criddler - which is a term used here in Portland, perhaps elsewhere too, to describe our special flavor of awful, meth-zombie homeless folks - and was very confused 😂

Looks great though, seriously! Nicely done
Chuckled at the Windows 95 manual mention. 

I’ve seen one in a neighborhood LFL when walking to the store once or twice - as well as some *very* random textbooks - and wondered if they’d get any takers!
Who knows - that manual could be *the* book for someone who has truly read everything! 😂
Ah yes, because white people can’t be impoverished, struggle with access to things, or have need for free books exchanges. 

Totally, awesome point.
Thank you ♥️
Thank you so much ♥️

I am by no means a good cook, so perhaps that is why, but I’ve made teriyaki sauce at home with a similar recipe, and while decent, it just wasn’t “it” - I don’t know what “it” is, exactly, but the NS sauce just tasted very “different” to other teriyaki I’ve had, and I could never figure out why, but let’s just say I probably could’ve single-handedly kept the wok bar open with how often I’d eat it 😂

I will give it another shot with this list on hand, though! I appreciate it *so* much! 
I’m completely useless in the kitchen, so I’d guess that plays a part in why I can’t quite identify what it is about the NS teriyaki that makes it “different” but guess quality of ingredients and exact amounts does okay a big part in the final flavor - I’ll try to play around a bit! 
Thank you again!
Thank you so much for your response!

I don’t know that I’ve ever seen teriyaki chicken in the self serve hot bar, but then again, I can’t say I’ve looked that hard - do you know if that’s something they may still offer, or if that was an “older” thing? The couple times I asked about it since the wok closed, I was told they had no idea/didn’t sell the same stuff they used back there. 

Funnily enough, I worked at the Cedar Hills New Seasons a bit under a decade ago, and wish I would’ve thought to investigate then, but I just assumed it would be around forever!
Thank you so much for responding!

I’m essentially just trying to find the teriyaki sauce that was used in the woks! 
I don’t know if y’all used a certain brand, or how it was made if it was something specific to New Seasons, but I’m desperate to find it.
I don’t know why, but there was something “different” about it that I haven’t found in other teriyaki sauces, and I crave it constantly.
Ah! Thank you so much - I’ll give that a shot! 😊
u/Feelted1,

Please keep it civil. If you don't have anything respectful to say, no need to comment. This is a warning.

Thank you
u/ItzAquaaa,

 If you can't keep it civil, you will receive a temp ban. Rule #1 - if you can't be respectful, no need to comment.

This is a warning.
u/DeMiDeViL1,

This is a warning.
The aftermath of my stepdads suicide was pretty fucked up, I guess. 

He shot himself in front of my mom last January. Couldn’t have been more unexpected - not that you ever “expect” these things, but there were *zero* signs, this was not someone exhibiting depression or going through a rough patch *at all.* 

I had to clean up the aftermath on my own, maybe an hour after they took him to the ER - he didn’t make it, but he was kept alive on machines for a week so they could harvest him for organ donation, which quite frankly was almost more awful of an experience overall than cleaning up the unreasonably awful aftermath. 

I still think about it all the time. Never on purpose, it just flashes by, sometimes. 
It’s weird - you see suicides in movies, bloody scenes on screen… it isn’t really like that. It’s different, it’s somehow both less shocking and gory and more gruesome all at the same time. 



I guess second to that would be six months later, holding my cat, who I loved more than anything, while he bled to death from a needlessly cruel and gruesome mauling by our deplorable neighbors pit bull. 
Think what you want about pets, cats don’t have to be your thing, but it absolutely ripped my heart out. Haunts me all the time.
This cracked me up. What a wild way to say “I can’t afford to purchase a parking pass” 😂
It does look good, but I much prefer the Tower at night without projections. It just looks “right” when it’s lit up normally, projection free, and is really beautiful.
Some of the holiday projections, while well done, are *way* too busy/chaotic. 
The 50th look, as in OPs photo, feels like the best of all of them - not too over the top and very crisp - but I feel like it really takes away from the Tower and looks a bit odd in the area. That said, they’re fun once and a while!
At this point, on the rare occasion I attempt to explain what Narcolepsy is like/how some of the symptoms are, I will use "degenerative" alongside a lot of the "brain"/mental symptoms - such as memory loss, loss of executive functioning, automatic behaviors, brain fog, etc. 

I have *absolutely* lost most of my short term/working memory, executive functioning, attention span, organization skills, recollection, etc.   
The brain fog and memory loss *absolutely* feels degenerative - gets worse all the time, has gotten progressively and measurably worse over the years, and has not/will not/is not coming back or ever getting better. 

Just know - you're not alone. A lot of us are experiencing these symptoms and with extreme severity.   
It's terrifying, can be embarrassing, and no one really "gets" it - unless they have Narcolepsy, they'll ***never*** know what it's like, ***even remotely.*** Just on the exhaustion alone.

I absolutely relate to everything you mentioned, and I'm so sorry you're going through all this, too.

It's mortifying to forget simple things that you should absolutely know - and knew for years. It's so scary to realize how much your memory has deteriorated - and to know it'll never come back. I wish there was a way "out" or "back" from this awful disease.
They still come in daily anyway, unfortunately, whether you’re getting cleaning services or not. But I agree - I prefer not to have people maneuvering around my stuff every day, I worry about things getting lost/taken/tossed by mistake.
I mean, considering I need a controlled substance medication to survive each day - and not collapse at random, or be essentially catatonic - I will be at the mercy of however much medication I have left when a disaster hits, if the stress and trauma of the event doesn’t render it useless anyway, so I’m not working myself up too much about it, I’m not one of the folks meant to survive something like this. 


It’s close to impossible for anyone suffering through life in poverty to be reasonably prepared, anyway. 
Where are people supposed to store all these supplies, nonetheless afford them? 
Our government is happy to leave the poor out to suffer and die on a normal day - and through the pandemic - so I can say with certainty the same will be true in an event such as this. 

It sucks to think about, but at the same time, there’s only so much a lot of us can do to prepare. 
Knowing I can’t really do *anything,* I try not to think about it. 🥶
I agree with you.

While OPs “boyfriend” may have been lying, and doesn’t sound very committed here, OP doesn’t exactly sound like mature relationship material either. 

She’s *29* for gods sake. This is some teenage drama bullshit. 
I’d be pretty upset too if someone was posting my photo and information on a “dating forum” to get opinions and “takes” from strangers. That’s a pretty big violation of my privacy, and I’d be pretty upset that my supposed partner wouldn’t address their concerns with me or talk to me about what’s bothering them - but would happily go to strangers and blast my picture and problems online. 

OP has some growing up to do.
I got precheck specifically *because* regular TSA times at PDX were so godawful I couldn’t take it anymore.

Has never taken more than 10 minutes in precheck, even when getting those emails. (Even the days after Thanksgiving, when the normal line was clogging back to the carrier desk areas and wrapped several rows of dividers deep.) 
 
It doesn’t hurt to be 1.5 hours early, regardless, but I’ve *never* needed 2-3 with precheck. PDX also has an estimator on their website you can check. 
I think in general it really depends on when you’re traveling specifically - I think they send that as a blanket warning, rather than it being triggered by your specific flight time.)
This is my fear/assumption - my hope was they sell it/it’s purchasable somewhere, or something I could obtain a recipe for, but I’m guessing this is probably the case
I have this as well, and I love it! The Tower is my absolute favorite - I’m not a huge Funko person, but I think this one is super well done. They have one with Mickey in black instead of gold, as well.
Yep - it’s probably near impossible to switch in such little time, and if you do, I’d question how prepared/rested you’d be for the study/if it would have a negative impact still. 

I would call your doctor/whomever is doing your study and ask what they recommend, if you can, OP. Let them know you’re really concerned.
I’ve done this three times in the last year, actually, and was told “no idea,” “no one back here worked that,” and “uh why would I have taken note of that” 😭

I was hoping perhaps this post would reach an ex-wok worker or someone who’s had more success in asking, but I’ll attempt to ask again in the future - I just don’t get to NS often, especially these days.
Right 😂

As if nearly every bar I’ve ever been in in Portland doesn’t actively overserve *constantly.* 
Bottle service exists in other states and manages just fine.
That’s pretty silly.
Even *dives* are getting to be that bad, these days. 

I could rarely ever afford to go out before, but now? It's getting insane.
I’m so glad! I mean, not glad you’re going through it equally, because that sucks, and I’m *so sorry,* but I’m so glad my comment resonated with you and helped. I’m *so sorry* you’re feeling it too, friend. Always here if you need to chat. I wish you the absolute best in your journey.
Do you *seriously* think that their *only* job requirements involve aimlessly hunting for stolen cars? Are you kidding me?
I didn’t say that I knew for a fact she did, as we clearly don’t. 

I said *if* she did, just because there isn’t a *lease* doesn’t mean she isn’t a tenant. Eviction “doesn’t require a lease” as you so confidently, incorrectly stated. 

There are other laws surrounding occupancy and establishing tenancy that don’t involve paying any rent, as well. 
Under no circumstances do you get to kick someone out with “one day or less” notice, unless you’re an idiot that wants to deal with a hell of a legal ordeal with the court system. 
I don’t need to “source” anything. These are facts in the real world - sounds like you could use to start living in it.
This is stupid, plain ignorant “advice” - it varies by location, but in *most,* a lease is not required. Establishing tenancy occurs through a few different avenues, and no doubt if she’s lived there over a few months, paid *any* rent, etc. she is legally a tenant and must be given proper legal notice to vacate - for legally permitted reasons - or be evicted through the court system. 
In some states, even just occupying a space for a certain period of time gives you these types of rights. 

You don’t just get to kick someone out without even a day to pack, no matter how much you don’t like them/how shitty it was that they brought dogs into your house.

Hopefully no one listens to this absolutely dumb, completely inaccurate take.
Likely because there are a lot of landlords on this subreddit, whereas the people you are talking to are probably largely not in that category.

The most vocal are always the most noticeable on Reddit, as a general rule. There is plenty of pushback from renters/those who aren't super "pro-landlords making big profits" around these parts, too, but you will definitely see landlords chime in more vocally when something is impacting them directly, because while not all renters may be bothered by some of these bills/changes, it will apply to all landlords.
Did you not read *"disabled"* there? Us folks with disabilities work harder just to survive each day than you likely ever will in your fucking lifetime.

There is no "work more, work better" for disabled folks, quite frankly - if we can work *at all,* which many of us *can't,* hence ***disabled***, the jobs are almost never paying a living wage, nor are enough hours available/can we work enough hours to get by.

Hard work, more work - these don't equal more money in the US. You can work yourself to death and still be paycheck to paycheck, because the system isn't built to raise you up, it's built to keep you down. There's nothing the majority can "do" to escape that - especially when they're already living life in hard mode by having a disability, which they also ***can't fucking do anything about,*** didn't ask for, and didn't deserve.

You're a privileged piece of shit, clearly, by your tone and ideals here. Maybe spoiled, entitled? Consider yourself lucky you aren't in the same position as those of us who are disabled and impoverished, and who are barely surviving, despite all our best efforts.
u/AlternativeSquare123,

This is your first and final warning before a ban. The way you're engaging on this subreddit is absolutely ***not okay*****.** If you can't be respectful and civil with other users, you won't be here *at all.*
For a good majority of people, it WON’T have much, if any impact, more than likely. Because for a good majority of people, it isn’t a problem, and isn’t interfering with their lives/sexual relationships - so what exactly would there be for it to improve/effect?

Those friends of yours who noted it had “some kind of effect” on them likely were using it differently than you, experiencing different negative effects from their routines than you, or potentially also reduced the amount they were masturbating in addition to ceasing to view porn - honestly there’s quite a lot of things that could factor into why they noticed a difference in their lives and you did not, unless you are doing a 1:1 comparison between two people living exactly the same lives/routines with the same masturbation/porn habits and such, it’s really hard to say/to expect the same effects.

A lot of people who quit watching pornography *also* stop masturbating daily/as much. This decrease in masturbation *on top of* quitting porn would likely cause an increase in general horniness, potentially sexual performance, and would mean they’re allocating time they normally would be using to jerk off to do other things, which could be perceived as “discipline” or “work ethic” since they’re potentially spending more time on other things.

These friends also could’ve had more “obscure” porn/general masturbation habits that was impacting their sex lives/sexual motivation. Maybe they were jerking off more than you and reduced the frequency, or maybe they were spending a great deal of time per session watching porn, and no longer doing so freed up a good deal of free time for them.

There’s a lot to be said for the placebo effect. If the person quitting is doing so *because* they feel it’s problematic/causing issues/a negative behavior, or they go into it *expecting* and *truly believing* they will experience a great deal of positive benefits, they may perceive the outcome of the change to go along with that belief. It may not actually be positive benefits relating to ceasing porn use, but they’re attributing it to that/claiming that is - either because that’s what they want other people to believe due to their own motives/mentality, or because they don’t realize that the change is more in themselves than it is a result of quitting porn.
A lot of times, when we’re going to make a sizable change in our lives, under the assumption it will benefit us positively and improve things like mood, motivation, drive, productivity, etc. we tend to start working a bit harder at things in general, staying more upbeat/optimistic, trying to balance our priorities more, etc.
Those things can improve *without* changing anything around porn/masturbation, but because they’ve committed to this “quit” that they believe will improve their lives, suddenly quitting porn is solely responsible for this change, when that’s not it at all.

Point being - the only person who’s habits and results matter in your life is *yours.*
If you don’t feel porn is causing any problems in your life - sexually, motivation wise, etc. - and you are satisfied with your work ethic, sexual interactions, motivation, etc. then there’s no reason to deprive yourself of it or consider it a bad habit.
When you start neglecting other tasks/responsibilities *to watch porn* that’s when it starts becoming an actual problem - it doesn’t sound like you had/have issues with porn addiction or “dependency” so there’s no reason to “quit” unless you personally don’t find it enjoyable and want to spend your time differently.

You’re already masturbating every day - what difference does it make if it’s with or without porn, unless you’re specifically spending worrisome amounts of time doing it when you *do* use porn, or if the porn use is impacting your sexual relationship(s) with real partners. As long as that’s not the case - and you’re not causing yourself “death grip” or related issues - again, it’s not a negative thing.

There is a *very* obnoxiously vocal minority that are *very* anti-porn - either “no-jerk” bros, religious types, very insecure folks, etc. - who will tell you “quit at all costs, it’s bad, negative, you don’t need it, its pathetic especially in a relationship!” 
These types are to be ignored.
There’s nothing wrong with watching it, nothing wrong with not - make the best choices for you, based on you alone.
Hmm, I would say that this really depends, for me, on what exactly I'm telling them in terms of how I'm doing.

I have completely given up on explaining my struggles/symptoms relating to Narcolepsy to other people, or answering "how I am doing" in relation to this fucking terrible disease.

People who do not have Narcolepsy will ***never*** truly understand what it is like, period. (Though I'd say people who live with/are very close to someone with it will have at least a better idea, they still will never really "get" what it's like to be essentially running as though you're 72 hours sleep deprived as a baseline.) 

Trying to explain to people "I'm so fucking tired because I am incapable of getting restful restorative sleep ***ever again in my life***" is *exhausting* in and of itself - because people *immediately* try to relate/compare, and go to things like "oh I'm really tired too because I've been really busy/sick/whatever" and it's never going to compare on the same level, and gets so old, honestly. 

When it comes to other issues, again, it depends. I no longer explain that I can't do \_\_\_\_ because of Narcolepsy, and how it is impacting my mental health/how my life is falling apart as a result, because people always come back with, "Well just sleep more!" or "lol I wish I could sleep all the time, that doesn't sound so bad!" 

Non-Narcolepsy related things, like emotional woes, depression, life struggles... If it's someone I trust, I have no qualms telling them how I'm really doing if they are genuinely asking and want to listen. (No need to overshare when someone is just giving a small-talk, "how've you been" type thing.)

Yes, it can be really hard to put yourself back together, but the bottling up of your emotions is only going to make things that much worse.  
No one likes to "fall apart" and feel that energy drain that comes with sharing the tough, deep emotions and struggles they're facing. But it's healthy to share, to vent, and to process - and though it may take some time, you build yourself back up, and can move forward.

If therapy is an option for you, I highly recommend seeking it out. It sounds like you need someone to share with and vent to that is there specifically for that purpose, and who can help you reframe these exhausting, upsetting emotions in a healthy way so you can take a load off and not be carrying the weight of so much pent-up frustration and pain.
Yes, it would. 

With likely nowhere to really start, sending police on a wild goose chase for a bike - that likely looks like every fucking bike until closely inspected, so not exactly an easy find/quick to spot item - across the city through *hundreds* of shitty homeless camps, chop shops, trap houses, squats, RVs, etc. is so obviously a complete waste of time and resources. 
Especially when, if caught, the DA is going to do anything substantial, so they’ll be right back at it in hours. 
And that’s assuming there’s enough evidence to be able to charge/arrest, as the “oh someone gave me this/bought it on Craigslist/from a pawn shop” chain of excuses, while easy to see through, still has to be trumped with actual evidence and following our legal processes. 

Cars and bikes are *everyone’s* transportation. It sucks when they’re stolen, it’s wrong, it seriously hurts the victims, and there should be more that can be done.
But can’t argue devoting what few cops we have to pointless chases like this is not a waste of resources, because it is.

It’s better than *zero* justice. I disagree. 

No one related to this group/article was, say, shooting people point blank in the street for a car they perceived to be stolen. They were locating vehicles and reuniting owners with their much needed, stolen property, that otherwise almost certainly wouldn’t have been taken back. 

That’s exactly the justice I want.
How is someone recovering their stolen car not a good outcome?
Went in there because I actually wanted to watch the show - big animatronics nerd, wanted to see all the presidents - but as a person with Narcolepsy... oof. Just about put me out for the entire day! One minute I was excited, next minute my partner is shaking me awake - it was like magic!
This is definitely a big part of it.

The kind of partner that strictly wants a one night stand/FWB situation and knows *they themselves* will not get attached, not deviate from that "NSA" plan, and be cool to walk away at any time with no turmoil is the kind of partner that won't care if OP is married - and is the kind of sexual partner OP should be looking to find, instead of lying to other women to manipulate them into sex.  
Some may still not go for it because they don't care for the married variable, or don't trust it, or whatever else, but I think a big part of it is that for a lot of people, there is *always* a chance of getting attached, developing feelings, really bonding, and wanting to take it a step further - even if that step is just casual dating.  
With a married man, as in OPs situation, your options are strictly fucking. You're never going to develop a relationship outside of FWB, and it's perfectly reasonable that a lot of people want to leave that door at least open in case something *were* to develop, even if that's not really want they want going in.  


Some may also assume that an extra layer of drama/complication comes with their potential sex partner having a wife. That may not be true for OP, but it's a fair concern, and people are entitled to avoiding that dynamic if they aren't comfortable with it.

Sure, it might take longer and be more difficult to find those strictly-unattached types, but such is life. 

Lying - or omitting - that information is extremely scummy and wrong.

If the person you're lying to wouldn't sleep with you if they knew that information, you shouldn't be sleeping with them, period. This shouldn't even be a question.

No problem! 

Narcolepsy symptoms vary so much person to person that it'll probably be hard to get a conclusive answer one way or another, but it's definitely interesting to see how the symptoms present in different people/how they are connected.

For me, I experience severe sleep inertia every single day. It has been probably a decade, at least, since that wasn't the case, and even then it was extremely frequent - probably one or two days a week where it wasn't "as present" but has been such a constant in my life that it's hard to really remember.

I don't *always* experience HH, despite *always* experiencing sleep inertia. But, I would say that I experience HH a good 85-90% of the time when waking - be that in the morning from an overnight sleep, or from a nap, or when I wake up periodically throughout the night to use the bathroom/wake up briefly at random.   
I also experience a great deal of hypnogogic hallucinations as well, though - not sure if that is *why* I experience HH so much when waking, or if they're related, but figured it worth mentioning.
E-mail sent to the address in the OP! :)
Gotcha!

Your wording kind of left it a bit open, hence why I wanted to clarify! I know a lot of us here take Adderall and have been impacted by the shortages, and are definitely feeling it! 

I definitely haven't seen the Narcolepsy side of it being covered at all - it's all ADHD/telehealth related, which is a bummer, because it seems we have been forgotten about in many ways - something those with Narcolepsy are *very* used to in medicine.   
I'm sorry to hear you're being impacted by the shortages on top of covering them!  
I'd be happy to chat with you if you need an Adderall-taking-Narcoleptic with an Adderall-taking-ADHD partner. Man, these shortages suck all around!
Yep. One of the worst parts of this curse of a disease, in my opinion.

I have next to no short term/working memory anymore. I will forget what I'm doing while I'm doing it, forget facts about myself that should require no thought - phone number, clothing size, etc. - forget what I did 5 minutes ago, all of it.

It'll come on like a flash sometimes - I'll be doing something, and then my mind is gone. Nothing. Empty. Just confusion.

It's getting to the point where I'm starting to plan my life the way someone with early onset Dementia/Alzheimer's would. Seeing as this problem gets worse all the time - on top of my energy levels/sleepiness, which is getting worse all the time, as well - I can only assume that in a few years, I will be beyond the point of being able to maintain any quality of life for myself.

Shit fucking sucks. Wish I could tell you it gets better, or what to do about it, but I can't seem to figure out any relief.

Wish you the best, you're not alone.
I suffer from *extreme* sleep inertia, and also get hypnopompic hallucinations.

Don't know if I get more or less than people who aren't as impacted by sleep inertia, as I have nothing to compare to. I would say 90% of the time, I have both while waking.
To clarify, you're only seeking people who have been impacted by the Concerta/Ritalin/etc. shortage, *not* Narcoleptics impacted by the stimulant shortage as it relates to Adderall?   
(By your post title, I would assume that's the case, but your line "But some people who have narcolepsy are also affected and I want to tell their stories. So here I am!" would indicate maybe you're just seeking impacted Narcoleptics in general, so I wanted to clarify just in case.)

In any event, I'd argue people with Narcolepsy are a *hell of a lot more* impacted than ADHD folks, but that's just a personal take. 

Best of luck with your writing, thank you for reaching out to tell more expanded stories!
Agreed.

Having sex in a common area is *insanely* disrespectful unless you’ve both agreed that you don’t care and don’t have boundaries about it - which is *clearly* not the case here. 
The fact that it isn’t even *your* couch, OP, is so much worse. You clearly have some maturing to do, and need to learn a few lessons in respect. 

She has every right to feel comfortable in the common areas, and not worry about someone else fucking on *her* furniture.
She shouldn’t have to come home to potentially walk in on you fucking in a common area. 
That’s part of living with roommates - keep that shit in your room, or get your own place. 

She has no right to dictate what you do *in your room,* unless you’re disturbing her peaceful enjoyment of her home - meaning after a reasonable hour, she shouldn’t have to hear you engaging in sex/loud music/etc. 

The cameras in a common area is a bit much, but unless illegal, is her right for security/other purposes. 
It won’t be a problem for you if you aren’t fucking on her couch in a common area.
u/JayBloodSage

If you can't be civil and respectful, you won't be here at all.

This is a warning before a ban. Knock it off.
And quite inexpensive if you know where to look! To quite a lot of places, too!

I've noticed the best view, and my personal favorite, of Portland is on your way out, by plane.
This one definitely screamed "some kind of bully breed in there" to me, too
I highly doubt nearly any cocaine people are doing on the “illegal market” is anywhere near the type that this study would’ve been looking at. 

That shit is so stepped on/cut with all kinds of garbage that you’re lucky to be getting any *actual* “cocaine” in it. As such, pretty hard to say *what* out of the substance they used would be responsible for benefitting someone who has done it in the past, or if the perceived benefits outweighed whatever other chaos was going on in the body/actively working against it.

That’s a very interesting study though!
Ha, gotcha! Totally misread what you meant in your post - in a haze of tiredness at like 3am!
As much as I'm happy for anyone who gains awareness of something that may be impacting them, and is motivated to speak with a doctor as a result of these types of posts, it should also be noted that Narcolepsy is relatively rare, takes a generally long and stressful - and possibly expensive process - to be diagnosed, and there are ***many*** other things that cause fatigue, sleepiness, needing extra naps, etc. that should be - and will have to be - ruled out first.

Narcolepsy is not just "taking random naps" or "sleeping at random" - far from it, actually - so hopefully posts like the one you're referencing lead people to do some research and better understand what Narcolepsy really is, outside of the general stereotype! 

&#x200B;

I'm glad you found the sub, OP, if it sounds like something that may be true for you, and I hope you're able to have the conversations you need with a doctor!  
It's a process to figure out, but so worth it in the end.
I *so* wish there was a better, more accurate, more consistent type of test to conclusively diagnose these disorders.

It's bad enough that the sleep study bed is shitty and uncomfortable, the room is foreign/sterile/uncomfortable/difficult to relax in - and potentially loud, bright, too hot/cold, etc. - but *then* you mix in:

* the medical equipment all around you/uncomfortably ***on*** you
* the anxiety of knowing you're being watched
* the anxiety of knowing this test is your best shot at answers ***and*** if you fail you're back to ***nothing*** \- *or* paying for another one, and going through the hell ***again***, *and* possibly losing your medication/having to take more weeks "off" out of your life while you *wait* for the study ***again*** 
* the absolute nonsense that is the naps portion of the test - truly a form of torture
* still adjusting to being off your normal medications, and thus unable to live/function/sleep as you're used to, which definitely impacts your sleep behaviors, often negatively
* just general anxiety, yay!

If you're at all finicky about the conditions of a bed/room when you sleep - or, as I do, have related traumas, which makes it impossible to sleep properly your first few nights in a new place - you're pretty much fucked once you sprinkle that on top of all the above nonsense.

...Oops, /endrant, heh

All this to say - yep. The anxiety sure made me pretty alert, too! I think we can all relate on that one.

Glad you were still able to get an IH diagnosis, and treatment. Hope it's working okay for you!
Bring as many things as you can/need to feel like you're sleeping as you "normally would" - blanket, pillow, eye cover/mask, earplugs, etc.

Within reason, most things *should* be fine/allowed, and it's such a ***fucking awful*** environment that's *nearly impossible* to sleep comfortably/normally in, that anything helps - especially if you're at all like me, and you take a lot to get comfortable.  
Call ahead if you're worried about what is allowed, but you're definitely in the right mindset trying to replicate your "usual" sleep while there the best you kind!
My partner takes stimulant medication - so do I, but I’m not a dude - and I can confidently say it doesn’t have that effect on him at all. 


Which is just to say - meds will hit everyone different, never assume it’s black and white one way or another.
Yep, exactly. 

No race has more of a right to intrude on other people’s quiet enjoyment of their fucking homes with ridiculous behavior. No one *needs* nor has a right to blast music so loud it is disrupting other people’s lives inside their homes. This is a standard that everyone should be held to equally - it’s not discrimination to say “turn your shit down, and keep the noise levels reasonable so the people around you can exist.”

If it impacts certain groups more than others, oh well. Shouldn’t be causing the problem in the first place. This is an issue that *can* be that simple.
Quite frankly, what made me change my mind about organ donation, was witnessing the "process" as a family member of an organ donor.

My step-dad committed suicide last January, but was the "ideal" and "rare" candidate they look for for organ donors, in that he was completely "brain dead," but stable and alive on machines indefinitely.

The organ donor team left a lot to be desired. They came in right away and were almost *excited* to explain the grim details of the process to us, with little bedside manner.They kept him "alive" on machines for an entire fucking week, leaving my mom unable to say goodbye, and afraid to leave the hospital because he could be pulled at any time, and she didn't want to miss the "send off."

Despite the hellish week - other details of which I'll save, it's a long one - when it was all over, she left with nothing but medical bills. I'm of the opinion that if they're going to keep your shell of a loved one "alive" to be fucking harvested for a goddamn week, the least they could do is pay for the cremation, or ***anything.*** I get that this defeats the purpose of "donation" but... my god.They had his body for weeks before they finally called her to arrange to have it transported to a funeral home - with no warning, basically saying if she didn't figure it out in 48 hours, they'd start charging in the hundreds per day. She was literally calling every cremation place in town trying to find one she could *fucking afford* because everything was outrageously expensive, and y'know, her life was just destroyed.

Annnnnyway, I digress.

I am not marked down for organ donation. No thank you, I'm not doing that to my loved ones.

I've read about the body donation problems as well, and definitely won't be supporting that. Such a shame that things are that way!
I mean, Narcolepsy also has "concomitant depression, anxiety, addiction, etc." amongst countless other serious illnesses - and ADHD, too! - so.... 

I get what you're saying, and I'm not saying ADHD can't be severe, but you're not going to fall asleep while driving or drop to the floor and crack your head open.
He clearly cares because he’s asking. Not everyone “enjoys” being peed on, or having someone piss in their bed/room/etc. - which is reasonable and perfectly acceptable to care about.
Right… like if anything, falling asleep uncontrollably/most Narcolepsy symptoms have more severe dangers and consequences than ADHD in a lot of ways… 🤨 
But again, it’s approved for *both,* so 🧐
It’s not “looked at” as a dive bar, it *is* a dive bar. 
Owners market it that way, and the upkeep sure matches. As does the crowd.
You sound like a *lovely* person 🙄
And yet *you* also came from another city to visit there. Hmm. 🙄
🙄🙄🙄

Las Vegas is no more a “cesspool” than anywhere else. You could’ve gotten COVID *anywhere.* Could’ve been positive before you even got into town, and just didn’t quite know it yet. 
It’s a tourist hotspot with things to do, there will no doubt be a higher amount of people, thus increasing risks of illness of any kind - just like any other Meow Wolf location, not specific to Vegas.
Don’t rip on an entire city just because your immune system took a dump there. 👋💁‍♀️
OP “only ever wants him seeing/hearing her like that” 🙄 and thinks this has something to do with modesty.
So I’d guess that you’re right - not quite mature enough nor “ready” enough for adult relationships in the “real world.” 

OP, you’re 18. The guy you’re with now will almost certainly not be the *only* person seeing/hearing you like that, as you’re statistically very likely to break up/part ways eventually due to your ages. 
Sex doesn’t usually get to occur in a soundproof chamber and most humans engage in sex - no one thinks it’s “more modest” or virtuous to make it a hush hush, complicated activity just to feel like you’re “hiding it” as if that somehow makes you look better or more “wholesome.”
… do not move to the pacific NW. 

Wages are still garbage out here, cost of living is stupid high outside of tiny areas, and those high cost of living areas are largely filthy hellscapes. 

No no no.
Honestly, your guess is as good as mine - it boggles my mind why/how places have things like *dog menus* when they *very much* are ***not*** supposed to have dogs inside their establishment, nonetheless eating at them ***at all.*** 

It's definitely something that *should* be enforced, and it's definitely confusing, but I'd guess lack of enforcement - and it not being "high" on the priorities list to put resources into handling strictly - is probably why it has become so widespread/common. 

"Everyone's doing it" is a good enough excuse for a lot of people - in most things in life, not just this, I suppose.

And on the smaller scale, it's hard to expect individual employees to enforce something - especially when patrons often turn sour/escalate a situation - if they don't have anyone/anything "backing them up" so to speak - or if the owner of the business refuses to follow the laws.
It would appear that the code - both Oregon specific, and seemingly in the rest of the country as well - reads that at no point in time should any dog be inside *any* portion of *any* "food establishment" or grocery store at *any* time.

&#x200B;

As it relates to restaurants/grocery stores/bars/places that serve *any* food, Oregon specific code reads:

*(E) Pet dogs may be allowed in outside seating areas of a food establishment under the following conditions:*

*(1) The food establishment prepares written procedures that include:*

*(a) A diagram of the outdoor area to be designated as available to consumers with pet dogs;*

*(b) The establishment’s procedure for assuring that employees do not touch, pet or otherwise handle pet dogs and for immediately cleaning accidents involving dog waste.*

*The procedure must also describe the location of materials and equipment necessary to clean up accidents involving dog waste;*

*and*

*(c) The establishment’s procedure for notifying employees and consumers of the requirements of this paragraph.*

*(2) Pet dogs may not come into contact with serving dishes, utensils and tableware. Pet dogs are also not allowed on chairs, tables and other furnishings.*

*(3) Employees and consumers may not provide food to pet dogs.*

*(4) Pet dogs must be on a leash and under control of the consumer at all times.*

*(5) At no time may pet dogs be permitted to travel through the indoor or non-designated outdoor portions of the food establishment.*

[The entire code, and other related regulations, can be found here.](https://www.oregon.gov/ODA/shared/Documents/Publications/FoodSafety/FoodCode.pdf)

&#x200B;

It sounds like you're courteous and doing your best to follow the rules the best you can, which is awesome. 

I know a lot of places don't enforce any of this, which I'm sure probably makes it that much harder to know what's "actually okay" and what's "being allowed".
*Yep.*

And fortunately it doesn't *need* to be made into an argument of "you hate dogs" or "what's wrong with dogs" because it is ***not legally permitted.*** 

Dogs are *not* allowed inside restaurants, bars, etc. 

***Period.***

Dog-friendly patios are allowed with certain restrictions - which many don't follow, unfortunately - but at ***no*** point in time should a dog be in a bar like pictured in the OP.

It's not a matter of "hating dogs" - they simply don't belong there, and the law agrees.
Yeah, there *absolutely* is, and for good reason.

Dogs are ***not*** allowed *in* restaurants - or any other establishment with food being sold/served/handled.

Dog-friendly ***outdoor only*** patios are allowed to exist, with the rule that employees must at absolutely no point pet/touch or come into any contact with the dog, *and* the rule that dogs are ***not allowed*** on any tables, chairs, any other furnishings, *and* may not come into contact with dishes/utensils/etc.

A lot of these dog-friendly establishments don't follow these rules at all, unfortunately, but they are very clearly laid out in law.

If any Portland restaurant is advertising as dog-friendly in that they allow dogs *inside* the establishment, that's a huge no, and is definitely not permissible in Oregon - or the rest of the country as far as I'm aware.
You don't have to be a "dog hater" to point out that animals are not allowed and don't belong in food establishments.
Please also tell that to seemingly half the bars, restaurants, grocery stores, etc. in Portland, where people inexplicably have dogs - *no*, ***not*** service dogs - inside without a care in the world.
Yes, even if it’s the first time.

This was out of the ordinary - and is not typically something that happens when both partners are enjoying a sexual encounter, this is a *clear* signal that *something* was off. 

She may be wondering why you didn’t check up on her or ask if something was wrong, and have just left it to pass. 

Or, it may have been as little as her being irritable and tired and not as in the mood as she had hoped - and you had thought - in which case she can say that, and you both can move on. 

Adults in adult relationships communicate. This isn’t a big deal, and doesn’t need to be made to be one.
“The other night, was everything okay? Anything you want to talk about - just wanted to check in, is all!” - easy, done.
I mean, my partner and I are *huge* SW fans and we absolutely love Galaxy’s Edge. 

Yeah, we’d love if it wasn’t tied to the sequel trilogy as much - though GE west is doing a good job of bringing in characters that aren’t, which is great - but we still love it there.
I would love this 🥲

I’m pretty indifferent towards the films, but I love Pandora in the park. Such a beautiful and peaceful area - even when crowded - and I really adore both rides.
Thank you for reminding me about their fries! I totally forgot about them! 

They’re pretty simple, but theyre super easy to inhale and the dipping sauce I remember being great. Their pork belly bahn mi is excellent too!
And their ketchup! Something about it when mixed with the truffle oil is so good 🥲
$300 is what I paid for my 3 year old, 14 pound cats cremation - this included a clay pay print, fur clippings, ink paw print, and basic bamboo urn box that is “free” with their cremations. It was about a month from drop off to getting him home, and it was a private cremation. 

Different places will charge different prices, always. 
If you felt respected and treated with dignity and received what you paid for, it was worth the price, IMO.
u/HawtPackage

If you can't be respectful, you won't be participating here at all. This is a warning - that's enough.
I'm *not* sorry to assert that ***no,*** I'm ***not*** going to administer Narcan to a *stranger*, who may attack me/cause me harm/may in someone attempt to hold me liable to the outcome of the event.

Not even a little bit.

I don't *want* people to die, and my attitude isn't "you chose to die, sucks to suck!" but I need to watch out for ***me*** first in this kind of a situation, because *I* am **not** going to die or become seriously injured at the hand of someone else - who in fairness, DID make the choice to get into the situation in the first place.  
That's just called self-preservation.
Thank you! And thank you for the tip! His birthday is early February, so I've been on the extra active hunt for a copy! Really appreciate it! :)
Cooking stinky food *can* and *does* disturb other tenants depending on the building.

Imagine thinking you’re entitled to doing whatever the hell you want in *your* unit without anyone saying anything about it or disturbing you, but not understanding that other people also want that same right and should be able to enjoy it. 

It’s a fine line, and it’s hard to find a balance. But if your activities are making another persons home smell consistently horrible, that’s also *not okay.*
If no one picked up the Blade Runner VHS, please please consider me. I’ve been looking for one for over a year now, my partner treasured his and it somehow stopped working, and he was super bummed, and I’ve been looking everywhere but haven’t been able to find him a replacement. 
Thank you 🥲♥️
What’s your point?

Disney isn’t *exclusively* for kids. It’s for *everyone.* 
And it surely isn’t for entitled parents who leave their shit everywhere like it’s their house. 

Get outta here 👋
Yeah I’m wondering this, as well. 

I never understand how people come here complaining about their sexless/passionless marriages/relationships when they state in their OP how it was almost always this way to some extent. 
If they weren’t sexual with you at the start, what made you think it would be fulfilling for your future? You signed up for this - well, not the cheating with the stripper, that’s another story, but the dead bedroom red flags were waving obviously from day one. 

It clearly hasn’t changed even with years of marriage and therapy.
It won’t change now that she has cheated in front of you.
There is nothing to save. Walk away, or you lose the right to complain.
Why the hell would the response to OPs spouse cheating in front of him, leaving him feeling angry, hurt, confused, and resentful be to *let her go on some dates with someone else* and consider opening the relationship?? 

OP has been mistreated long enough *before* this happened. 
She doesn’t get a pass because it was with a woman and she may have a repressed sexual preference.

OP needs to be done here. If he decides he wants to repair it instead, that happens through counseling, not letting her run off to keep getting her way while he sits waiting for her to be a real partner.
I typically don't keep more than a months rent or two in there at a time - though, these days, that's a few grand :| - as I'm too paranoid, I've never been super well off and can't afford to lose when things go wrong, or numbers get stolen, but I don't keep it sitting at $0 or overdrafted either, so I'm not exactly a high value customer, but I suppose not a "problem client" either.

That's good to know and be aware of, though. Thank you!
Heh, yep I totally worded that weird, not sure how I did that! Definitely don't eat DURING surgery!
It sounds like what I've been told in the past regarding chargebacks is not the case! (And thank you for correcting me!)

I was always told that more than a very rare chargeback here and there made you an "unattractive customer" to your bank, and eventually may lead to them no longer wanting to do business with you. (Not meaning an outrageous amount of fraudulent chargebacks, of course, that's a different story.)

I have only done a few in my lifetime, and haven't really needed to much - fortunately - but I've always been really nervous about ending up in situations where I'd need to because of what I'd been told.

Not that I want to do business with companies I *expect* to *have to* do chargebacks with - common sense would say, "Hey, don't do that" - but there have been times where I've had to spend extra or go through a lot of hassle to buy something from a company with a better policy because I was worried about being screwed if a package was lost/marked delivered but not received or something of that nature, because I didn't want to end up filing a chargeback and looking negative to my bank.
I’ve been told by family who work at banks in relevant departments, as well as by agents at my bank, that though it’s not a “this goes on your permanent record” situation, it is a “negative mark” towards you as a customer - chargebacks, not fraud disputes - and more than a rare chargeback here or there makes you an “unattractive customer” to your bank, which may eventually lead to them no longer wanting to do business with you.

I don't know that to be an absolute fact - and that's awesome if it's not the case, because sometimes a chargeback ***is*** necessary, and when I've had to do it I'm always worried that banks look at it negatively/don't like when customers do it, or that I might lose - because again, I only do it when necessary, and I really don't know enough about it to know what the whole process is.   
I'll have to look into it more, I suppose, I didn't mean to state that as an absolute fact or anything, just what I've been told.

&#x200B;

Also - regardless, I shouldn’t have to file a chargeback with my bank and wait up to *90 fucking days* after a driver steals my food or brings me a completely wrong order. The company should be better about those problems.

Yeah, sounds like OP is either 1. Trolling/creative writing exercise stealing the plot of an actual Law and Order SVU - and no doubt some other CSI type show I’m sure, but I’ve seen the SVU one 😂 - episode plot or 2. It’s his girlfriend setting this insanity up and blaming the ex.
…where exactly are these $30k, livable houses they could’ve bought, because…. Nope, not on this earth.
For whatever stupid as fuck reason, here in Oregon, Medicaid covers an eye exam every 24 months… but doesn’t cover any glasses/prescriptions from that appointment.

*Why the fuck* would you cover the damn appointment only to have the solution *not be an option?!*
Was so fucking pissed hearing the $150 bare minimum it would cost for me to get started remedying what they found. But if I was pregnant it would be covered! 
This country is a joke.
You… are..??
Yeah, was going to say the same thing. 

I’ve had Ubereats/Postmates and DoorDash/Grubhub orders marked delivered - but never arrive with zero communication and no photo - or be the completely wrong order, even be *half eaten* or *soaking wet* and was burned by the company refusing to refund despite very clear and very documented proof that the driver screwed me over. 

I refuse to use any of these services anymore. I only used them in emergencies - super sick, after surgery, etc. - or when traveling and in an unfamiliar area without a car or other options, but it’s just not worth paying the *insane* markup and fees just to be completely fucked over by a company who doesn’t give half a shit about their customers, and have to go through the hassle of a chargeback. 
I imagine banks don’t look kindly on chargebacks, either, so it’s putting a negative “mark” on my account on top of it, so to speak.

Noooooope.
The Instagram page the video came from is trash. The woman clearly thinks very highly of herself and thinks she’s doing real reporting, despite posting a lot of false information/posting speculation as fact before details are confirmed.
She tried to push the Korean church fire as a homeless camp fire that spread, and argued with people in the comments informing her that the person responsible had come forward and it had been all over the news for hours.
She has a lot of really stupid takes and while I agree that Portland is a dumpster fire and a lot of our government nonsense is getting ridiculous… she just ain’t it.
Agreed! I don't think it would have the same feeling/as much impact if I was staying off property - I've done a night at the hotel in MCO, and one in Celebration when flights were delayed, and both days/nights felt very bland and like I was missing something.  
As fun as Disneyland can be, it's just not the same for me, as well - Anaheim is in every direction, you don't have that same separation from the "outside world."

As someone who is disabled and severely chronically ill - that also struggles with depression/PTSD, anxiety, and OCD - I can agree with those who've said that you'll never really know until you get there, but as long as you go in with an open mind, and set your expectations realistically, you're bound to have at least *some* fun.

For me, it feels like Disney is the only place where I can really ever shed the weight of my illnesses, get out of the depression "funk" and truly live a little. (This does making coming home all the more difficult, and it's really hard to process that post-trip depression, but in the end it's worth it to me to get a break from the absolutely godawful city I live in, and all the day to day nonsense of being disabled and having no quality of life.)

This last trip, my energy levels were the worst they've ever been, and we were getting to the parks each day later than ever before.  
At first, I was getting really upset over this - what a waste of trip/money, the trip is going to fly by and I'll have slept through it, etc.  
But I reframed this as "you know what, sleeping half the day in the Polynesian resort, sitting on that beautiful balcony looking out at the most gorgeous resort, and then getting to spend half the day in the parks? Beats anything else I could possibly be doing."

Just be kind to yourself, and allow yourself to rest as needed, stop when needed, and feel whatever emotions come on as they happen.   
I've cried many times on Disney vacations as an adult for many different reasons. The important thing is to let yourself feel how you need, but also don't linger in it. Wipe the tears away, pick yourself back up, and let there still be magic left in the day - one bad moment doesn't have to set the tone for the next hour, evening, day, or rest of the trip. 

Sometimes when I'm in a funk, I find that watching my partner enjoy things really distracts me, too.   
I might not be in the immediate mood to pick an activity and engage in it with full excitement, but if I say, "why don't you pick, I'm fine with whatever" I will no doubt perk up when I see my partner getting really excited over a ride/activity, and see the joy wash over him.

I hope you're able to enjoy the trip, and you and your spouse have a wonderful time! May it lift you from the pain and heaviness, if only for a moment.
There’s literally *human feces* on every corner and trash piles the size of houses everywhere here, so I don’t think the “environmentally conscious” compostable bags really matter at this point. This place is filthy and disgusting.
(And half the dog nuts *don’t* pick up after their dogs, at least anymore, anyway.)
They’ve gone back and forth with having their “China town” flavor wings, sadly, but when they’ve had them, they’re so damn good 🥲 I think about that flavor all the time.

Their loaded fries are great, too! And slushees! Go Dots!
Down here in Portland it is sadly the same. 

Dogs absolutely everywhere, and for whatever reason Portlanders are a special kind of stupid so they’re also all pit bull nuts specifically. 

I swear to god, I see a pit bull in a store every damn time I go out for groceries. Today it was Fred Meyer, huge beast standing in the deli section slobbering on the glass case. 

A new bar/restaurant opened recently nearby, and they have a photo of their huge shitbull *in the restaurant* on their Instagram, confirming they’re dog friendly - great, dogs inside, in an eatery, and the worst breed no less! 

It’s unreal how dog friendly Oregon and Washington are, and it’s awful. 
I’m so tired of these things being absolutely everywhere. 
Last I checked, I didn’t choose to get a dog - so why is there a barking, shitting dog everywhere I turn? 
I wouldn’t care if people chose to have them if they weren’t constantly being made my problem - loud as hell everywhere I go, jumping on me, running at me, etc. 

Get me out of here 🥲
Narcolepsy Type 2 - I take IR Adderall during the day, and Hydroxyzine Hydrochloride at night.

&#x200B;

Without *any* medication, I will sleep until something prevents me, and then go right back to sleeping. I might wake up to use the bathroom, or get up to eat/shower if pestered enough/the environment is loud/bright/uncomfortable enough, but I will immediately go back to sleep after, and will be in a zombie-like state the entire time, feeling immense mental and physical pain.  
I will turn off alarms in my sleep without ever knowing it, and won't wake up to any if they *do* go off anyway. 

Without Adderall, but with the Hydroxyzine, I will be much the same as zero medication, but will sleep harder, feel worse upon waking, and may not be able to be woken up no matter how hard someone tries.

With Adderall but ***not*** Hydroxyzine, I experience a lot more of the insomnia side of Narcolepsy. 

* It will take me longer to fall asleep at nighttime - when I get into bed with the intention of sleeping for the night - but I will still be exhausted throughout the day and easily able to nap and drift off at inappropriate times. So it helps me fall asleep quicker than without, though only if I "shut down" and let myself fall asleep the *second* I feel the drowsiness. If I stay awake too long after taking it, it will lose that effect.
* I get really bad anxiety in the evenings when I lay down for rest, which is what this medication is meant to target. It makes me a bit drowsy, but doesn't knock me out, and I find I stay asleep for longer/get up less throughout the night with it. Without it, I will get up 10 times throughout the night easily, use the bathroom, and take anywhere between 10-20 minutes to fall back asleep. I tend to feel more restless at night without it.
* I will sleep for an average of 10-12 hours with Adderall only, no hydroxyzine. With it, I will sleep an average of 10-14 hours a night. Sometimes it makes my sleep inertia worse, and often it is much harder for me to get out of bed in the morning. I don't usually feel more or less rested either way, so it's more that it helps me fall asleep faster/stay asleep without getting up as often.

Adderall doesn't really impact how long I sleep at night. Its been a looooong time since I felt it really had much effect on how exhausted I am throughout the day - without it, I'm useless, and my brain is complete soup 100% of the day, whereas with it, I can at least function on automatic behaviors, and maybe be functional 1-3 hours a day.

I have ***maybe*** 1-3 "working hours" - meaning, hours where my brain works and I can do ***anything***, not hours at a job - a day if I'm lucky.   
When I first wake up, my brain is soup. I'm in physical and mental pain, I'm exhausted, everything is a fuzzy, fatigued mess, and that damned sleep inertia is ***painful***. Sometimes I make it out of bed and to the couch/into the shower, but I am a zombie for the first 2-4 hours of the day no matter what I'm doing - I can do little more than stare at my phone/eat/shower/sit around.

I then maybe get 1 to 3 - 4 if I'm really lucky - hours where I can do anything of value. I still feel exhausted, physically heavy, in pain and fatigued, but at least I can make some phone calls, go to the store, answer an email, etc.   
I wouldn't say I'm alert, awake, or very attentive during, but I'm not brain-soup/useless, either.

Then after that, I'm back to zombie. I can feel my brain start to slow down. The fatigue and brain fog gets thicker and heavier. Everything feels worse and takes longer to do. I become more scatterbrained and it's harder to focus or prioritize or do tasks. I lose all motivation.

Then, when it's time for bed, I either take the Hydroxyzine, lay in bed and wait for it to "kick in" enough to drift off, sleep 10-12 - sadly sometimes 14 - hours, and repeat, or I lay in bed and take HOURS to fall asleep despite being painfully aware of how tired I am, and how much more tired I'm becoming.

I'm grateful for my Adderall, because without it I get 0 "working hours" but damn does it feel hopeless most of the time. 

This disease is a curse. There are no positives here. Fuck Narcolepsy.
Thank you <3 

I'm sorry for your loss, as well - time may pass, but it always stings! - orange kitties are always so special!  
Thank you for sharing! They sound like such a special pair. 

It's hard to imagine losing one of a bonded pair - you can't explain to them what happened like you can a human, not that that makes it any "better" but at least there's hope for understanding.   
If only we could find a way for them to live forever!
Sorry for the late reply - first off, thank you so much for taking the time to comment! I really appreciate it :)

&#x200B;

It's funny - our cat tree is right next to the kitchen - we rent a townhouse with what they called an "open concept floorplan" downstairs, so essentially just a long single rectangular room from kitchen to front door for the downstairs level - because it's the only real place to put it, and they spend 99% of their day sleeping on it, climbing it, etc.   
Our lady kitten doesn't care about climbing the cabinets at all, but kitten in my post is a bit more of a goober and wants to climb ***everything.***

I think part of it is that I made a huge mistake and unintentionally trained him that going up there is a good way to get attention/possibly treats, because I used to try to coax him down with them when I'd catch him. Oops!

Do you have any recommendations for rubber spikes, by chance? Unfortunately the kitchen is pretty large, and there's a ton of counter/cabinet space, so it might be a bit of an undertaking to cover them, but that seems like a good bet.

The gate would be great, but given the "open" floorplan, there's just nowhere to do it without building a literal great wall, sadly 

My thought was maybe storing boxes of some kind that fill the entire upper cabinet space so there's no gaps/room for him to jump up/hang out, but I wonder if that would be effective on its own.
Oh, totally - I didn't mean to imply sex was *only* vaginal penetration/contact.

I was more coming from a place of, if you're going to be stupid and say "nope, no birth control or abortions ever, hell no!" it's *probably* best at their age to just straight up avoid ***any*** sexual contact, because it's a "slippery slope," and like OP said, they tend to be very impulsive. (And then there's the risk of semen/vaginal contact through various other activities, which again, too impulsive/dumb to use condoms, possibly too dumb/impulsive to not let that happen.)

Totally agree with your message to OP, as well!
Of course, if my response helped at all, I'm glad!

I appreciate your respectful responses to my comments - you're not trying to be argumentative, and you're receptive to what people have to say, and that alone tells me you're probably a pretty good kid with a good road ahead of you!

You're young - mistakes happen. We've all been young and impulsive once - hell, some folks take a loooooong time to grow out of it - but there's a reason that sex and birth control can get pretty "serious" - it's not just a "oops" when a mistake happens, it could be an entire human life.   
I promise you, you ***do not want*** nor are you in any way prepared for or should you be having a child at 14 - or anytime in the near future, maybe even the next decade or more.   
I won't judge your religious beliefs and choices, but lets just say, if you're going to "break the rules" and have premarital sexual activity, you'll really thank yourself later for breaking them a little more with contraception - and besides, condoms help with STDs, too! 

Anyway, I'll leave you alone, heh - you get it. I wish you the best going forward, and applaud you for coming here and asking and chatting with folks instead of just throwing caution to the wind and saying, "fuck it" - pun intended!
We can agree to disagree. I don’t care for either of those rides, and Universal is still extremely lackluster to me.
They’re not beating Disney at their own game - they’re not even in the same realm to me. 
They don’t create the same experiences nor to the same level *to me.* 
I’m more excited for Tron than a single thing Universal has on the table right now, or Hagrids/Velocicoaster. 
I don’t care how “long” Disney is taking to bring these things to the table, their parks offer me a better overall value and atmosphere.
It’s not a competition of who releases the most things.
Unfortunately it only takes *one* time for her to end up pregnant. 
You’re young, but that doesn’t mean you have to be impulsive and stupid - the fact that you’re asking here and are concerned about it shows that you’re smart enough to know you’re playing with fire and that this is dangerous. Listen to that instinct and stop making life-alteringly bad choices. 
She can ask 1,000 times - the answer is *absolutely not* unless there is at least one form of birth control being properly used. Otherwise you should go into it expecting that at the end, she’ll be pregnant, and the next thing you know you’ll have a baby on the way that you are financially and legally responsible for. 

Sex is fun, and it doesn’t have to be a scary ordeal. But unless you’re using contraception and being safe about it, it can ruin your life, her life, and the life of a potential unplanned, unwanted child. 
Please do better for yourself - and any lady you’re with - and use condoms, at minimum, every time.
They don’t just protect against pregnancy - you don’t want an STD either.
If you don’t “believe” in birth control or abortions, you either need to abstain 100% from *any* sex 100% of the time, or you *best believe* you’re going to be having unplanned children. 

It’s not a matter of politics or faith. 
If you don’t want to become pregnant - or get someone pregnant, unsure if you’re male or female - your only options are to *not have any sex, period,* or to be *smart* and *safe* and use contraception.

If you’re “so Catholic” that abortion and birth control are out of the question, premarital sex should also be off the table. You don’t get to pick and choose what you feel applies to you for your own enjoyment and then claim religion as your reasoning for not practicing safe sex. 
There are no other *real, trusted* alternatives - condoms at minimum, ideally combined with other birth control methods are *the only way* to *truly* practice safe sex. 

By all means, *please* refrain from having *any* sex whatsoever if you’re unwilling to “believe” in birth control - or abortion should it fail.
Some people love it, it’s worth trying it just to say you’ve done it, but personally I think it’s awful 😅

I’m really big about the story of a ride. I don’t care how thrilling it is - if the story is bad, it’s *not* a good ride. 
And *boy* is the story dumb as hell and seems very lazily thrown together on DCA Guardians. 

The Collector’s archive area is *fine,* but it’s honestly the only area of the entire queue that seems to have had *any* level of work put into it, and after you’ve seen it once it looks cheaper and lamer every time. 

The outside queue area is bad, and frankly I feel like the tower facade is hideous and looks like a bunch of garbage glued to a computer tower. It’s a *mess,* and looks terrible from so many angles. 
The area replacing the boiler room is honestly *hilariously* bad. So lazy and literally looks like a toddler did it. Awful. 

The drop sequences *are* more “thrilling,* I’ll give it that. But the random screens are… boring and lazy. The doors open to random shots of the Guardians doing things - always looking *extremely* bored, and there’s no real cohesive story movement to whatever they’ve got going on.
There’s no real sense of urgency for a ride called “Mission Breakout” and it’s painfully lackluster despite the attempts at making it more fast-paced with the drop changes. 

Then you exit to a *very* uninspired gift shop, and again to the equally uninviting concrete hellscape that is Avengers Campus. 


I don’t *hate* Marvel by any means but MAN are there so many misses in DCA, starting with the Tower. 
I sincerely hope they leave it alone in WDW. It frames the area so well, and that “old Hollywood” vibe is timeless and classy - Marvel may be popular, and I’m not saying they don’t have *any* place in *any* of the parks, but Cosmic Rewind is more than enough IMO, giving a similar treatment to Studious would be an insane mistake.
It’s honestly awful at DCA 🥶🥲

 I specifically went out to DCA to say goodbye in late 2016 and it hurt. My heart skips a beat in fear anytime I see WDW’s Tower in an article 😭 Please leave it alone! Nothing good will come of any changes.
🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️

It’s *super* cramped and the crowd management/flow is pretty awful. It’s also just not as big of a draw for me in general. Not a comparison - but that’s just *for me.* The atmosphere just isn’t there like it could be.
I don’t believe you’re *supposed to* be parking strollers there, but try telling entitled Disney parents to move their strollers 🙄🙄 The worst
Yeah, cool, I guess.

It’s still Universal 🥶

I just really don’t care for or about Universal *at all.*
It’s not even a competition, to me - they aren’t on the same level as Disney, don’t interest me and have no major draws for me in the way Disney does, and the value simply isn’t there for me.

I love Area 15 - where the LV experience will go - but this isn’t a draw for me there, I’m indifferent to haunted houses and frankly Area 15/Vegas are expensive enough as is, so this will be a definite pass, as Omega Mart/other offerings will certainly still be more attractive. 

The Texas “park” is for young kids, that announcement left my brain as fast as I read it. 

Personally I find it kind of tiring to read the same “look at all that Universal is doing!!!1!1!1!!1! New park!!! Rides!1!1!!1 Disney has only opened a couple in that time!!1!1!1!” comments. 
It’s not a “one to one” competition - Universal can open 50 things to every 5 Disney opens, that doesn’t mean they’re better quality, “beat” Disney somehow, or take value away from Disney parks. 

I think there’s a good chunk of us that Universal just doesn’t “connect” with/do enough for, and that doesn’t seem like it’s going to change.

For those that like Universal, I’m glad you are getting new offerings, though! Please check out the rest of Area 15 - especially Omega Mart and Wink World - instead of just skipping over to the haunted section.
What do you mean by “they’re doing Omega Mart”? 

No, Universal is not “doing Omega Mart.” 

Nothing is changing with OM.

This Universal “experience” won’t be open anytime this year.
Yep, thank you. 

While I feel for anyone who had to deal with Pole, I don’t get the feeling that Karine is some innocent, stable woman who would’ve been a good example of parenting had he not caused “100% of the problems.” 

Sure, being an OF creator, or “makeup influencer” doesn’t make you a *bad parent* automatically, but you get the picture of the type of person she is here - and you can’t pretend he was *forcing* her to do OF content when she’s spending her time trying to be a content creator/influencer herself on her own. 

Shacking up with some bachelor weirdo - who frankly had *more than enough* info about his ways out there, she doesn’t get to play naive - on top of this doesn’t exactly paint the “stable mom doing anything she can to get her kids back, which is her main priority” picture people keep trying to sell. 
If she’s *that* worried about custody - so worried we need to sympathize and give her our money through donations to help out - you’d expect her to be taking *real* steps to achieve that, instead of whatever wannabe influencer mess she’s got going on now.
The thing is, if Disney would hypothetically be removing Aerosmith due to, let’s say, “issues” with members/history/music content - in attempt to be more “safe” - KISS and AC/DC certainly wouldn’t be on the table either.
Yep, this is my only hard “don’t touch it” right now. After they ruined California’s Tower, I will lose my mind if they touch WDW’s - especially as it was always the superior version, to me.
It’s such well done theming, from the walk up the street, to the queue… it’s such a timeless, classy theme overall that really ties the entire area together, and it *will not* benefit from some “modern” retheme or overhaul - *especially Marvel.* Leave it ALONE.
People don’t want to accept this, but it’s absolutely a fact. 

A lot of these people would absolutely destroy whatever housing you give them, much like they do everything else they come in contact with. 
They’d be doing all kinds of illegal shit from this hypothetical “housing” and it would become a filthy, drug-littered biohazard full of stolen goods. 

I’m not saying we don’t need to help with housing for *anyone* but continuing to parrot “housing first!!!1!1!1!1!” if ignoring the very real core problems we’re facing that have everything to do with mental health problems and drug abuse.
Haha, no worries! Just wanted to make sure you knew - and clarify if you were planning pre or post Houston opening in case anyone chimes in with ideas!


Personally I feel like that would be a bit intense of a road trip, but would also be a ton of fun to attempt!


I would want to spend 2 days at each location - to be able to really take it all in, participate in the stories, and not feel rushed - at least, personally, so that would make for a long trek if trying to do it all across one vacation.
If you’re waiting for Houston to open in this hypothetical, there will be *five,* not *four* locations to consider.
Couldn’t tell if you meant pre-Houston opening or not.
I wonder what she considers to be “the real problems.” 


Like, hmm… did she forget about that time where she put a random Postmates driver on blast by posting their photo and accusing them of theft of *fucking food* - who’d have guessed 🙄 -  causing them to receive death threats and endless harassment, when nothing even close to theft occurred? 


Right Lizzo, the *real* problems. Mkay.
Ha, I *saw* him at the Rainbow once back in late 2016. 



Was in a booth grabbing a drink and he was in the middle of the room at a table being interviewed by some younger looking dude who was holding a dildo. Camera people were walking around the room and recording everyone sitting around, which was uncomfortable because I was just trying to snack and grab a few rounds and didn’t want to end up in some recording somewhere.
I’ve tried to find the video, but never was able to.
1. I hate kids. Genuinely. Cannot stand to be around them *at all* for any length of time. Don’t enjoy it, don’t want to do it, and hearing kids be loud in a public place sets me off so quickly I don’t see it changing. 
Frankly, kids don’t seem to love me either - it’s like I don’t talk to them in the right “tone” or lap up their dumb shit enough, I don’t know. 


2. I simply can’t afford it. Kids, in this economy? Absolutely not. 


3. Even if I could afford it, I’d never waste my time and money like that. I’d like to enjoy what of my life I can. Kids would suck any chance of that up real fast. Freedom to travel, live on my own schedule, do things the way I need to… not giving that up. 


4. This world sucks. I barely survive each day at this point. I wouldn’t bring another life into this willingly. 


5. I have severe health problems I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. I wouldn’t want to risk passing those on, and I wouldn’t want to make them insanely worse by having a kid and having to use what tiny bits of energy I don’t have often to care for it. I’m maybe functional 1-3 hours a day at this point. It wouldn’t work out. 



6. My partner doesn’t *hate* kids but he doesn’t like them or want them either.
I have *extremely* severe Narcolepsy, it simply isn’t possible. 

Not only do I simply not have the energy - or *any* energy *ever* for that matter - the fact that I am incapable of *ever* actually having restorative sleep means that the pain and stress it would put on my body is that much more excruciating, and I simply don’t recover. 
It’s actively harmful for me to even attempt. 

Fortunately I have always been on the thinner side, I guess. But between other chronic illnesses and the awful life stealer that Narcolepsy is, I just can’t be any kind of active.
Ooooof. 


Luckily my pair are only 8 months old right now, but this is just not something I have the capacity to think about, and I don’t know how I’ll ever manage it. 


They’re so insanely bonded, and I just can’t imagine what that’ll be like for one of them, nonetheless for us having to process the loss at the same time. 


Nothing has hurt quite the way tragically losing my fuzzy orange best friend summer of 2022 has, and without these two I’d still be a very lost, cold, lonely mess of a person. This is my first time with two cats at the same time and I just never even thought about that eventual scenario where one outlives the other. 
Nope nope not fun!
Never said anyone was. Reading comprehension may be a solid goal for 2023, for you.
I believe in a lot of places, legally they can't require a sick note for 2 days or less - this is dependent upon state/city, of course.

I 100% agree, though - why would you want your employees to risk coming in sick, thus risking other employees falling ill as the disease spreads through the business? And why would you want an employee who doesn't feel well/up to the task of working representing your business to customers, handling tasks in the workplace, etc.?

I've never understood the way some workplaces treat employees - like they're kids in middle school that can't behave and won't do anything unless forced.

We're fucking ***adults***.

If I say I'm sick and can't work, I'm sick and ***I can't fucking work*** \- doesn't matter *what* I'm sick with, I'm not going to perform today, and you shouldn't *want* to try to force me when I have already assessed it isn't going to happen in a satisfactory way. Let me get some fucking rest.

And yep - why burden a doctor? A doctors note is something you give a principal or teacher in grade school. Fuck outta here.
The way it reads to me is that if you don't bring a sick note - explaining the days you called in sick prior to returning - with you *when you return* from your days home, you will be sent *back home.*

&#x200B;

Which like... yeah, is pretty ridiculous...

But hey - I *always* want to be at home, and *never* at a job, so by all means, send me *back* home!

Chances are if I was home sick, I still feel like shit when I'm coming back, anyway.
I'm telling you, for a ***goddamn fact***, **no**, it has ***never*** cost me $7k or ***anywhere near*** it in a year.

Uncomfortably poor people tend to know their ***exact*** finances down to a penny 100% of the time. *We* don't get the luxury of a choice. 

I sure as *fuck* know how much my car costs me - it costs me exactly as much as I think, budget for, and knowingly spend. Thanks.

I'm not saying 100% car dependence should be "built into society" and forced upon everyone. Never said that.

But it's ignorant and all kinds of plain wrong to assume that some people don't need to be able to drive places, and cars are not some "great evil" that we can all just eliminate and be better for.

There's *absolutely* no way I will *ever* be ***able*** to take public transit again in my lifetime no matter how much "better" the access is to housing/doctors/workplaces/etc.

Life is not that black and white and there are many legitimate reasons - even with a more transit-friendly infrastructure - that many will *need* to drive.

I'm not arguing against better transit and better infrastructure for those who can't or choose not to drive. I think those are greats things - we agree there.

But this "cars are evil, people who drive are bad/ignorant/dumb" attitude on this subreddit is ridiculous, delusional, and needs to stop.
They both look - and ***are*** \- godawful, but damn, Darcey looks ***a lot*** worse than Stacey these days, somehow. Those under eyes, my god!

I forgot they had a spinoff, what a shame. These narcissists don't deserve screen time, and maybe if we stopped giving it to them, they'd eventually look at themselves and get some *real* therapy.
“Wait, you say you live in America? In *California?!* …Have you ever heard of a money order…? I think I’m in love. I know this is crazy, but… would you marry me?”
Right? 

I mean, I get people need the hours - well, the *pay* - but the whole “___ gets you sent home” boggles my mind anytime I’ve seen it. 

I’d much rather be at home, especially if I’m sick/have been sick - make my day! 

And if corners have been cut and things have been tough due to shortage of staff… why are you sending staff home for every single little thing?
Not for everyone it doesn’t. It’s never cost me even close to $7k a year to have a car, and I’ve been poor and disabled my entire life, thanks. 
Some can’t afford to live close to their jobs and doctors - and aren’t privileged enough to have those be located on functional public transport routes either - and have no choice but to drive a shitty beater to get where they’re forced to go. 
But sure, fuck cars!! They’re never useful or necessary!  Yeah!! Evil!!

*Seriously.* 
I’m so sick of all the car hate on this subreddit. People here are delusional, self-absorbed, anti-poor, and ableist - especially when it comes to cars/the need to drive. 
It shouldn’t come as such a shock or insult that some people *have to* drive, or have different needs that can’t exclude driving. 
And frankly, with all of the Max attacks/happenings, no one should catch *any* grief for saying they don’t feel comfortable subjecting themselves to the unhinged wild card that is the Trimet transportation experience.

The whole “lol fuck cars people are so attached to driving they’d drive to take a shit!” nonsense is really pathetic. Grow up.
Careless square is a good way to refer to downtown *already.*
A carless square isn’t exactly going to do this for most people, though. It certainly doesn’t suddenly make downtown more appealing.
I’m so sorry for your loss, OP. Please be kind to yourself. I wish you the best in your grieving journey, and the safest of travels out of town. May 2023 improve despite this loss, and may you come out of it stronger and feeling at peace with yourself.
Not who you were responding to, but wanted to chime in anyway...

I would *not* tell them openly that it was you who complained unless you are faced with a situation where you legally have to identify yourself.

They may seem relatively normal, and like the "keep to themselves" types, but you **never** *really* know someone, especially when their lifestyle is being threatened, or the possibility of legal trouble - court, letter from the city, continued visits from law enforcement, fines, etc. - is on the table.

People that let their pets get *this* intrusive on the lives of those around them don't give a fuck about *anyone* but themselves.

These types of people feel that they are more entitled to having an unruly pet than *anyone* around them is entitled to having *any* quiet enjoyment of their homes. 

That alone should tell you that these aren't polite, reasonable, decent people - if they turn out to be, and it only takes 1 or 2 minor complaints to see a change, count yourself lucky and be glad, but don't expect this or assume it's the norm.

 Chances are there will be pushback - either straight up ignoring the requests/complaints, or worse - and there's zero reason to label yourself as the "bad guy" when you don't have to.

I would stay as anonymous as possible in every way, shape, and form for as long as you can. You don't want some pissed off neighbor causing problems for you - having their mutt fuck up your yard, retaliation of any kind, false cop calls *on you*, verbal confrontations, etc.
Yep, this is a big one for me. 

I'm so, so sick of the "disabled isn't a bad thing!!!" toxic positivity attitude. 

That's great if for ***you*** you've found a way to cope with your disability that includes a positive outlook, and have found a way to manage it to where it *isn't* a serious detriment to your life. I'm *stoked* for you if you're *privileged* enough to be able to look at the "positives" and find things that your disability does/causes/impacts you that you find to be good or something you appreciate - I'm having a hard time wording this in a way that makes sense, but essentially when people go, "I love \_\_\_ about my disability, it makes me more quirky/creative/etc." or "if I wasn't disabled I wouldn't be \_\_\_\_ and I love that quality."

Or like you said - the "being disabled isn't a big deal if you have the right outlook/handle it the right way!" crowd.

I'm not trying to rip on people who are able to have that positive outlook and maintain that kind of positivity for themselves.   
That's awesome.  
I wish it were honestly possible for it to be like that for me, truly.

But man, this shit ***fucking sucks.*** 

I would give ***anything*** not to be disabled. 

I have ***no*** quality of life. I ***never*** will. I know this to be fact, there's no fun, positive way to spice it up and change it into a motivating, inspiring story. It is what it is, and it ***fucking sucks.***

Give me the benefit of understanding I know my situation better than anyone else, have assessed it perfectly, and have earned the right to be bitter, upset, negative, in pain, and thoroughly sick of being disabled.

I don't find having a disability cute, positive, something that makes me "me" - it's an uphill battle I rapidly lose every day that causes me endless problems and makes me absolutely miserable. There's no adding sugar and sprinkles to that. It's not an "outlook" thing.
This made me cackle 🤣 Who knows, maybe they love a high chair!
This. 

*Please* supervise the *children,* OP. 

It’s easy for kids to get caught up in these types of environments and behave in ways that make it really unpleasant for everyone else, who also paid quite a bit to be there - many of whom may have flown from out of state. 

*Please* do not leave them unattended. I don’t care how “well behaved” you may think they are. The worst part of my Omega Mart visit was loud, rude, entitled 12-14 year olds literally *running* around the exhibits, seeing what they could get away with, etc.
u/darkenfolk, 

That’s *enough.* If you can’t behave maturely and respectfully, you won’t be participating here at all. Consider this a warning before a ban, this level of disrespect and aggression towards other users is unacceptable.
Frankly, bringing a dog to *any* park - that isn’t specifically a *dog park* - is a dick move. 

Kids and adults alike who are afraid of dogs, have been traumatized by them, or frankly just don’t like them shouldn’t have to put up with them at non-dog specific parks.
They’re obnoxious at best and hazardous at worst.
Super interested! Chronic illness means I can rarely leave the house anymore and simply am not safe walking the neighborhood for exercise but desperately need a way to get my blood pumping and get active again! Doing so from home would be a godsend! 
Thank you for offering regardless - love seeing the buy nothing group thrive for everyone!
This surprises me! I was there a few weeks back, and it was being OVER policed. Person was literally walking up to the car with their bags, vehicle had JUST pulled up, being screamed at and threatened with a ticket already instantaneously. They were getting way too aggressive with literally every car there, none of which were doing what you described.

That sucks! They definitely should be keeping more on top of it if that kind of thing is happening again. Tough to balance, I'm sure. Sorry you've been experiencing that.
Done! Best of luck
I mean, in a way, it is.

If you're a criminal asshole who is stealing from innocent people, and are out endangering the lives of countless innocent people using said stolen vehicle, with zero care for yourself and others, "karma" *is* having your ability to continue to do so taken from you when you're being reckless.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. I'm glad it was him that died, and not the countless innocent folks he chose so selfishly to put in danger with these actions. I'd rather it be him than an innocent bystander who was killed while he recklessly sped down the road.
I don’t know, I personally don’t value some asshole who steals from other innocent people, recklessly endangers countless innocent lives, etc. on the same level as most “human lives” - but that’s just me 🤷‍♀️
It’s truly just going to keep getting too expensive to be alive, isn’t it? 


This increase might not seem like a lot for some, but *any* increase is crippling, for others. 


When you don’t have any other option, and can’t just “find cheaper elsewhere” - and will automatically lose any home you rent by not actively affording the utility - eventually you’re just stuck at “well… can’t afford to be alive anymore really, can I?” 

Love it.
Did they used to have more flavors? I remember this spot as a kid, and in my mind, they had a few more flavors than this. A melon one comes to mind specifically.
It doesn’t make you a sociopath to *not like dogs.*


Poisoning animals is fucked up and wrong - no matter the species. That’s the takeaway here.
u/AFishNamedFreddie,

If you don't have anything nice to say, don't comment. This isn't constructive criticism, nor is it respectful, and it won't be tolerated here.
Same. 

I get that the rain is “good.” 

It’s still disgusting out the majority of the year here - especially now that summers are less and less mild and come with fires and heat waves - and the wet, cold, windy darkness is depressing and awful.

You can be happy for the benefits of the rain and still absolutely hate it. Jfc.
My one fear is that a retheme of Rock n’ Rollercoaster will bring a greater retheme to the area and be the end of days for the Tower of Terror. 
The coaster area is already a bit of a mess IMO and it will be hard to do a major rebrand that feels cohesive with the Tower area and also pushes some IP - which is all Disney seems to care about these days, IPs everywhere! 
I have absolutely nothing to base this on - aside from past experiences with Disney and their bad retheming decisions - but I greatly fear they will tie the two together eventually and a major change for one will mark the final timeline for Tower before they absolutely ruin that beautiful timeless attraction.

I do agree the coaster could use a faceless at least, retheme at best.
Agreed! I have the Brother LB5000S, and started out on it, and though it has a limited hoop size, it’s great for making patches and getting the techniques down as a beginner.
This right here. Came here to say similar.

I don’t give a flying fuck which people use. Say whatever you want, I have *much* much more important things to worry about than nitpick over language. What a tiny, unimportant thing to waste energy on - as if I have any to spare. 

All I remotely care about is that the person addressing or referring to me is being respectful. And frankly, if they aren’t, I don’t have the energy to give a shit then, either.
u/Big-Replacement-9202,

Consider this a warning - r/Smite is not the place for politics/these types of topics or debates. Getting into a bicker session with other users about "TERFs" has nothing to do with Smite - and will be removed as such - and telling a user to argue with you via DM doesn't qualify as respectful, polite conversation, either.

If you don't have anything nice to say, just don't engage. Thank you.
u/Biwrecksual, that's enough.

Keep the arguing and general nastiness to yourself, this isn't the place for it.

Likewise, this is *not* the place for arguing about "conservatives" or steering ***any*** conversations to ***any*** topic **unrelated to Smite** \- "TERFs", politics, etc. are *not* considered Smite related topics, and steering conversations to these off-topic directions will be removed.

I suggest in the future you refrain from commenting on how "happy" you will be that other users will "die alone" - this isn't considered civil, respectful behavior, and in the future will lead to a temp ban. If you have a problem with another user, report it to the mod team, and disengage. 

Thank you!
Does your landlord live in the same unit as you or something?? This sounds over the top and beyond what a lease can enforce, oof. 
Hopefully one day you’ll have a place with more freedoms! Good luck with the kitty proofing - it’s so hard sometimes, all the things “cats hate” sometimes become their favorite things!
You’re joking, right? Tell me you’re joking.
I had to make an allowance for this as well. The main OMAD site everyone links goes into why diet soda is “big bad” but I can’t drink coffee or tea for caffeine - all kinds make me feel sick and jittery - and need the small doses to survive - I’m Narcoleptic, this is a non-negotiable part of my day, I need *something* to survive. 

I’d say as long as you aren’t downing 10 a day, you’re good. We all have different needs and dislikes, and as long as you’re noticing the results you’re happy with, you’re good.
OP threw a tantrum - ran outside to the beach at 11 at night expecting him to follow her like a child, they didn’t talk for 2 days, etc. - and has now *thrown away a bunch of her clothes* over an offhand, not-that-big of a comment about her attire after a long travel day. 
Sure, husband might not have been kind and tactful, but OP is acting like a petulant child over it, and I wouldn’t exactly be rushing to try to make it up to someone who has this big of an overreaction to something most adults would’ve maturely addressed together *long* ago.
 Couldn’t agree more. 

OP sounds not all right herself with this massive overreaction. Google isn’t anyone’s best source for this kind of thing, and it shows that there was major lack of care and empathy from her towards her husband to take some online results and decide to turn on him. 
 Immediately jumping to “he’s a monster and I’m no longer viewing him as the father of my *precious babies* I need to *protect*” 🙄🙄 says she’s either got serious issues herself, was already looking for an out and has found an easy scapegoat, or a mix of the two.
“Attention: Too many employees are calling out during a period of particularly hazardous weather, which also happens to be falling during a time of year where illnesses tend to run rampant. 
To deal with this, we are going to make it outrageously difficult to keep your job/avoid being deemed fireable for insubordination - which would only make us short more employees, but that’s not *our* fault! 
We are also going to put *everyone* at an increased risk of falling ill by making it near impossible for sick workers to stay home. Hope a widespread outbreak doesn’t completely destroy our ability to operate! Merry Christmas!”
At the time, OP had no concrete evidence that he was on fake phone calls, for one.

Second off, humiliating your partner like that is pretty childish and petty. A confrontation about his behavior can occur between the two of them on their own time - mature adults don’t make a huge display out of it in front of everyone else, shifting the attention off the holiday party to their own drama. 

Anyone agreeing with that type of nonsense is outing themselves as a bratty child. This isn’t a sitcom - handle your personal relationship business elsewhere, and ideally with more grace than this BS.
For what it’s worth, an emotionally mature person doesn’t snoop through a partners phone and then commit to being dishonest about it. OP isn’t checking a lot of the “emotionally mature adult” boxes here either.
Ship is the best all year round! ♥️
Doubt it! She still can’t and won’t admit she was a serious abuser and I doubt she’s done the therapy and work needed since she stills seems self-obsessed and unwilling to own just how wrong she was. 

I don’t care how much of a physical “glow up” she went through, or what degree she “earned” - doesn’t make her any less of a toxic abuser, and that doesn’t just “go away” because you act nice and look pretty on Instagram. 
When I see people who endlessly support her… says a lot about the person, honestly.
Alternatively, I’ve *never* gotten a FedEx package on time, and those assholes ignore signature requirements and leave packages wherever the hell they feel like it - and with absurdly incorrect tracking - and then claim they’re not responsible for whatever happens to your shit despite never once making sure it gets to you in a timely, secure fashion - and you’ll be lucky if it isn’t broken, I’ve watched them throw my boxes like footballs on my doorbell camera.
Fuck FedEx. Not worth the gamble.
I was shocked that my mail - and UPS as well - came today, I was pretty sure when it started getting icy last night I could guarantee it wouldn’t be happening today. I think most will have expected this as well. 

I’m super grateful my mailman made the trek. I get my prescriptions by mail, if it hadn’t come today, I’d be absolutely fucked until after Christmas - Tuesday is when delivery starts up, right? - and it would’ve destroyed me this weekend with no way to go get them from the pharmacy.
So your solution is being a manipulative child and trying to trick her into finally breaking up with you - or doing 100% of what you want sexually and staying in a miserably incompatible relationship? 

You need to grow up. Seriously. 



You’re banking on her “not wanting another guy” and are leaving everything up to her to keep a breakup from happening.


I’m guessing your assumption - or at least hope - is that she will decide to put all *her* wants and needs aside for *you,* subscribing to 100% sexually incompatible vanilla sex to keep from having to deal with the unpleasant and difficult path of breaking up. 



If it’s a deal-breaker for her, she gets to look like the “bad guy” to you - “she dumped me because I wouldn’t be rough with her in bed!! Poor me!!” - and you get to feel sorry for yourself as the “dump-ee”.




A mature, rational adult in a healthy adult relationship realizes that this is a fundamental incompatibility that cannot be resolved, and agrees that splitting up to find partners who are compatible in the future is the best thing both partners can do. You should want to find a partner who is sexually compatible with you, not try to force the other persons hand and *make them* do the hard work/initiate the breakup *or* be stuck with unfulfilling, unpleasant sex in a relationship they aren’t satisfied with. 



You shouldn’t want to force a partner to give up their own sexual needs and desires for your benefit or force them to walk away. It should be a mature, mutual decision - or a decision you make when you realize this can’t be fixed, allowing you both to move on and find a real, healthy relationship elsewhere. 




It’s pretty disgusting that you’re willing to ask her to put 100% of her sexual needs aside for you, to engage in sex with her you *know* she doesn’t enjoy/get satisfaction from, or make her end things *for you* because you’re too big of a coward to do it yourself if she doesn’t bend to your needs. 

I hope she does breakup with you and find a rational adult partner that is excited about fulfilling her sexually.
Portlanders seem incapable of admitting there are *any* problems or downsides here, and it’s ridiculous.

Look, I grew up here, and I’m stuck here again now. There’s a lot that sucks about this place. Just because other cities deal with the same shit or have it worse doesn’t make it not a problem here.
A lot of Portlanders need to pull their heads out of their asses.
Ah yeah, because most of us poors have the kind of *free outdoor space* needed to raise chickens. Easy!
I agree with this wholeheartedly! Find out what happened first to gauge if it would be appreciated or appropriate, and if it’s nothing too terrible, send it anyway! 
What she chooses to do with it is her choice regardless, but the sentiment is still there and it’s a beautiful gift.
Multnomah county is basically catch and release at this point. No wonder everything is so fucked up - and getting less and less safe all the time - here. Portland is a joke.
This is definitely *not* a guarantee. An ex was vegan, and one vegetarian, and their cum was some of the worst, most foul and vile taste I’ve ever encountered in my life. Like, literally repulsive, bitter, absolutely disgusting tastes. 

My current partner of many years is far from the picture of perfect dietary and nutritional health but is super easy to take - almost flavorless, even.
Yep, couldn’t agree more. 

The dialogue between the brothers had serious r/fellowkids energy, and was absolutely cringeworthy and just plain dumb. 


Took was obnoxious and lazily written, and Kiri - with her *old woman voice* - was too poorly fleshed out for anyone to care about yet somehow all-powerful. No thank you. 


The adults are much more interesting and still not that exciting, but we spend the entire moving following these bratty, poorly written children causing problems. Noooope.

Visually, the movie was nice to look at, but the plot… eh.
I hope you enjoy it if you do go back and see it!

I’m not a diehard Avatar fan here to endlessly defend the film or anything - and hope I didn’t seem that way, heh 
But I feel like “falling asleep 10 minutes in” was a bit harsh, especially with you having not finished it. 
But hey - we all like different things, and that’s okay! 
I thought the plot was a bit dicey and too similar to the first film, but the visuals were well done and I enjoyed the atmosphere and effects quite a bit. Will I be rushing out to see it a second time? Nah, but I did enjoy it enough to feel I didn’t waste my night sitting through it, nevertheless. 

It was loud as *hell* though, agreed. Dolby atmos was a bit overpowering for me.
Yep, agree with 100% of your comment.

This is *not* professional attire - regardless of if it is sold at the store you work at, that is completely irrelevant, you can’t expect all things to be appropriate in a workplace - for most workplaces, and I would *never* expect this to be allowed at work - aside from maybe a bar job or something. 


That said, you’re not on the clock, and it’s a day off, so unless otherwise stated - and then paid for the time - it would stand to reason that you’re going to wear day off attire if you happen to do them a favor by stopping in. 


At the same time, as rude as the comment is, it’s just that - a comment. Not sure why the post was needed, aside from unnecessary validation - let it roll off and move on.
All these “lol call a lawyer!” comments are delusional. This one off isn’t a harassment case. People make snide remarks in the workplace and they aren’t all *sexual harassment* or lawsuit worthy. Time for a reality check.
Don’t insult those who genuinely need the medication with this horseshit. People who don’t need it will abuse it, and that’s on them. It’s not “government meth.”
Portland has always looked like shit, not sure when you’re referring to. 

Roadside Attraction, however, is and has been a wonderful place amongst the shit for a *long* time.
You claim to have left the theater less than an hour in. You’re clearly not the targeted audience for the movie, and quite frankly no one wants to listen to you whine about a film you didn’t even stay to finish. (I personally have zero respect for someone who pays for a movie, leaves before it’s over, and then complains about it. You didn’t even watch the whole thing, and you wasted the cost of a ticket just to walk out before being able to form a full opinion.)

You don’t have to like it. Personally, I don’t feel like the Avatar films have that solid of a plot - I’m watching for the visuals and effects and environments. But they’re definitely not *fall asleep 10 minutes in* worthy nor are they bad enough to warrant *a walk out under an hour in.* 

If they aren’t for you, they aren’t for you - and you largely knew that already, before visiting the theater - no need to come here being hyperbolic and dramatic.
Everyone in the theater *fell asleep* a mere *ten minutes* into the film? 

Sure dude.
👏👏👏👏


And if he does, hopefully it’s with a partner that *actually* respects him and the rules they set beforehand.
Last time I checked, *youth* aren’t legally permitted to purchase cigarettes, flavored tobacco products, or vape products in the first place. 
If you think for one second that this will stop “youth” who are already obtaining these items through illegal avenues from continuing to do so, I have a bridge to sell you. 

As far as data on smoking cessation… frankly, who gives a shit?
There are countless adults who say that vaping was a valuable and successful aid to them quitting smoking. There is some data claiming vaping is healthier than outright smoking, both for the user and those around them. 
And all that aside… I don’t care about that data, frankly. Adults should be allowed to legally buy these things and make the choices for themselves as to whether it is detrimental to their health and lifestyle or not.
We’re doing a painfully bad job here with the choice to “decriminalize” drugs and hand out *zero* consequences for hard drug use and all the bullshittery that comes with it, yet *flavored tobacco and vapes* is suddenly where we start taking a moral high ground and drawing some lines? 
Ridiculous. 

I’m not a smoker or a vape user, and never have been, but this is getting ridiculous. 
This isn’t “for the children” and is just one of many stupid, overstepping choices in a land of many shitty, over the top restrictions.
Right?? *Not wanting to* and *choosing not to* are two different things.
I’d say a great deal of us *don’t want to* pay “our” taxes but still have to. The people that comment is referencing just straight up *don’t* pay them - or pay very little of their share. Big difference. 

I **never** *want* to pay taxes. Especially where I live, taxes are raised/new taxes passed all the time for ridiculous bullshit while quality of life plummets more and more and the city gets filthier, local government absolutely pissing it away.
I’m well below the poverty line and disabled. None of this shit benefits me and I can barely get by as it is. I don’t *want* to pay taxes but damn right they’ll come for me if I don’t.
IR or XR? 

He usually gets 20's but was having trouble finding 5's and 10's as well - his doctor was willing to rewrite the RX for the same dosage with those mg breakdowns, but he called all over town and into Beaverton/Hillsboro and still wasn't consistently able to find enough to fill his full script. (Not sure if 15's are having the same issue or not, it would be more complicated to achieve his dosage with 15's but if it keeps being a problem he might have to ask anyway lol)

Glad you haven't had to deal with it yet - and hopefully you never do! Fortunately Costco was able to fill his this month, but its been an issue for him every month for the last 4 months. I fortunately haven't had to go outside of Kaiser, but *have* had to change my mg breakdown a few times which was annoying.
I’m not actually sure why there’s an IR shortage vs. XR, to be honest! 
I’d guess that has something to do with it! Perhaps different regulations around IR vs. XR - I was reading that the shortage comes from a problem with regulations only allowing so many to be made at a time or something to that effect, perhaps it’s slightly different for XR since they have less potential for abuse/are less viable on the “illegal market” but I haven’t really read anything indicating that so it’s just a wild guess. 

The shortage definitely sucks! I take it for Narcolepsy, and the N groups I’m in are *suffering.* It’s a much more severe and potentially dangerous situation for Narcoleptics not getting their meds, but there isn’t a “priority list” during shortages so it’s just luck of the draw who gets what and for what. 
They’re estimating the shortage will continue well into 2023 which is pretty scary! 
Hopefully it doesn’t impact you at all, but I’d imagine people will have to supplement with XR at some point if this keeps dragging out, so definitely be prepared!
Oh, you take XRs. Yeah, you’ll *probably* be fine. IRs are experiencing the shortage - though keep knocking on wood because it’s predicted to potentially hit XRs too, just to a smaller extent.
It’s *definitely* happening in Portland.

Kaiser mail order has been a lot better than what my partner who isn’t with Kaiser has dealt with - he usually fills at Fred Meyer but has had to call all over town to multiple different chains, only to eventually fill at Costco - but even with them, I’ve had to have my script rewritten to accommodate what mg tablets they have available - taking *handfuls* of 5’s per day instead of multiple 20’s for example - but its definitely ever present here. I’d be shocked if you never encounter it in some form.
Check out r/1200isplenty. 

It’s *not* easy to eat super low calorie, especially in the beginning. 1200 does *not* feel like plenty, especially when you’re used to eating high calorie meals. 
You can gain a few extra calories into your allotment with exercise, but not everyone can do this - my Narcolepsy is too severe, it’s not even an option - and frankly, exercise doesn’t pay off calorie wise in any substantial way when you have to eat that low cal to lose. 
Low calorie foods that are high in protein, playing around with things like intermittent fasting/OMAD, using teas and hydration and other things to get you past the hunger - these will all help, but it’s still tough until you can get into a routine and retrain your stomach and brain. 
There are tons of calorie counting meal plans out there, fortunately - I’d recommend looking into those, takes the planning work out of it and gets you into a routine right off the bat.
Amen. All the people who claim that being constantly active and having a lot to do keeps sleep attacks away are the lucky ones - this is not how my Narcolepsy works, and I’d be much better off if it was.
Doing things is *exhausting.* I have no energy as it is, how am I supposed to work out, have a highly active job, etc.? 
If I could manage those things without extreme pain and sleep attacks, I wouldn’t be severely disabled - as a result of having Narcolepsy.
Would love to be thrown in the hat for this! 
My check in bag was destroyed last time I traveled with it - soft fabric suitcases aren’t the best for checking, I’ve learned! - and we can’t afford a replacement right now, but will have to travel soon to help transition my grandma into a care facility. 
Thank you for considering!
I have my Adderall mailed every month, and haven’t seen my prescribing provider in person - or even done a telehealth appointment with them for that matter - in almost 3 years. They have been contacted on my behalf once, but this was because of the shortage, and needing to change the mg breakdown in order to be able to fill it without delay. 
This is via Kaiser, which I get covered through Medicaid. 


Granted, I take the medication for Narcolepsy, so much more serious, different ballgame - but I would assume the same general controlled substance rules apply. 


I have not heard of any changes or new worrisome controlled substance laws, and I would not get too worked up over it until official news is available. Social media is *not* official news unless legitimate sources are linked. 
You can ask your provider and ask them to keep you in the loop if you’re genuinely concerned.
I lived in that building, there’s no amount of fixing up that will redeem or genuinely improve that place.
Yep, this is all I can think, too.


He speaks highly of her, and clearly loves the person she is, but they’ve barely been together *one year.* 
I know plenty of people have married that quickly and plenty have had it work out, but I would still *never* advise such a commitment and life choice after such a *tiny* amount of time.
That first year is very much “honeymoon phase” in a lot of ways, and I doubt they were living together for the majority of that time - they have *a lot* to learn about each other still, and the fact that there’s this much uncertainty around sex and intimacy proves they are *not ready.*
But given that OP values sex and is a highly sexual person, it wouldn’t be surprising that rushing into it faster than maybe he otherwise would in order to unlock “sex privileges” plays a huge part here. 



Less than *two years* ago, she was having frequent casual sex with someone, and *one year and 8 months* ago - give or take - she *completely* changed her values and boundaries sexually/in relationships and made a *huge* 180 as a person into church life, abstinence, etc. 
*She* may not even truly know where she’s at with sex or what that’ll look like for them once married. 
She may have no real interest in jumping right back into those activities, or may feel deep shame about it still - seeing as to how that’s what brought her to the epiphany and church commitment… you don’t usually decide you want to be abstinent and look poorly on your “sex phase” because you *love sex* and are a *highly sexual person* that will quickly return to those behaviors once the vows are exchanged. It’s usually because you don’t plan to revisit that side of yourself/don’t feel good about it. 

Look, I’m a highly sexual person. I love sex, and sexual compatibility is *crucial* to me in a relationship. I would *never* marry someone without be damn sure we are compatible sexually, share the same values around intimacy, and are equally excited about sex.
I also wouldn’t be able to just switch off that side of myself for a year with someone I love and am dating, show no interest or excitement in it, and then switch it back on when I finally get the person to marry me - it just doesn’t work like that. 
I’m not judging people who choose to remain abstinent- I have no interest in that kind of risk and sex is important to me in a relationship so I’d be shooting myself in the foot taking a gamble like that - but I am absolutely dumbfounded by people who claim to be very sexual and value sex in a relationship that wind up with a partner who is waiting until marriage. There’s just *no reason* to end up in this kind of a situation - you *might* wind up just fine, but more likely than not, you’re going to deal with mismatched libidos, sexual incompatibility, etc. 
I’d never enter a marriage with those possibilities on the table right off the bat.
“Can you live a fulfilling life with Narcolepsy?” 

This depends on how privileged you are, and how severe your symptoms are. 

Many people answering “yes” while also not truly struggling financially, being able to stay afloat and employed at a job, acting like only minor changes - like diet/exercise/sleep hygiene - will make a world of difference to improve symptoms… these are not the people with the more severe end of symptoms, or with the more extreme hurdles to overcome. 

For me, the answer is “absolutely fucking not.”
This life is hell. Too disabled to work, forever cursed to extreme poverty and struggle, always in a constant fear of how the hell I’m going to survive and stay housed or fed or afloat. 


Always feel sick, exhausted, fatigued, and can *never* achieve restful, restorative sleep - despite needing 12-14+ hours a night to even remotely function in a day, and even then it’s not *really* functioning.


Memory? Long gone. Feels like I have Alzheimer’s most of the time - working/short term memory completely obliterated to the point of legitimate fear of losing myself entirely, old memories fading more and more all the time. 

I get *maybe* 2-3 hours in a day where I can do *anything* - the rest of the time I’m too heavy and pained and fatigued and brain fogged to even answer a basic email or fold my laundry. Can’t really have much in the way of fulfillment when the most you can muster most of the time is staring blankly at a wall or phone screen, dazed and half asleep.

No one takes Narcolepsy seriously and no one who doesn’t suffer from it themselves understands it, can even remotely relate, or *truly* “gets” the weight and realness of all the symptoms. So add in never being taken seriously or believed fully and not being able to truly relate to hardly anyone in your life to the roster of bullshit. Nothing I love more than having to constantly defend or explain myself or justify the hell that is living with Narcolepsy. 

And it gets worse all the time. I’m *substantially* worse than I was two years ago. *Much* worse than one year ago. Definitely worse than 6 months ago, too. 
Things I used to be able to manage, or at least enjoy a little bit despite being more exhausted by them, are now tougher and tougher, and I see myself quickly approaching the point of no return for many things quite quickly, where I won’t be able to enjoy or do many things I once loved *ever again.* 

Sleep is hellish - and I spend over half my time wasting my time on this earth doing it. Such vivid dreams that, when coupled with the memory loss/issues, make it hard to know what’s real and what was a dream. 
Did I do ____ thing? Yeah, of course I did… I remember doing that…. - oh wait nope, it was a dream. 
An exhausting dream from which I woke up even more tired than before, having no real rest, and now I have to try to do it again in “real life.” 
It’s like being trapped in some kind of sick torture cycle, forced to be constantly living the worst - and painfully mundane - versions of existence with no idea which are the real actions that’ll have real consequences or impacts later. 
Sleep inertia is physically painful in ways I can’t even verbalize well enough to get basic understanding from others - so instead I’m “lazy” or “choosing to sleep in.”
The hallucinations are so frustratingly vivid and bad that I feel like an insane person. Sleep is my biggest enemy for so many reasons.

Sleep medicine is a joke at this point for people with truly severe symptoms.
Treatment options are limited and not wildly effective for many. 
My meds don’t work a good deal of the time - and when they do it’s barely an improvement - and I’ll only continue to build more and more tolerance until there are no longer *any* options on the table at all. 


So… given these factors… what exactly is my hope for a “fulfilling” life? 
The US government hates disabled - and poor - people. I will be trapped in poverty, pain, and suffering until I die. 
I lose more and more memory and function and feel worse and worse every day it seems like. 
Can’t financially afford a comfortable, manageable, or fulfilling life - or to do *anything* I still enjoy, before I can’t any longer - and there is no job on earth that can accommodate the severity of my symptoms. 

At least, if I’m lucky, I’ll stop remembering any of it at all at a certain point, and just black out to the rest of this life.

This isn’t to say you - or others - can’t. I envy those who can, and I’m happy for them. But they aren’t the only reality, and it’s okay to feel disappointed or like your life isn’t fulfilling and this disease is robbing you of a good life. It definitely can.
Couldn’t agree more, 100%. 


This disease is a curse, and comes with the added sting of no one taking it a seriously as it deserves.
*This* is the difference.  

I love SW in all forms, but this is the first show that hasn’t been aimed at children. The movies are all trying to appeal to kids/families, and the camp is *heavy,* which makes the atrocities fall flat/hard to take seriously sometimes. 
Having a grittier, darker SW that appeals to adults is obviously going to hit harder and be able to do more with the concepts. Anyone pretending this isn’t the case is frankly silly - it doesn’t mean the OT isn’t amazing, or that the Empire didn’t do horrible things, but when it’s covered with 100 layers of camp and child friendly filters, it just doesn’t have the same impact.
Was… was this seriously necessary? It’s very clear what he meant. Plenty women with refer to it that way because it’s an easier “general term” to use instead of being pedantic and getting unnecessarily specific when we all know what’s being referenced.
When you’re cripplingly poor, the price tag at checkout is the only cost you can afford to focus on. 

Amazon sucks, and major corporations need to stop fucking over workers - and everything else they negatively impact - but for poor/disabled people, sometimes these companies are the only options we have.
Agreed.

I love SW, but I also grew up watching it, and didn’t have a bunch of newer content to compare it to. 

I still love the older films, but I can imagine someone coming into the franchise and not finding it as interesting or exciting in comparison - especially if it’s someone who can’t overlook the fact that it’s an older movie, and the effects and stuff aren’t on the same level as the more current movies and shows. 

I feel like I would’ve still loved it and gotten into the franchise had I been shown SW for the first time in this order today, but I also have a pretty eclectic movie taste and enjoy the charm of “older” stuff. If she is not like this, it will likely be harder for her to enjoy after the newer content.
This feels like a troll post, 100%. 


If it isn’t… The guy doesn’t know you. The other Redditors don’t know you. This isn’t a “funny but questionable joke with a friend who I have that kind of rapport with and make non-PC jokes with” situation.
Given that, yes, those comments *could* come off as racist, offensive, and like you’re teasing or insulting the guy over his race/racial stereotypes.

Whether you meant it that way or not, and who you are as a person/if you’re racist or not isn’t going to translate into a comment you’re making to a stranger online, so it’s best to avoid making jokes that can be read that way if you don’t want people to assume the worst.
This is only true for progestin-only pills - and the majority of people take combination pills, which this is *not* true for. If you’re taking a combination pill, one pill a day taken at *any time* is perfect, and varying times daily is fine. 

Good idea to know which you’re on and what the specific instructions are, OP.
I’m not bitter just because I’m agreeing that I don’t “get it” - you’re the one choosing to pick an argument with someone who wasn’t talking to *you* in the first place, frankly. 
Nowhere did I invalidate someone’s OCD experience by stating that some of us don’t “get” whatever “metaphor” is being presented here. 
Good for you that you think you get it. My comment wasn’t directed at you. Move along.
I know what a metaphor is. This isn’t a very clear one, obviously, because most of us have no idea what the hell it is.
Yeah, I know *zero* idea. 

Life with OCD is life… sitting with your feet replaced by OCD, and flowers growing out of your head that’s always a clock? What?
It has gotten so bad - and gets worse all the time - that I have chosen to essentially look at my life and live it much in the same way I would if I was diagnosed with a terminal illness, or told I had early onset dementia or something. 
I know that my ability to enjoy any aspects of this life is very limited not and will only get progressively worse each day. I know that I am becoming less and less functional all the time as a result of my Narcolepsy and memory loss. 
So I’ve basically erased my priority list and replaced it with a few basic things - try to survive, try to stay afloat, and focus solely on enjoying any moment I can whenever I can, because it’ll all be gone before I know it. 

This disease is hell. I truly feel like my brain is rapidly deteriorating. I can barely remember what I’m doing while I’m doing it anymore - what’s the point of anything if you aren’t forming any memories?
Lmfao holy shit, this cracked me up. I’ve never gotten a “relevant username” comment in my entire 8+ year span of having this specific account. 
Well done 👏
Happy Thanksgiving!
Is… is there a reason behind this post? Do you not remember last night? 
Is there something special about this area? 
Do we win a prize if we guess? 
Did something happen??? 
Why, OP?
Personally:



I’ve had migraines since some of my earliest childhood memories.


I also have no recollection of any time in my entire life where I wasn’t exhausted, constantly sleepy, having disordered sleep, etc. 



(My parents have also confirmed that I’ve had horrible headaches since I was essentially able to speak and communicate their presence, and that I was always exhausted as a young young kid and never able to be woken up on time for anything/have energy for life.)



So I would say both have probably been there equal lengths of time, since my youngest childhood years.
Yep, couldn't agree more. Extremely stupid, dangerous, selfish, reckless, all of it. 

Put the babies at extreme risk, put the siblings at risk of being motherless, put her husband at risk of losing his partner/co-parent, puts them at risk of additional health issues - and herself at risk of further complications/health problems, literally nothing about it was at all smart. 

***No one*** needs to produce a small fleet of children, frankly, but especially not this close together.
It ***is*** an ***insane and dangerous*** thing to put your body through - and she did it 100% by choice.

They ***were*** complicated, dangerous pregnancies for her, and were not without extreme risk to her and the babies, and were advised against.

She needs to close up shop - ideally permanently, if not for a ***long*** time.
I see nothing wrong with this at all, at least at this point in time.

You have a stressful job that is very demanding and takes a lot, if not most of, your attention and energy during the week.   
Instead of half-assing sexual encounters and being half-engaged because you're still trying to decompress from work and thinking about having to start back up again and maintain focus and commitment the very next day, you're saving those encounters for the weekend when you can truly dive "all in" - and this is giving you something to look forward to, as a reward for getting through the hard parts of the week.

This is absolutely no different than when a couple, who both work demanding jobs and are too busy during the week to really connect and have date nights, set the weekend aside for a nice dinner, a movie, etc.  
Just because it's sex/sex related doesn't mean it isn't a "date night" or an opportunity for the two of you to connect, connect emotionally, and be intimate. A healthy, fulfilling sex life is pretty crucial to a healthy, happy relationship that lasts - and it sounds like you have that.

Exploring your sexuality/exploring sexually, and exploring sexually with your partner are also incredibly healthy, important things. It can teach you a lot about yourself, your partner, your relationship, the two of you together, etc.  
Things like BDSM require an intense amount of trust and healthy communication skills - you're not just fucking, you're growing these qualities and strengthening your relationship.

Yes, it *is* important to have a social life to *some* extent, and to do things outside the bedroom sometimes. But some people are less social than others, and some people prefer to spend the weekend engaging sexually and romantically with their significant other instead of going out to lunch and being around a bunch of people after an exhausting work week.  
That's not only perfectly okay, it's perfectly ***normal***. 

My partner and I have a dynamic sort of like this, sexually. While we don't have a crazy career like you do, so we have far more time together during the week and aren't as mentally sidetracked with such a crazy workload, we have our own challenges throughout the week that make things stressful and preoccupying.  
On the weekends, that's "us time" - we will regularly have 12 hour sex sessions that go all day/night, where we do all kinds of wild things together, explore, watch videos we've filmed, film new videos for ourselves, etc.  
Friends will hit us up to do things, and the answer is, "Sorry, today is date day/night" - and that's that. Friends don't pester, and we feel no guilt - "us time" is very important, and very healthy to have.

That intense release and intense intimacy after a stressful week - we will have sex periodically throughout most weeks, sometimes, but we also like to save it to build up the tension if we know a big weekend is coming and the week is particularly busy/rough - is an amazing reward for getting through it all.  
We've been on this "cycle" for pretty much all of the year, and we're just fine.  
Our lives haven't fallen apart, our friends still know we exist and aren't mad at us, and our relationship is stronger than ever - and we're closer than we could've ever imagined.

Don't sweat it. As long as you both feel fulfilled and happy, love and respect each other, and occasionally make time for your friends - even just a phone call or a text, or a lunch once a month when you have the energy and mental capacity to deal with it - you're golden. 

There is no room in this life for shame, guilt, or personal insecurity - especially around sex. Have fun.
Food - candy especially - is not safe inside the vagina, so no, it is not.
One thing it’s important to note is that an amphetamine based stimulant is not going to make you *less tired* either, it will also only keep you awake - if it even does that - and potentially help with focus/concentration/attention/etc. 

There is no daytime medicine that will take away your feelings of tired of exhaustion. It’s important to set your expectations accordingly.
I would never necessarily advise this, but my dad - who had never been remotely religious - joined the church for exactly those reasons, and it was probably the best decision he could’ve made during a time of extreme loneliness, depression, and hopelessness.
Finding a supportive community and positive routine is never a bad idea, doesn’t have to be religion.
I've had a bunch of different manufacturers - I've been on Adderall for ***ages*** \- and over time I came to realize that a lot of the generics just... plain don't work. 

Whenever I'd get a new looking pill, I'd Google the manufacturer, and what do you know - tons of reviews/posts all around the internet of people complaining that they seem like sugar pills, or questioning whether or not they're going crazy because it feels like their meds suddenly don't do anything.

I've been gaslit by medical "professionals" in the past, and told that there is no difference between manufacturers, and that thinking some of them don't work is "all in my head" and "not possible."  
Yet I've also had medical professionals - and have confirmed through research on my own time - that they do indeed differ, and some may not be as good as others.  
I am inclined to believe the latter, because I definitely have noticed that some work better than others - and when there are hundreds of people across the internet posting about that same thing, it's hard to believe it's just a mass delusion.

Anyway, I digress... The two manufacturers I personally have used that I know consistently work for me, are Teva and Sandoz. My partner, who also takes Adderall by prescription, also agrees that those are the two good ones.

Others have given me headaches/extreme migraines, haven't worked at all/have made me feel *more* exhausted, caused more dry mouth/nausea, bad side effects, etc.

I asked my pharmacy to specify that I will only accept Sandoz or Teva. I told them that other manufacturers trigger extreme migraines for me, and those are the two I know that work. (I could've just given one, but I wanted to have backup so that they could provide the alternative if the first was not available.)

While I could've gone off and said, "I don't feel like other manufacturers are as strong/work as good" I didn't feel the need to potentially have another bullshit gaslighting conversation as if I don't know what it feels like when my meds are and aren't working, or have that come across as "red flag" type behavior. I would suggest going about it the same way if you want to have a manufacturer specified. 

You can typically see who manufacturers your prescription by reading the label on the bottle. Mine says, "General for Adderall" and underneath that, "Mfr: TEVA USA" for example. Your label should have this somewhere on it. 

I'm sorry you're having this experience and are being judged as though you're drug-seeking. It's absolute ***horse shit*** that medical professionals/pharmacists feel justified in having that attitude with patients. You have a valid fucking prescription, *of course* you're going to want to fill it and get the medication you ***need*** and are prescribed.   
Don't let them bully you. It's perfectly reasonable to want to find a solution and get your medication despite the shortage - and it's in no way "weird" or "drug-seeking" to do so by having them change the mg breakdown in order to provide the same damn meds you've *been* getting.

Best of luck! I hope they work it out for you soon.
Hell, it was really upsetting and uncomfortable even for me as a preteen, to witness my parents sobbing while putting down our cats. 
Absolutely no to bringing a 3 year old. 
They’re either going to lose their shit, fall apart, and create an extremely hard to manage scene because they don’t understand the death/what has occurred and are shaken by seeing their parent upset, or they’re not going to react with the right types of emotions - possibly get impatient or agitated for example - and ruin your final moments with your beloved pet, since you’ll have to be parenting them instead. 

Have an age appropriate send off beforehand, and go without the child, I would say.
God, I’m *so* so sorry for your loss, and the awful way you had to experience it. 
I can’t even begin to imagine, having to witness that would absolutely shatter me. I hope you are able to heal, and in time begin to replace those traumatic flashbacks with more cherished memories to reflect on.
I don't need a lesson on unmedicated ADHD, I've had ADHD since I was a child, I fully understand the symptoms and how they can impact your day to day life.  
I'm well aware that it isn't the "lol squirrel" disease it can be stereotyped as.

I still firmly believe Narcoleptics suffer substantially more, due to the nature of the disease and lack of capacity to achieve restful, restorative sleep, and therefore should be prioritized in time of shortage. 

Kind of hard to worry about my attention issues and mood swings and impulse problems when I can't stay awake, could collapse at any moment without warning, and can't differentiate between being asleep and awake.
Not so much of a horror story as just a weird sickness occurrence I’ve always wondered about. 

Was at Disneyland, really excited for the first night of our short visit - it was a ticketed event, so we entered the park at around 6pm for an 8 or 9pm event start time, I think.
I felt great, nothing was amiss. We go to Bengal BBQ, having not had lunch yet, and grab two skewers each. 
I finish mine, and we’re letting it settle and making a game plan. 
Out of nowhere, I start feeling absolutely horrible. Nausea, keep freezing up because it feels like projectile vomit is about to come out of nowhere. 
Finally feel safe enough to make it to the bathroom, and take one of the large back stalls. 
Spent a solid hour and a half or so in there, vomiting like crazy. I’d stop, feel better, sit on the toilet to be sure it was over and collect myself, and then it would come back. 
Finally after the solid 1.5 hours, it seems like it isn’t coming back, and I put myself back together, swish a ton of water in my mouth and try to regain composure, and rejoin my boyfriend who was waiting patiently outside. 
We take it slow walking towards Main Street to see if we should go back to the hotel or if I’m going to manage, and… I’m fine for the rest of the night, and trip. 

I have no idea what happened, why I got sick, or why it was so short lived, but I was so glad I only missed a couple hours of the trip instead of it becoming a prolonged ordeal.
It was unlike anything I’d experienced before. I felt so horrible! I wish I knew what caused it.
10000000% agree. Grew up with - and obviously still have ADHD - but Narcolepsy is a totally different, much more dangerous and severe can of worms. 
You’re not going to fall asleep driving or doing dangerous tasks or working if you don’t get your ADHD meds. I absolutely will as a Narcoleptic. 

But sadly that’s not how it works, and so for the millionth time Narcoleptics are low priority in medicine and we’ll all just suffer through the shortage indefinitely while having pharmacists and doctors treat us like drug-seeking pieces of shit. 🙄
Are you able to change the mg in order to have it filled for the same amount? 


I went from taking 6 10’s a day to taking the 5mg equivalent - my dosage didn’t change, I just take twice as many pills now, because though they were experiencing a shortage of the 10 and 20mg options in the two manufacturers I will accept, they have not experienced a shortage on 5’s. 
They’ll need your doctors approval for this - or you can ask your doctor directly and see if they can help get to the bottom of things and find something that will work with a pharmacy available to you - but it might be a good workaround for you.
Yeah - nothing is going to drop in price. Anyone who thinks this is naive, delusional, and has no idea how businesses work. 

But maybe things will level out for a year or two somewhat, which is something.
Therapy should be higher on the priority list than dating and being in a relationship.
It’s okay to be single, it’s okay to be single for *a longer period of time* while you’re working on yourself and getting over and through your issues and fears, and it’s okay to focus on yourself so you can be healthy enough to be with someone in the future. 

This is not to say that people can’t be in a relationship/dating while they’re in therapy/working through trauma, but it sounds like you’re not quite ready for that right now, and bringing all of that into a relationship right off the bat isn’t a great way to start off on a good track with someone, especially when you aren’t even in therapy yet. 

I’m sorry you’ve gone through this and are struggling, regardless. I know it can be hard to get started in therapy and it’s an uphill battle to process trauma and establish boundaries in new relationships. I wish you the best.
Right?

Like, it sounds like this guy is a dick in general, or at least from OPs perception, but like... you're a grown ass woman? Use a towel, and get on with your day?

I've never once thought to sit there helpless waiting for my partner to clean me up for me. I'm a fully capable human being, and it takes no effort to do it myself - is this seriously an expectation people have?
*Most* people have better shit to do, think about, care about, pay attention to, and focus on than what a random stranger is buying at a store they are also shopping at. 
You are *not* the main character - or even side character, interesting extra, or memorable cameo - in the lives of strangers at the store. 



Most humans have sex. You can count on it being a fact that almost *every* person 18 and older - and some younger - at the store will have either had sex at some point in their lives, be in a sexual relationship currently, be actively seeking sexual encounters, or plan to have sex in the future. 
Being sexually involved/inclined in some capacity is “the norm” - it’s human nature. 


Those who frown upon sex, judge others for having it, or feel that it is shameful are *not* “normal” and do *not* have a healthy, rational mentality about sex/sexual behavior - given that, why do you care about their thoughts or opinions? 
What weight does their internal monologue, which may or may not include *you* specifically, and will almost certainly shift away from the fleeting second they saw you *purchasing merchandise legally at a store* - if they even noticed what you were buying at all - very quickly, and you will *never* be thought about again.
No one is going home and spending time thinking about how they saw you buying condoms - and if they are, so what? You don’t even know them? So? 


If you’re “mature” - for lack of a better word - enough to be sexually active and comfortable doing sexual things with other people, you can be mature enough to realize these things and buy whatever you need without stressing yourself out over other people. 
Other people don’t give a fuck if you see them buying all kinds of shit - you aren’t a factor to them. No need to pay more attention to them than they do you. 

Also, online retailers, my friend. Boom.
I recently tried to detail to my partner - after seeing a post where she’s still photoshopping the everloving shit out of her photos, as if we haven’t seen what she really looks like - the whole Zied/Rebecca photo ordeal, and his mind was blown. 
He couldn’t wrap his mind around wearing a shirt with your partners face on it - or printing out weird selfies of them to hang in your house, for that matter. 
I just can’t imagine doing this, it’s so cringe, and stinks of insecurity and desperation. 

(Bonus points to the Rebecca story for being genuinely hilarious. Nothing like your SO wearing a shirt with a *highly filtered and edited* photo of you on it, and then seeing what you *really* look like in person… Truly amazing.)
Sure, but not in the *same way* as someone who doesn’t have casual sex, and views sex as something they only value/want to pursue with someone they feel strongly about/know well/etc.

Neither person is wrong, but they are different viewpoints and mentalities, and would make those people incompatible.
Exactly. 

My partner and I don’t often do things apart, and try not to travel separately unless the situation specifically makes it necessary. 

My partner is also not a huge texter/caller in general, and finds traveling super stressful, exhausting, and distracting, and finds it difficult to make a ton of time to be on his phone when traveling.

But I still hear from him at least twice - morning and evening - when he travels, and we keep each other updated with how things are going, a “I love you hope everything is going good” at night, etc. - even if we save the details and stories for when we’re back in person. 

First solo trip and not even a “things are going good, how’re you/the kids, love you” is very odd. When you couple that with the lack of info beforehand, it’s a red flag.
I mean shit, he had no contact info for her friend, no idea where exactly she was going - what if something happened? Given the OF aspect of this, this could’ve been a very dangerous trap for his wife. 
Maybe when you’re a couple that travels solo often these things aren’t as notable, but this does strike me as super odd.
Super interested! Would make an amazing holiday gift for my partner who is hard to buy for - and who I wasn’t thinking about when Halloween stuff was still around 🥲 - who has a crazy skeleton aesthetic space in our home that needs more inhabitants.
How much do you like it? 

It's only worth as much as the buyer is willing to pay - if you really want it, and really like the piece, $30 might be worth it to you if you really want it in your collection and don't think you'll find the same piece/anything quite like it.

Personally, I wouldn't pay more than maybe $10-15 for it, if I had the extra spending cash, *possibly* more if it was a really big cup/goblet versus something small. I like the look, and could imagine it looking good in a lot of different types of displays - it has a classiness about it that makes it versatile. 

  
It's also pretty dang hard/rare to find any uranium glass where I'm at - and most of it is just *super* generic/bland plates and tea cups - and it's all *extremely* expensive, so that's something I factor in too. If it's easy to find where you're at, it won't sting to pass on this for being a bit overpriced.

Maybe ask her to come down a bit, and see if the seller is willing to budge?   
If not, ultimately $30 is a bit overpriced in my opinion, but if you really like it and can't get it out of your mind, go ahead and splurge.

I mean, I get what you’re saying, but OP is claiming they’d never been to WDW ever, yet also says the reason they “desperately” need this reservation is because her favorite memory is *dining in the castle at Disneyland.* 

Not saying OP is lying, but the internet is full of fake sob stories so I don’t blame people for calling out the major inconsistency there.
Yep. I have Narcolepsy. This is a daily occurrence for me. 
Very much could’ve been what happened, OP.
u/SmiteCorporate,

Consider this a warning before a ban. This type of disrespectful behavior doesn't fly here, nor does imitating Smite/HiRez staff - however poor a job this may be at that, it's still considered imitation, and will not be tolerated.
Dogs don't experience human emotions in the way that we do, nor do they experience emotions in the same way as this specific droid is portrayed as experiencing. ***Human*** companionship isn't a concept to dogs - they know where their food is. We can anthropomorphize dogs all we want, but it's simply not the same emotional range or experience.
I think that’s a bit of an insult to droids, frankly, which serve a purpose, have their own thoughts/personalities/desires to an extent, can perform useful and complex tasks, etc. 
The sadness and companionship the droid you’re referencing experiences in Andor is more akin to a child or an intelligent and/or human companion - these are not things a dog is capable of feeling.
I’ve worked nights before - it’s definitely a whole strange level of tough! Totally! 

And, 100% - a coffee shop, totally a luxury, no one is more entitled than anyone else.
Which extends to everything, of course - your choice to have kids doesn’t entitle you to *anything.*
I think I get most frustrated when people insinuate that they have a deeper understanding of exhaustion or tiredness because they have kids - it’s simply not true, and even if it was, who gives a shit? 
We’re all here, same playing field. No one gives me *any* considerations, and I’m literally disabled and have a crippling disease that impacts my ability to have restorative sleep. 
People with cancer still have to deal with the same bullshit the rest of us do. 
So, why would kids entitle to you anything?
No kidding. 

I have Narcolepsy. I’m incapable of getting restful, restorative sleep, *ever.* That’s not me hyperbolizing, that’s what this disease is. I’m *always* mentally and physically running as though I’m *at least* 72 hours or more sleep deprived.  

And yet entitled moms will still go, “you’re not as tired as me, though, you don’t have kids.”

Absolutely fuck off. You don’t even know what tired is, lady.
If someone wants to “avoid better care” that should be their right and choice. 
What you perceive as “better care” is not always *actually* better care - and quite frankly, *you* don’t have to live through it, struggle through it, maintain through it, or *pay for it,* so it isn’t your place to decide if it’s “better” care or not. 

The person struggling to survive their disability, and struggling to survive this life while disabled, knows best whether or not they’ve exhausted all viable options, and if the other options available will genuinely offer a chance at a better quality of life - and without too many risks or negatives to negate the benefits - or if they have finally run out of better choices. 

Quite frankly, even if someone *hasn’t* exhausted all “better care” options, they should be allowed to make this choice with dignity and acceptance. 
As someone who cleaned up the literal aftermath of my step-fathers suicide earlier this year, people will make this choice when they are “done” whether they are “legally permitted” to do so or not. 
Being able to do so in a comfortable environment with supervision and dignity, rather than the all too common alternatives, is a huge “plus” in my mind.

No one *wants* to lose a loved one. Especially not in circumstances we perceive to be “before their time.”
But that is not for us to decide. We don’t have to *live* as them. We don’t have to *suffer* through their reality.
Definitely time for a cabinet display! 

I agree - it’s definitely becoming more and more rare. I never see it anywhere where I’m at, when hunting in person, and the stuff I see online is often overpriced, in bad shape, or pretty “basic” pieces.
Gotta snag the good stuff when you find it!
That tray with the glasses, alone, would be worth it to me - they look awesome together, really cool pieces! 
The butter dish and the pitcher - which is *gorgeous* by the way - are just the icing on the cake! Absolutely a win! Thanks for sharing!
You surely didn’t hear right… tattoo removal isn’t exactly a one and done, quick removal process.
I mean look, at a certain point, for some of us, there is no better quality of life. 

Sure, having the financial means to actually live an enjoyable life without employment, where housing isn’t a concern/luxury and isn’t substandard, and where I could actually enjoy things and *do* activities instead of just trying to scrape by and exist as inexpensively as possible while being stuck in forced poverty would *help,* but at the end of the day, my disabilities are only going to keep getting worse, and that’s going to make staying alive pretty fucking miserable regardless of any other amenities or benefits I’m afforded. 
It is clear that my disease is not important enough for there to be any major research or treatment options on the horizon to change this, or afford me any substantial relief, either. 
It is harder and harder every day to maintain *any* semblance of function. 

There will come a time where it is no longer worth it *at all* to continue to drag myself through each day. It is too damn painful. At that point, I would like the option to dignified release from this vessel, instead of continuing to be trapped in this physical prison. 


I am 100% all for this, for those of us who will never have a viable cure or treatment that provides enough relief to maintain a decent quality of life - and that’s ignoring the financial strain of existing.
Yep, this right here 👏

Disney will 100% make this right, with no hassle at all - know from personal experience, and they went above and beyond - but you don’t get the internet validation if you just do what you’re supposed to and contact them instead of whining online.
Unfortunately, it isn't that simple.

First of all - because she was not the owner of the dog, there is nothing I can/could do to compel anyone to have the dog put down. The owner took the dog, and claimed he would not be using her as a dog-sitter again, so as far as animal control was concerned, that was enough. I was informed by multiple animal control employees that nothing more could be done, and that no court could compel the actual owner to bring the dog in to have it put down, since I would not be suing him - I would be suing the woman watching the dog at the time - and they tend to only award verdicts of monetary value, since that is all the loss is seen as.

I still would like to take her to court, but unfortunately, it isn't as easy as just going, "I'm suing you! You killed my animal!" and walking away with a judgement.

She has dodged every attempt at contact, and I simply do not have the financial ability to hire a process server, nor to pay court fees. I am severely disabled, and unfortunately that means I am not financially privileged, either.

Small claims does not tend to be the most fruitful experience for anyone, and animal-loss cases like this are typically not easy to win, nor very high-paying.

I agree it would have been some justice, and I have been trying to see if there's anything I can still do to make her "pay" in one way or another, but it doesn't look promising.
It pains me to say that the comment you're referring to likely wasn't me, if it was on this subreddit - this is the first time I've commented here, so it was likely someone else, which unfortunately just goes to show how often this tragedy occurs, and how often lives are ruined by irresponsible dog owners and their mutts. 

But that aside - thank you so much for your kind words and compassion! It really means so much to me to know that people have heard my little dudes story, if nothing else - that he wasn't just brushed off and forgotten by *everyone*, just because the woman who caused this chose to handle things that way.

Please do give your little fuzz-balls extra loves from us today :) You sound like such a kind and sweet person, and I have no doubt they're very lucky to have you!
Yeah, a lot of Hallmark ornaments I’ve seen lately look *terrible.* Super bad paint job, zero quality control or consistency between different ornaments of the same design, just really thrown together and cheap looking. They’ve definitely lost any standards of quality they ever had, sadly.
I don’t know, personally I think she has now firmly entered “was” territory. I can’t possibly see how this could be considered *still* pretty or attractive in any way. Her face is horrifying, and the general overall vibe of “100% plastic” is really off putting. She has gone way too far already.
Thank you so much ❤️ Give your kittens extra love from me today! I’m glad you have the protective instincts that you do to care for them.
The report - and the retelling by the neighbor who called and tracked the bitch down, who I am forever grateful to - essentially said that the bitch lied, tried to hide the dog and claim there was no dog. 



Then said that she was housesitting and didn’t live there, nor was it her dog. 



Then finally owned up and said she lives there, but it isn’t her dog - she dog sits for some asshole who lives an hour outside of town, and they immediately called him.



He came and picked the beast up and was allowed to take it home with zero follow up, punishment, etc. because he said he’d “never use her for dog sitting again.”



She tried to say my little dude was on her property and the dog dragged him out from under the shed and then “rolled into the alley behind the house” where the mauling ended. 



In reality, this bitch had an unleashed pitbull hanging out unattended in a backyard that barely even had a piece of chicken wire up as a “fence” and he jumped into the alley and attacked, seeing as there was evidence of this - and witnesses - and no evidence it started on her lot. 


The dog had to be choked out to release my little guy, but by that point he had ripped through his entire abdomen. 


It was bloody, hellish to hear/see, and half the damn street came outside while she bolted with the dog the second it dropped him - she didn’t stick around to see if my kitty survived, nothing, just *bolted.* 



The financial and emotional burden this bitch caused… I still haven’t recovered. I don’t understand how someone could be so fucking irresponsible - having a pit bull *unleashed* in a yard with *zero fence,* left unattended…
I see red every time I think about it, it’s just too much. He didn’t deserve to go out like this. 

Animal control doing nothing was just the icing on the shit cake, here.
Believe me, if the risks weren’t so high, I’d have done it myself already. I found out who it was - animal control was called by a neighbor, who located the bitch and the hellbeast, so I got their information - and they live 4 houses down. Not a day passes where the fact that there was no justice at all doesn’t sting.
A lot of people chime in with “something that keeps you on your feet and moving constantly/keeps them constantly busy” whenever a post about best jobs for Narcoleptics comes up and it absolutely boggles my fucking mind. 

If I had the *energy* or *ability* to be constantly moving, or in any way busy and active, my narcolepsy wouldn’t be much of a problem, now would it? 
And why the hell would I want a job that is going to keep me constantly moving and busy, and thus depletes every last bit of energy reserve I possibly could’ve had, exhausting me even further every day? 
No thank you. That’s torture. 

I wish I knew what to tell ya, but sadly I don’t have a good answer - I am permanently disabled by my narcolepsy and cannot work. 
When I was still trying to cling onto working, though, something brainless and low key that wouldn’t exhaust my energy resources or physically deplete me was the best thing possible. 
Work from home type thing, lots of naps, nothing physically demanding or anything that I needed to be “constantly moving” for. 
I suppose everyone is different, and if it works for some folks that’s great, but it definitely wasn’t for me.
I 100% feel you. I wish they’d separate waiting rooms, or at least have clients leave and enter separately as so to never cross paths in this way. 

Back in late June, a pitbull mauled my indoor-only cat - who bolted outside when startled by a truck backfiring on the street as I came inside - to death, and the coward owner fled the scene. 
My fuzzy best friend bled to death in my fucking arms. He meant the world to me and was a huge help in dealing with my severe disability each day in a number of ways. I will never be the same after this loss. 


I was never a fan of big dogs - have trauma/fear from being attacked as a child - but my hatred and fear of/towards pitbulls is immeasurable now. 
And they’re *fucking everywhere,* which definitely doesn’t help. 

I feel rage boil up inside of me the second I even see one, these days. I actively avoid being anywhere near them - taking other entrances at shops, crossing the street, etc. 

I now have two kittens, who I rescued a couple months after losing my little dude, and had a similar experience to this at the vet. 

No, your hellhound can’t come near my kittens and “curiously” or “playfully” sniff at their cage. I don’t give a shit that they “just want to check it out.” 
Also, *no,* your shitbeast is not permitted to get *anywhere* near *me,* either. Fuck off. 

It can feel embarrassing at first to go against the popular “dog crazy” way of behaving - be that moving away from them at the vet like you did, or verbally stating a boundary and asking them to remove themselves from your space - but the more you do it, the less you’ll care, and the happier you’ll be.
Who cares what these people think? You didn’t do anything wrong. You’re protecting yourself and your pets, which is the good, responsible thing to do. 
Anyone taking issue with that has serious issues themselves - and thus their opinion holds zero value. 

At the end of the day, as much as I don’t want to cause problems or have uncomfortable encounters with others, all I care about is my safety - and that of my partner and pets. 
Fuck strangers. 
All those pit-loving, eager to tell you how innocent and friendly their dog is, quick to judge idiots aren’t going to be there helping you pick up the pieces when you’re on your knees sobbing and screaming covered in the blood of your pet/loved one/etc. 
Gotta look out for you and yours first.
If you fully understand the reputation behind pit bulls, why the hell do you have one? 

I applaud you for muzzling and understanding why people don’t want to go near yours, but I’m genuinely confused as to why you’re harboring one if you’re also aware of the massive problem? 

I don’t mean this as a jab or an attack, I’m genuinely interested in hearing your reasoning here - and I do promise not to snap back and turn it into a debate, that’s not my intention.
That’s ridiculous, I’m sorry you had that experience.


Definitely can’t use “sleepy” with people as an alternative to “tired” to try to get people to better understand/take things seriously, in my experience at least, either. 
“Sleepy” sounds way more childish, and even less serious.
“Excessive daytime sleepiness” being the official term for a big part of Narcolepsy makes me irrationally angry. It sounds so laughably childish and fake, and almost in a way sounds like it’s mocking the symptoms/severity.
Trying to tell anyone about Narcolepsy using those terms - or trying to get them to take it seriously after they Google it and see those terms - is *that much harder,* it’s so annoying how much language is failing to help us here.
Never ever is there “too much” when it comes to cleaning. 

Every time I shower I use the detachable shower head and go to town down there. Blasting water *everywhere.* 
Absolutely *always* getting the inside and outside of my ass/other bits with hot water. 
Definitely would rather but too much into it than not enough.
So you expect us to believe that the staff and management decided to make it their mission to single out ***your*** family and ruin your night just for the hell of it?

It doesn't matter if *you* personally agree with the rules or "contrived age restriction policies" - they are in place for a reason, and Meow Wolf is *hardly* the only business on the planet that enforces these, *especially* with live events.

The bottom line is that you have a ***minor child.*** A minor ***child*** who is, as of now, still **under 16**, even.

Liability is a thing. You have *no idea* why their policies state a child must be 16 or over - or 18+ for some events. It's much bigger than you and your family, and goes into insurance, legality, etc.

Literally every event on the Meow Wolf calendar/where you go to buy tickets states the age policy. If you missed it, take the loss and move on.  
If you're trying to insinuate that the age policy wasn't stated/"a thing" beforehand, and management was crafting a story to work against you specifically, that's absolutely absurd, and no one here is buying it.

Just because she couldn't "provide you anything in writing" doesn't make this some grand conspiracy. You're not entitled to have the answer given to you in the way you deem acceptable, and you can be denied entry for ***any reason.*** This is not the call out post you think it is.
This is 100% it, in my opinion.


It’s clear OP has never truly faced housing insecurities, and has been privileged enough to avoid facing the situations you describe.


Not all of us have had that luxury. 



I’ve moved every single year for 10 straight years before moving into my current place - February 2023 will be two years here. 


It was a scramble every time - rent was raised, or they didn’t offer me a month to month after my year term was up in order to turn it over at a *much* higher cost, since tenant protections have a cap on rent raises here. 
Each time, I had to leave one shitty place frantically with no real savings - since rent is so damn expensive, how do you put money away? - just to find another shitty place.
Nowhere *ever* felt like home. I was *always* worried and *always* monitoring Craigslist and rental websites. 
I’ve had to live with black mold, meth addict neighbors stealing my shit, had to occupy a unit while it was flooded with ankle deep water, no heat/power, no hot water, etc. etc. - the list never ends. 



The place I’m in now is amazing, but I’m scared 24/7, even after almost two years. 
If they raise the rent *at all,* I’ll be out. The market now is so bad, I *won’t* find another place. There’s *nothing,* not even another really awful, slumlord owned shack. 
It *will* be a death sentence for me, as a disabled person. 
When the private landlords I initially rented from informed us they were hiring a sleazy, shitbag “property management” guy, it felt like the world was falling apart around me - things couldn’t just remain chill, *of course* we’d have to face the road to the end sooner rather than later. 
I took one look at the rental market and decided to update my will instead of investigating further - when the time finally comes and the rent goes up here, it’s more likely to be useful than anything else. 



I get it - owning is stressful and expensive. But not having to live at the mercy of shitty landlords, who can raise your rent or force you out at any time for any reason at all is worth every cent. 
This is no way to live. Being trapped in forced poverty on top of it? Truly terrible.
Yeah, agreed. I get the sense most of these people haven’t traveled much, or explored other cities scenes when/if they have.
There’s *nothing* in Portland that isn’t done better elsewhere.
She posted that to manipulate, because she knew it would tug at the hearts of the kind of gullible people she’s aiming for. 
That’s such transparent, lazy, classic sob story bullshit.
Exactly. If you’re genuinely on a tight, out of pocket budget trying to make magic happen out of the goodness of your heart, your first stop is probably *not* endlessly browsing Mercari and then over sharing your sob story to get people - whose circumstances you don’t know, and could *need* the money at full price, since these apps are *people* selling, not businesses - to lower their prices. 

There’s enough red flags in her two messages to decorate this entire fictional gym she’s referring to. 

“Trauma based children” - this one could just be me/me being nitpicky, but… what? *Trauma based* children? Makes no fucking sense. This is not how someone working with children who’ve gone through trauma would word this, I feel like. It sounds fake as hell, like someone who is scrambling for a background for their sob story trying to come up with something legitimate but failing. (But again, this one is probably just me being picky lol) 
But the fact that she opened the conversation with it? My rule - and I’ve never been wrong - is that if someone begins a conversation by over sharing/presenting a sob story, it’s bullshit 100% of the time. It’s not relevant yet - not that it ever would be necessarily - in that first message. She’s just trying to manipulate from the very first second. Transparent as hell, not even remotely clever. 

Then that second message? 
*Immediately* after “what’s the best you can do?” we’re right back into the sob story. What’s the lowest you can go, you’ll be helping *boys who have no one.* 
Doesn’t take a pause, just *immediately* launching into the poor me, how low can go you for *miserable, lonely children.* 


The one that killed me was the “really not trying to low ball you or *whatever they call it*” like… Lady, *please.* 
You’ve *got* to be kidding me. You weren’t born yesterday, we all know what low balling is. How transparent can you be?!

I can’t believe some of the comments here are making it out like this person was clever, or potentially legit, or somehow *”very good”* with this message. 
0/10, lazy sob story, transparent as ever.


I personally really hate the “I shop on this app all the time, but this is out of my pocket and I’m on a tight budget” shit too, while trying to throw a pity party about wanting to make something magical for these apparently traumatized kids.
If you care so much, and you shop for yourself all the time, it should be no problem to pay a reasonable price - either what OP is charging, or by making your own reasonable offer without all the BS messaging - to do that for them. Why is it this strangers job?
You’re joking, right? This is a “VERY good” sob story to you??? 

Good grief, they went right into the normal “poor me, you’d be helping ___ in need who have nothing/no one” *right away*. This is as uniform, lazy bullshit as it gets.
I mean, OP even said she recognized she was smelling gross long before engaging in sex with him that day, and said “fuck it” and went for it anyway with no warning.

I’m not saying the guy was nice about it, or that it isn’t a natural thing for some women, but if *you* realize you aren’t smelling great, what the hell is wrong with you that you’re going to let someone else put their face in that without warning, or even a shower - after a 3 hour drive and full day?! 
Have some basic respect for them. 
Even just a “I’m just coming off my period, let’s save oral for another time” would’ve sufficed here.

That, plus unloading on him that after *one* meeting she had feelings for him probably was enough for him to part ways before getting more invested in a situation with obvious incompatibilities.
Haha, I'm tempted to do the same, I have all the materials to do it right now, but haven't touched my Cricut in ages because I'm too exhausted and dead to craft most of the time.

I guess there's no better time than now!
That's definitely what it is a lot of the time, especially with people who don't have *any* tattoos, or aren't heavily tattooed themselves. And while I get it, it's also so frickin' *boring* and lazy, and it seems like no matter how respectfully I try to shift the topic or give the vibe that I'm not really excited to talk about it, people just don't give up, and keep going on about it. 

Feeling like "Google" for peoples every question about tattoos - "how much did it cost/hurt/how many do you have/what's the worst spot/how much do they typically charge/what do you think of this idea/what is the story behind every single one/blah blah blah" - has gotten so, so old after decades of wearing these tattoos.

&#x200B;

I definitely was like that at first, too - the first few pieces I got, I felt they needed to have a story behind them, and have a deep personal meaning. But after that, I found myself preferring to get tattoos just for the sake of the art/because I liked them and the way they looked/etc. 

It's really obnoxious when people without many tattoos, or who don't have any at all, keep asking about the story behind my pieces. 

"What do you mean they don't mean anything? Isn't the point of tattoos to have a story behind them? There ***has*** to be a story behind them??!" 

\*groan\*
“Don’t shit where you eat” is a saying for a reason. 

Might’ve turned into a hot thing for you once, might’ve been an impulsive and dumb drunk night for them, but trying to make this a regular occurrence is only going to add drama, weirdness, and a whole bunch of extra shit - extra shit that it *already* appears your roommate and his fling are too young, stupid, and immature to handle respectfully and responsibly.
You don’t want to add all those elements, which have high potential to go south *real* fast and get *really* negative to your *living situation.* 
I’m glad you ended up enjoying it, but this was absolutely disgusting to do - without prior consent - on their part, and shows a lack of maturity and sexual maturity/responsibility all around. 

Best to keep your roommate situation sex free. You’re young, it may sound fun, but you *do not* want to deal with how uncomfortable and problematic your home life can/will become if/when things aren’t so cool anymore.
Portland, Oregon - a *heavily* tattooed city, in general, and it’s still constant.
Thank you so much!! I’ll check these out! Really appreciate all the info 😇
Yep, you nailed it. 

If I could go back in time, I’d never get a single visible tattoo. 

I’m so fucking sick of being asked about them. I’m so fucking sick of people pointing them out. Sick of them being the first thing anyone sees when they look at me. Sick of the assumptions people make about me/them/because of them. Sick of people expecting me to be a tattoo FAQ page/endless Google search bar at the drop of a hat. Sick of people using them to flirt, make jokes/puns, think they know something about me, etc. 

Leave me the *fuck alone* about them - and in general, thanks! 

I’m sure a facial scar - or visible scarring in general - is the same way. 
You’d hope people would have more grace about scarring than tattoos, given the nature, but after decades of wearing tattoos around I doubt it. People are straight up dumb as bricks about this kind of stuff and really have no sense of boundaries. The worst. 

That said, I think OPs scar is striking, and doesn’t take away from his face at all. I totally respect wanting to cover it up, but I hope he doesn’t feel self conscious about it.
Unrelated to the OP but… do you have a UV eyeliner recommendation, by chance?? I keep meaning to find some!
Yep, not a lot of room for anything that isn't echoing the delusional levels of positive, ignorant to all problems, "this is fine" outlook here, sadly.

I'm not saying we had better choices - Kotek was one of three equally terrible options, and we really should all be feeling pretty devastated by *all three* options laid out in front of us. We really weren't given *any* suitable "choice" here.

Whether you think Kotek was the better of the three or not, she's what we're getting. But if you think for a second that she's going to enact any meaningful change, you've completely ignored her history, and are choosing to be ignorant to the way things are at this point.

People weren't frustrated with having to vote for her - or choosing to vote against their own party to vote against her out of exhaustion with the current state of things - because she was a promising candidate with *real, viable* plans to fix this homeless crisis - and crime crisis, and filth crisis, and drug crisis.

Expect more of the same. That's quite literally what was voted in. Whether that's better than the alternatives or not, that's what it is, plain and simple.

I am definitely pretty perplexed and fascinated by triptan medications, myself. It's pretty crazy how well they work - when they work - at zapping migraines and headaches away so incredibly quickly, but they come with some very strange side effects too, which is odd.
Don't get your hopes up. She barely wormed in her "homeless plans" to get herself in the seat, but I can all but guarantee we'll see next to no change, if any at all, during her time. 

Not that the other candidates were good, either - we were given 3 frankly horrible choices all around - but anyone expecting Kotek to do ***anything*** of value regarding the homeless is kidding themselves.
I have taken stimulant medication for well over two decades - for Narcolepsy - so I know what a "substance comedown" feeling is. I've taken opiate pain medication for various conditions and surgeries over the years for shorter  stints in the past, as well as highly addictive sleep aides and anti-anxiety medications, as well. This is not that.

&#x200B;

It is an ***instant*** feeling of physical woe that begins ***very*** immediately after taking the medication. Fortunately, the relief from a migraine/cluster headache, if it is going to come, is very quick also - sometimes 5-10 minutes later, but again, sometimes it doesn't work at all.  


If you read up on triptan medications, this is not uncommon. Especially with sumatriptan, people report feeling a general sense of malaise directly after taking the medicine, that can sometimes last an entire day.   
I immediately feel extremely hot and feverish, my face - and seemingly the rest of my body - gets flush, and I feel a great deal of tension in my face and head, almost like everything is tightening dramatically, in a very painful way. From there, it's a full body sense of discomfort, coupled with a lot of weird and random painful feelings - but it's hard to pinpoint what exactly is hurting, or put words to exactly ***how*** it's hurting, just that it is.   
It's unlike anything I've ever experienced. It's such a bizarre feeling of "sick" but not in the way a "comedown" feels.
Thank you for your kindness <3
Thank you <3
Thank you <3
Unfortunately no, he did not. Both he and my mother were on Medicaid, and extra expenses like life insurance were out of the question of affordability. He worked as a barber, so was "self-employed" and thus there were no work-related benefits. The pandemic obviously hit his industry incredibly hard, which brought them further into poverty than ever before.

Thank you for your kind words and empathy - I sincerely appreciate that.
Trying my best to hang in there, thank you <3
It definitely killed all the faith I had left in this "society" to say the least.
For me they were all tied into one.

If you have the money to go gamble, especially during the pandemic, you have the money to be responsible for your debts before you’re *literally sued over them* and *having your paychecks garnished.* 


There’s a difference between “reasoning and plans” for your credit card debt, so dealing with it slowly, and letting it get to the point of collections and garnishments. 


The latter reeks of shadiness, lack of “give a fuck” about one’s actions and responsibilities, and is pretty disgusting from someone in her position. 


(I’ve been poor all my life, and sadly always will be short of a miracle. I *understand* debt, but letting it get to the point she did, whilst in office, out gambling and treating “lesser workers” like shit? What a disgusting person.) 


If the casino thing hadn’t happened, I’d have still found her insanely irresponsible and gross over the credit card situation. So it was on brand for her, and that all ties together.
Yep, it’s disgusting.

Step father shot himself in front of my mom this year in their shared home. The cleaning crew alone would’ve bankrupted her - or me - so I had to try clean the gruesome scene up myself with basic household products, alone, while she fell apart in the hospital waiting for the donor team to harvest his organs. 

I’ll never forget it. It’s indescribable, having to mop up someone’s insides with your bare hands. 

Then came the other costs. For her, and for me. The medical bills, having to live in a hotel while trying to move, therapy, medications, missed work, trying to stay afloat, debts, etc. etc. the list never ends. 


Shit, when my cat, who I loved more than anything on earth and who I had trained to help me manage some of my disability symptoms was mauled to death by a horrible neighbor and her awful dog who fled the scene - he was indoor only and bolted out the door as I came in when startled by a truck backfiring on the street - the bills were so far beyond what I ever could’ve expected. I’m *barely* surviving right now. As if I had any room to breathe after my stepfather passing, the death *of a pet* was so expensive it has nearly put me in the ground. 

It’s insane. Of all the things that shouldn’t be a financial burden, death is surely one of them. As if loss isn’t hard enough for those left behind.


As if *living* isn’t hard enough as it is.
I’ll add another comment, though it looks like more than enough have responded.

I have Kaiser through *OHP,* which surely changes some things a bit, but I see all the same providers a non-OHP person would.


Their dental is fine. Nothing fantastic, nothing *too* bad - it seems like most dentistry in this city is a joke to some extent, and I’m getting a lower standard of care being on OHP anyway, so given those factors, it is sufficient.

Primary care is hit and miss. I’ve had some great providers and some *awful* ones. The upside is there are *tons* of providers, with locations all over the place, so you’re likely to find someone you like - even if it takes a few tries - and appointments are usually plentiful. 

Their sleep lab and sleep doctors are *fucking awful* and a complete joke.

That said, their pharmacy has been great and stress free. I get everything mailed free - including controlled substance medication - and everything is always on time or early. Even during periods of shortages of some meds, they’ve found a way to fill mine - be that working with me on switching manufacturers and switching pill counts, filling elsewhere, etc. 
If you ever take a controlled substance medication you’ll know how important and how much of a godsend not having to do monthly UAs and then having run all over town trying to fill the damn thing is. 

When needing to see a specialist, it’s also hit and miss. Sometimes awesome because they’re in the same complex, readily available, and it’s easy to hit multiple stops in one visit.
Sometimes hellish because appointments are scarce and booked 6+ months out.
Really depends on the department.

I will say my experience with other large medical groups in town has been worse on the pharmacy end, about the same or worse on everything else, so… 🤷‍♀️
Do you not experience sleep paralysis, a common symptom for most Narcoleptics? 
Yeah, I’ll continue to use paralysis to describe sleep paralysis.
Honestly with or without holding it against her, she’s in self preservation mode, and there’s probably a big “sunken cost” aspect of it, too. 

She doesn’t want to be homeless again. She hasn’t even been working lately. She’s already invested this much time, energy, and emotion into the “relationship” and has humiliated herself on a wildly popular reality TV show for quite a while. 
Leaving Ed would mean departing from TLC, having to go back to work and make enough to sustain herself and her lifestyle transition, and she’d likely end up back in her car for a while in the process. 
Even if she’s done and wants to leave *him,* she probably feels like she needs to at least see it through until the point at which she can take something with her when she goes, so it wasn’t all for nothing.
Eh, I think that only really applies so much. 

Unfortunately, in a micro-penis - or close to it - situation it absolutely will matter quite a bit to quite a lot of people. There will be partners who are fine with it or don’t care, but they will be *much* harder to find, and it will absolutely limit the dating pool substantially for those men. 

Dick jokes and insults are cruel and unkind - it’s not something a man has any control over. I do agree with you there!
100%. 

Your friend doesn’t need sex right now, she needs therapy. 
How soon sex will be practical and “healing” after something like this will vary from person to person, but if she hasn’t gotten professional help with the trauma and processing side of things, the answer is “not yet.” 

I wouldn’t get involved in this process if you want to keep her as a friend and have this go smoothly until *at minimum* there is a professional involved in therapy with her.
A budget would be *very* helpful for both software and machines. 

Hatch is a great program, but it’s also $1,000+. This isn’t practical for everyone, especially people who are mostly hobbyists.

Machines can start at $450ish for something that does embroidery, and can go into the $6,000+ range for a multi needle, more capable machine.
Wow, clay! Amazing! Super well done - I definitely would’ve guessed 3D printed, clay must’ve taken a ton of time and effort. Thanks for sharing ☺️
*Thank you.* 

His response to my comment told me everything I need to know about him, frankly. Impossible to miss the *real* meaning behind that jab!
I didn’t really have time to think about it, unfortunately. 

My best bud was mauled to death by a shitty pit bull. It was a completely unexpected loss - he was indoor only, and bolted out the door when startled as my partner came in - so we didn’t have time to think about final arrangements, we had to do *something* with him. 

I haven’t regretted cremation, though. We rent, so burial never crossed my mind - and even if we owned, I’d be worried about moving someday, as I’d feel devastated to leave him behind. 
We have a shelf set up in our kitchen above where he used to eat, and decorated it with photos of him, the paw prints and fur clippings they took at the cremation facility, and his urn. 
It feels good to have a memorial for him in our home, and the peace of mind of knowing he will be able to move with us wherever life takes us is priceless. 
Plus, he’s inside with us, where he always was - not outside under a bush. Something about that just feels “right” to me. This is his home, and he’s here.
I’m not sure what you’re getting at, exactly. 

People use the term “exotic dancer” to mean stripper in the US. 

People could also say “erotic dancer” and it would be correct, but I don’t think that’s used nearly as much - or at least, I haven’t seen it often at all. Exotic is definitely the term used, and it definitely is used to describe a stripper, not a person of a minority group/who is otherwise foreign.
What a unique and incredibly touching compliment, wow. Your comment is just so wonderfully kind, you seriously warmed my heart! Thank you *so* much! 

I can definitely be an asshole and a cynic - probably *too much* of the time, admittedly - sometimes on the internet, but I try to be as genuinely kind and caring as I can when I can, too. I’m glad that side of me translates here, and thank you for the reminder to choose to be that way more ☺️ 
You rock, please continue being you, too!
Oh no!! Overly salty is literally THE WORST, I am so glad both the OP and your comment saved me the cost and hassle.

When you don't get to treat yourself often, there's nothing worse than the food being literally repulsive, and you feeling like you've somehow left yourself in a "treat deficit" as a result. Nope nope nope.
Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts on all the close by spots! We've lived in this rental for two years and have only been to Pizza Roma - went once with my partners mom earlier last year as they have a huge patio and it seemed like a "safe spot" to eat outdoors when she was worried about COVID/traveling - so I've been curious about the other places close by.

For the most part, it seems like everything in the immediate vicinity - aside from Super Torta, which I've been told countless times to avoid - is probably "pretty good" but definitely a bit pricy. Not that we don't venture outside of the neighborhood, but we're on such a tight budget as it is, and go out to eat so infrequently, if there isn't something outstanding close by to support might as well stay in!
I'm gonna be honest... I have always assumed Otto's is just a meat market, and doesn't sell "hot food" so haven't even had it on my radar as a place to potentially check out!

Thank you for the rundown on some of the other spots around! 

We are such rare dine-outers that we've not really ventured to any of the close by spots, despite living in this rental for 2 years now, but I've definitely been curious about our options should we decide to treat ourselves.

The noodle place seems decent, but their menu looked a bit pricy. I'm a huge fan of Thai so I'm stoked to hear there's potentially a good spot close by!
Oh no! I'm so sorry for your experience, that sounds truly terrible.

I have friends who swear by that place, and I'm way too broke to care about going out to eat these days, but was considering giving them a shot for a splurge after a big surgery I have coming up, since they're cheap and I absolutely love and constantly crave  smash burgers. Definitely will avoid this place now.
Thank you for the reviews!

We don't get out to eat much, maybe a couple times a year if that, so haven't really been anywhere in the neighborhood despite living in this rental for 2 years - and always in inner SE through different apartments, just different chunks - and I felt a bit lost this week trying to come up with recommendations while we both had family in town.

I still have yet to try Super Deluxe, even - people won't stop recommending it because of my affinity for In N Out - but Dick's is literally 10ish blocks from me, so I've been curious whether it's worth the venture/cost eventually or not. 

Sounds like it wouldn't hurt to give it a chance! Worst case, we tried something new, best case, we find a new favorite.
And yet their ask is for *WFH jobs,* specifically.


Not even factoring in the multitude of reasons why *joining the military* isn’t a job recommendation to be taken lightly.
“Real men” has nothing to do with this *at all.* 

You can respect sex work as work and have no problem with sex workers and still not want a relationship with someone in that line of work/who is a stripper. 
Just like you can respect someone who bartends but not want to be in a relationship with someone who works until 4am around alcohol and drunk people every night. 
Or not want to date someone who is a traveling truck driver and is away for long lengths of time. 

People are allowed to have preferences, boundaries, and dealbreakers. 

Stripping comes with its own baggage, risks, and problems. People who dance deserve respect and love but they *will not* be the right partner for *everyone* for a multitude of reasons, including crazy hours, risky environments/clients, etc. 

And that’s perfectly fine. It doesn’t make someone not a “real man” for having different values, boundaries, or wants in a partner/relationship.
I promise you, “exotic dancer” *never* refers to a person who is part of a minority group and also dances in a *non-sexual* way. At least in the states. 
It’s nearly *always* referring to a stripper or otherwise sexual, erotic “dancer”
Wasn’t aware the military was WFH.
What a gem you are. 

Absolutely disgusting.
He doesn’t *owe* you *shit.* 

If you can’t even muster up the nerve to ask the man *to do it in the first place,* nonetheless ask him *why he hasn’t,* how the hell does he *owe you* anything?

Is he supposed to be able to read your mind? Do you expect him to just out of the blue *sense* that you want this “owed” explanation, and provide it in a satisfactory way?! 

Part of being *an adult* in a sexual relationship is acting like *an adult* and communicating your needs, wants, questions, concerns, etc. in a relationship. 

No one is *owed* anything. If you want something, use your words. If you’re confused about something, buck up and clarify. 

If you’re comfortable enough to fuck the man you’re comfortable enough to ask him some basic questions about a very basic sex act.
“You’ll also feel better about yourself” - speak for *yourself* buddy. 

People who are *truly* disabled and *truly* can’t work sure the fuck won’t “feel better about themselves” trying to force themselves to handle the demeaning shitshow that 90% of jobs available are. 
Quite frankly, there is *nothing* that feels **worse** to some of us than trying to manage working while disabled. 
Regardless of how pathetic and harmful the SSI/SSDI system/benefits are, for some, it’s the *only* thing that gives *any* semblance of decent quality of life back to disabled folks.
No problem! 😇

Best of luck making the switch! Cats can be really picky but eventually they’ll take to it if you keep consistent - there’s some great tips online for gradually switching over that I highly recommend versus just thrusting them right into it.
I’ve been to a bunch of Banfield locations and they’ve all been absolutely shit. 
Literally the McDonald’s of vet care. Wouldn’t take my cats there even in a dire emergency at this point.
I live close by and I’ve been wondering about that place. We never go out to eat, but I always wonder what in the neighborhood is “worth it” on the off chance we can afford a treat out, or have family in town or something. 
Sounds like this place is nothing special - and I’m always happy to skip something overpriced!
Our street is pretty dark - *desperately* needs a fucking street light, but apparently that’s never going to happen - so I didn’t think we’d have anyone down our block, but my partner put an “honor system” bowl out anyway. 
I was surprised, we had a solid 10-12 folks come by - doorbell camera, so I was able to actually count.
We’re directly connected to Woodstock proper, lower 60’s. 
Kids looked cold and bundled up/lots of umbrellas. 
I’m not a big “kids person,” but I was glad we put a bowl out, so much of our neighborhood was lights off/no decor and it was probably slim pickings out there for em.
Right??

None of us have to *agree* with her, share her insecurities, or understand everything she’s thinking, but the bottom line is she’s entitled to her own boundaries and feelings on the matter.
Just like some people have a boundary that stripe clubs aren’t okay, or interacting with cam girls/OnlyFans girls is unacceptable, or whatever else, having a boundary about not wanting a partner who *films pornographic or overtly sexual, nude content” is okay. 
OP doesn’t have to agree with or follow the boundary, but his partner is well within her rights to leave the relationship if he’s unwilling to accept her boundaries.

While this wouldn’t be a hard dealbreaker for me, I wouldn’t really want to continue down the path of a long term relationship with someone who will be spending *months if not years* filming pornographic material for a living.
It doesn’t really remain “on top” of the *litter,* because they absolutely still dig and bury the poops. I would say they don’t dig it as deep in - you don’t have to go hunting for it, especially if you keep up on scooping - but it will get slightly coated in the pellets, which is great because that keeps the smell nonexistent. 
The urine doesn’t stick to the pellets and doesn’t clump in the box, and simply drains down into the tray below - since it isn’t collecting in the box, you have a solid layer of pellets on the bottom, and then I’d explain it as the top layer being where the poop is, with a solid layer of pellets surrounding it. I’ve never just had exposed poop on the top in the box, it’s always at minimum coated in a good amount of pellets - they *do* stick to the poop - as they definitely still kick the pellets at it or “bury it” with small swipes of litter immediately after going. 
I’ve also noticed that with the pellet system, cats seem less interested in “digging around” in the box, or kicking up litter everywhere. They go, do a little of that backwards-kick covering thing, or swipe a little on top, and then get out and on with their day. It’s all business all the time if they’re in there, never any playing around or making a mess.
The Breeze system is the *only* thing I’ll use, *ever.*

I’ve had cats my entire life - since childhood - and *god* everything else is just disgusting and fails in comparison. Once you know how it can be, you can’t go back. 

I swear I haven’t smelled the box *once* since I started using the system - and I’ve used it with 3 different cats now, first time with my solo cat, and then now with my two 6.5 month old kittens who share a box - even when I’ve accidentally let it go a few extra days.
Litter pellets *never* leave the box, and the pad makes cleaning it so easy, and so much less gross/messy. 
Absolutely love it.

I’ve seen cheap knock-off versions and they weren’t anywhere near as good. Other kinds of pellets I’ve seen - my mom tried many - smelled absolutely horrible after a day or two, or were a disastrous mess to clean. 

Breeze system is the way. I know I probably sound silly getting this hyped over a cat box but when it works it works.
👏👏👏👏
I wouldn’t call stuffing your basic humans needs down so far that you eventually turn LL - and are “kept ok” - with the aid of SSRIs no less, “evolving” - it would seem you’ve *devolved* into being able to tolerate the situation you’re in, since you’ve chosen to stay the course, but I wouldn’t elevate that to “evolving” at all. 

I’m glad you’ve found your peace with things and have found happiness with your family, but I really hate seeing these kind of one sided compromises branded as “evolving” when they most certainly are not.
I had a black version of this as a kid!! It was black and white, and was a big pull over poncho type thing. I wish I would’ve kept it into adulthood just for the sake of having. 
What an awesome creation!
u/Just_Trying2Makeit

Enough. This isn't the place to discuss your hypothetical, angsty legal threats, and the discussion about your supposed "previous legal ventures" are off-topic and not welcome here.

Threatening other users is also clearly unacceptable. Consider this a warning before a temporary ban.
I mean, the failure of drug decriminalization certainly didn't help, and is creating a ton of additional problems here, as well as barriers to attempting any kind of solutions.

And again, so fucking what? So what if it's happening in cities outside of Oregon? Again, this does nothing productive for our problems here, and is counterproductive to any meaningful conversation on the subject of our problems ***here.***
It's counter-productive to any worthwhile, meaningful conversation about what is happening ***here***, or acknowledging that Portland has ***very*** real, ***very*** big problems that ***very*** much need change.

So fucking what if it's happening "everywhere" - it isn't, by the way, happening ***everywhere.***

The important point is that it's ***happening here,*** and nothing is being done about it - or at least, nothing substantial that's proving to be causing any real change.

It's okay to admit that shit is bad *here*, and to focus just on the problems *here*. Shifting focus elsewhere does just that, and there's been more than enough of that over the years, frankly.
*Thank you.*

I came to the comments to say similar. 

I don't give a ***flying fuck*** about your "STATS" - I know what my day to day life here is ***really*** like, and the experiences of close friends and family.   
We may not have been murdered, and we may be unlikely to actually be killed on the street, but that doesn't excuse the very real, very constant dangers occurring all around us at all times.

Call these stats whatever you want, spin them however you want to push your view or angle, but to act like anything in this post "proves" anything of value is just silly.  
These "stats" don't cancel out all the *very* fucked up shit all around us happening at an alarmingly high rate. It doesn't negate the ***very real, very constant*** crimes ***all over*** the city. 

And for fucks sake, can we stop pretending like Portland doesn't have a lot of fucking problems, already?  
I get it, it's not fun to talk about. It isn't fun to acknowledge that all this bad stuff is going on.   
But pretending it isn't, acting like it "isn't *that* bad," or shrugging it off with a careless "it's happening *everywhere*" isn't doing ***anything*** good for us. It's counterproductive, in fact. 

There are very real, very bad crimes happening here all the time. At a much higher rate than before. With a lot more enabling than before. With a lot more slaps on the wrist than before.

Hard to add data to statistics when things aren't being called in, when cops aren't showing up/taking reports/able to do anything, when people aren't actually receiving consequences, or ending up in jail, etc.

I can tell you that assaults - violent and sexual - theft, break ins, stabbings, shootings, arson, vandalism, car theft, other forms of property crime, etc. are all very much happening here, *a-fucking-lot.*  
I don't give a fuck what some soap-boxing, holier-than-thou Redditor wants to spin it as. Shit here is ***not good,*** and I'm tired of it. I don't feel safe from a lot of things here, and rightfully so. I may not be that worried about being murdered, but I shouldn't have so damn many "menaced by, violently assaulted by, robbed by, chased by, etc." stories from homeless/drug addicts in this city - nor should my friends and family.

I don't think "homicides" is a great singular metric for danger, at all. A city can be dangerous, miserable, filthy, unpleasant, unsafe, and falling apart/being destroyed with a "below average" homicide rate. Just look around. We're in one.
This person is infuriating, holy dang. Felt like I was beating my head against a wall just reading their responses. I’d stop responding to this one, nothing of intelligence to be gained 😂
Right?? 

Like the “Drazen is a good politician, but a terrible liar” - am I supposed to want to vote for Kotek based on that sentence? Why? 
Seems like Kotek doesn’t even know how to have a functional, positive narrative in her own ad campaign… doesn’t exactly give me faith in her abilities as a politician. 

If all you have to say in your ads - which should be an attempt to gain voter interest in checking you out, at minimum - is ridiculous smear campaign accusations and finger pointing, with little to nothing about what you’re proposing to do when elected, I for one am *not* interested in voting for you.
Right?? It doesn't matter how long I nap, they're completely useless - I never feel any better, and I *certainly* **don't** *ever* feel refreshed, or freshened up, or in any way rested.

And how the fuck is a Narcoleptic supposed to control how long a nap goes for? If I had that ability, I wouldn't be half as crippled by this shitty disease. I have zero control over how long I will sleep for once I attempt to sleep - no amount of alarms, other people, or willpower will change that. I turn alarms off in my sleep hours before they even go off! Fucks sake.

And yes, this is medicated or unmedicated... \*eyeroll\* 

Doctors never get it, I can't believe how awful the standard of care for Narcolepsy is.
Well… honestly… Judging by the fact that 110 - and so many other dumb taxes, measures, etc. - passed, it appears we - well, not *me* specifically, I absolutely knew it was a horrible idea and voted against it - *very much are* a bunch of idiots who don’t understand the difference between a cool idea and something that is actually workable.
Also, *no one* gets paid enough to have to watch that shit on the job on their security footage. 


Part of having risky, public/outdoor sex is being mature enough not to force your sexual behaviors onto other people. 
No one is consenting to watching you, having to hear you, or deal with your shit, and a mature, respectful adult realizes this, accepts that the world is not their fuck-pad, and does everything they can to ensure no one will have to witness their sexual escapades. 
Be a mature adult, please. 


There are various charges/fines you could catch if caught, as well. Especially in places where a child may be around/witness. 

There’s nothing “wrong” with outdoor/public sex - I’ve done it, myself - but being “freaky” doesn’t excuse you from basic respectfulness - to others and public places - and basic responsibility. 
If she argues it “kills the fun” to have to do so much planning, or do it “safely” then she’s not mature enough to be engaging in a kinky, adult sexual relationship - and is an asshole, frankly. 

Be smart, be respectful, and have fun.
He’s *stealing* from his entire family, and selling it to get shit he wants that he doesn’t need. 

When you live with your parents free of charge and choose to steal from the household, isolate in your room, and do nothing but smoke weed all day, you understandably lose the kind of respect and privacy rights a responsible adult would normally have. 

Crossdressing - or whatever he is doing with the lingerie - isn’t the problem here. OP made that clear, as well, you’ve just chosen to ignore it. The problem is that he’s a thief, and that he violated his sister by going through her things and stealing it. 

If he doesn’t want his mother checking up on him and his things, he can stop rooting through everyone else’s belongings and taking them as he sees fit. 
Or, he can get his shit together and work on moving out or seeking self sufficiency so he can better provide for himself and get the things he wants. 
He can speak with his parents about wanting to find a way to earn some cash to purchase non-necessity items. 
At no point is it okay or understandable for him to steal from his family just because he wants something. 

He is living there free of charge whilst stealing from the home. Most parents/people cohabitating would be doing what the mom and sister are doing to try to get their things back, keep a watch on the problem, etc.
Frankly, I’d have kicked his ass out, personally.
This is how it feels for me, too - if I’m understanding your description properly. 

My body is in sleep mode, but I can still think. I’m having thoughts and internal dialogue, and I can hear shit going on around me. But I’m also experiencing a dream simultaneously.
Sumatriptan makes me feel the strangest kind of horrible. There’s something just really awful about it. My entire head, face, chest, and body feel *wrong* and *fucking bad* but I can’t quite describe the sensation. 
Sometimes I kills a migraine or cluster headache but just as often it does nothing and leaves me feeling fucking horrendous instead.
I’ve always been curious what exactly it’s doing that causes these feelings but I’m sure I’ll never get an answer.
We - two adults, two kittens - rent a 3 bedroom, two story townhouse. 
We have our bedroom, the “office room” - my desktop, Cricut, embroidery machine, craft supplies, and organized storage bins of stuff like seasonal/holiday items, off season clothes, keepsakes, etc. - and the “music room” - which is where my musician partner has his recording gear, instruments, etc. 


If anything, we’d opt for a fourth room if we were ever fortunate enough to afford buying a house, in order to have a small, modest guest room that could double as storage, extra cat play zone, other activity/crafting space when we don’t have guests. 


You know what is right for you. Sounds like you have just the perfect amount of space for your needs!
Having an extra room for guests/future needs is ideal, I’d say - we hate kids, so wouldn’t be planning it for that potential purpose, but that’s a bonus for some people - and keeps you from feeling too cramped when visitors happen.
Plus, if you end up wanting a second “office space” or more room for a hobby or craft, or need some extra storage, there you go!
Yep, it’s all about *what* you’re eating during your window.

If you tend to reach for high calorie, junky foods, and tend to have a “mini binge” during your window, you’re absolutely going to go over most, if not every time, and you’ll be continuously disappointed by the scale during your OMAD ventures. 

Having an idea of the general range of calories of your commonly eaten foods, and being cautious about serving sizes will definitely help even if you aren’t weighting foods and calorie counting strictly.
I wouldn’t doubt she lied about it. Bitch is disgusting and will do anything to keep the spotlight anywhere near her, and to stay relevant enough to remain a feature of the 90D franchise. 
I don’t believe a word she says about Syngin or *anyone* or *anything* - and neither should anyone else. 
If the alleged abuse doesn’t stop you from clout chasing bullshit like this, it wasn’t abuse, and it certainly isn’t relevant. 

At least she isn’t fucking her sister in *this one,* I guess. Not that we won’t see that repeat in the future, probably.

Your second paragraph is an excellent point. 

I haven’t take the MAX since 2019, and there’s no way in hell you’d catch me on it, or a bus, now. (Granted, due to disabilities neither is an option for me anymore for a variety of reasons, but even if they were) 


I was hassled, attacked, threatened, and screamed at enough on both during pre-pandemic years. Now? If the behaviors the unhinged display on the street are any indication of what I can expect in an enclosed space… fuck no.
They seem to be doing this kind of thing at a lot of their locations, and I agree - it’s so unpleasant and adds such additional hassle that it completely puts me off shopping there.

The Mall 205 Target had damn near everything in the electronics department not just wrapped in an alarm device, but physically chained to the shelves *in addition to that.* 
Of course, not a single employee to be found anywhere, and after walking the entire top floor and finally finding someone - who, upon asking, had *no idea* if I’d ever be helped, “I think they all left 10 minutes ago. Or uh, someone should be out in 5 minutes. Yeah. I dunno.” - I ended up standing there for 10 more minutes only to have someone finally come out and act like I was ruining their entire life asking to have the item removed from its shackles so I could purchase it. 
If it hadn’t have been a necessity I needed quickly I would’ve bailed on the entire experience, but surely won’t be doing so again. It’s a shame this is what things have come to with all the unmanaged theft in this city.

Wouldn’t be surprised if plexiglass barriers in fast food/pizza places started becoming the norm too, like in other places I’ve lived.
I've been looking into the Ricoma leasing program you're referencing for similar reasons - $135 a month seems like an excellent deal when you consider you're getting a multi-needle machine, plus the digitizing side of things. There aren't exactly a plethora of companies out there offering a bundle like that, and it makes it a lot more reasonable and accessible for those of us who don't have the privilege of thousands of dollars up front to throw into a pro machine and digitizing software.

I think something big to consider is what your goals are, and whether or not signing onto something like this is going to be the best route to achieving them, while also being a sound idea financially.

If you are just looking for a minor side hustle, or to practice and maintain a mostly hobbyist level, I don't know that this would be the route to go.Getting a hobby machine and a medium-tier digitizing software and starting to devote time and energy to practicing with that, while maybe selling some custom things as you improve, but keeping things on a small scale would definitely be more advisable if you're not trying to "start a business" or really invest the kind of time, money, and energy that starting down the path of leasing a big machine like this would warrant.

If you think you're ready to devote that time, money, and energy into really going full force ahead with machine embroidery, and you see yourself really working at developing a "brand" or a "shop"/business, then by all means, this isn't a "bad" route to start investigating further, and potentially moving forward with.

The easier to use/learn programs like Hatch are a solid $1,000+ right off the bat, and that's without a decent machine. Hobbyist machines really *aren't* practical for anything more than *very* small scale Etsy shops with *very* low sales volume, and if you already know you want to move forward on a larger scale, it might make more sense to invest that money into a leased multi-needle machine/pricier digitizing software so you can really dive in big right at the start.

This kind of thing also has a lot to do with your personal finances/financial ability. Clearly $135 a month isn't out of the question for you, since you're here asking, but you have to also factor in materials, utility cost, and the cost of the time you'd need to put in to see that money being worth investing. If you have a full time job already, for example, and don't often have an abundance of free time, you will have to work a lot harder to make up for that $135, plus materials/other costs, than someone who pursues this as a full time, self-employed path.

All of the above points are of course assuming you're even looking to get into selling your designs/custom things, and aren't just primarily doing this for yourself/friends/family/very small scale. If you don't have any interest on generating income from machine embroidery - however big or small those income goals would be - then all it really comes down to is whether or not $135 a month - before materials/utilities - for a personal hobby/interest is practical and "worth it" to you.

I can't personally speak to the quality of a Ricoma machine. I have used their software to digitize a couple times - was lucky enough to have a friend with the software and tried it a few times at their home - and I loved it, personally. I have used about 5 "30 day trials" of Hatch, and produced hundreds of designs in those trial periods, and I can say that I absolutely liked Ricoma's software better, and found it much nicer to use, with a lot better design results for a lot less effort. I am by no means an expert digitizer, so found it really easy to understand and learn as someone with an intermediate level of digitizing knowledge/skill.

I have watched a ton of videos about their machines on Youtube, and while it's obvious there are a lot of "paid reviewers" pumping up the company/machines with positive reviews, I can also see from these videos that the machines do a *perfectly fine, good job* of stitching out designs. The machines do produce quality outcomes, and that's what's important to me.

Are they the best company around, with the best machines? No, probably not.Are there issues with the company, reps, and machines? I have no doubts.But as someone who otherwise would not be able to afford to have access to a multi-needle machine and nice digitizing software, and begin to really get more serious with machine embroidery, I think that their program has a lot of benefits, and would be perfectly suitable for my needs, and for producing the kinds of things I want to create.(Whereas my hobbyist level Brother machine certainly cannot.)

A lot of people come to threads like this one and go, "it's a rip off" and "look for a used \_\_\_\_ higher end brand" or "finance \_\_\_\_" or "save up for \_\_\_\_."  
That is not a possibility for everyone, and for those of us that lack the financial privilege some of these commenters have, the Ricoma plan is a potentially beneficial option to have access to a better machine, software, and to be able to advance with machine embroidery, and other personal goals. Only you will know what you're able to do and what is feasible for you, and it's important to do what you need to for yourself, that is within you ability and affordable to you. Even if it isn't the best machine on earth, if it's a stepping stone to advancing, having more resources to later upgrade, etc.... I'd say it's worth it.

Their reps have been great to talk to so far, and while I'm unsure if I will take the plunge, it has certainly not been a waste of time to look into.

Best of luck with whatever you decide, and wherever your machine embroidery path takes you!
I’m probably missing something obvious or misunderstanding what you’re referring to specifically but… what does propranolol have in common with stimulants, here? (Forgive me if I’m connecting your comment to the wrong one by mistake, on mobile it appears your response is in reply to “depends on how much of the stimulants their surgical partners prescribe them they took”)
The refusal to take side effects seriously or acknowledge that they may outweigh benefits is pretty baffling. 


When I was requesting medication to help with falling/staying asleep after an extremely traumatic event - had to clean up my stepfathers gruesome suicide aftermath, solo, bare hands, and watch my mom care for his “living corpse” on machines for a week for organ harvesting with a pretty poorly covered head wound - I made it very clear that though I was experiencing PTSD - and anxiety/panic related to that, though almost entirely at bedtime/overnight - I was not interested in anti-depressants, and only wanted a temporary sleep aide. 



I had multiple primary care doctors try to push them anyway, trying to convince me that I must be anxious/depressed *all the time* and not just at night, or that my problems could only be solved with SSRIs, not a sleep-related medication. 


I explained my disinterest and cited the extremely common and awful side effects as one of many reasons, and got some of the most ridiculous responses. 


“Well, if you care about your well-being badly enough, dealing with ____ is a pretty manageable trade off to not be crippled by anxiety/depression anymore.”


I literally said, “I am unwilling to risk, for example, destroying my sex life, sexual enjoyment, and sexual drive for a medication.”


“Well when you’re really suffering, sex is usually not really important in comparison to fixing the issue.” - are you kidding me? Sure, let me destroy my sex life with my partner and zap all physical enjoyment and pleasure out of my life. That won’t have immeasurable consequences in my relationship, or cause me more depression.
This is the only explanation needed, frankly. 


It doesn’t matter what/who you aren’t attracted to, that can’t be helped. No one should be trying to persuade you or change your mind - you like what you like, and for the most part, those things aren’t changeable/a conscious choice. 


What matters is if it stays a personal preference, or if it becomes a personal belief that you’re trying to put on others, or use to demean others. 


Like you said - “I’m personally not attracted to ___” is fine.
Developing that into “All ___ are unattractive” crossed the line. 


I feel like the “openness” behind it comes into play, too. 


For instance, thinking/saying, *”I’m personally not attracted to black women, but if I did meet one and found myself drawn to her, attracted to her, and wanting to date her, that wouldn’t be a problem for me, though it hasn’t happened up to this point”* 

vs.


 *”I don’t find black women attractive and would absolutely not date one for any reason, regardless of who they are. I’m confident I will *never* find a single attractive one out there.”*
Exactly how it should be! 


We’re all adults here, let’s act like it. 


Clearly your child is having intimate relations with their romantic, relationship partner. 
You don’t have to share sex stories and get raunchy with them - nor they with you - but parents who act offended or disgusted or possessive over their *adult* child having sex are juvenile and frankly pathetic. 



My partners parents are the perfect balance in this area. It was never even a question of if I would be sleeping in the same room/bed as him when we have visited them, it was a given. (No, we aren’t married, for context.) 
They’ve never made any uncomfortable comments or questioned us about anything sexual/our sex lives, but on the infrequent occasion a sexual story or joke comes up - or some form of media leans sexual - we all chuckle, maybe drop a goofy one liner or joke of our own, and move on. 


There is a clear but unspoken “we’re the parents, there is a level of appropriateness” vibe to things, but it’s never stiff, strict, or overreaching, and we both feel respected as adults in an adult relationship. There isn’t a vibe of infantilizing him, me, our relationship, or what happens between adults who are partnered, and I *really* appreciate that.


It boggles my mind when I’ve read posts about couples being forced to sleep in separate rooms/one on the couch one in the guest bed when visiting parents. 
Unless your kid - or their partner - are completely out of control and disrespect the situation by having crazy, loud sex when visiting, it’s *insanely* disrespectful to undermine your child’s relationship like that. 


If you can’t wrap your mind around - and respect - your kid having sex as an adult… you shouldn’t be a parent, first off. 


The scenario in OP might be a little “uncomfy” depending on how well the partner knows the parents, and the personal sense of humor of all involved, but shouldn’t require more than a chuckle and moving on.
I’ll second this, and add - denying *children* forced into mental holds or “troubled youth boarding facilities” the right to call parents/direct family/*anyone* while inside. 


Allows for absolutely unhinged levels of abuse and mistreatment that go completely unreported and unchecked, all while the facilities feed parents lines about how anything the kids say regarding mistreatment is a lie meant to manipulate them into bringing them home.
This kind of shit is horrific but no one talks about it. You think care facilities for adults are bad… these are another level entirely.
God, what an exhaustingly miserable and frustrating person you are.
What a useful, respectful, necessary comment. Well done 🙄
Wow, that’s in *amazing* condition! Absolutely no way at that price, but how gorgeous! So well kept.
Don’t want to be a Debbie downer by any means, but this is sadly not always the case. 

DoorDash almost *never* refunds/replaced the order for the customer when something gets fucked up/never arrives. They’re absolutely the worst about this of all the delivery companies I’ve ever used. 

Grubhub and UberEats *might* make it right for the customer if they feel so inclined but also are likely to tell you to get fucked, especially if you’ve had an order messed up with them before - which unfortunately isn’t an uncommon occurrence, it seems. 

I’m glad OP had a come up like this, and they absolutely shouldn’t ever feel bad - it’s not like they hid it from the person looking for it, this was 100% a good omen for them! - just don’t want to give these companies more credit than they deserve, because they fuck over their customers *so often* and for people who don’t have money to throw away, it stings.
This is *wildly* dependent on where you live in Portland, what your needs are, what your schedule is like, etc. 

The blanket “no one needs one here” statement couldn’t be more wrong.
Do you ever get tired of being so incredibly wrong, and so incredibly predictable? Or is my assessment that you have nothing of value going on in your life and you feed off your own toxicity and downvotes accurate? 

Anyway, enjoy your weekend, bud! Not going to feed the troll any longer.
I never said that, and you damn well know it. It’s clear all you exist to do on this subreddit is argue and twist words.

Regardless, you know I never said that. 

I’m all for sanctioned camps. I’m not in support of putting people who actually pay for their housing and are just trying to get by in this filthy city through more hell by shoving them into neighborhoods or areas mostly populated by housing.
Industrial areas/other spaces not directly in neighborhoods do exist, believe it or not. Put them there. 
We’ve had enough of them in our neighborhoods, we don’t need to sanction an entire shanty town tent village for them near more of them.
The only alternative to “I don’t want these criminal, violent, unhinged zombies living directly near my house in chaotic, filthy, hazardous camps” *isn’t* “well we just won’t have them at all then!” 

Believe it or not, industrial areas exist, as do other areas outside of fucking neighbors and dense housing sections of our city. 

They can easily opt to put this shit somewhere like that instead of putting those of us who actually pay for our housing and would like to maintain some semblance of livability at it through more hell.
Look, I get it - these types of things have to go *somewhere,* obviously. 



But calling people NIMBYs simply because they don’t want the place they live to be infested with criminal drug addicts that assault, harass, threaten, burglarize, and attack whoever they can, while destroying and littering every square inch available to them - often with human feces and hazardous used drug paraphernalia - leaving filth, causing rat infestations, and even causing out of control fires - which have literally *burned peoples homes* as a result - is a bit ridiculous.



It’s *understandable* why no one wants these types of “safe rest villages” or “camping compounds” in their fucking neighborhoods. 
People who’ve dealt with these types around the city have already had enough of the deplorable behavior they exhibit and the disgusting conditions they leave spaces in. 



I’m *absolutely not sorry* to be one of many voices to say, you know what, I pay *too damn much* in rent for my overpriced, already unsafe place to live to want a literal *shanty town* of “authorized campers” - and with them, unending chaos - to move in anywhere *close* to my domicile. 



I have been stolen from, assaulted, harassed, chased, threatened, flashed, etc. *fucking enough* in this city by our tent camping “community members.”
Hell, some asshole with a *nail bat* threatened me at my neighborhood Plaid two weeks ago. 
If not wanting to welcome a compound of them into my immediate blocks makes me a NIMBY, what the fuck ever. 


Again, yes, *I get it.* They have to go *somewhere.* 
But I’m also in the camp that feels there has to be a place to put them that doesn’t punish the “housed community” more than the lack of action on this already has year after year. If that means placing these in industrial districts or away from areas with mostly housing/neighborhoods I am all for that, personally.
Thank you so much! You absolutely rock - I look forward to trying to stitch the design out myself, if you still feel like sharing whenever you're back :)

It looks seriously great! Thanks for sharing!
Thank you so much for the information! Really appreciate those tips - and hadn't heard of that machine model, it looks really nice!

I guess I more asked about the machine because a heavier duty, more "pro" machine can definitely handle stitching through thick, tough material a bit better than a lower end - I have found this to be the case with really dense designs on thick fabric, anyway!

Can I bother you with one more question? Where do you buy your black denim? (Or is there a "type" you use specifically?)  
I've gotten a few recommendations from this sub for materials - felt being a big example - but after purchasing some from Joanne's, found it was definitely not the most optimal, possibly because I wasn't buying the right kind like the person recommended.

Sorry to bother you so much! Thanks again for sharing :)
I’m surprised I haven’t seen more comments about her ads. 
I’m absolutely sick of them.

They tell me *nothing* about Kotek’s platform, values, etc. - just that all “friends of Tina Kotek” know how to do is pay for low effort, finger pointing garbage full of buzz-words.

We get it, Tina, Drazan is “bad and MAGA and Q-Anon” all in one. 

But what the fuck do *you* have to offer? 

How about dealing with the homeless - the service resistant, violent, criminal one’s littering our streets and attacking residents at an insane rate - in a way that doesn’t just throw more money at them? 

Crime? The shootings I’m constantly witnessing/hearing blocks from my overpriced apartment? 

Nah, not gonna prioritize those things, what Oregonians really care about and what’s *really* gonna win you votes is ads full of childish name-calling. Cool. 

If a campaign ad is meant to draw in interest from voters, she has lost me completely in a mere minute and a half with that shit.
Oof, you’re entitled to your thoughts and boundaries, but this is absolutely off the rails. 


Humans are visual, curious creatures. We love to expand our minds, fantasize, experience new things, etc. 
For the same movies are mentally stimulating, visually and mentally arousing, and captivate our minds, pornography is an appealing visual aide to many. 
It means *nothing.* You aren’t “cheating” on your job or your home by watching a movie about a different lifestyle. 
Media allows us to explore different things and enjoy different scenarios without actually doing them - which further extends to, and speaks to the fact that often what people fantasize about, and watch porn about, isn’t necessarily what they want in real life, or their preference. 

By your logic, are you not emotionally cheating if you watch a film or read a book about romance? Are you not throwing yourself into characters and scenarios about love and relationships that aren’t with your partner, and lusting after them, or feeling excited by them? 

And where does it end? If you see an attractive person on the street, and you unintentionally think “damn they’re sexy” or have a brief fantasy about them sexually - not intentionally, of course, most peoples brains just do this - are you cheating then? 
Is a film with nudity okay? A sexually charged song or advertisement? 

I could see drawing a line with cam girls/OnlyFans type stuff, where you’re paying a human money and potentially interacting with them for porn/sexual stimulation. Yes, sex work is a job, and many wouldn’t consider frequenting a cam girl cheating, but I can also see the argument for it being too much, and crossing that line - because you *are* interacting sexually with another person, even if only digitally. 

But porn sites? Seriously? There’s no interaction there. It’s the same as seeing a film in the theater - you’re not cheating with Leonardo DiCaprio just because he gets sexual on screen.
Very well said, and great comparison. 

Since we’re playing to OPs insecurities here, I guess I’d add - it’s not that the people in porn are objectively more attractive, or better at sex than I find my partner to be. It’s a nice visual aide, I enjoy viewing different kinds of things, but the best partner/best sex out there for me is my partner. 
It’s not that they’re “not enough” or I’m enjoying “something objectively better” - it’s just a meaningless visual aide - like any movie - during “me time,” which my partner can’t always be there for, and frankly during times I don’t always want to have full sex or have the time for it.
Interesting! What type of machine? 

I mainly got into machine embroidery to make patches, and I’ve definitely been struggling to find the right material - everything I’ve used never seems to be firm and flat like yours looks 🥲
Your patch looks excellent!
That looks great! Can I ask what kind of fabric you use?
Alrighty, unfortunately I'm going to have to lock the comments on this one.

r/Smite is not a place to debate global minimum wages, politics, the economy, personal finances, HiRez's financial status/decisions, the value of currency, or any of the other completely off-topic tangents the comments section has devolved into.

Anything that needed to be said on this topic - and then some - has been said. We're going to leave it there.

Thank you!
Alrighty u/Blevyzga_ and u/PokeMeiFYouDare \- going to have to shut this conversation down at this point, as it's devolved into bickering, and isn't a constructive, respectful conversation.

Speculation as to why an account was banned has no place on r/Smite, and is against the posted subreddit rules. Any account related problems should be addressed with Smite/HiRez directly.

Further back and forth regarding this subject will be removed - enough has been said at this point.

Thank you for your understanding!

You're fucking joking, right?

You must be either *really* privileged, *really* ignorant, or both to think there's no uptick in crime here.

Or, sorry, have we all just been *imagining* all the shootings, stabbings, robberies, car thefts, assaults, rapes, businesses devastated by smash-and-grabs, arsons, destruction of countless public areas, littering, etc.  
For some ungodly reason,  some people don't count the mass amounts of filthy, hazardous, open air drug markets in the city as "criminal activity" but it absolutely counts, especially when it's creating dangerous hubs for unhinged, violent people to commit crimes against the rest of us - and leaves biohazardous waste everywhere.

Have it your way - we won't call it a crime wave. 

But there is more crime happening here than *any* of us should be even remotely okay with, and pretending it isn't a problem makes you the kind of ignorant enabler we desperately need less of. 

Okay, so you don't like "law enforcement" as an answer - you're entitled to your opinion - but the rest of us who are sick of being attacked and stolen from, and who have been devastated by some of these crimes/criminals, we're sick of the "no enforcement" catch and release bullshit.

Absolutely love the texturing on the different parts of the landscape! It looks fantastic, gives a really nice “vibe” to the scene, and it’s not overwhelming - sometimes a lot of different textures/fill angles looks messy, but this is very clean. And the colors are so rad!

The satin circle border looks a bit puckered or not quite round, sure - but hey, you did a fantastic job regardless! 

I’m curious - did you digitize it yourself? If so, what program? 
If you’d ever share or sell the design, I’d be interested - something about this I just really love, and I’d love to stitch it out as just a circular patch to have!

There is a Discord group with a trading post, as well as a Galaxy’s Edge trading post Facebook group I would recommend you checking out for this 🙂
You’re 100% right. 


*Curling up in a ball* and sobbing is not something a well adjusted adult who plans to have an active sexual life with her partner does over a documentary like that. 
A well adjusted adult doesn’t feel “icky” over making out with their partner, who they intend to marry. 


OP, your partner has some *serious* problems surrounding sex and intimacy, and these need to be addressed in *therapy* with a professional. 


They will *absolutely* not get better just because you say “I do” - and she clearly knows this, because she’s already giving you a heads up on *exactly* the way it’s going to go. By mentioning her client and wondering if she’ll feel disgusted after sex with you, she’s letting you know what your future almost *certainly* will look like. 
She’s so “traumatized” and “grossed out” by having sex in the past, you can all but guarantee once she has roped you into marriage, it will *never* be a priority. 


It’s not my place to comment on religious values, but if sex is important to you, it is *never* wise to get with a partner who is “saving themselves for marriage.” 
Marriage isn’t a small commitment, you want to know that you’re both *very* compatible on all levels that matter before taking that plunge. 


I personally wouldn’t be planning to marry someone I’ve only been with for a year and a half, that I’ve *never* had sex with, who is waving around insane red flags that say “sex disgusts me!” 
I value sex and intimacy and a sexless marriage would be hell on earth. If my partner loves and values me, and is compatible with me, we have an active sex life that we’re both thrilled about. A compatible partner for me gets excited about sex with me, and wants to share that and build on that. 

What about for you? Is sex important to you? Do you see yourself being happy with a marriage where your partner is *disgusted* by sex, hates herself for having sex with you, and resents you for your sexual needs?
Because it sounds like that’s what you’re signing up for.


If if were me, I’d be slowing my roll with this lady. We would not be moving forward towards marriage until she participates in therapy, individual at minimum, possibly couples counseling as well. 
Until she can work through some of her feelings towards sex and have a healthier view towards it - and towards future intimacy in the marriage - I would not be able to confidently say a commitment like this would be a good idea.
Couldn’t agree more! 

Between the seasonal depression, 80% shit weather, ridiculous and passive aggressive people, filth everywhere, crime, high cost of living, insane taxes - getting higher all the time and being misused, garbage city and state government, abysmal social services for anyone who isn’t homeless, unhinged homeless/drug addicts assaulting/robbing/destroying every inch of town, etc. what exactly are we defending here in Portland? Certainly *not* a high quality of life. 

I get it - no one *wants* to live in a shit hole. No one *wants* to have to say “yes, it’s filthy, dangerous, and unpleasant here.” 
But just because you deny the realities around you doesn’t somehow mean they don’t exist. And its that “Portland isn’t so bad, it’s worse elsewhere, we’re fine” attitude that is making it that much shittier here day by day. 

Wake the fuck up, guys. Just because your little bubble of privilege has allowed you enough comforts to ignore the greater realities here doesn’t mean Portland is a nice place to live, and without *major* problems.
Yes, he absolutely should have.

Their pet didn't deserve to die because your dog was at large, and is inclined to kill other animals. I don't care that it was a rabbit, you are responsible for ensuring your dog doesn't get out and maul another innocent persons pet. 

So you are entitled to keeping your pet, regardless of other people's pets lives, because... what, your dog is somehow superior? Absolutely not.

A wild rabbit? A wild rabbit in your yard where your dog is fenced in and able to play unsupervised? Absolutely different story, I agree.

I feel horrible for the people who had to lose a treasured pet to you and your animal.
I wasn't there, I don't know whether or not LAOP is lying. 

I don't really care, either.  I don't have the time to sit and play detective with every post. I was *obviously* commenting under the assumption LAOP was an honest post. If it's not, it's not - none of my business, and doesn't change my opinion in the general sense.

If the dog actually did take off enough skin from the arm to need reconstruction, that's a serious problem.

If not, and LAOP is lying or wasting people's time with BS, so be it.

I meant ***pet.*** My bad for not wording that 100% perfectly, I can see where that was confusing.

Any dog that kills or injures another ***pet*** should be put down. You don't have to agree with me, but that's my firm belief and opinion.

I don’t know… a dog that *attacks a random person* - especially one that wasn’t instigating *anything* with said dog - and injures them to the point of needing a skin graft **absolutely** *should be put down, period.*

It’s unfortunate that the owner wasn’t responsible and didn’t properly lock up their dog, but I have zero patience or tolerance for animals that maul other humans - or other pets - out of the blue. Nope. Not a chance.

Edited: Changed "or other animals" to "or other pets"
Agreed! I’ve lived in a handful of other states throughout my life - grew up here, sadly - and it’s astonishing how much people here will *allow,* if not downright *enable* and *encourage.* 
I’m so sick of the “most vulnerable, houseless neighbors” rhetoric. Enough is enough. 
There’s a reason Portland is such a disgusting, filth covered hellscape these days, and a lot of it is how unwilling people are to do *anything* meaningful about it - and no, bitching about it once or twice a week doesn’t count as an action 🥶

If I could, I’d move in a heartbeat, but unfortunately I’m disabled and trying to build up a medical care team elsewhere isn’t as easy as people think. 
I don’t foresee any great changes or comeback for the city, unfortunately, and I say that as someone who will be forced to die here alongside it.
If you think this is going to have a notable, enjoyable impact on rent… think again.
Amen. 

I’m so sick of seeing “it’s like this everywhere, all urban areas have these problems.”

No it fucking isn’t like this everywhere. These problems may not be exclusive to Portland, but the way we enable them, fail to clean them up, and allow them to run rampant and steal everything that isn’t nailed down before shooting it and lighting it on fire sure is a special flavor to this shithole “city.” 

People aren’t living like this everywhere. It’s crazy how *happy* people seem elsewhere. How *clean* it is. 
I’m sick of this dump, and just as sick of people pretending it isn’t as bad as it is. There’s *nothing* to defend.
….Yes it does? 

As someone who sadly has to use EBT, when I purchase things with bottle deposits, I do not have to spend “actual money” on top of my EBT card.
Give zero fucks about anything *at all* but themselves.*
Good luck, but don’t expect success. 

My dad, who had three strokes, could barely care for himself anymore, mentally reverted back to a very childlike state, all the more complicated by extremely unmanageable diabetes, eventually gave up because he couldn’t make it through all the ridiculous hoops they force people to backflip through, and was literally dying in poverty/from poverty, since you *absolutely cannot work* during the process, no matter long it takes. 
They fucking denied him the first time and used “letter sorter” and “paper folder” as job titles they thought he could qualify for and work. *Fucking horrible.* 
Ultimately, the disgusting and inhumane disability system in the US is what killed him, frankly. 


As other have said, Narcolepsy isn’t a “recognized” approval disability for them, so it will be an uphill battle in every way. At your age? Without other conditions? Close to impossible. 
They will want to be sure you’ve tried *every* treatment option humanely possible for substantial lengths of time, and you’ll have to argue that at such a young age, *no* job is doable for you whatsoever. 


This fight, again, must somehow happen while you have zero income whatsoever for the entire duration, and *if* you do finally get on it, you will live in abject poverty for the rest of your life. 
That’s not to say it isn’t worth it - some of us, myself included, genuinely can’t work, and have no other options - but it’s something to consider.
The pay isn’t “worth it” - it’s a last resort when you truly cannot work whatsoever.
Thanks for sharing! These are awesome!
I especially love the decanter, I can’t get over how beautiful that piece is!
I’m sorry honey, you’re the one who responded *to me.* 
You must be lost.
You must have some wildly bad dimensions if it’s literally difficult and *painful* to do something so simple.
Nope, it’s just literally *not fucking hard* to do, *at all.*

But then again, I actually like doing it, instead of whining about it and half assing it like a lot of y’all.
According to a lot of the women commenting here, yes. 

But in reality, no. 

You’re entitled to likes and dislikes and preferences and boundaries. It doesn’t matter *at all* why you don’t want to do it - just that you don’t, and won’t. And that should be respected 100%.

It will be a deal breaker for *some* women, but others will respect your boundaries and be happy to have sex - and enjoy sex, which is very much not just about receiving head - and it sounds like you’re more than willing to be attentive to their pleasure and needs, so everyone will have a great time.

Ignore the many “fuck men who don’t go down” comments here. These women suck, frankly. You won’t be compatible with everyone, but you’re not less than or a worse candidate for partner for those who realize there’s so much more to enjoy than just receiving head during a sexual encounter.
For what it’s worth, I’m a woman who has been *upvoting* you. 



You’re not wrong in a lot of what you’re saying.



Frankly, sucking dick *isn’t fucking hard.* 



My partner is above average in size, and I’ve never once thought “hmm, this is *painful* or *difficult*” and giving head is honestly my favorite sexual activity. I have absolutely gone down on him for 30-60 minutes without stopping, as well as for a combined total of hours when we’ve had long “all day to fuck” sessions. And I was fine. Was my jaw sore after *hours?* A bit, absolutely, but it was fine in a handful of hours/after a night of sleep, and barely more than a minor annoyance, not *painful.*



Most women in these comments - and the OP - talk about how they “like giving head” but it’s clear they do not. 

You don’t genuinely *enjoy* the act - *or selfless intent* - of giving a blowjob if you *only* enjoy it if you’re getting something in return.
You like it *as a gateway to something you want.*
When it’s off the table if you don’t get what you want, you don’t actually fucking like it. 
And no, you don’t like *pleasing your partner* or *giving them pleasure* if you’re only willing to do it under the expectation they will do it back. That’s like giving a gift or doing a favor only to receive in return - it’s not really a gift now is it? 



Granted, I am *very* straight, so the thought of eating pussy is repulsive to me, but that aside, it’s pretty ridiculous how judgmental some of these women are when a man isn’t into going down. 



I like receiving, but I also *like having sex* and there’s *plenty* else about a sexual encounter I enjoy and value besides *just head.* I also know how to *get myself off* during a sexual encounter, or guide my partner to do so without *his fucking mouth* so it’s not the only option for me to “enjoy myself.”



And frankly, if a partner isn’t into it, I’m happy they feel they can set that boundary and not be forced to do something they’re repulsed by - no matter what the reason.



The entire experience can surely be gross to some people - lots of bodily fluids, not always tasting of pure delight, lots of textures, sweaty thighs/legs, lots of pressure on your face/head, inability to breathe, etc. - and while many women can say the same of blowjobs *in their opinion,* it’s ridiculous that some folks here can’t seem to wrap their minds around a man not wanting to do it, and can’t respect that preference. 
(Yet when men post about women not wanting to give blowjobs, it’s all about respecting her in the comments, isn’t it?) 


If the *only* important pleasure you get out of sex is receiving head, that’s very much a problem *with you.* 
If you can’t respect another persons preference not to have someone’s genitals leaking fluids all over their mouth and face, for any/whatever reason, and you see them as “less than” for that, that’s pretty fucked up - and I sure hope you don’t have sexual preferences or hard no’s! 

Not saying you have to have sex with someone who isn’t into the things you’re into or expect from sex. Not at all. OP was fine is setting and following a boundary. 
I’m just so sick of all the “fuck men who are like this how dare they” comments. These same women would be crying out 20 paragraphs about how horrible the man is if the situation were reversed.
I'm so glad that my comment specifically stuck out to you and provided a conversation starter for you and your partner - and even happier that it helped so much :)

I'm ***so*** proud of you for having that talk with your partner, and deciding that therapy is the route for you! 

Therapy ***fucking rocks.*** There is *zero* shame in seeing a therapist - I firmly believe *everyone* should get therapy at some point in their life, and that everyone can benefit from it - and it can be such an amazing tool to really know yourself better, love yourself harder, and work through some of the tough shit life throws *everyone*. It can be hard to find a therapist that you fit well with - especially these days, coming out of the pandemic, it can be hard to get in with a clinician, as there is a "shortage" - but I encourage you to stick with it until you do, it's seriously amazing how much you can improve - on things you didn't even know you needed to work on - and I promise it'll do wonders for your self esteem *and* your relationship. Learning how to communicate better and express your emotions in a healthy way - even if your relationship is going great as is - is such an awesome tool to have.

Best of luck to you going forward! Take care :)
I’m always dehydrated.

I hate drinking water for a lot of reasons - not just “I don’t like it” - and generally drink Mexican Coke - can’t handle the taste of any other soda - occasionally Apple Juice or green tea, or nothing at all. I also take stimulant medications in *very* high doses for Narcolepsy - stimulants are dehydrating. 
I have been this way for well over a decade. 

My boyfriend has never had an issue with the way I taste. He’s genuinely crazy about my taste/scent. 
I don’t “taste myself” constantly, by any means, but it’s not at all unpleasant when he has had me do so on his fingers, or if I go down on him after penetration.

Which is just to say - be prepared for water to not make much of a difference, and not solve anything here. It could make a difference, it could not. 

I eat red meat and dairy, but don’t drink coffee, to comment on the other things in your plan. 

Some people just have a more bitter taste, from what I gather. And yours may not even be “bad” but just odd to you. 

Best of luck in any event! I’m sure you’re fine.
You couldn’t be more off base with this. 

*MANY* of us find full time work of any kind to be not at all feasible.
Narcolepsy, for *some of us,* is a *legitimate* and *severe* disability. Full stop. Not because of “multiple health issues” or whatever else. Because it’s a fucking disability, and a *horrible,* debilitating disease.
When that season was airing, I got sick of call outs towards Syngin. He knew who he was, and was honest about it upfront. If she wanted a motivated, career driven husband she could manipulate and verbally abuse, that wasn’t him.
People may not agree with his lifestyle choices or “whateverness” but there’s nothing *wrong* with not wanting to devote to a specific job, and not being that driven towards wasting away all day working. It’s not like he expected her to finance his every ambition and make millions while he did nothing. Some people are fine with less money and more time.

God, can’t believe I had to scroll this far to find something that wasn’t just “they’re perfect!!!!!! Everyone is flawless the way they are never be unhappy with yourself!!!!1111!1!1!!1”

There is *nothing* wrong with deciding to have surgery done to improve something. 
If it’s something you genuinely want, and the alteration would make you happy, go for it!
The benefits to this surgery aren’t nonexistent - besides just improving how they look and your views on them. It may make it easier on your back, be easier to find clothes that fit properly - or fit in in a way you prefer and enjoy the look of. The lifting aspect is something *many* women covet, not to make them “perfect” but to achieve a more comfortable “setup” so to speak, amongst other reasons. 

If you’re just getting it because you think you have to in order to be sexy, or good enough, or because you can’t stop comparing yourself to countless other “better” looking women… therapy is what fixes this, and is a lot cheaper. 

But if you are able to be objective about it and go, “You know what, I love myself, my partner loves me and is attracted to me, I’m attractive as is and I’m happy with myself… but you know what, the confidence boost I’d  get from the surgery would be amazing, and I would achieve the look I desire and be able to wear things I can’t now - even though I’m fine the way I am today!” 
Then I think looking into surgery is a great idea, and there’s nothing wrong with it.

People are so quick to judge cosmetic surgeries and hate on the reasons behind them/those who get them.
It’s one thing if you’re jumping haphazardly into it to please other people or cover up deep self esteem problems you really should be working through in therapy, but it’s not always a bad thing or a bad option and is just like any other body modification when it comes down to it. 

Regardless, I hope you’re able to make the right choice for you, OP. I’m sure your partner loves you just the way you are, and I hope you do, too.
So he has to always meet her needs first, and answer to her whims in order to have his needs met? Absolutely fucking not.
Bullshit. 

If your partner doesn’t give a fuck about your needs, and doesn’t care about showing you love in the way you have indicated is important to you, romance isn’t usually second nature. I don’t feel like going out of my way to *pay for, plan, and take someone on a date” when they can’t even participate in physical intimacy with me. 
It’s 100% the same. Her needs won’t be met if she can’t start giving a shit about her partners needs.
Because she’s not the only important fucking partner in the relationship. 

If she wants respect for what she wants or doesn’t want, he deserves *equal* respect for his needs and dislikes.

If she wants romance, and her love languages attended to, he deserves that as well, 100%.

She’s ignoring and denying his needs in the relationship. It’s only fair hers aren’t his top priority either.
I simply had them switch me down to 5's. I get the same dose as I always have per day, I just have to take 3 times the amount of physical pills to get there. They said they'll have plenty of Sandos and Teva 5's through the "end of the shortage" - the only two manufacturers I've found to be in any way legitimate - and don't anticipate a shortage so I'm hoping they're right on that. It's annoying to have to take so many tiny pills, but it beats having nothing.

Somehow my partner has been able to get his Teva or Sandos 20's just fine with zero delay or shortage through Fred Meyer (what Kroger is called in Oregon) and has remained unaffected, which is odd.

I'm sure you've done this already, but if it happens again, ask to have the pills switched - to 5's, 10's, 20's, etc. - in a way that allows you to maintain your original dose, just with a different breakdown of pills. Manufacturers can be tricky, as there are very few that actually work and are decent, but it might be worth looking into switching those if nothing else.

Also, you aren't "dependent" on your medication. You wouldn't tell someone who has to use crutches that they're "dependent on them" in a negative way. You wouldn't say that to someone using insulin, or an inhaler. It's no different here.

“Embroidery frame stand” will get you many options like this on Google.

I purchased mine from Amazon with those search terms, and have seen nice ones at Joann’s and Michael’s as well.
Unfortunately, Adderall has not done a thing for my “ADHD symptoms” - nor has any other medication. But in fairness, after all these years, it does very little for my Narcolepsy anymore - and nothing else has done a thing, either. 

The hard part is that ADHD and Narcolepsy symptoms can overlap *a lot.* 
Attention issues, memory problems, brain fog, forgetfulness, etc. are all Narcolepsy symptoms that are *very* common. 
Does that mean if you have ADHD + N, you have double the symptoms, or they’re twice as strong? 
Does it make no difference, and your focus should be on treating the symptoms, not “what” they come from?
I have no idea. Nor has any specialist I’ve ever seen, all of whom have been floored by the severity of my symptoms/Narcolepsy. 

I wish I could provide positive, helpful feedback! Just chiming in with my two cents - you’re certainly not the only one dealing with this combo and issue!
I know! I didn't mean to come off as if I expected that you could, I apologize.

Lost my best friend, my kitty who I loved so dearly, to a violent dog a few months back, so it's a sore spot for me. I more mentioned it in case any part of you *can* do *anything* or say anything about it, but of course, it's not your job to fix everything, and I totally get that!

“Smash that like and subscribe button for more sick videos like these! Alright, now we’re onto number 5 of the top 10 intersections to do meth while stealing a catalytic converter, and this one is SPECIAL guys I’m telling you!”
Hey now, your privilege is showing!

Those KGW employees have jobs and possessions, clearly our most vulnerable neighbors need those electronics and personal bags more than those privileged employed oppressor's!
I personally won’t mess with antidepressants of any kind after *many* bad experiences with them for non-depression related treatments. 
Have been put on various forms for migraines, nighttime sleep, etc. - the side effects always *suck* and the time to adjust after stopping them does too.

My understanding from my doctor is that trazodone can cause physical dependence, and can’t always be stopped “cold turkey” as well as trouble adjusting to sleeping without it. 
Given the similar potential side effects to a lot of SSRIs, I wasn’t interested in pursuing it.


Mom began taking it for sleep after trauma earlier this year - she is not diagnosed narcoleptic but it’s suspected she has had it since her teenage years - and it was messy. Awful side effects, impossible to sleep on nights she didn’t take it, mood swings, etc. 


I currently take Hydroxyzine - which has worked *okay* for me. 

I like that its a pretty casual medication, and I can adjust my dose up and down at will depending on how I’m feeling. It doesn’t knock me out - unless I’m already over tired and take a high dose - but it helps combat the insomnia Narcolepsy can cause, and I don’t feel groggy the next day as if I’ve taken something heavy. 

It doesn’t do *a ton,* but Xyrem is out of the question, so I’m glad to have something.
A dog that is violent towards other animals is a problem that surely needs to be addressed too… 

Thank you for reporting the cat.
u/sparda10123,

This conversation is going nowhere, let’s leave it be.
U/Steamin_Bman, 

*Enough.* If you can’t behave like a mature adult, you won’t be commenting here at all. Final warning.
u/Luke-28,

Regardless of your personal feelings on the matter, the subreddit rules are posted, and you are expected to read them, familiarize yourself with them, and ***follow them,*** *just like everyone else.*

Thank you for the genuine laugh I just had at your expense - no, we are not "Hi-Rez advocates paid in free gems" nor is anyone on the r/Smite mod team in any way affiliated with or employed by Hi-Rez.

You are not the first - nor will you surely be the last - person to resort to that unoriginal, juvenile accusation when you aren't getting your way on the subreddit.

***No one*** on the moderation team works for HiRez, and thus to keep the subreddit running smoothly, free of toxicity/personal drama and rants clogging up the feed, we as a team have chosen to prohibit posts of this nature, that seek to rant about "state of the community" topics that no one on the moderation team or in the community has any influence over.

Posts such as yours do not tend to inspire positive, *productive* conversation on the subreddit, and often devolve into bickering and toxicity. Just by looking at the current comments on your post, it is clear that this is ***absolutely*** the case here as well - I would not call these responses a "discussion" by any means.

If you have suggestions that you would like HiRez to see, reaching out to them directly is your best plan of action. You can do this by voicing your personal opinion over a ticket/feedback email, or by reaching out to them via their direct social media - which again, r/Smite is not.

Regardless of your personal opinion on the r/Smite rules, the moderation team expects you to familiarize yourself with the stated rules in the sidebar, and to follow them accordingly. All users in the r/Smite community are expected to understand that we prohibit posts that solely seek to express their complaints on certain topics - as this falls under Rule #3 - and as such, you are expected to follow this rule, as well.

Your post was in direct violation of Rule #3, and therefore is not eligible to be reinstated. If you repost it, it will be removed, and continued attempts to do so will result in a ban from the subreddit, as you now have been warned and familiarized with the rules and how they apply to you.

If you feel the moderation team is "pathetic" and r/Smite is not up to your standards, no one is forcing you to engage here.

Thank you for your understanding!

So... you started a stimulant medication, which is actually meant for the treatment of Narcolepsy and helping reduce EDS, and you're attributing this improvement to... a supplement powder?? 

Man, I guess there really is something to be said for the placebo effect...

I do hope you went off Zoloft at the full recommendation and supervision of your doctor, and not just because you were afraid of the interaction.

When you're just starting out on a new medication, it is best to stick with the medical treatment plan set by your *medical professional.* Adding in a bunch of unnecessary supplementation can make it quite difficult to know if the medication is working or not, or what side effects are coming from where.

A “horrific meme” at that 🙄🙄🙄🙄

This girl has no idea what some of the *real* horrors of life are like.
Right? All good points! 


I personally couldn’t imagine staying with or remaining interested in a partner who is as selfish and shortsighted as OPs girlfriend.


She’s fucking 19. She is in *no way* ready for a baby * whatsoever,* and is haphazardly planning to bring a life into a world of chaos, uncertainty, and *poverty.* Her family aren’t financially sound or stable, and neither is she - how exactly is she planning to provide a wonderful life for this baby, that her partner has made clear he doesn’t even want? 


I would lose 100% of my interest in continuing a relationship with someone like this, and the resentment would grow so strong - as my life is ruined for a child that wasn’t wanted, needed, or planned for - that it would be crippling. 



I’m sorry this has happened, OP. 

Yes, you had your part in getting her pregnant - though it sounds like you guys did use protection, sucks this happened despite being responsible - but she is making a horrible choice all across the board, and I’m sorry it’s going to destroy the next 18+ years of your life. 


Do not wait to make your views firmly known here. Continue to repeat how poor of a decision this is, how not ready *both of you* are, and how rough this will be for the next two decades for you both. 
Reiterate that this is not her only opportunity to have a child, and she should want to make this choice when *prepared* and stable and able to give the child the resources and stability it needs - and reiterate that neither of you are anywhere close to that level of stable at this time, nor will be in the near future. 

Reiterate how strenuous this will be on your relationship. Your relationship will *never* be the same, in many ways negatively. You will both be stressed, exhausted, and pushed to your absolute limit in every way. 
Sex will be minimal if not nonexistent. Personal time/free time gone. Hobbies, goals, dreams likely out the window for *quite a while.* You will be financially drained and desperately trying to survive paycheck to paycheck in a shit economy with rising inflation and high costs of living and will likely feel as though you can never get ahead.
Education will be tough if not impossible. 
Her body will change dramatically and she will have a whole new set of mental and physical woes to deal with for years at *only 19.*  
Heaven forbid the child has any physical or developmental issues or disabilities… get ready for a potential *lifetime* of caregiving. 


It’s easy for some people - god knows why, I certainly can’t figure it out - to be talked into this shit by family or doctors that are anti-abortion. But they don’t have to live with this baby. And it isn’t their life being destroyed by its arrival. 
Drill these points home, it’s your last chance to change the path you’re both on. 

I hope she makes the smart choice and goes back to her initial decision. Either way, I wish you all the best.
>I like how my cat knocks out my wifi and I get a soft ban but some a hole spams NGR or other slurs and insults gets nothing…  
>  
>This system is a joke

I'm going to assume you're not *seriously* claiming that these types of sentences don't fall under "no soapboxing, rants, or complaints" but just in case...

As stated in the posted subreddit rules, "***Constructive criticism*** is allowed and encouraged but ***simple complaint posts*** that don’t go into detail and ***don’t encourage discussion*** will be removed." 

If you have problems with the reporting system, you can bring this to HiRez directly via their support feature, or by reaching out to them via their social media with questions, concerns, or complaints.

This issue is brought to the subreddit semi-frequently, and unfortunately does not tend to encourage constructive, civil discussion on the topic. As such, posts of this nature are removed. 

*No one* here on r/Smite knows exactly how HiRez/Smites ban/report system works, or what their metrics on players are.  
If you have suggestions or concerns regarding this, your best bet will be to reach out to HiRez directly.

In game, if you are dealing with a toxic player, reporting these players - with a detailed, filled out report - and blocking them is the best way to stop encountering a problem user. 

Unfortunately, ***any*** online gaming community *will* have bad apples that bring toxicity,  foul language, and other unpleasant behaviors into the game. The best thing *any* player can do is *ignore* these users, report, and move on.   


Regardless of ***your*** personal opinion on HiRez's report system, these are the options available to you. As such, there is no further discussion needed on the topic.

Literally a few comments down, someone’s flair is “Larry’s uneaten lechon” - girl your shameful ass will live on here being roasted for all eternity 😂
Hey folks, 

We understand there’s some controversy going on around the Mizkif allegations, and that there are a lot of mixed feelings in the community on the topic. 


Until HiRez makes a statement or takes action - purely meaning if and when they do, if they ever feel the need, not commenting on if they should or should not - large community discussions on this topic are only tangentially related to Smite. 
Therefore, all discussion on the topic should be focused in this post for the time being - and all further posts will be removed. 

Should the situation develop further, and receive official HiRez attention/action, a stickied post may be made for discussion. 

Again, until then, we do not consider this a “Smite related topic” being as it only tangentially relates to the game, and therefore further posts are not needed, nor “on topic” for r/Smite. 


By no means does this reflect *any* of the r/Smite mod team’s personal views or feelings on the alleged actions, or topic whatsoever. 

We simply feel that until HiRez becomes involved, it would be best to steer discussion back to Smite specifically, as that is the purpose of the subreddit. 

Feel free to continue civil, respectful discussion on this post.

Thank you!
Received! Scanning now!
First off, I'm so sorry for your loss, and that you are going through this right now! My heart goes out to both you and your husband <3

It's definitely a difficult experience, and there are a lot of foreign and hard feelings that come up during these times!   
It's hard because you know it's not anything they're "doing" on purpose, or anything they're doing "wrong" - but even in knowing that, it's so hard not to feel that resentment, anger, or sadness anyway. I totally get it.

I'm not sure based on what you wrote - are these kittens, or older cats?

If kittens - absolutely give it time. For all of the cats I've ever had, they've all changed a ton over their first few years. Sometimes it takes a while, but as they settle down out of that first year phase - and even out of that "first year with you" phase, regardless of age - they tend to become more snuggly/buddied up with their people if you're persistent. It can be hard - especially when they're giving your husband more attention - but if you maintain that constant vibe of "I want to give all the love to you, I want to be your buddy, I want to be close to you and bond strongly" it usually develops, even if it takes a little longer with you specifically. It's when you give up and back off, and start being more distant around them that they usually match that, and it starts to "reset" those "I'm warming up to this person" levels. 

If they're older - not necessarily meaning "old" - it can definitely take a lot more effort and time, but it's totally possible! I don't believe any cat is firmly "set in their ways" when they're cold, not so social, or distant. I think some will certainly be more friendly than others just in general, but you can absolutely get to a good strong bond with most cats given persistence. Maybe with your two new kitties, that will just mean some extra Google research into different ways to get to that closer, snugglier, more bonded place. And extra catnip and treats, surely.

But you're right - you lost a really special, unique, sweet soul. You've lost your best friend. That shit is *impossibly hard.* The grief is overwhelming, and hurts in ways you've never imagined it could. There's no "fixing" that - and there's no replacing Nala.   
I mean, you wouldn't even want to try to replace her, right? That's crazy talk! She was *amazing*.   
It definitely makes it that much harder that these new kitties - despite your happiness to give them a new home, and attempts to bond with them - aren't the kind of "dream cats" that are friendly, follow-you-everywhere, snuggle bugs right off the bat. Sometimes we just get really lucky, like with your girl.  


I think the hardest thing for my partner was *remembering* in the moment that they aren't our late cat. You know that, you know they won't be the same, but in the moment it's hard not to look for those traits, or compare them to your memory of the best cat you've ever known. It's not intentional, it's just something you do without realizing, because you're so used to that special friend, and all the great things about them.

It can really help to make a conscious effort to try to "wipe" from your mind your expectations of a cat - not forgetting about Nala or her good qualities, but not defining "my cats" as those behaviors she displayed.  
This isn't easy, and it takes time, but it can definitely help to shift to a fresh perspective when dealing with the new pets. Coming into every interaction with no expectations, no "hopes" for how they're going to behave, and not "searching" for any specific traits or actions can really help you to warm up to the new, fresh personalities that these new cats have, and find the things you love and appreciate about *them* specifically.  
When my partner started coming from this perspective, it was like a flip switched - I could tell he was visibly happier interacting with them, and suddenly he was pointing out all these cute poses and goofy things they do, and really engaging in playing with them.

When we're grieving, it's hard not to compare to the one that we lost. But we're only hurting ourselves in the process by limiting the depth and strength of the bonds we could be forming.

Sorry to write you a novel! It's still a pretty fresh experience and loss for myself, too, so I tend to get off on a tangent and ramble a lot. 

In any event, I wish you - and your husband, and new kitties - the absolute best. I'll be hoping for a strong, snuggly, amazing bond with these new goobers for you for many years to come.
I will take some high quality, full scans in a couple hours, and send them your way. 

If you want to DM me, I can send them to your email if you’re comfortable - as so to not lose any quality - otherwise I’ll drop an Imgur link!
You’re jumping to some wild connections there, bud. Not what I was getting at at all. 


No, I don’t agree it’s anything like flat out rape like you’re proposing. Nowhere near that level. 


But it is *wrong,* in my opinion, to deceive someone - whether that be lying outright, or lying by omission - when engaging with them sexually, *especially* and *specifically* about things relating *to sex.*


And before any more ridiculous comparisons are made, no, I don’t look at things like lying about, say, political affiliation, or saying you like a band you don’t, or that you make more money than you do the same way. 



I - and many people, judging by conversations on similar topics on this sub/on Reddit - do feel that lying about things pertaining directly to sex in order to engage with someone sexually is *absolutely* wrong, and does not allow for fully informed consent. 


If I don’t want to have sex with a 28 year old virgin, be that because I feel unwanted pressure, or don’t want to have a one night stand with a virgin - for reasons I originally stated above - or don’t feel comfortable with how that alters the tone of the sexual encounter, or even just because *I don’t want to* - which is everyone’s right, “no” is a valid reason - then that should 100% be my choice to make. 


If the person I’m engaging with values informed consent, and wants me to be enthusiastically willing to have sex with them, and wants a partner who is comfortable with them and choosing them fully, then they should *be fine with me knowing that detail.* 



If they’re lying about it, or deceiving me by omission, is it because they fear I wouldn’t have sex with them if I knew? So they’re deceiving me in order to get me to have sex with them, no? 
That’s *pretty fucking disgusting* to do someone, wouldn’t you say? 


Or is it because they’re afraid of my reaction? That I won’t be as comfortable? That I would want to take it slow, and maybe not engage sexually right away? Or think about it? Or get to know them better first? Or talk about it more, and set the boundaries and mood more firmly? 
Why would they not want me to do that? 


You don’t have to agree with my feelings on it, but I personally think lying to a sexual partner about things that pertain to *sex specifically* - not that any lying is generally necessarily a good habit, but that’s not what we’re talking about - makes you a scumbag at best, a deceptive manipulator at worst, and it *does* blur one’s ability to fully agree to the act in cases where they would not have otherwise.


I guess since you’re riding really hard on my wording, yeah, “informed consent” in a legal sense, of rape vs. not - you’re right. But that’s not what I meant, clearly.
With you on everything here except for *lying* about your virginity status. 

Some people will not want to be a one night stand/hookup/whatever else to a *28 year old virgin,* and it’s their right to make that choice with *informed consent.* 

Not saying this happens for everyone, or will for OP, but there is a lot of emotion, uncertainty, and all kinds of negative and positive reactions that *can* come with losing your virginity/having sex for the first time. *Especially* with someone from a heavy religious background. 


Most people would want to know *beforehand* that those may arise with the person they’re about to engage sexually with. Lying about it helps no one here, and can only lead to OP or her sexual partner becoming *very* uncomfortable should certain needs, emotions, etc. arise.
The store front rent would have to be *very* cheap for that to be possible for the majority of small/medium Etsy shops, especially depending on what products they specialize in, and the security would have to be *excellent.*

But that would be awesome if it were possible! Would much rather see shops like that than big chains.
Ah yes, just what Portlands consistently *enjoyable* weather and crazy-unhinged roaming community is good for… year round outdoor, exposed activities that involve upkeep. 

Indoor would be neat, though.

Absolutely, I’m so glad my comment helped a bit ♥️

It will definitely be weird at first with the new kitty - it was for us too, even though we chose to adopt them and had a say in how soon - but I have no doubts you’ll come to appreciate the new cat, and it will take your mind off things at times. 

Sometimes it’s hard, because these new kittens we have are *very* different from Iggy. He was a special man, and the most unique cat I’ve ever met - one of those that doesn’t feel like a cat at all, more like a good friend. We love our kittens, but I have found myself at times feeling sad or disappointed that certain things I loved that he did they don’t do. 
But those moments pass quickly, and I let myself feel them however I need, and then things move on and there’s new happy moments again. As long as you know that it’s likely you’ve have a lot of those conflicting moments and are prepared to process them and let them pass, I think it’ll all be just fine. 

I hope your family is being empathetic to your feelings and gives you space to talk about the grief - and conflicted emotions around the new cat. If they aren’t, I’m deeply sorry for that, too. 

Something that has brought me a lot of joy has been thinking that Iggy would be really happy to know we have given two new cats a good and safe home, resources, and a peaceful life. 
That’s the best gift you can give an animal, and many are not so lucky. 
It sounds like you really love animals, and that you’re taking the time to set up your “kitty spots” and prepare for them is really sweet and amazing. This new cat will be very lucky to have you and know you 😊
I lost my best friend, my kitty Iggy, end of June. 
It was tragic, devastating, and very traumatic for my partner and I - he was brutally mauled and died in our arms, it’s an image I’ll never forget. 

We immediately knew it would be difficult to think of getting another cat, and had to take a few nights away from our home at a hotel because everywhere we looked we saw Iggy’s stuff, or memories of him. 

The house started to feel really empty and cold without him around. He was like my little shadow, and it wasn’t often I’d be in a room without him. I talked to him constantly throughout the day, and he was a huge part of our lives. 
This emptiness really weighed on me, and added to the grief and depression from his loss in ways that became unbearable.

We weren’t planning to adopt new cats so soon, but we fell in love with a pair of kittens who were being mistreated by a shelter, and we impulsively brought them home the same day we met them. 

At first, my partner really struggled with it. He was happy to provide a better life for the kittens, but didn’t feel quite ready once we got them home, and it brought up a lot of conflicting feelings for him. 

It’s been a couple months now, and we’re all doing a lot better with it. 
The kittens feel like part of the family, and while we miss Iggy *intensely* every day, we are so grateful to have them around to fill that empty space. 
They bring us a lot of joy, are super sweet and snuggly, and are such goofy little characters. 
We can never replace Iggy, but we can provide love and security to two new lives - and that feels really good. 

I’m sorry that you don’t have a say in the timeline of adopting a new cat. I know it will be hard, but please be kind and open to this new life - it could be easy to feel resentful or angry with this new pet, especially since this was not your choice, but it’s important to remember that this kitty hasn’t done anything wrong, and they deserve love and happiness too. 

They will never replace your lost cat. You may find yourself looking for traits that remind you of your lost kitty, or trying to get them to act the way that kitty did, and becoming irritated when they don’t. 
Alternatively, you might feel yourself getting frustrated if they *do* act like your old cat, because they aren’t them, and you resent them for that. 
These are all normal, human reactions to grief, and it’s important to let yourself process and mourn however you need to. 
But in time, if you can, try to form a new relationship with this kitty - they won’t be the same, but you *can* come to love them just as much, and find things about them that you will grow just as attached to. 

Having a new friend around can really help the grieving process, even if it’s hard sometimes. Hang in there ♥️
This person, per their profile, does this professionally, and has huge multi needle machines for mass producing products/patches. 

Definitely not a hobbyist, or anything near a hobby level. Amazing work, nonetheless, but the thread/stabilizer/fabrics they use will almost certainly not be available/practical/relevant to the “just starting out” level, nonetheless the machine - and possibly software. 

But they’ve got some cool embroideries in their post history to browse!
It’s hard to say! I would talk to a vet or otherwise qualified “cat expert” about that. 


I personally would *never* feel comfortable taking the risk, having cremated my indoor-only best friend 3 months ago, when he was eaten by a disgusting pit bull after bolting out the front door when startled.  

I can’t imagine taking my kittens out and risking them getting out of the harness after witnessing firsthand just how unsafe it is “out there” for kitties on their own. 


I will say, I’ve collar trained both of my kittens now - plan to have AirTag collars on them when they’re big enough just in case a freak accident ever occurred where they got outside - and its been a breeze. 


If you get a harness that fits properly, isn’t binding but isn’t loose, practice *extensively* inside, and live in an area with minimal big risks - near prey driven dogs, loud roads, city areas, potentially hazardous nature areas, etc. - you may be fine, but I think it’s a personal choice as to if the risk is worth it, and if you feel like your cats will do well with it or not.


I would absolutely practice *tirelessly* for a *long time* with them wearing it and walking with it *inside* and in controlled environments where they cannot bolt and escape. 

Some cats are fine with collars/kittens, some fight it endlessly, some collapse and go “limp” in protest, some lose their shit in the most erratic ways, etc. 
I think a lot of it has to do with temperament, your cats personality, and how you introduce them to it - how dedicated you are to training them with it, how patient, and the environment in which you do that. 
As a kitten is *definitely* better for that kind of stuff, but it’s not impossible for older cats. 


If possible, a “catio” is a much safer way to let them enjoy the outdoors, but not everyone has the space for that kind of setup.
Absolutely cracking up, that’s hilarious 😂 Thanks for the laugh!
I’m sorry, I wasn’t aware we could be choosing beggars. 

If the hypothetical treatment that will make me feel better than any other options on the market, or be as close to feeling “cured” as possible, has to be administered via IV, sign me the fuck up. 

*Some of us* have *actually* lost *enough* to this god awful disease that that’s a *tiny* and *exciting* “price” to pay for relief.
I’m with you on that one.

Not enough motivation, not an “important enough” or “common enough” or “popular enough” disease, not enough money to be made over other focuses, etc. 
And frankly, I’m sure it’s no cakewalk to come up with ways to “fix” this that are safe, effective, practical, without horrendous side effects, etc. 

I don’t feel there will be either. I would almost guarantee if there is, it won’t be anywhere near my lifetime. I’d love to be wrong.
I always wonder how pets work in the AC world… like we’ve got cat and rabbit and dog villagers in clothes, having lives, talking… but then we’d have a pet-sized version running around the campsite… makes you wonder… 😅😂

I’d totally love this regardless, though.
Did you design these yourself?? Amazing job either way, thanks for sharing! 
Very envious of those talented at 3D printing! It’s something I’d love to get into but it’s a big undertaking to create something as polished as this! Well done. 

If you did, would you be okay with me using a few of the designs to make a couple embroidered patches? 

I will never sell them or profit off them in any way - I do machine embroidery as a hobby, mostly to make patches, and would love to make a couple of these to use on some of the jackets I wear when I visit Batuu.
Personal use only, purely. 

I’d be happy to send a couple of any I make to you free of charge and free of shipping cost if that interests you at all, in exchange for permission! 

Zero offense if you decline - I wouldn’t feel right not asking permission!
If you believe a word she says, *especially* avoid Jihoon in this situation, I have a bridge to sell you. 

I wouldn’t send her a *dime.* It’s not going to her child’s treatment, and that has been apparent. She’s a grifter, and a shameless one at that. 

And how is he supposed to get in contact, or see him, exactly?
She profits and “wins” if he’s the bad guy. Her story falls apart if the truth behind her manipulation is revealed. 
Is Jihoon supposed to get a visa, cover *high* travel costs from South Korea to the US - with lodging for an extended period - and then try to locate her to see his son with *zero cooperation from her or anyone close to her?*
Is he supposed to just manifest like a magical fairy in the same room as his son, who she is keeping from him? 
Does the child have a cellphone he can just call to obtain unmonitored access to him? 

Let’s be real here. 

At a certain point there isn’t much you can do. 
She has displayed a clear pattern of procreating to gain attention, cash, and a manipulation tool with multiple men, and Jihoon was just an unlucky pawn in her game. She tossed him out, replaced him with another “stand in dad” she could mold and fetishize, and it’ll likely repeat again when he isn’t fitting her will enough. 

The way she behaves, her history with men and restraining orders… he’s literally in a foreign country with no way to find and see his son without her allowing it… I can’t blame him, personally.
I wouldn’t send *one penny* if I were him. That bitch has herself in mind and that’s absolutely it - I wouldn’t trust that she’d use it for the child, necessary treatments, or bills. Straight into fillers and luxuries, just like any GoFundMe money she’s getting. 

Jihoon isn’t perfect, but no one is. At this point, what is he supposed to do? 
Get a visa, travel from *South Korea* - let’s not pretend this is easy or cheap, thanks guys - and show up with no idea how to find or see his son and absolutely zero cooperation from her? 
*Really?* 
We’re blaming him for not going along with that *fantastic* plan? 
She cut him out and replaced him with another similar “instant daddy” she can fetishize and bend to her needs - and when he stops fitting the mold, she’ll toss him out too.
All she seems to know how to do is procreate to gain attention, finding, and manipulate men/fans/family, and lie. I wouldn’t believe a word she says 🤷🏻‍♀️
This happened to my mom as well! Fortunately she was right by her car, and he bolted underneath it and she was able to grab him and toss him back in the vehicle, but I told her she’s a fool if she ever does it again, because she may not be so lucky next time - he’s 5 years old and it was his first time using a harness/going for a walk, he doesn’t seem really antsy to “learn” how to enjoy it at this point in his life 😂

I’m so sorry to hear about your little guy. I hope he comes home soon, or is found and reunited with you. You will both be in my thoughts ♥️
So… then remove them from the line, and stop inflicting them on everyone else while forcing them onto something they’re miserable doing, and therefore making everyone else miserable in the process??

It’s still forbidden on the Portland subreddit.

Weeeeeird, would’ve never guessed! Definitely a rabbit hole there 😂
Huh, you don’t say! I haven’t read it in years, but have a really nice hardcover on my bookshelf that I keep meaning to pick back up. I had no idea about the sleep attacks/potential narcoleptic side to him, that will definitely be interesting to think about when reading through again. Thanks for sharing!

Hi there, I’d love to be considered! (Thank you for this giveaway regardless, how wonderful to offer to the community!) 

Recently I have found myself most impacted by the art and creations put on by Meow Wolf - and associated artists. 
It’s pretty crazy to browse the subreddit/related Instagrams and see the amazing worlds the company is bringing in artists to create and nurture. 
For those unfamiliar, Meow Wolf currently has three locations of huge, interactive art exhibits that have a “story” to explore, with many rooms of *wild* art and sensory experiences. 
I have been really inspired by these creations, because it has really expanded my definition of what “art” could be - what music can do, what shapes art can take, what film can be used for, etc. 
I’ve always felt I’ve had some form of artistic vision, but never felt there was much of a place for me to express it - I mostly do embroidery, machine embroidery, rug tufting, etc. which feel a bit “bland” and limited - but seeing all the unique uses of different artistic mediums really helped bring me out of my creative shell.

The hell are you talking about? I shave religiously, completely bare, whether I’m expecting sex or not. It feels more clean and more comfortable to me.
Right? 

We can’t know what will make a blow job better for your partner, OP. If he already says you’re amazing, and he’s already able to cum from what you’re doing, the only improvements you can make will be specific *to him.* 

Some guys like certain things done with their balls - some absolutely do not want anything in that area *at all.*
Some prefer deeper, or faster, or more or less hands. We can’t know that. *Ask him.*

What my partner loves is likely not going to be what yours is wanting. Ask him what he’s wanted to try, or what would really drive him crazy. 
It doesn’t “ruin it” to be told, it’s not a guessing game, you don’t have to magically find it for it to blow his mind.
*Wow.* 

I hadn’t seen that the buildings have to be at least 15 years old for rental assistance to apply. That’s *useless.*
If things were to go that route, they’d not only need *absurd* amounts of additional rental assistance funding, but they’d need to reformat the way it is awarded, processed, and actually staff the damn places responsible for doing it. 
OERAP was nothing short of a *nightmare,* failure in many ways, and I have *zero* faith in Multnomah County to handle *more* funding responsibly or in a way that helps those who need it.

Playing willfully dumb makes you look just that - dumb.

I didn't say "there's shitty landlords because a few tenants ***put bacon greese down the drain."*** 

A lot of comments were bragging about all the awful ways they've treated a property, and how it's nice to be able to treat their rental home like absolute shit since they aren't responsible for fixing it or paying for it.

And yes, *that* attitude *is* why a lot of good, honest small-time landlords stop renting their properties out, leaving tenants with nothing but shitty, exploitative landlords on the market.

But no, go ahead, pop off some more about a point no one was making because you want to feel smart today. Enjoy :)

I mean, for someone who has *180* pounds to lose, they need more than to just “walk around outside” - and a “better diet” is an understatement.

I mean sure, he failed because he didn’t change his habits and establish healthier routines outside of the meal plan, but the meal plan isn’t to blame. For some people, it takes a preplanned diet like that to shift their eating habits enough for it to matter. You can’t just make small changes when you’re *that* overweight.
If you can’t trust your primary doctor, and have to go behind their back and lie to them about major surgery and large components of your health, it’s time to get a new primary doctor. 


What if you have complications from the surgery later on? What if you’re having issues that *could* be linked to this surgery, or could’ve formed because of it, but she doesn’t know to look or go that route because you’ve lied about it? Is that when you’ll decide to tell her - and then have to backtrack on even more years of dishonesty? 

I guarantee your doctor will care more about you lying about your health and impeding her ability to treat you fully than she cares that you went elsewhere for surgery. And if not, that’s how you know she isn’t an ethical, good doctor, and it’s time to go elsewhere. 

But I highly doubt she’d have much to say after you get the procedure done - there’s no going back, what’s she going to do, *lecture you?* 

That has no benefit to her as a medical professional - which is her only relationship to you, she doesn’t think about or care about you outside of the appointment.

Whether she would or wouldn’t do the procedure isn’t really important.
You’re allowed to visit other doctors and specialists and have procedures done wherever you feel comfortable when you’re ready. 
Maybe your friend had a good experience with a specialist for the same thing/they came highly recommended, maybe you couldn’t get an appointment with the primary when it was best for your schedule, maybe you didn’t want to pay for a referral appointment and went straight to the option you knew would handle the procedure. There are many valid reasons to go elsewhere for something like this, and you won’t be the first nor the last person they’ve encountered in their *medical career* who has done so.

Prepare for *many* more denials and *many* more years of waiting and fighting. 

Be glad if/when it’s less, but expect it to be a long, hard road, as it is for most/has been for many of us. 

It is especially hard to be approved for mental health problems - and even more so if you’re younger. 

A diagnosis means and guarantees nothing. It’s a long road of proving that you’ve tried enough treatments, medications, therapies, etc. and showing you have enough medical records/proof.
People definitely get weird and wild! I’ve seen it all - casual, plain, loud, wild, way too revealing, costumes, all of it.

Given Seattle weather is much like ours down here in Portland - plan for the before/after, you don’t want to be freezing, soaking wet, or otherwise uncomfortable as you’re coming and going from the venue. Comfort over coolness, always - wear shoes you can stand for a while in, won’t trip/be easily knocked over in, etc. 


I’m excited for the Saturday show to be 21+ only for once - nothing like underage kids in next to no clothing who have no idea how to behave at a concert to put a damper on an experience 😅 - and plan to wear something sparkly/flashy, breathable for the show but with a warm jacket since it’ll be 60 out all evening. I usually wear platform boots to shows since I’m short, so I can see while still being able to balance and stand comfortably. 

You really can’t go wrong! Have fun with it and wear what makes you feel good, comfortable, and ready to party!
Have fun!! Post some photos/video if you can 😇 enjoy!
Absolutely ***do not*** ask to have an album signed ***during*** a set. That is so ***incredibly*** rude and disrespectful.

Trying to catch them by the van, merch booth, or standing at the front of the stage after the set/encore are completely finished and seeing if you can catch anyone is fine, and probably your best bet, but for the love of all things don't ask them during the set.

They posted a video of the merch booth on their story the other night - there was an enamel pin that looked like a green alien, a long sleeve shirt for the new album, a short sleeve for the new album, lots of vinyl/CDs, a “UR FUN” poster, and of course, many of David’s wonderful art pieces. 

I’m surely missing a few things, but those were the staples I noticed in their story!
I’m sure a lot of us are curious - what medication are you on? For how long? How is it “causing problems?” And how were you placed on it without any sort of diagnosis? 



That aside - the process of pursuing a diagnosis is never easy nor fun. 
Sleep studies are *awful* - and can be inconclusive or flat out wrong, and need further pursuing or retesting - and that’s with or without having to take time off your regularly scheduled medications. For some of us, that standard 2+ week med break is *devastating* - if not impossible and crippling. 
You’re not alone in that fear and struggle, and I’m sorry you’re having to face it during *law school* of all things!

As “embarrassing” as it may feel, definitely reach out to your school in some capacity. They should have a specific department that deals with medical accommodations/a “disability” specific department/worker. Get in touch, explain where you’re at, and let them know you *need* specific accommodations and exceptions during this time. 
Sleeping through class without alerting anyone about your specific woes obviously isn’t the answer here and won’t fly - reputable schools have a system in place to accommodate for cases like yours, but they can only implement them and help you if they know about it. 
It will feel a bit embarrassing, you’ll feel vulnerable, and not everyone will be understanding 100% of the time, but if you don’t advocate for yourself, no one can meet you halfway and help you - see what they can do when you explain, and go from there. It may not solve 100% of the anxiety or struggle, but once you know what patience your courses are willing to give you, you can make a better plan. 

I hope you’re able to find the answers you need with this path of seeking out a formal diagnosis! All the best ♥️
Have a blast!! Especially being your first time, you’ll be blown away no matter. Even if you don’t know a single song, they kill it, sound excellent, and the stage show is captivating. 
I always make a Spotify playlist of the set list beforehand to listen to in the days before the show - you’ve got time to learn some lyrics I’m sure! 😂
It’s typically the same, yes. 

I’m excited to go still, because they’re never a bad time, but this is probably my least favorite set list of all the tours I’ve gone out for 🥲 and I’ve seen them *many* many times. 
That said, there’s some great songs on there regardless!  It’ll be a great show no matter what.
The amount of people on this post who are like “right? When you rent, you can treat the property like complete shit, and if you break something, the landlord can just pay for it and fix it!!!” 

Y’all are the reason shitty slumlords and predatory property management are about all that’s left these days. Honest, good landlords lost all incentive and will to rent their properties out to you heathens.
*Thank you.* 

There is a difference between OP, and the all too common deranged homeless person who is chasing you, threatening you, assaulting you, brandishing a weapon, leaving feces and drug paraphernalia in the open and creating a massive biohazard, engaging in lewd sexual behavior in public, stealing, breaking into homes/cars, littering the streets with *mountains* of garbage, etc.


Pretending their isn’t is silly. 


The sub lacks compassion for the latter for *good reason.*
So bummed it isn’t on the set list this tour 🥲😭
If you don’t live with them, and you’re at *their* house, you sure do need their consent. Could be advance consent - “it’s cool if you masturbate whenever, doesn’t bother me” - or quick “is this cool” beforehand. But you’re most certainly not entitled to whip out your genitals and start going for it *at someone else’s house* whenever you damn feel like it, relationship/FWB or not, without prior permission.

I've seen them probably way too many times, so I've gotten to enjoy a lot of "dream" tracks live over the years, so it's hard to decide what I'd want for a full set list, given how many I've seen, and how much variety there is!

Trying to give the newest album some slots, and thinking about songs I haven't heard live/haven't heard live in ages... and without overthinking it too hard:

1. Bassem Sabry (I got way too into this song after hearing it live, no shame)
2. Peace To All Freaks
3. Id Engager 
4. Gronlandic Edit
5. How Lester Lost His Wife
6. Coquet Coquette 
7. Virgilian Lots
8. Nightsift
9. Sophie Calle Private Game
10. I Was A Landscape in Your Dream
11. Touched Something's Hollow
12. Hmm
13. Blab Sabbath Lathe of Maiden
14. We Will Commit Wolf Murder

Encore: 

1. St. Sebastian 
2. Deliberate Self-harm Ha Ha
3. Suffer For Fashion 

I've been to numerous shows on every tour since 2011, so have seen a lot of setlist variety. The one tour I missed was for "UR FUN" and I really regret it - would've been an amazing NYE show - because I've really been loving "Peace To All Freaks," "St. Sebastian," and "Deliberate Self-Harm Ha Ha" lately, and would've loved to see those tracks live.

Not *that* into the setlist for this tour that I've seen posted so far, but it's *never* a bad show, so I'm excited nonetheless!
Was going to say the same thing.

OP, your problem is this entitled, "why won't girls love me, other men are getting women but I haven't even been kissed, I have a stable job and want a family, why are women not lining up for me!" attitude.

The fact that you've even mentioned or considered a mail order bride/importing a wife situation speaks to some of the reasons why you are not finding a partner. A girlfriend or spouse is not someone you pick out of a catalog and "provide for" in exchange for sex, loyalty, and the partnership of your dreams.  
A relationship like you're describing happens organically, because you have a good personality, genuine love to grow with another person, and bring more to the table than cash and stability.

If you're looking for a person to have your children, live in your house, and be given the title of wife, you're not going to find a loving, genuine relationship. Because you're not looking for a partner, you're looking to check off a list of goals and milestones. That screams "desperation" - which no one finds attractive - and "possessive" - which is also a huge turn off. That attitude also tells potential partners that you don't really care about *them*, just what they're *doing for you* or have to offer you.

  
The point of starting a family, getting married, and building a long term relationship is doing it with someone you genuinely care about, enjoy, and love. You should find yourself inspired to do those things with someone you've been dating, not entering every relationship assuming it's going to get to that point just because you can provide financially and have a "house to offer" - none of that shit matters to a partner of quality, it's about the genuine quality of the relationship, not how rich or poor the partner may be. 

If you're just looking to get laid, hire a sex worker. For the love of god, don't import a wife from a poorer country, who would ***only*** be with you because she is essentially selling herself into servitude with you - and who will almost ***definitely*** leave you as soon as she establishes permanent residency, and will absolutely resent you from day one. That kind of shit is really exploitative and gross, and the fact that you're open to it shows that you're not looking for a real partner, just someone to tote around as a wife.

I highly recommend some therapy, first and foremost. 

From there, as others have mentioned, what do you bring to the table? No, not "stability" or financial wellbeing, personality, hobbies, etc. You have managed to convey zero of that in this post, which tells me you likely haven't held it to the same importance as having a decent paycheck and working out - which is absolutely a problem.

u/KellySweetHeart,

The posted subreddit rules - which we expect *every* user to familiarize themselves with *before* posting, and follow accordingly - *clearly* indicates in Rule #4 that posts regarding bugs, technical errors, and account related issues are **prohibited**. 

We are not directly affiliated with HiRez. It is pretty clearly stated under the rules in numerous places that if you have a bug, technical error, or account issue, the place to address that is on the Official Smite Discord channel, or by opening a ticket with HiRez directly - or reaching out to them via their direct social media platforms.

No one here can help with crashes on consoles, nor compel HiRez to respond.

Continuing to post about it does nothing, and your time is better spent reaching out to HiRez directly through various platforms. 

A post that is titled to include how HiRez "refuses to respond" to an individual users complaints/tickets can be classified as a rant/personal problem - and per Rule #3, " /r/Smite is not your personal blog, soapbox or helpdesk."

The rules are as they are for a reason. The amount of misdirected anger, ranting, unnecessary "bug report" posts, and just plain spam - 100 posts in an hour about a game issue that has been identified and is being fixed, for example -  that come from not enforcing rules like #3 and #4 far outweigh any benefits to allowing those posts to stay up, at times. The OP is no exception, and could also have fallen under Rule #8.

And frankly, given that you "have absolutely no context" because the post was removed, in accordance with the subreddit rules, I'm not sure what point you think you're trying to make here.

Gladstone* not Holgate.

I’d be curious how old they are, too! Glad they’re still around.
I think it's *definitely* different for a lot of men and women.

If my partner *really* wanted me to give it - or anything his-ass related - a shot, I'd enthusiastically try it for him once or twice. 

But he has expressed that he has zero interest in having that kind of thing done for him, and that doesn't disappoint me in the least, because I have *absolutely* no desire to do it, and don't think I'd get *anything* enjoyable from it, and find it super off-putting when I think about it.

 (I haven't talked down on/about doing "butt stuff" on him to him, for the record. I don't personally find it appealing or see it as something I actively want to explore, but I don't want him to feel he can't approach me with those things if he's curious/wants to explore, so I keep that to myself. Fortunately, he's very "nope, not for me" about it, so we're both in the same mindset.)

On the other hand, he's all about anal, anal play, eating ass, all that with me. So I think it's a preference thing, for sure, but men are more likely to want to go for it than women, from what I've seen.

It’s not something he did “long ago” - it’s something he does every single day. 

Every day that he says he loves you, talks about your time together/past together, and doesn’t tell you the truth he is actively lying and hiding his cheating from you. Every single day he *actively chooses* to lie to you and continue the relationship on a foundation of cheating and deceit.

“Until you’re in remission” - this wording might make it seem like there’s a decent probability you’ll end up having that experience, OP, but it very much is not the norm.

For most of us, it’s a *lifelong disability,* from which there is no “remission” - and for many, it gets worse as time goes on, and medication becomes less effective. 

Not that it can’t happen, but I don’t want you to get your hopes up either - don’t let a doctor tell you you should be at that point already/ever when you know the meds are needed. Get a second opinion, OP.
Damn, you're right. Huuuuge missed opportunity - glad you caught it, because even I didn't think of it at first!
>"I've suggested sex therapy, but again, her ego immediately feels crushed and she feels it's her fault for being "sexually stunted".

At this point, it *is* her fault. Not for being "sexually stunted" necessarily, but for having too big of an ego to *get some therapy* and work with her partner in a meaningful way. If your "ego feels crushed" and you shut down any meaningful growth or discussion in your relationship because of it, you are *not* mature enough to be in an adult relationship.

If you're unwilling to try anything, don't want to take the steps necessary to help yourself grow and work through some of your hang ups and issues, but also expect your partner to do 100% of the work and be 100% understanding, you are *very much the problem.*

I'm not saying that she needs to be into everything that OP is, or that she needs to bend to his every will and be down for everything he wants, but it would seem that she recognizes she's too "in her head" to be a very good sexual partner, yet won't do *anything* to work on it, and deflects and points the blame back to OP anytime it's discussed. That's pretty awful.

OP, it doesn't matter what anyone else says - if you are not happy or feeling fulfilled in the relationship, be it sexually or otherwise, then you have every right to leave.   
You can break up with someone for *any reason,* or *no reason -* if you are no longer "feeling it" in a relationship, or are no longer interested in continuing, that's ***enough*** of a reason. Period.   
You are not required to stay in a relationship that you aren't being fulfilled by just because "some of it is good" and quite frankly, no one should be pressuring you to do so - I imagine your girlfriend wants to be in a relationship with someone who is fully happy and fulfilled, not someone who is constantly feeling as though they're missing out and incompatible.

Sex is a ***huge*** factor in ***most*** relationships. It is a ***major*** part of intimacy, and is something that most people value with their partner in some way or another.   
A lack of sexual chemistry and sexual fulfillment is a ***hugely*** valid reason to leave a relationship, ***especially*** when you have put as much effort as you have into trying to fix it or work on it, and have been met with ***zero*** effort by your partner.

There are plenty of people out there who think it's "shallow" or "superficial" to break up over sex, and quite frankly, they couldn't be more wrong.  
These people either don't value sex much, have never been in the situation you have where they've had to make this decision, or are inserting their judgmental, shaming opinions where they aren't needed or wanted to make themselves feel superior in some way.

**You** are the ***only*** person who has to live with this relationship, and be with your partner. Therefore it is truly only ***your*** opinion and feelings that matter here.  
If you are unhappy and feeling incompatible, life ***is*** too short to continue to beat your head against a wall with a partner who isn't interested in working on things with you. 

Don't waste 5 more years of your life with someone who isn't right for you. Let her find someone who will be a better fit for her sexually, and go find the right person for you.

Thank you, from someone with *actual* OCD, for pointing this out. You're 28, OP. Diversify your vocabulary, for fucks sake.
Wo, I’m super jealous! Amazing piece! Absolutely beautiful - thanks for sharing!
“You’re too young to go on disability.” 


I’m so fucking sick of that shit. 


I don’t care if you’re 18, 21, 25, 30, so on… if you don’t feel you can work, your illness(es) cause too much suffering/pain/stress to maintain a career, or you don’t want to waste what few waking, working hours a day you have slaving away, you should have no problem being able to get disability benefits.


Period. 



You shouldn’t have to be “old enough” in order to “be disabled enough” to be able to survive and pay your bills. Fuck this country, truly.

u/That_Smile4646,

Enough of that. Consider this a warning before a ban, if you can't behave yourself and communicate respectfully, you won't be communicating here at all. Keep it civil.
Not a man, but going to comment anyway so you can possibly expand your post a bit and maybe get some more useful-to-you responses. 

Why do you ask, OP? 

Are you struggling with libido, finding that yours is lower than you would like, or declining, and you are concerned so want to improve it? (If this is the case, I’d also ask how old you are, and how long you’ve had these concerns.)


Or do you feel your libido is healthy and not of concern, but want to “level up” more, so to speak, so are just looking for casual practices that could increase it a bit even though you’re fine without? 


Because if it’s the former, you should almost certainly speak with your primary care doctor, and perhaps seek to have your hormones - mainly testosterone - checked, potentially see a urologist, or be recommended to a specialist that can help you directly. If it’s a medical problem - or psychiatric one - things like stretching and supplements *might* help a *little,* but generally won’t do much if you aren’t identifying, addressing, and fixing the core issue. 


If you’re just looking to increase and improve but don’t feel you have anything to worry about with it, and just want to up your game, that’s another story! 
Still doesn’t hurt to ask your doctor next time you talk to them, as they’ll be able to give recommendations more specific to *you* and what they know of your health.


Generally, maintaining a protein rich, healthy, balanced diet and getting a lot of vigorous exercise - well balanced exercise that works on different parts of the body, as well as cardio - will help nurture a healthy libido - when you’re eating like shit and treating your body poorly, libido is often one of the first things to get lazy as well. 
Being sure you aren’t vitamin deficient and get enough of the core vitamins you need is another one. 
In both men and women, porn/masturbation habits can impact libido - both positively and negatively - and are a good thing to think about as well. 

Sleep is another big one. Good sleep hygiene, getting enough sleep, etc. will help you in all parts of life, not just with libido. 


Can’t be of more help beyond that, as I’m not a dude, but hopefully someone else can get deeper with it for you!
It 100% is, and boy am I sick of people who try to reframe it as though it’s “not that bad” or “could be worse” - it’s absolutely horrible, debilitating, *exhausting,* depressing, and *absolutely* steals your life from you in *many, many* ways.
And to add to this, how can you expect someone to have sex with you, be satisfied with it, and enjoy it *at all* when you’re repulsed by yourself, are completely shut off sexually, and have no desire to have an open mind or work to please your partner? (OP is very “me me me I want a man who is satisfied by the admittedly extremely boring and limited range of things I want to do, never anything more” which is unreasonably selfish. A partnership is just that, you may have boundaries and hard limits, but how can you expect a partner to be down with the things you want if you’ll never do the same for them?)


OP *desperately* needs therapy. *Desperately.* 
To overcome the self-defeating, insecure, self-loathing body image/thoughts about herself, and to work to having a more open mind in relationships and towards sex. I know therapy isn’t an option for everyone, but there are - like you said - so many books and other resources to help and guide through this. 

OP, you’ll be amazed how different relationships feel and work when you value and love yourself, are comfortable with your body, are open to a mutually satisfying and open minded relationship - sexually and otherwise - and are no longer at odds with yourself - and others - sexually.
Found it!

I’m out of town in Bend for a wedding but am driving back in the afternoon and will be home around 9pm, as soon as I’m back, I’ll DM you a photo of the machine and some info so you know the size/type/all that, and if you still want it, we can arrange a time 🙂

Kindly stop spamming the subreddit with this post - two identical posts from two accounts is not needed, and if something is removed it is removed for a reason and you can address it with the mod team via modmail if you have any questions.

I’m so sorry you’re feeling this, but know you aren’t alone - many of us can relate, myself included. 

It’s very isolating. 

*No one* can possibly understand what this disease is like who doesn’t have N/IH. Period. 

There are people who will try to relate but can never relate on any level stronger than “oh yeah I’ve been really tired when I ____” - which just… isn’t it. Not that I don’t appreciate that they’re trying to relate, it’s just… not the same. 

Then there’s the people who feel like you’re being lazy, overdramatic, etc. because “I’ve been really tired before and I was fine.” 
There’s so many people like that and it’s *awful.*


My partner is amazing and I’m so grateful for him, but I wish he could understand fully what it’s like. He’s always understanding and patient, but I know he doesn’t truly get why I can’t do certain things, why I feel the way I do a lot, and what it’s like to be truly exhausted. I would never want him to go through it, and he never makes me feel bad for it, but I often wonder what he really thinks about it all, since he doesn’t truly know. 

It’s hard to relate to people in general because most don’t know anything about Narcolepsy - or only know the completely inaccurate stereotypes - so trying to explain that you have a severe disability and can never feel rested, and start your day 100 points behind everyone else often requires *endless* explaining and justifying, or falls on deaf ears. Lonely as fuck, for real.

Just know there are others out there suffering through the same horrible disease, who feel the same pains and frustrations, and who feel for you. It sucks that those close to you can’t always relate on that level or be as supportive, but you aren’t fully alone. 
I hope things improve for you ♥️
My partner and I have been together over 6 years. 
We have sex super frequently still. Every other week we set aside an entire day to do nothing but fuck - we set the downstairs up with lots of fun mood lighting, have playlists made, watch sexy videos we’ve shot, and go at it for literally 24 hours - sometimes we’ll drink mushroom tea, which helps sustain that length, too. 

We get extremely kinky and wild anytime we have sex. It’s always exciting, always super sexually charged and “horny” and we both tease each other sexually a lot outside of sex. 
We’re highly sexual people, talk about sex a lot as a topic - not just about sex between us - and are very sexually open with each other. I’m pretty constantly horny and have a super high sex drive. 

There’s nothing wrong with this. It doesn’t have *any* negative impacts on our relationship, and if anything, makes it stronger and more fun, since our intimate life is healthy and satisfying.

But we also talk to each other about other things, do other activities, and are fine if we aren’t doing something sexual. We discuss issues, we work through fights or stressful situations and emotions, and don’t put off important things indefinitely just to fuck. 

There’s nothing wrong with being super horny when you guys are together. Sex is a needed and healthy part of any relationship. You *should* be horny for and around your partner, especially this early in the relationship. 

But if you’re never talking about anything, never working through problems or stress, and don’t do anything or talk about anything, it’s just sex… that’s not a relationship. That’s closer to a friends with benefits arrangement. 

You both have to decide where your needs are at and what your goals are for the relationship. You’re young and barely see each other - it’s okay to just be about sex. 
But if you’re looking for something more deep and connected on a level that isn’t purely sexual, you both need to prioritize that, and make time to talk about those things. 

The fact that she’s an adult in college and has a curfew doesn’t lend itself well to an adult relationship, either.
I’ve also worked in Vegas. On Fremont. You have to tune out a lot of shit and focus on your main responsibilities to exist in that type of space on a consistent basis and do your job. With the amount of tweakers, crazies, and just ridiculousness, this looks very minor if you’re standing farther away from the area and have to be focusing on *your* job and *your* place of work. Expecting employees of *another bar or venue* to monitor this stage when it isn’t their job and notice that this is going on is a bit ridiculous. Should *someone* have stepped in? Absolutely. 
But people need to stop pointing fingers at employees who couldn’t have been further from needing to take responsibility for this.
This has nothing to do with brigading the *bar* that people keep posting on review sites. 

The stage is not associated with them. They have no responsibility to watch it or maintain the area, nor assign security for the area. 

People are so quick to brigade and “cancel” that they’re doing more harm than good.
Fitting you should use a gif of Portland, where security/cops are also nonexistent 😂
The business was supposed to do what exactly? This isn’t their stage, and this isn’t their fault. 
Y’all so ready to brigade you aren’t even putting your anger in the right place, or towards anything worthwhile. This is misdirected, and does literally nothing.
Yeah! The katana item - sadly for your house, not a handheld or backpack item - is really cool! Customizable in a bunch of colors too!
Dang, really? It doesn’t say one way or another so I *assumed* we’d get more… this long of an event period for 3 tickets total is really silly, and the rewards were definitely lackluster. 
I was stoked for an actual mini-game since the monthly events are so dang repetitive but if it’s only 3 plays total per person, this was weak 😅
Collar training is both a lot more complicated and a lot more simple than it sounds, haha

Basically just meant - get them a collar, put it on them, get them to wear it full time.  
Some cats take to collars right away - the younger they are, the easier this will be - and some *really* hate it. You can Google guides/tips to get cats used to collars - it can be a long and frustrating process with some cats, but it is 100% worth it to have the piece of mind of a GPS-chipped collar, if that's something you are willing to invest in and keep on them 24/7.

I'm telling you - when my kitty got out, I have never felt more hopeless. I knew that he was microchipped, and that if someone picked him up, we'd get a call, but there are so many indoor/outdoor cats and strays in my neighborhood, and so many overgrown yards for cats to hide, I didn't think someone would bring him in.  
If we had had a GPS collar on him, we could've at least known which block, or even which yard to look in. That would've saved us so much time, heartache, and frustration. I highly recommend it, because cats can bolt out at any time, and it's really helpful to be able to find them yourself.

If you do get your cat used to a collar, I would not take it off them. The point is to have it on 24/7 - which is totally humane and can be comfortable if you get a quality collar that fits well - so that if they *do* manage to get out somehow - bolt out the door, break the screen and jump out, etc. - you can locate them.   
If your cats are still small kittens, an AirTag is probably a bit too big right now, but get them used to a collar anyway, so that once they're a little bigger, they can wear one on their collar. There are other pet specific GPS chips/collars, but in my research, AirTag seemed perfectly accurate, and was the most cost effective.

&#x200B;

As for spay/neuter - get this done ASAP, seriously. You'll be a lot happier, and so will they. Especially if they're a male and female pair, this ***can't*** wait. You ***will*** end up with kittens.   
If it's a cost thing, look up "spay and save" type programs. There are low income programs for this, and it might take time to get scheduled, but it's extremely important.  
As for separating them after, I would follow your vets recommendations. 

There might be clinics/low income help for vaccines and such too, if that's why you've delayed.

When giving cats liquid medication, unless the vet advises otherwise, it is always easier for them to ingest it when mixed with a wet food. For example, the liquid dewormer I give my kittens, I squeeze the syringe onto a small portion of wet food, and mix it in, being careful not to spread the medication into the bowl but instead keeping it concealed on the food. Don't do this with too much, because they won't finish it, but give them each their own bowl, separately, monitoring them one at a time to make sure they eat it all - ideally do this when they're hungry, not close to a meal.

I personally have never trimmed my cats nails, nor had it done at the vet. I make sure to have quality scratching posts/toys everywhere in the house, and this has always been enough for me.   
People tend to get their cats nails trimmed/trimmed them when they scratch a lot, or use furniture as scratching posts. If you play with them often, provide plenty of toys/scratching posts, and redirect them when they're scratching at people/furniture, you may never need to do this.  
I still do the paw rubs to get them used to having their toes touched just in case, and because it can be helpful in general for them not to be skittish when touched in that way.  
You have to be careful when trimming, because you can hurt them. If you're interested in doing it yourself frequently, I would take them to the vet to have it done again, and ask the vet to walk you through it, and watch while you do a nail or two. They should have no problem doing that. They should also be able to recommend products to help with this.

It sounds like you've got an awesome scratch cactus for them so far! I get little scratch pads that I can mount to the wall/sides of furniture, in addition to scratching posts, and they have a cat tree with beds and posts on it as well.  
Cats are fickle - some will like certain toys, and not others, so it can be tricky to find the right stuff. Make sure and get some active toys, not just scratching materials - stuff that encourages them to run around and play actively, not lazily, so they maintain a good weight.

Best of luck with your kitties! It sounds like you love them a lot and want to do the absolute best for them. You're gonna do just fine :)

Some of us absolutely would. 

I’ve suffered in ways most people I meet can’t imagine. 

Goddamn right I’d give a hand up to absolutely every person I care about, who has helped me, or who I’ve seen suffer in my time.
I’d get myself a decent house, modest and safe vehicle, and a couple practical luxuries - like a nicer computer, some decent shoes, etc. - and from there, I’d be trying however I could to fix and lift up the community around me. 
I know that and can say that firmly because that’s how I’ve lived any time I’ve had any “come up” - it wasn’t straight into savings with the extra, or straight to luxuries, it was quick to “who can I help with this who will fall otherwise?” 

So, speak for yourself. Yeah, gross amounts of wealth changes a person, but if you have truly good values and know who you are, it doesn’t have to be a negative, greedy change.
Storming out is what a child does when they don’t get their way. 

Adults in adults relationships talk things out, and if one partner is refusing to apologize, they continue to discuss and share perspectives and feelings and come to a reasonable end of the conversation, or make a decision to revisit it later. Throwing a tantrum over a joke that fell flat and then running off to stay at your condo because you didn’t get the apology you wanted is childish as fuck, and a major overreaction. This was a joke, it doesn’t warrant this level of meltdown, period.
Right?? 

They’re super annoying to interact with, but the items are mostly great. 
The Pagoda??? Pyramid and Sphinx?? Katana?? These are all *awesome* items - I honestly love all of his furniture items, but those have been the most useful and versatile for me. 
I do find his task a bit tedious, but it really doesn’t take *that* long.

Gullivarrr’s items I have had less use for, but they’re still really cool, and his task takes literally 60 seconds. One piece and you’re done.

I don’t get all the hate 😂 Is he annoying? Absolutely. But the items make it worth it.

Agreed, 100%.

To me - woman - this is funny, I’d laugh with my partner after a great night, and we’d be on our way. I can’t imagine losing my cool over a joke, even if I *did* find it offensive. 

The level to which OP escalated this is extremely childish and ridiculous, and if I were OPs boyfriend *I* would be considering if I wanted to be with someone who threw a tantrum over a joke. 
If a joke falls flat, it falls flat. That’s it. Explain you didn’t find it funny, and move the fuck on. It doesn’t require an *argument,* storming off like a child to stay at your condo, or anything more than a “eh that wasn’t funny to me, let’s skip that one next time.” 

If he continued to make jokes like this after that, sure, it would warrant further discussion and eventually be a bigger problem, but man, talk about an overreaction.

I upgraded to an embroidery/sewing machine last year from just one that sews, and now that I think about it I have no idea what I did with the old one - which means it’s still in my house, somewhere, in a box, in excellent working condition.
Just gotta find it! I’ll look for it tonight, and it’s yours if I find it!
Collar train your cats and get them AirTag collars if you have serious concern of them getting out - honestly everyone should do this, it’s impossible to find your cat once they get out most of the time, and something horrible can happen so fast that it’s worth it. 

A microchip is great too and I recommend doing that as soon as you can. But if your cats get out, a microchip does nothing unless someone catches them and brings them into a vet/shelter to scan. An AirTag allows you to track them. 


Back in June, my kitty got out - bolted when scared by a loud car backfiring as my partner came inside, had never even shown interest in the door before - and trying to find him felt so hopeless. We literally didn’t sleep for 3 days, searching endlessly through the neighborhood and putting up posters. 
Ultimately, he was mauled to death by an off leash, unmanaged pit bull just a few houses down. The owner didn’t even stay to see if he was okay or take responsibility, just immediately bolted from the scene, and then tried to lie to animal control - fortunately other neighbors witnessed and gave their side of the story to the officer. 
I would’ve given anything to have been able to know what block he was on, nonetheless what house he was hiding at. He was chipped, but if he had an AirTag or other GPS collar, we could’ve maybe brought him home. 

Sounds like you’re doing everything right for them so far! If the screens are a concern, make sure to keep the windows cracked with next to no room, so they can’t bust the screens and get out - they will, believe me! - or try to reinforce them somehow. 

Enjoy your kitty friends 😇

Not just that, but establishing yourself/kids on Medicaid in a new state - once you get approved - and finding doctors, dentists, specialists, etc. 
Best hope there isn’t a waitlist for all those things, that the doctors you get are even remotely competent, that you can get the same prescriptions carried over and same standards of care, and that the providers that are covered are easily accessible and reasonably close to where you live. 

People seem to not factor medical/dental care and coverage - *especially* if they’re on Medicaid or plan to be - in out of state moves. It’s a *huge* factor that can go wrong in a lot of ways. 

Yknow, before you start factoring in the sheer cost of an out of state move - moving truck, transporting all your positions, gas/flights, breaking a lease or moving out costs, new deposit/first/last months rent, application fees, savings while finding secure jobs, etc. 

That’s simply not doable for most people. It requires massive savings, which most can’t accrue anymore. This is not a remotely reasonable suggestion for someone in poverty *ever.*
It’s “daily” as in a thread that is posted and refreshed daily, not “daily achievements” as in common achievements/frequent achievements. 

This *absolutely* belongs in the daily-posted *achievements* thread, because it is exactly what that stickied thread aims to keep from clogging up the sub. Couldn’t be more clear what that thread is intended for, which is this kind of content.
The Plaid Pantry on Woodstock and 55th has always been semi chill, but the other day, my partner went in for a quick stop, and was greeted on the way out by a tweaker with a *literal nail bat,* wrapped in *spiked wire.*
The guy asked him for a cigarette, and when that was a “no” asked for change, and blocked him off from getting back in his car. Boyfriend handed him $2, as that’s all the cash he had, and the guy finally moved.

A fucking *nail bat.* We’ve been having more and more unfortunate encounters in our neighborhood lately. It used to be so mellow!
“They’re kids!!” - that’s cool, should’ve thought about that and lined up early enough to get a spot that would accommodate them without ruining the view of everyone else, then. 

The kids excuse means absolutely nothing to me. I don’t care about your kids. 
I paid an absurd amount of money to be on this vacation, and if you wanted your kid to have a specific view/experience, it’s your job to plan for it and get them there early enough to do it without intruding on the vacation a stranger is having.
Haha, no problem! It’s not immediately obvious if you’re not used to looking for collections of posts, glad I was able to help ☺️
Just click on OPs profile, you will see the posts, as they’re the only post on their profile currently! 

Well done OP, really enjoyed looking at these and your past submissions.
Didn’t say anything about orgasm. 

If it isn’t “fun” or enjoyable, that’s an issue. Foreplay isn’t “for the woman” while PiV is “for the man” - and if that’s how you’re looking at sex, I feel awful for you.
An 8 year old has no place being there, either. Period. 

If it’s a kids free event, your shitty 8 year old is a kid, and you can find a babysitter.

“Rules for thee but not for me” is a shitty way to do anything, small business or not.
“That is the fun part for you” - uh, and the actual intercourse isn’t? This wording 🙄
Foreplay should be enjoyable for *both* partners, anyway. As should the rest of the act.
God I hope you’re joking. 

Can’t imagine *agreeing* with OPs hypocritical and toxic “rules” and point of view.

An 8 year old has no business being at an event like this, bosses kid or not. 

And regardless of if anyone else will “argue” it, this sends a clear message - I don’t value my employees, and any rules made only apply to everyone else, I am above all rules and considerations, and am entitled to do as I wish regardless of anything and everyone else. 

Good luck maintaining a healthy, enjoyable working - or camping event - environment if you go down that road, OP.
“These events are usually child free, as they should be because it’s an event *adults* look forward to all year so they can get drunk and let loose, but because we’re above the rules and our kid is so important and perfect and mature we’re going to make everyone uncomfortable and bring them anyway! Doesn’t matter that an 8 year old will be uncomfortable in this environment and make all the adults uncomfortable too! Oh, other employees with kids? Absolutely not. We’re the bosses so we get to bring *our* kid, but that one employee with the wife I don’t like better find other arrangements so I don’t have to deal with his heathens!”

Not a counter point at all, I don’t personally think. 

Ordering a bunch of parts on the internet and piecing them together in your house is *nothing* like the Savi’s experience. Building a lightsaber in their workshop and carrying it out into Batuu after, with a group of other builders, feeling the emotion and experiencing the atmosphere… not comparable to online shopping whatsoever.
Yes, and I have an “invisible” disability, even. 


Narcolepsy - no, I don’t fall asleep randomly, or collapse into slumber out of the blue with no notice and start snoring. 


But I have been asked to leave various stores, restaurants, bars, etc. and have been hassled on public transportation, and even at airports or *doctors offices/appointments.* 


A sleep attack can cause me to feel extremely dazed, fatigued, unsteady, perhaps dizzy or faint. It makes it difficult to think, see clearly, communicate properly, sit upright - need to lean or use more “exhausted” posture, I don’t just lay down. 

It feels like suddenly being hit by the worlds largest and heaviest truck physically, with an unimaginable heaviness crushing down upon you, and mentally you’re experiencing every fatigue/exhaustion symptom possible while your brain and body try to fight the blurred sleep/wake phase you live in constantly becoming even more chaotic. 


It can be hard to verbalize what’s going on. I can slur/stutter a bit, or be very confused/have trouble vocalizing or finding the right words. It’s like talking to someone who’s struggling to come out of anesthesia, or who hasn’t slept in 72 hours and is being woken up with an air horn every time they’re about to drift off. 


I have, because of this, been accused of being drunk, on drugs, mentally insane/psychotic, of being a “mentally ill homeless person here to cause problems,” of having something “seriously wrong with me,” of trying to pull some kind of scam/act “off” with malicious intent, etc.


I have been refused service because of this at all kinds of places, told to leave, hassled and judged, and have had security or law enforcement called on me in all kinds of places you’d never expect. 


I never just fall asleep in public, or lay down/start trying to nap or rest anywhere outside of my home. 
At most, I have sat leaning against a wall - in a proper seat, not just randomly where it’s inappropriate - or using my hand to lean my head up when a table is in front of me, eyes still open, to breathe through it. 
Do I look exhausted and drained? Yes, but no, I’m not sleeping/eyes closed. 


I think a lot of it has to do with me having substantial tattoo work - all professionally done, well kept, and not vulgar or offensive - and being a younger, small female. 


People are very quick to judge and assume I must be on drugs or up to something, because someone who looks *like me* couldn’t possibly be disabled or experiencing medical distress. 

This wouldn’t be that noticeable to employees at various establishments if they weren’t already profiling me for how I look, and then noticing that something is “off” - not that they wouldn’t notice when ordering/serving at a food place/bar or at a cash register for example, but this happens far more outside of those actual interactions. 


I don’t go out *anywhere* anymore unless I am dressed well, makeup done, and hair styled - I am assumed to be homeless/some kind of “drug addict lowlife” if I am not overly presentable, despite neither being true - and have a note in my bag about my situation with a number to call my partner or doctor - I don’t want to get into a situation where I am too exhausted and burdened by my symptoms to properly explain and am physically removed/hassled by security or store employees who think they’re “sticking it to another homeless nut job” who dared “act up” in their store. 


It’s pretty ridiculous, embarrassing, and hurtful. I can only imagine what it’s like for those with more visible disabilities.
Curious, did you end up going with Hatch, or did you opt to give Chroma a try? 

The Chroma trial definitely has me loving it over Hatch, but you also can’t export in trial mode, so I don’t know how my designs/digitizing would turn out when actually stitching, and that has me unsure as to whether I like Hatch better or not.
I’ve done this - it doesn’t. 

Got one from Goodwill - I couldn’t resist even though I have a few, he looked so sad there 😭😂 - and did two wash cycles on hot water/high, because germs/bugs paranoia. 
I tied him in a pillow case, made sure it was fastened between the two washes, and even dried him on medium heat in the dryer - still in a case, but with a blanket in there too so he wouldn’t bash around - and he was perfectly fine. No paint loss at all.

A Clorox wipe will also do a good job with the plastic parts if you’re too worried.
u/GarbageLumi,

Alrighty, the aggression and vulgar snap backs are uncalled for. Consider this a warning - lets calm down and remain civil, or receive a temp ban.

So is Christmas, Halloween, New Years, Thanksgiving, Fourth of July, Memorial/Labor Day(s), Valentine’s, Mothers/Fathers Day, etc. 

*Every* day is “just another day” - but *some* people enjoy holidays, celebration, and feeling a sense of joy on occasion to break up the usual “just another days” that fill the majority of our lifetime. 
Birthdays, especially, are a day for and about *you* specifically to celebrate your time on earth, and making it through another long, harsh year of living.

What’s your point?
God I hate when people make that comment.

It’s not a competition, and peoples need to be seen as “more tired” or “more exhausted” from “doing more” is pathetic and obnoxious. 

But as you say, if it *were* a competition, people without Narcolepsy wouldn’t even begin to stack up. 
People really don’t want to hear that though, and it seldom changes their views or mind. 
They’re still going “well a single mom with 4 young kids is still *way* more tired than you!!” or “well I’m a nurse and with my hours I promise you don’t even know what tired is!!”
Nope, point still stands. 

People can only really relate by comparing what they know tired/exhaustion to be. They have no idea what Narcolepsy feels like or does to a person - and the symptoms that come alongside the exhaustion - so can’t fathom that it’s possible to feel *this* bad. I wish there was a simulator we could put people in 😂
I *highly* recommend getting a second opinion/finding another doctor if at all possible. That is *not* the *legally binding* max dose *anywhere* in the US.
He is likely saying it’s the max dose *he* prescribes, or the max dose *for you* with *him,* but it’s clearly not enough for you and by no means is your only option.
(40mg is the ADHD max, around 60mg for Narcolepsy. You absolutely could take a booster or higher dose, and a great many of us do. I take close to 60mg, all IR, all at my leisure throughout the day. I literally started on 10mg and it was nothing, so was gradually brought up over time.) 

If you can, definitely seek out another doctor!! I understand the fear since it’s a controlled substance, but his word isn’t law, and if you aren’t getting the care and treatment you need, *fuck him,* find you a *good* doctor. 


The 30 day supply/90 day appointment thing is the case in many states/with many insurance companies. 


I can only have a 30 day supply at a time, but my prescription is mailed to me every month and I haven’t had an appointment to “check up” on it in over a year. 


From my understanding, it’s at the requirement of both your insurance and doctor how often you have to come in to get more prescriptions written, but 30 day supply limit is standard everywhere in the US. 

The max dose thing is separate from this and 20mg is way lower, period.
Do dogs live anywhere near you? Do people walk their dogs anywhere near you? Cars? Do cars exist in your vicinity? 
If yes, you have “predators” there that can and may easily kill them if - sorry, when - they get out. 

My well behaved - since you seem to think that makes a difference - indoor cat who wanted nothing to do with the outdoors for almost 3 years bolted outside when startled when I was coming in with groceries. 
Literally had to push past me and squeeze through because I barely had the door open at all and was carefully sliding in. 
He always would sit and stretch and meow hello when I got home, never even sniffed around a door. I never would’ve expected this.
This was June, and it still hurts every day. 

I searched for him tirelessly for 3 days. Literally didn’t sleep. 

He was mauled to death by a pit bull four houses down. The bitch that owned the hellhound fled the scene and didn’t even stay to see if he survived. My neighbor who witnessed the attack - and who had my number from lost fliers I immediately started putting up - called me and I FLEW down the street to her backyard. He took his last breath next to me while I sobbed and screamed uncontrollably. 

I live in a dense, nice neighborhood. You wouldn’t think there’s many “predators” but dogs exist, and they’re everywhere. 
You don’t think it’ll happen to you, but it can anytime a cat gets loose. There’s “predators” everywhere for cats that are frantic and out of their element. 

Cats are hit by cars way too often over here and it kills me every time I hear about it on Nextdoor.
Outdoor or stray/feral cats, raccoons, coyotes - they’re in more places than you’d think - certain birds, diseases, shitty humans… it’s absolutely an issue where you are.

And frankly why would you take the risk? Put a damn roof on the thing for the piece of mind and safety of your cats. It’s a no-brainer and then you don’t have to worry about it. You already put this much effort into building the thing, finish it properly.
Your doctor said 20mg is the *max dose?* Or the max dose *for you?*
Out of curiosity, because it definitely isn’t the max dose prescribe-able.
On the flip side, 10mg is pretty low for a great deal of us. I’d be useless on that tiny dose.

OP has been taking Adderall for 10+ years it sounds like - it’s hard to tell from their wording exactly how long they’ve been on it, but a diagnosis over a decade ago leaves me to assume stimulants have been involved that long or close to it. 
A dose that high - or near it - isn’t unreasonable, especially given tolerance. 

Many people who take XR take an IR “booster” for many reasons. IR allows you to choose when you need that extra boost depending on your schedule and other life factors. For a lot of people with Narcolepsy - and ADHD as well for that matter - find that XR *does not* “work” or last *anywhere* near 12 hours. *Especially* after prolonged use. 

Not saying OP couldn’t use to switch up their meds or play with changing the dose, but I don’t think anything in their post seems wildly out of the ordinary - aside from their energy levels, which quite frankly could just be a result of worsening Narcolepsy, as I know I’m not alone in finding that it has gotten progressively worse over the years.
Maybe because it’s extremely expensive, often doesn’t cover a whole lot - unless you’re paying for the *reeeeeally* expensive plans - and still has crippling deductibles? 

Dental care *and* dental insurance are abhorrently overpriced and inaccessible for many. It’s not a “why don’t you just purchase ___!” when so many can’t even get close to affording it.
I will say from experience, lip gets to be a pain to reapply all day, and if you’re eating/drinking frequently - or tend to purse your lips a lot in the heat, or need frequent chapstick - it tends to get messy even with the best makeup. 
The dots will be easier to keep neat and likely last longer, if that’s the route you go!  

Have a great visit! I’m sure you’ll look awesome no matter what you go with.
I went to the May 4th after hours event - at west - and ended up doing just the lip makeup. 
When I added the dots, I personally felt it looked a bit too Padme, even though the rest of my costume was Sith themed and I didn’t do my hair like her. I think it’s just such an “iconic” look that that’s instantly where the mind goes, but that doesn’t mean the rest of the outfit won’t stand out or it’ll be too close, just that you can’t really do the same makeup without thinking of the original character that wore it. 


I think it just depends on your overall look - how are you doing your hair, what other costume pieces are you wearing - as to if it looks *too* similar or not, but it sounds like if you’re trying for a Naboo tourist look, even if it does look “too Padme” that isn’t a bad thing, because a tourist might wear something on purpose to give that kind of nod. 

Otherwise I agree that ditching the dots, or moving the dots - temples? Along the forehead? Near the lips? - would be a way to keep them but avoid being too similar to Padme.
Agreed - and I’ve seen quite a few posts randomly while scrolling my front page sharing this sentiment, so it isn’t just you/us. 

I only need one more, so I’m hopeful that I’ll get it in the next before the goals end, but its been a slow crawl in comparison to the other tasks. 
A few of my friends market boxes have stacks of 10, possibly multiple stacks, so *some* people are getting them… but the RNG does seem a lot worse than the other goals we’ve had recently. 

I hope you’re able to get them in time! If the RNG is going to be this bad they should at least allow for market box purchases to count, at least adds a little extra chance.

I don’t want to taste my own vaginal fluids, and find the thought of going down on a woman absolutely repulsive, but I still enjoy receiving oral from my male partner. I would never make him do it, and have expressed many times that if he isn’t into it, he doesn’t have to do it and I would never have an issue with that. 

Likewise, he doesn’t *want* to taste his own semen, but is happy that I enjoy swallowing. 

Your ultimatum is really pointless and this outlook is incredibly immature. 
I doubt most dudes are *demanding* that you act like it’s the *best taste on earth.* If they are, that’s an issue specific to those partners - most men enjoy the sensation and experience but certainly understand it isn’t the most enjoyable for some women and are just happy with whatever you’re comfortable with, so long as it’s fulfilling their needs, just like you have clearly indicated you expect in return.
I just wanted to chime in and say that while I have not had a hysterectomy myself, your feelings regarding MAiD are valid, and if that’s the route you want to go, I hope you are able to do so, and find peace. 

All the comments acting like you’re ridiculous for not wanting to go through this process because it’s “relatively safe” and they’ve had “decent quality of life” seem to miss the fact that it’s *your choice* and not everyone *wants* to endure these things and struggle through all the steps necessary to recover or gain any decent quality of life afterwards. 

I’ve been severely chronically ill my entire life. I’m exhausted 24/7. There are definitely some things I would *not* be willing to go through at this point, regardless of the small potential benefits. 
Ending up in surgically induced menopause is definitely one of those things - I’ve seen how that played out for my grandmother and mother, and it was a nightmare - and I would lose the last bits of comfort I have in this life to that ordeal. 
I am not willing to sacrifice my sex life, put my sexual “setup” at risk, or endure the awful bullshit that is menopause when I’m already struggling to be present in 1% of my life as is. 

Given all the extra risks and factors for you, I just wanted to validate your concerns and say that no matter what you decide, you’re not wrong in doing what you feel is right for you, even if other people would choose differently.
It’s not just STDs you need to worry about here. 

Vaginal infections like yeast infections or bacterial vaginosis are a *huge* risk and problem - and quite frankly come with *disgusting* symptoms and often require really unpleasant medication - as well as UTIs, and other consequences of putting bacteria where it doesn’t belong. 

Doesn’t matter if you’re STD free and “hygienic” - these can and *will* eventually develop if you’re being this careless.
…Not sure what your partners balls are like, or how you’re doing it, but no, it’s never been *anything* like this for me…
Came here to say exactly this! 

They would 100% not be my soulmate if sex wasn’t a priority, enjoyable shared activity, and active part of our relationship, period. 

I value sex, sexual compatibility, and would not be happy in - nor stay in - a relationship without an active, fulfilling sex life where our sex drives are similar, kinks match up, etc. 

Sure, things happen, and it may be less frequent at times, or take a pause when big life events happen, but in general, it’s very important to me in a relationship and I wouldn’t feel fulfilled or invested without it - and a partner who would be my “soul mate” and match with me on that level would have the same values and thoughts around sex.
Inside is what we do most often, and it’s always enjoyable. 

I really love swallowing, so that’s a favorite too, but we don’t do it as often because we typically with intercourse, but it’s fun when it does happen.

I love when he finishes during anal, too, but it’s a bit more effort cleanup wise, so is also not as frequent. 

Neither of us are a huge fan of him finishing outside of me/on me. It’s a mess, and it isn’t as satisfying for either of us sensation-wise to finish “pulled out” so to speak.

Trying to give it a fair chance, so listened through it a few times today for the first time, and will revisit it a few more - I’m seeing them next month so want to at least be familiar with the songs, not knowing which might show up on tour. 

So far, the only songs sticking for me are “Hmm” and “Nightsift” - and honestly, I *love* these two tracks. 


“Hmm” really resonates with me, and feels very raw and emotional - the grief lyrics hit, it’s been a year of loss for me so this song just clicked immediately. 

“Nightsift” surprised me - first listen I was definitely ready to listen again and process it in more depth, but wasn’t sure if I liked it.
Since that first play earlier, I’ve honestly probably listened to it 50 times today. It’s really catchy to me, but not in the way you usually think of catchy. The lyrics are a lot to digest, but they *sound* good and the song just *works,* somehow. It just feels very polished and interesting to me, like I can’t stop listening to it and enjoying all the components. 

The rest of the tracks haven’t hit for me yet. I don’t have them, don’t dislike them, but don’t feel any attachment or draw to them at all, kind of a miss for me so far, but I expect them to grow on me. 

Overall, don’t hate it, and even if I only end up liking the two tracks and the rest don’t click for me, I would be satisfied with that because I *really* love these two tracks. 

I’ll be curious to see what songs make it into the rotation on their tour next month, and how they translate live. Really hoping for “Nightsift” at minimum, “Hmm” would be a treat but I might also have an emotional breakdown 😂😬
I hope you can find something! 
These seem fairly easy to make yourself with minimal skill, but I know crafting isn’t everyone’s cup of tea - or the energy/other capacity for it just isn’t there - so a knockoff would definitely be easier!  

Maybe reverse image search and see if you can find anything similar browsing Google images or shopping?
I feel like maybe Shein, aliexpress, alibaba, or something of that nature could have something similar. 
The quality won’t be fantastic, but then you can play around with padding/altering them for your needs, and have a few pairs at a cheap price for when they wear out. 
Alternatively there’s some fashion knock-off subreddits, maybe check there? Good luck!
Agreed! 

I always used to be self conscious that the experience wasn’t actually that good for my partner, but was something he did to please me/enjoy seeing me experiencing pleasure. 
Even though I knew I have good hygiene, smell perfectly normal, and all that, I was always self conscious and couldn’t relax during, thinking it must smell/taste unpleasant or be a chore.

When my partner verbalized how much he enjoys it, craves the taste/smell, and gets into it, it completely changed my feelings towards receiving, and made it an enjoyable experience for me, and not a tense one. 100% verbalize, OP. It’s a compliment to her, and might help her more than you know!
This is a designer brand selling fingerless leather fashion gloves. Not a brand for or marketed at disabled people specifically, and in no way selling these as wheelchair gloves - in fact, I’m sure they’d prefer them *not* to be used in that way, and rather as a high end fashion item.

These would likely not be that great for the wearer anyway if the intended purpose was a disability aid, as they aren’t constructed to be durable, comfortable, and supportive for those kinds of needs.
Definitely feels different!

The “lazy” spooning, taking it from behind on my side position feels amazing, and is great when we’re both feeling low energy - tired before bed, first thing in the morning, etc. - but definitely feels different than if I’m laying on my stomach, on my knees with my chest/head down, or on all fours. All those different angles feel a *bit* different, and allow for varying levels of deepness/force behind each thrust.
I would love the candle holders!! I collect brass/have my entire home office space done in brass pieces and these would look amazing amongst my collection!

The lamps are gorgeous too and would get use with us, but don’t want to be greedy 🥶
I asked about any potential risks of continuing the pill, before/during/after surgery, and multiple doctors told me they are negligible at best, and there was nothing to worry about.

Ask *your* doctor if you are concerned, as they will better know your circumstances, medical history, risks, etc.
I hadn't given this album a shot yet - I wasn't a huge fan of their last the one time I listened through, so have been a bit nervous since I'm seeing them in September and don't want to dread the new tracks - but decided to listen to "Hmm" and "Nightsift" to start after reading your comment, and I *love* these two tracks!! I'm going to give the full album a proper listen this evening, but even if these are the only 2 I enjoy from it, I'd be plenty satisfied.

Those who got there before you - because they prioritized it - shouldn’t be expected to rearrange and accommodate you/your entitlement/your kids, no matter what the setup. Period.

Yeah, I’d order some “surgery safe” jewelry to pop in right beforehand just to be on the safe side! 
Hopefully those work and it’s a relatively easy swap for you, whenever your appointment comes up!
Ah gotcha! I feel like for most piercings there’s no chance they’re going to close in the very short time you’re required to have them out, but no idea about nipples!
I’m confused why piercings would close up… aren’t you only required to take them out for the surgery, which takes a couple hours/not even an entire day? Unless you *just* got the piercing I’m not sure how it would close up unless I’m missing something.

Hope you find someone awesome who you can excite/gets you excited like this when the time is right! 😇
Haha, we are both very lucky, indeed!

I feel super silly about it, and it definitely can be embarrassing and/or inconvenient, but I also can’t really complain too much - it’s pretty wild sometimes how quickly the brain can just switch into “primal sex mode” over something without you really controlling it.
A past partner said he would get extremely, uncomfortably horny, if not a pretty decent half-boner when he thought he was smelling the lotion/perfume I wore all the time while out in public. 
I was never sure if I really believed him at the time but I’ve definitely been accidentally conditioned in similar ways since, so it’s definitely a thing! 

I hate that one of those things is eye contact with my partner, for me. We used to never really make eye contact much during sex - no reason, just wasn’t a big focus, I would often close my eyes when giving oral as more of a focus thing - and somehow 7 years later we’ve gotten into some pretty kinky shit, and yet *direct eye contact* has been a newer thing that drives me crazy. The downside is when we have that same direct eye contact in our day to day, my brain switches to crazy horny mode immediately regardless of circumstances.
Yep, couldn’t agree more!

A lot of people who want/like children are toxic as hell about it. Like there’s something wrong with you if you aren’t absolutely wild about the gross little shits, and everyone is required to want to deal with 18+ years of hell because it’s some sort of miracle and beautiful journey. 
I also personally find those with that special kind of intense, over the top desire to raise a child by birth a bit narcissistic, but that’s just me. 


Yeah, my childhood was horrendous. But I don’t want kids because I find *them* horrendous, which has no ties to my childhood traumas.
My life is hard enough without a sticky mouth to feed, and as someone with severe chronic illness I’m frankly doing the world a favor by not procreating.

Plus all those great things you give up! Nope!
I don't believe you're ***seriously*** asking me this, as if you somehow don't know, but to give you the benefit of the doubt, I'll put it very simply:

You're not having physical sexual contact with someone's political views. You are with their genitals. Do the math as to why one is more relevant here than the other.

I don't believe you have to disclose ***every*** piece of information up front that could potentially change someone's views as if reading off some kind of list. I do believe you need to be honest if they ask you, and I do believe if there's something out of the ordinary, or something that could impact someone's attraction/comfort/preference you need to disclose it before sex, period.

There's a reason this trans woman in the OP had sex with the lights off and didn't tell him until after. She was being intentionally deceitful.
The word "deceitful" is literally in the title, he obviously does ***mention*** it.

&#x200B;

You're being willfully daft, and it's obnoxious. 

&#x200B;

Bottom line is, when engaging in sexual activity with someone, revealing things like this that directly pertain to sex are required for someone to fully consent to having sex with you.  
While you might be angry about a hypothetical conservative woman hiding her political beliefs, those aren't directly related to sex, and most people wouldn't assume that they have relevance to that decision. I don't think it needs explaining why something like ***this*** in OPs scenario ***does***.
This is the right answer, period. 

There’s no need for “well hypothetically what if it was someone who had reconstructive surgery but wasn’t trans” or “yeah but you liked them before” - the bottom line is that lying and deceiving someone in order to engage in a sexual encounter is *wrong* and doesn’t allow that person to consent fully. 
I would say this about *anything* - regardless of peoples views on the trans element here, they were intentionally dishonest and misled OP.
He has every right to feel hurt, angry, upset, etc.
Mostly applies to damn near any “laws” here. 

Drug “decriminalization” means rampant meth/heroin abuse, open air drug markets everywhere, dodging used needles on every sidewalk, and absolutely unhinged tweakers *everywhere.*

Shootings are rampant and very few are solved or consequenced. 

We might as well refer to our legal system as catch and release - if caught at all, violent, menacing offenders are released quickly and likely not truly consequenced. 

Property theft/crimes are constant.

We have a *living wage* shortage here. Let’s get it right. 

The jobs struggling to fill positions are largely not paying enough to make it worth working them. 

The jobs that *do* pay enough to live have a crazy amount of competition anytime there’s an opening. 

The wages here *have absolutely not* gone up enough for the majority to make CoL manageable.
u/Roguerunway,

In the interest of fairness, consider this a warning, also. If you don't have anything nice to say, move along.
Alrighty u/GarbageLumi, that's enough. Asking people to not "be dicks" in response to your comments, but then snapping back with *this* level of venom to other users is unacceptable.

The report button exists for a reason - if someone is bothering you, or being disrespectful, report it and move on. You are still expected to follow the rules of the subreddit and remain civil to others, regardless of the comments other users make. 

Consider this a warning.
Absolutely not. 

The period of time I was collecting PUA - pandemic unemployment for non-W2 jobs - was the best period of my life. 
I could afford to live, put money in savings and have a safety net, and I got to actually *enjoy* and *live* my life, instead of spending every waking second struggling to survive in constant fear and anxiety. 

Fuck a job. For those of us without the privilege of a high paying career we can actually enjoy and thrive in/be genuinely passionate about, it’s all menial busy work bullshit. 
Who *wants* to work entry level, minimum wage jobs? Retail? Fast food? Are you *kidding* me?
It’s all demeaning, exhausting, horrible busy work nonsense *no one* wants to do. And when it doesn’t even pay a *living wage* it’s no surprise they’re struggling to staff those awful positions. 

I think a great many of us would rather not work the jobs available for the crap pay out there these days.
A great many of us would rather be able to enjoy our time on this earth instead of selling it for a pittance. 

And for those of us, like me, who are disabled and will be for the rest of our miserable lives, being able to afford to exist while not crippling and killing ourselves further in what few low paying positions are available to us would be a godsend.
I just picked up my cats ashes on Friday. 

Iggy was my best friend, a type of service animal, and my little shadow that followed me everywhere and was very social and involved in each part of my day. 
He died unexpectedly after being mauled by a horrible woman’s pit bull, and had a lot of life left to live, so I hadn’t really put much thought into his final arrangements before the time came prematurely. 

I am keeping his ashes in the bamboo urn the crematorium provided, and have his clay paw print, ink paw impressions, and fur clippings the crematorium took sitting on a shelf next to it, currently. I also have a beautiful painting done by an amazing Redditor who helped look for him displayed next to his items, with a couple toys he loved. 
In the future, I plan to have some of the ashes made into a piece of jewelry for myself, and a small paperweight/crystal type item for my partner.

I personally didn’t feel spreading his ashes anywhere was appropriate for the situation. He was an indoor only cat, and lived with me at only two apartments - my old one, which was terrible, and the townhouse I currently rent, which I surely won’t be at forever. Leaving “him” at either place doesn’t feel healing or “right” so we are keeping the ashes in the urn - possibly to replace with a nicer urn later - and will be bringing them with us wherever we move, to be ideally spread or kept with us when we pass. 

Some people might think it’s silly, or doesn’t signify “moving on” to keep them around, but I couldn’t imagine not asking for them, getting rid of them, or spreading them anywhere. Though he isn’t with us physically anymore, I personally feel it gives a lot of respect to those who have passed to keep their ashes safe and displayed honorably - sort of like a gravestone in a way.

My mom has done the same with my stepfather who passed tragically this last January. 

Do what feels right to you. If you feel you want to spread them somewhere, make a day of it, have it be a special event. Or keep them - you can have all kinds of beautiful things made from them, as a keepsake.
I would say if you’re on the fence, absolutely ask to keep them - you can always get rid of them or spread them later, but you can’t get them back, and may have that regret for a lifetime.
Alrighty, comments are getting wildly out of hand here. Enjoy the art - or don’t - and be on your way. The sheer amount of juvenile tomfoolery unfolding here has been outrageous and unnecessary.
I’ve never heard the term “bonus bones” but damn, that do be how it is! 
It’s ridiculous. I’m in more pain than I’ve ever been in in my life thanks to OHP and their terrible dental coverage. Eating anything is an ordeal, and I want to die every time I have to do it. But that’s what us poors deserve, right? 

Sorry to hear about your illness and financial woes - I hope things start looking up for you even more soon!
Care credit has a relatively low credit requirement as far as I know, so might be worth looking into them/similar programs, but given your situation it may not be viable. Worth a shot, though!

Hey, $500 is something! I hope you’re able to figure something out and get the work done. I’d look into dental schools in the area, but from my experience they tend to be backed up. Best of luck!
Don’t have any recommendations, sadly, but wanted to wish you good luck! 

It’s *criminal* how bad OHPs dental coverage is. The fact that they won’t cover root canals, just extractions, and then don’t cover any form of implants is *disgusting.*
Only wealthy people deserve teeth, apparently! 

Wishing you the best of luck. I had to have an extraction done because it was all too expensive.
Are you eligible for Care Credit, or anything of the like?

Agreed. 

Cost of living here versus somewhere like *Kentucky* is dramatically higher. 
Rent, all utilities, gas, parking, car insurance, health insurance, groceries, etc. all cost more, and won’t be going down anytime soon. 
The quality of life you can provide yourself here might be much, much lower depending on your specific savings, and what income you manage to get in the future. 
I wouldn’t leave a low cost of living with a job that’s highly invested and provides good benefits, nor would I leave a solid medical team - permanently disabled here, so I get how important that is and how hard it can be to find. 
Travel here multiple times a year if you have to, but given the high cost of living, how much of a nightmare Portland is in general, and other factors… I wouldn’t move.
I’m curious, have you been to Omega Mart? And if so, did you feel they did this “tutorial” and explanation in a satisfactory way, or did you have the same complaints?
I felt like it was a perfect balance, there.
Man, this would be an interesting new scam. I wonder how exactly they’d pull it off and what all it would entail. I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised, but definitely haven’t heard of this one before!

That's awesome! I didn't know that! I've never been to Paris Disney, but I've wanted to even more ever since they closed DCA's TOT.
Two months is *way* overboard for no sex, swimming, etc. 
Completely unnecessary unless you’ve had specific complications.
You’re right, it’s fine that you’re wrong - glad you can recognize that! 👋💁🏻‍♀️
Hate that I had to scroll this far to find this answer. 

Mission Breakout feels like the cheap retheming that it is, and it’s bad. 

It looks like someone glued a bunch of random computer pieces to a giant tower. Super ugly, and ruins the entire strip that you walk to get to it, which used to be a beautiful area framed by the Tower. 

The ride itself used to be much better, too. TOT was a wonderful ride - yes, even though the WDW version is more elaborate - whereas GOTG frankly makes *zero* sense, has one of the laziest ride “plots” I’ve *ever* seen, and is basically just a bunch of dumb one liners and brief, lazy screen flashes. 

They could’ve kept TOT exciting by randomizing the drop sequences and speeding it up like they did for the reskin. Wedging it into Avengers Campus was lazy, boring, and frankly is a huge eyesore from any angle in the park.
I think it sometimes depends on the skill level of the giver, too. 

It sounds like OP is maybe not that experienced, or that confident in his oral abilities. 
If this is the case, it could be that his lady *would* be more into it, but he just isn’t that great at providing. 

Or she could be, like you said, not that into oral in general. 
I think OP could use to talk to her about it - “are you not that into oral in general?” or “are there things I could be doing to make this more enjoyable for you?” - and perhaps try to improve his skills a bit before writing it off entirely as if she isn’t into it at all, unless of course she agrees that it isn’t her thing.

I generally prefer penetration, but my partner is *awesome* at oral, so I always really enjoy it, too. Before him, oral wasn’t my thing, because my partners weren’t good at it, and despite my best attempts at giving them tips or guiding them, it was lackluster.

This is awesome, would love to enter! 

Have a friend who’s going through a really tough time and is crazy into DnD, would love to surprise him with this.
That’s definitely privilege speaking, I would say. 

As much as I would also prefer to pay for my own hotel and attempt to be reimbursed if facing this situation, not everyone can afford that. I know I certainly couldn’t afford nights of hotel with no guarantee of reimbursement right now, and we don’t know if OP has disposable income. Perhaps they’re just starting this job, and are desperately awaiting pay. 
Many of us don’t have the privilege of emergency savings.
I’ve had some great experiences with Couchsurfing.com, so wanted to chime in and vouch for it as a good possible option! 

Granted, its been quite some years - last time I used it when traveling was 2016 - but I have been hosted countless times in the past and never once had a bad experience - and I’m a very small female who was traveling solo, and was pretty young a good deal of the times. Make sure and read the persons reviews and make sure everything sounds above board - and trust your gut if you get a weird vibe when chatting with them over messages to arrange, or even when you show up to meet them - but at least when I used it last, there were a lot of genuine, awesome people in that community. 

I used to host via Couchsurfing as well - couple apartments ago, inner SE Portland - and met some fantastic people traveling from all over for various reasons - in town for work and wanted a unique experience, couldn’t afford typical accommodations, etc. 

I still talk to a few of them today, even. 

Definitely check it out and see if you can find something that way, if other offers don’t work out.

If you find yourself in a true bind with nowhere to turn but a park bench, please message me. I am not in a great position to host someone right now - going through some “bummer times” after our cat was murdered and things have been a bit chaotic - but we have a large two floor apartment with a couch, kitchen, and a shower and are safe, good people if you truly have nowhere else to turn.

You can’t have it every way you want all the time, that’s not how life works. 

If you can’t transport yourself to work, but need a job, you need to start looking at work from home options. 

The government isn’t going to subsidize, schedule, and arrange transportation for you to and from whatever job you choose, that is not a program that exists - at most they will expect you to take public transportation and provide benefits towards that. 

If you’re trying to move to a city with more/better options, and need money to do so, I’d advise you to start being realistic about your employment options, and take what is most feasible so you can save up to move somewhere with better opportunities. 

“I’m home too much as it is” and “I can’t transport myself to a job” put you with little to no options for work.
🙄🙄🙄🙄

This shit is happening all over the city. Not in one or two specific, well-known bad areas. 
The shootings, the stabbings, the assaults, the car/home break-ins/thefts, the fires, the menacing by insane and unhinged homeless, etc. are happening *all across Portland.* 
You can’t just avoid them by sticking to “certain areas.”

Never would’ve thought that the block of The Nest would be an “area to avoid.” Nor that Gold Dust Meridian would be shot up. This shit isn’t just “gang and criminal element” shit happening in bad neighborhoods.
When there is no law enforced, everywhere becomes a bad neighborhood. 

There’s zero consequences here.
I miss when they had pork belly skewers. I’d eat 8 of those suckers in one visit. 
Their salmon teriyaki donburi is absolutely fantastic, though. I don’t eat nearly enough sushi when I eat there because their other dishes are so awesome.
It obviously means that either OP or their partner isn’t being honest about not having had sexual contact with another person - either before or during this relationship. 

No chicken or egg about it, it’s very clear.
The boop cards have been accessible and available for quite some time now. This is still not “solvable” with them because it’s an unfinished part of the story.
This will largely depend on the doctor/specialist/surgeon. 

I had a 20 minute phone consultation with a CNM, where I told her I was seeking a bisalp, and we had a quick chat about it.

She started by informing me that a tubal ligation was potentially reversible, but they advise that you not rely on that possibility/consider it permanent, and that a bisalp was absolutely permanent. She asked me if I was okay with this being permanent, and said, "may I ask why you are seeking this procedure?" to which I said, "Frankly, I absolutely hate kids, have always hated them, and don't want them." - and to which she said, "Cool! We just have to ask."

She let me know that there would be paperwork coming from her in the mail, which was basically a document that she signs stating that she believes I'm of sound mind to make this decision, and that she's giving the "okay" for the procedure, and which I will sign as a consent form. She said that these forms have a 30 day waiting period - meaning after signed, I have to wait 30 days before a procedure can be done - and said she'd have them in the mail right away.  
She also said she'd put in the referral for the surgeon, who would give me a call to set the surgery date, and answer any further questions I might have. She said a further in-person exam *could* be necessary depending on my health concerns, risks, and history, but that typically a video/telephone consult with the surgeon is plenty.

An hour after my phone consult with the CNM, I had a phone consult booked with the surgeon for a week later. I did not need an exam prior, but I also have a fairly normal history in that regard, and had a routine pap recently enough that it wasn't something they felt necessary.   
I did have to speak with them further about anesthesia issues, but that was a personal matter due to my health.

Another doctor might want you to do an exam first if you haven't had one before, had one for some time, or have some concerns/prior issues that they might want to check up on beforehand. I would say this is a good thing - you want to make sure you're prepared and that it's advisable to move forward before undergoing any surgery.  
It's impossible to know if they will say "no" after an exam or not - this would depend on a lot of factors. I suppose you could ask and say, "If I complete this exam, barring any major health concerns, will we then be moving forward with the bisalp?" and if the answer is not satisfactory, you can determine your next steps.
Agreed! 

Maybe in some situations a religious partner and a non-religious partner could maintain a relationship and be compatible enough to survive long term, but I feel like that only works if the religious partner isn't ***super*** religious, and doesn't subscribe to the limitations their religion imposes on them/their relationships.

There's just no way I could date someone for any length of time that was seriously religious in any capacity. Not because I have anything "against" religious people, but I just don't see how our values, needs, wants, and mindsets could possibly match up. Usually that extends into sex, which is a ***huge*** deal breaker for me.

It's definitely unfortunate that that conditioning exists. I'm proud of OP for acknowledging his needs and sexual values - it's crazy to me how many posts on this subreddit are basically "I can't break up with someone over sex, so what do I do?" when the answer is, BREAK UP OVER SEX.
My answer would be, “feel free to get closer to god - as close as you possibly can - but by dropping this ultimatum you’ve pushed yourself as far from me as possible, and the relationship has no hope going forward.”

I’m glad OP at least recognizes that sex is important to him and something he isn’t willing to sacrifice. Some people get so wrapped up in feeling like “I can’t dump them over *just sex,* how shallow” but sex is such a key part of intimacy and relationships, it shouldn’t be ignored.
Honestly, the kind of partner who decides *for me* and for the relationship that sexual intimacy is no longer on the table, period, indefinitely is not the kind of partner I would want to work things out with, phase or not. 

It shows a lack of care for her partner, that she feels she can drop huge ultimatums on her partner whenever she sees fit and expects he’ll just cave and go along with it regardless of his needs and values, and frankly shows sexual incompatibility to a major extent as she clearly doesn’t value sex the same way. 

Phase or not, no thanks. Too different of values.

I mean, you would think that, but man you'd be surprised sometimes, especially on this sub lol
Well duh, most preschoolers have homes, get all their needs paid for, and get 3 meals a day. Obviously they’re the privileged ones!

/s
I really love his Spooky Nightmares skin, but he’s just so painfully boring to play 🥲 he needs a rework *bad*
You’ve heard right - the disability process is not quick, easy, or fun, and a major roadblock for many is that you will not be able to work during the process, no matter how long it takes. 


You need to have *substantial* documentation from medical professionals validating that you cannot work *any* job - not just jobs you’ve worked before/feel you’ve been qualified for, *any* job they can come up with, from Walmart greeter to receipt checker, etc. - and that you will remain unable to work *any* job for a minimum of 12 months+ regardless of any and all treatments - and that you’ve attempted all treatments available, with nothing else on the horizon that your doctor feels might work. 

Depending on your age and work history, you may not qualify for one type of disability if you don’t have enough “work credits” - which would leave you with the other, which has *strict* limits on what “assets” you can have. 

Expect to be denied the first time. And probably the second. Expect to have to appeal, go through many painful examinations and doctors appointments, and to have to explain every aspect of yourself, your life, and your illnesses countless times. 

And of course, you can’t work during this time, so you best hope someone can support you 100%, or you have savings to live off, because it’s going to likely be 12+ months at minimum before you see a payment. 

A payment - if you are approved, that is - which of course will be so low each month you’ll remain in guaranteed poverty as long as you’re on the program, with no hopes of rising above the poverty line. 

Not saying don’t apply, but definitely do your research and decide if it’s something you can reasonably attempt. It’s a pretty fucked up system.
Met Shaq at my local mall as a kid - I live in Portland, not exactly a “destination” town, never has been - and man, he truly is *huge.* 
He was wearing a gigantic fur coat, which definitely drew your attention to him, but he certainly didn’t need that, you could spot him from miles away regardless.
I’m still so curious what happened! I drove by it as well, seemingly right as it started - the guy who I assume was responsible for it, or who’s stuff was on fire at least, was in the street waving people away frantically. 
We drove by on the opposite side of it though, it seems like.
It was before the “Yard” apartments or whatever those Death Star looking rentals are, I’d say 4 blocks before those apartments, on the right side going towards them. I drove by it as well last night.
You have no idea what that “same day” was like.

If OP was/is as insecure as they’re painting themselves to be, this “breakup day” they’re referencing wasn’t some out of the blue, “we’re done” event that the girl would’ve been caught off guard and totally emotionally wounded by. More than likely, dude was projecting his insecurities onto for a *long time* and they probably had a handful of arguments/disagreements/bad nights as a result. She likely knew this, or some kind of serious issue was coming, and there had been emotional turmoil for them both for a while. (Meaning, it wasn’t a smooth, healthy, happy relationship for both of them that suddenly split on this day, it was rocky for some time.)
OP is entitled to feeling hurt that she fucked someone that same split day, and act accordingly, but I also don’t think the girl deserves this much “hate” for fucking around with someone at that time.


Maybe she regrets it. Maybe not. Maybe she was so sick of having OPs petty insecurities projected into her, and being punished for them, and just wanted to have fun and feel sexy and wanted again, and it just happened to manifest during a highly emotional time. Who knows. 

OP can dump her again if he wants, and feel bad about it if he wants, and I’m not saying he is “wrong” or she is “right” but let’s not pretend to know all the details here. Often times relationships are “over” or “on break” for both parties mentally long before it’s official. Not meaning they act on that beforehand, but meaning that separation and numbness emotionally is there before.
This is semantics, though. 


Person calls to report dog in car, asserts that they’re going to break the window to save it.

Car owner sees person attempting to bash in car window, assumes they’re a thief/criminal, goes and protects their property, since they believe a crime is being committed. 

After the fact, car/dog owner claims they had the AC running, or dog had plenty of air from windows/a cordless fan/whatever. 
Window breaker claims they did not - and either they truly didn’t, or person didn’t thoroughly check and went straight to smashing. 

I don’t know about you, but I’d predict this ends in both parties being told it’s a “civil matter” - I don’t see cops siding with one person or the other necessarily, so acting like it’s so cut and dry… that’s not usually how stuff like this goes.
Not everyone likes kids, wants them, or can even tolerate them.
I absolutely hate kids. Chances are I would *never* get to the point of love - or even basic like/dating - with someone with kids, unless he lies and hides them from me, because that’s so far opposite of what I want, value, and can stand, that I would know right away we weren’t a match.

“Spacious micro-studio in a lively, up and coming neighborhood with relaxing open-air feel, and large, gorgeous windows to let in the sights and sounds of the city. Centrally located, with vaulted ceilings and unique modern design. $1,800 with utilities, ample street parking available.”
I wouldn’t say this is “quickly” - it’s been *a year* without any sexual contact, intimacy, etc. 

If OPs girlfriend is completely shut off to finding a solution - which it sounds like she is - despite continuous suggestions and attempts to work through it, then what exactly is OP supposed to do here? Continue to bang his head against a wall, getting nowhere, completely shutting off his needs and desires to cater to her stubbornness in this relationship? 

He’s already waited longer than I feel the majority of us would, especially given her attitude. At this point, she either makes a significant change or a breakup is the *only* real option.
Go be argumentative somewhere else, bud. 

I’m not going to pretend my personal experiences didn’t happen just because you don’t agree or like the narrative. Generally never had problems in NYC, can’t say that for Portland. Doesn’t mean either city is more dangerous than the other, nor did I say that or try to infer that. 
Bottom line is, Trimet is unpleasant at best and unsafe at times at worst. This isn’t in comparison to anywhere else, nor does it need to be a competition. Doesn’t matter what public transportation is like anywhere else, we’re talking about *here.* 
Peoples need to go “well it’s worse elsewhere!!!1!1!1” is why this shit continues to be enabled and ignored.
Never once did I say either one was *more dangerous* than the other, just that in my personal experiences - and those of friends and family - more assaults/harassment has occurred on Trimet.
Sure, one or two crazy dudes may not be a “huge deal” - until it is. 

I’ve lived in bigger cities - including NYC - and have been hassled, harassed, assaulted, and stalked more in Portland than anywhere else. I’ve had friends/family with similar problems as well, more consistently here than anywhere - and the comments on any thread about Trimet show these aren’t rare, isolated issues. 

“Just wear headphones” isn’t a solution. 
It doesn’t solve the issue - especially when these people escalate from annoyance to actual problem - and frankly people shouldn’t have to shrink down and blast music just to tolerate a commute home among all the crazies. 

By enabling these folks so heavily by “ignoring” their ridiculous BS, we’re only making things worse. This kind of stuff shouldn’t be tolerated, period.
I don’t know about anyone else, but personally I don’t care if they make it free, I’m still not taking Trimet. 

It’s not worth the legitimate risks to my safety, all the methed out bullshit, the genuinely disgusting shit that happens - people shitting/pissing/shooting up during rides - the lack of consistent busses/trains, the added time it takes to get anywhere, etc. 

I took Trimet for years, and it was always a shitty experience. 
*Now?* The way things are? No chance. 
You couldn’t *pay* me to take it.

I know it’s the only option for some people, and I hope it improves, but as it stands now it’s a lost cause for me, personally.
This is a great comment, and I agree that OP should consider these points and really reflect on how he *perceives* social situations versus how his wife may be taking them. 

Considering he’s admittedly had problems with being too flirtatious in the past, to the point where it’s this deep of a wound for his wife, I would guess you’re not far off here.

Regardless, couples therapy sounds in order no matter what.
Thank you for checking back up on us, and for your initial comment - it brought me a lot of calm at the time, and I really appreciated the sentiment, regardless of the way things turned out it was really kind of you! 
We are absolutely heartbroken without Iggy, but are grateful that so many folks reached out and have offered condolences - thank you again ♥️
….*What?*

I don’t know how you possibly reached this conclusion from this post, but you’re seriously off base. 

She’s clumsy, can’t take direction or suggestion on how to better please her partner, just *lays there* and moans excessively loudly while doing little else half the time, has zero rythm and makes no attempts to consistently learn when shown… doesn’t sound like a “sexual Ferrari” to me.
I have a foam/hybrid, and I honestly never feel my partner get in and out of bed, and I’m generally pretty easily jostled when sleeping. 

I don’t think it’s bad for sex at all, either. Sure, it isn’t bouncing all over the place like a trampoline like some spring mattresses feel, but this doesn’t impact sex negatively for us at all - if anything it’s more supportive and makes it easier to hold a position without wobbling all over the place.
I refuse to believe this is real. *What?!* 


…is this really a thing? Tell me you’re fucking with me.
Yeah, shit, how did they pull that off even? Some of these tags around town blow my mind - I’m not that knowledgeable in how people do this shit but where were they at to tag this?!
Nice, lots of awesome shows!

Particularly jealous of Heatmiser - how was that??
Thank you <3
Thank you <3
I apologize for responding so late, I needed to take a few days to process things!  


Thank you so much for your kind words and empathy. This has by far been the hardest loss I have endured - it's crazy how bonded we can become to our animals, it feels like a part of me is missing.

I'm trying my best to heal through this and find ways to honor Iggy as he deserved - he didn't deserve such a tragic, painful end.

I'm finally feeling up to the task of following up with animal control, and beginning to see what my options are to pursue the owner - no amount of money will make this better, but I feel it's only fair she at least pay for the expenses this caused, especially as I was not financially prepared to deal with all of this.
Thank you <3
