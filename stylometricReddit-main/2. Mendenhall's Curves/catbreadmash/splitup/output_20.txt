its another thing to be able to do something about it or for it to change stating that a situation isnt what it should be isnt really helpful on its own just because people should be a certain way doesnt mean they are or they will act it same goes for words people say stuff all the time but what they do can be completely different hm my husband is my best friend and he tells me im his all the time though sometimes i go and also more than best friends right haha were definitely each others best friend lol you got my upvote for hilarity and wit the therapist may be suggesting you also get individual therapy because relationships habe to have a certain amount of strength to be able to go through with it it may be entirely possible his therapist doesnt think your husband is ready and im seeing some flags that make me believe this is quite possible if there is abuse in a relationship if one person is abusive then couples counseling is not recommended it is a big no no at the very least an individual therapist can help you cope and make sense of your situation im beginning to think this bordlover guy is just uoldfashionmarine in disguise or maybe i have a hard time accepting that more of these types of people exist and take the time to be so mean and hurtful so many of his posts are likedivorce and his advice is the most negative out there just like those trolling mgtows who have try dump their poison on everyone and dont have the decency to leave everyone else alone because theyre unhappy and trying to believe everything is someone elses fault and theyre the best thing that graced this earth this guy just seems to want to get into a fight and its like why are you here what kind of loser do you have to be to dedicate your life to such self absorbed hate and bugging people on the internet about it must be lonely af yeah people arent always capable of the things they may want or wish for some people may try to work past being cheated on but without the perfect blend of perspective forgiveness and love many can find it a deal breaker because they realize the trust is too shattered sometimes the cheater isnt trying hard enough either some people lack self awareness some circumstances are different from others by getting married your typical monogamous marriage has the expectancy of exclusivity i wouldnt say its the cheated on persons fault for not being truly married cheating is a severe violation of that type of marriages principles thats a really noble and respectable way of responding to your situation op i know people who would try to manipulate or force the situation i just wish the world rewarded people like you more i really hope that you find happiness and healing for your heart through all this errr if you think race doesnt play a factor in peoples lives white male privilege does exist just because the obamas have reached success despite this doesnt mean that white male privilege isnt a thing and you hear about all these kinds of issues in the news about black people being unjustly attacked and treated much more harshly than white people just on the basis that other races are treated harsher than others means there is racial privilege gender also plays into things you hear all the time about how women arent in the top positions or are getting paid less than their male counterparts have you read about the toxicity of pixars work culture dont have to be a bat shit crazy left to see these things are real sure just like anything that term might get tossed around a little too easily but you cant just downplaygloss over it either yes i understand i was merely addressing your statement i dont know enough about the situation op is describing through her knowledge to have an educated opinion on it i addressed your statement because as much as it is true in most relationships whether theyre healthy or struggling it is very dangerous and not true when applied to abusive ones cheaters often trickle truth as well actually if you read more into toxicabusive relationships and such there are situations where more responsibility lies in the destructive partner it is a common myth to think that in all relationship situations its two people there are situations where it really can lie within one persons issues not saying thats the case here just that always is far too much generalization and there is psychology to prove it source should i leave or should i go by lundy bancroft you may be experiencing something called traumatic bonding it occurs in abusive relationships hmmm perhaps try go to rweddingplanning they are really good about answering those questions they can probably help with the specific wording and such i know a couple who asked specifically for no big gifts as they had to fly back home and got them anyway so keep in mind that youre probably still going to get stuff another couple i know asked that people just give them gift cards since they were moving to canada i dont think its too rude to ask as long as people know the circumstances weirdly as much as i wish it was otherwise i dont think this part is true ive seen plenty of situations where either gender have no problem still pursuing for some it can even become a kind of fetish maybe it is just occasional just even then it feels like it happens way too much i heard bear is tough to eat because of the odor however if done right it can be eaten in lieu of beef it seems source a blog post about a man who took home a bunch of bear meat and cooked with it yeah i can second this experience people treat you more seriously as a unit and being someones spouse lends a sense of permanence and importance you are officially your own little family and a part of each others family admittedly its a little strange when someone who previously didnt really care to interact or get to know you suddenly become friendlier its like you didnt care or support me before others may have a different experience but i have found that i feel different by being married as well theres a wonderful sense of commitment and security i believe they make things specifically for this purpose you stick it on the side of the tub and smear peanut butter all over it supposedly makes it easier to have a spot for your doggy to lick the pb and also to clean up after bathtime upvote to that why should any woman have to defend themselves from you it seems like you just want a fight and to invalidate them just like you invalidated the man who tried to answer you if you look at his post history hes already frequenting rmgtow ive begun to notice that mgtows like to come to subs like this to either try provoke people or say rude hurtful things to people struggling thanks for sharing this ive been wondering why sometimes my husband will accuse my intentions of being the worse thing possible i often blame it on myself because there was a selfish period i went through while he knew me not knowing who to date or who to trust yet i also know he went through an abusive relationship for four years ive been trying to show him that i mean the best and i love him sometimes its hard having to defuse situations that dont need to be situations if you know what i mean from your perspective if you dont mind me asking what are things that i could do to help show him that i am trustworthy and not trying to leave or hurt him to be honest the time that i gained the most weight was when i was really unhappy felt friendless and further isolated myself i started losing weight when i went decided to go try expand my social circles through any venue possible as well as only store healthy foods in the house no chips etc i completely relate to your situation about not wanting to reach out to people because youre uncomfortable about where you are ive been there while i agree its not best to totally unload on people who come newly into your life whether a first time or again and that sometimes i just plain dont want to because im ashamed or uncomfortable with myself i have come to learn in my experience that having people in my life to talk to help me pull through you can take baby steps or go at a pace youre comfortable it may actually make you feel better than worse to try give the friendship a shot if you really dont want to though then thats also okay just it might be worth trying despite how you may feel about yourself right now and your friends compatibility like i said i know the feeling of totally not wanting to and being in that position the one thing that started to pull me out of it was when a girl at school wanted to be my friend friendships are harder to come by as we get older so people who come to you wanting to be a friend are truly a gift love this post it was a much needed warming for my heart on a difficult day would love to hear more stories about these two what happened when they first met as atheists we chose to get married because we fell madly in love with each other and wanted to commit we felt we could be with each other for the rest of our lives because what we experienced with each other was meaningful and different were also both more on the romantic and possessive side so for us its something we want and take pride in being married to each other sharing the same name the sense of permanency the ability to say this is my husband and for him to say im his wife he enjoys doing that knowing that we want the same thing and were going to fight like hell to keep it umedievaleagle couldnt have worded it more perfectly at the end of her post because i feel the same way about my husband to quote this man is my present and my future and i choose him everyday were a unit and were still learning how to be a unit together for us my husband and i we werent thinking too much about the legal benefits when we became engaged we find those to be quite nice and appreciate them a lot though since we werent together for that long we just wanted to be married to each other not really a surprise because my father had a history of cheating on my mom all the time while they were dating while she was pregnant found out when my dad finally met a korean woman who took care of him the way he always wanted and im pretty sure is a former patient of his if not a current patient at the time they were dating bullied my mom into signing her half of the house over before asking her for a divorce came home one day on holidays and he has a surprise he needs to talk to us about turns out he also has a daughter so i have a little half sibling i am never allowed to meet my mom has her own issues jokes on him the woman got sick of his crap and sued him for a
