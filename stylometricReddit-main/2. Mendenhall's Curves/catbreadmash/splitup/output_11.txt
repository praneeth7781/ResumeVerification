anger management is designed for people who generally have trouble controlling their anger meaning they let it loose on anyone and everyone while abuse is an active and terrible choice the abusers make to hurt their victims as they dont do it to anyone else but people often think abuse means or equates to anger management and thats the danger because it doesnt it requires a specialized approach and even then most abusers dont stop abusing if op were to read attached it could easily become a weapon or actually hinder his progress in trying to become nonabusive this is a pretty good summaryexample of why generic therapy does not help an abuser one of the many reasons why is because abusers use their feelings when really its their value system and thought processes as an excuse to abuse their partner and they not only have an inflated sense of their own feelings but they see their partners feelings as lessernot important a generic therapist is typically not trained to deal with abusers and generic therapy is meant to focus and give validation to the patients feelings and is based on rational behavior the last thing an abuser needs is to focus on his feelings more thats the root of the problem he needs to focus on his partners feelings abuse is not a mutual dynamic abuse is not rational behavior an abusers warped thought process runs so deep they will start to manipulate or use whatever psychology they learn to further dominate and control their partners while learning how to hide their own behavior edit this is also not a theory this has been proven through a lot of study if you would like i can dm you a great resource to read if you need proof understanding attachment theory isnt going to get rid of his abusiveness or even address it if anything the warped line of thought that creates the abuse in the first place will use it as a justification and an excuse he needs very specific resources dedicated to dealing with abuse because it is such a different beast which people dont know thanks to the general myths about abusers the book itself is an excellent one and great to recommend in many other situations just not this one please seek out therapy that is specialized and designated for abuse and not give up even when it gets hard and challenging because the roots of what you have is very strong and toxic generic therapy will not help you and might actually make it worse its good you realize that you need to change not just for her but change period accept that this could be a lifelong process one key thing is to really really think about how you must have made the other women feel realize what your actions really are take accountability dont minimize it dont diminish what you have done or justify it to yourself over time realize how wrong it is to intentionally hurt and manipulate people stop having an inflated sense of importance about yourself and your feelings stop silencing women for your convenience you can unconditionally love someone and not enable bad behavior that is more of a real love youre a good person for recognizing the situation wanting to do something and i hope doing something too many people in this world dont care about others or what people do to them because its not their problem theyre not fixing or being responsible for other peoples drama theyre giving people the truth so those people can make informed decisions on their lives and acting as a person of morality and character would you can love someone and still not enable shitty behavior its nice thats enough for you but for a lot of people they would want to know the truth if they were in that situation and feel betrayed if friends knew but didnt say anything and allowed them to be cheated and lied to nor is it about igniting conflict its about resolving a bad situation how they choose to go about the conflict doesnt make it the messengers fault its fair to question her character and morality though no offense but your wife doesnt have good morality or character in this area its not uncommon because there are a lot of people who when things are convenient as they are or frankly they dont care about the victim say its not their place to help she doesnt want you to tell him because its her best friend doing the cheating but if it was her best friend getting cheated on i would bet big bucks that shed be all for telling do not stay with him it will get worse and even harder to get out when you have a kid the rages will increase in frequency and volatility remember people dont do this to those they love he does not love you he actively disrespects you and sees you as less than a person do your best to get out now before you become more enmeshed or emotionally invested your daughter your future second child deserves a good life as do you free of fear its interesting when i associate sense of family i think of people who enable and defend unhealthy behaviors to support their family because theyre closest im really glad that sense of family doesnt mean that standard ive always held it more as the meaning you mention in your post but lately i just encounter the enabling type in my association which makes me think perhaps i have just encountered people of low moral caliber and character despite their proclamations of being otherwise congratulations congratulations and good for you and your family and your family to be 3 im so glad you have their support katniss is also very aware of herself in the sense that she knows what she can move past from and what she cant she and gale had been drifting apart for awhile at that point because of their differing views towards the war him being the creator of the bomb device that killed prim was the final straw he himself knew that katniss would never be able to look past it and so did she i know a woman that won the jackpot met the nicest guy at 36 got married at 37 now has a child if someone like that can have a happy family surely someone good like you can too someone who has went through much hardship and has so much kindness left in them you will surely find someone who can appreciate all that you are the key is to have confidence to enjoy and cherish yourself to make your own life on its own whole and full even if you dont have a partner and that will attract a healthy partner to you because you wont settle for less and thats the most important thing we tend to choose the partners we think we deserve beautiful congratulations oh hes a gorgeous foal i love how gangly they are at that age its your boyfriends problem his people his problem its actually good he wants to help and support you this way i know you might be uncomfortable with the conflict it sounds like that to me but hes doing the right thing by you it doesnt really come off as him victimizing himself at all based on what you wrote you can need support without being a victim it may not be a permanent solution but a temporary one the gf wants to keep things safe for the rest of the children they can negotiate and if its a hard line for her and a hard line for him they can break up killing a pet by throwing it down a flight of stairs and bring physically violent to the point of assault it is extremely stressful living in fear around someone and living in fear that they will hurt the ones youre in charge of protecting it is hard being so severely limited in what you can do or not do because you are afraid of someone the girlfriend may be reaching her limit for reasons unknown to us perhaps op has refused to set any boundaries whatsoever up till now and now things have just gone too far for the gf yes nicole needs help but it might be important she go away for some time and get that help because it doesnt seem she can handle being around the family safely for now i knew a family who had adopted a girl from infantry the girl grew up and showed signs of being very disturbed the final straw came when she threatened the father with a knife and she was under ten years old at that point the family sent her away to a boarding school designed to help children like her they didnt give up but they knew when it was too far beyond their abilities to help or handle perhaps theyre is a compromise op can find to keep his family safe and still have a relationship his daughter the girlfriend might be open to compromise and negotiation its fair and honest that she openly says what outcome she would feel best with and they talk it out from there its important that people realize when their partner is making a sacrifice and that goes for both of them relationships are a lot of negotiation i dont think shes necessarily demanding or trying to control him by what it sounds like it sounds like shes tried to make things work but its legitimately afraid now they cant even have a pet because his daughter threw a living creature down a flight of stairs and she is physically violent this is probably not the case but ive also seen relationships where the person doesnt say their ideal outcome and immediately offers something reasonable and a compromise but the other party doesnt see that and continually demands more because they feel like if they say yes then thats their partner getting their way when in reality the partner is already trying to compromise and cant go any further hey there just want to point out that while what you say is true it doesnt apply to abusive marriages not saying ops marriage is or isnt abusive abuse lies solely on the shoulders of the abuser its the attitude of the victim being also at fault one of many things that trap and isolate abuse victims op definitely isnt in a healthy state of mind though especially if theyre family i worry about this the clever ones are manipulative and smart enough to get away with it thats what drives me nuts youre a bad guy if you do bad things and take advantage of another persons goodwill or basically use them l yes she is ultimately responsible for herself however it doesnt make him any less of a bad guy if you can please dont watch the movie the main star spoke out against the people of hong kong having human rights and supported police brutality it is disgusting that disney supported that as well as filming in an area where uighur are being kept in concentration camps furthermore i heard the movie is a piece of shit as well as having no songs so it seems like it would also be a waste of time it does seem like hes stringing her along sometimes people do that unintentionally negative they dont think about how selfish theyre really being instead of saying i dont want a relationship with op which would end his supply of sex and companionship with her he making excuses and trying to make it so he he can do whatever he wants without boundaries and still get sex hes not mature enough to be in a relationship based on what youre saying
