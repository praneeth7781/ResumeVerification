well behaved if her sisters husband isnt willing to give the dog a chance thats not ops problem and its her sisters choice whether she wants to come when i wrote my opinion it wasnt just as a dog owner it was also as a person who found the hard way that just because someone is family doesnt mean they wont take advantage of you be selfish or shitty sometimes you have to set boundaries and they need to respect it unless you want them to keep trampling over it i dont think her crating her dog to accommodate her sister makes her the bigger person and frankly that logic gets abused way too much people often say be the bigger person to someone because they dont want to deal with the trouble of the boundary breaker and because they think they can push that person over stella is so cute love she wouldnt compromise for you its your house and your dog why should you compromise for her the way she treats that dog isnt right and honestly it should go to a better home than to be banished to an attic and she claims to love that dog shes made it obvious what her priorities are as an outsider looking in thats my view your dog doesnt deserve to be shut away and hes got a lot less time on earth than your sister does and the more you give in over time the more your sister will expect it i know youre asking for a compromise but honestly i cant think of one and i doubt she would accept one i also dont think you should give one to her but thats just me with duck fat thats all the seasoning you need hi speaking as a woman here its entirely possible that its her association with those sex acts with that ex that make her not want to do those things now maybe shes ashamed of having done those things or because she doesnt want to remember those things with that person or maybe she doesnt want to be the person she used to be when she was with that ex maybe she didnt want to make videos because that shady ex of hers pushed her to do it in the first place and look at what hes doing with them now its so uncomfortable just knowing videos of you doing a sexual and intimate act with someone is out there ive done things a decade ago that i dont want to do now no matter how much i love or desire someone i can assure you it is entirely and very possible it has nothing to do with how much she cares or desires you that that is a beautiful friendship oh im sorry thats a pretty straightforward reason if you dont mind me asking what led to you guys splitting after so long together youd be surprised at how cold and how much people dont care once it starts inconveniencing them or it gets hard dont put up with that bullshit i understand the yearning to bond with an immediate family member the sense of loyalty but let me tell you from experience that they can be as toxic and unhealthy as anyone else toxic is toxic being family doesnt grant you special treatment if anything its all the more reason to cut them out speaking from experience dont waste your time with him lol reminds me how my friend ordered a super sick sports car her bf was with her when the delivery guy came and he kept trying to talk to the boyfriend and get him to sign her boyfriend had to say three times i dont know man its her car that might mean you just dont love yourself enough then you are worth more than how this guy is treating you and dont allow yourself to be poorly treated by people because theyll keep doing it by letting go youll open up space and time for better people and things i know its scary but it can be better lol manipulative people dont see themselves as manipulative they just know what they want and they do their utmost to get it by manipulating the people around them with words or emotions but they dont think of themselves as manipulative because then that would require they realize theyre not very good people and these kind of people just keep pushing boundaries and doing it because they get away with it and it works i wish i lived in iowa so youd have a place to keep warm and for your cat to be safe while waiting for your new home im so so happy for you its incredible how you stayed strong and persevered through it all you should be proud and fuck the people who make little of you for it as people they are nothing compared to you regardless of what material possessions they may own im not giving her a free pass she admitted she was wrong and that she shoudlnt have done that no matter how stressed she was and she apologized that shows someone taking responsibility we all make mistakes like that under strain youre correct that we only have one point of view but we are here to address the information she has given us based on how she has written it the husbands behavior is not normal and you seem to be giving him a free pass when it is clearly abusive behavior and abuse is not a mutual relationship dynamic you are also correct that our partners feelings affect our own however his reaction by being intentionally cruel and demeaning for hours is beyond the pale and is unacceptable strain stress of being provider all those things are things you talk about with your partner not things you punish and humiliate them for sure maybe op does that stuff in other situations but thats making a huge assumption because people dont normally behave like that why because its abusive and wrong the fact you are so eager to defend this mans clearly atrocious behavior is very concerning uh but his reaction was way wayyy overboard and he purposefully did things to hurt and sabotage her sure he didnt plot it ahead of time but he did things on purpose to hurt her for hours that is ridiculous and knew it could have consequences for her future he wouldnt even accept her apology furthermore it sounds like shes under a huge amount of strain that would cause anyone to snap now and then if internet strangers can understand that so should her husband i honestly think she is right to reconsider staying married because that kind of cruelty if hes allowed to get away with it will only continue because he knows he can having reactions is understandable and can be worked out purposefully being mean and coercive to your wife and literally humiliating her what is with the phone recording shit is flat out wrong youre supposed to work together not try to fuck each other over just because you can thats so wonderful i wish i was young enough to get a zoom visit too thank you for being such a wonderful santa even with social distancing and for bringing happiness all over i dont think hes forcing her to have an abortion they tried to be safe it didnt work he wanted to try be excited and supportive of the pregnancy and came to realize he couldnt be and hes not ready its better hes aware of his limitations now than to figure it out the hard way rather than the kid to grow up with an inconsistent parent at best and at worst an indifferent and resentful one hes respecting her choice to have the pregnancy while allowing her to know his limitations if she wants to pregnancy she can have it but he cannot handle being in a relationship with her and being put in a father role him demanding she stay pregnant or him pressuring or coercing her to get an abortion would be him being controlling over her rights to her own body from ops account it doesnt sound like thats the case he told her how he really felt and what they want is dealbreaker level incompatible make sure you have your ducks in a row by checking eviction laws in your state to make sure she cant pull anything over you shes shown herself to not be trustworthy at this point i wouldnt bother unless your parents basically beg and apologize and even then it would be a hard sell dont put yourself at risk for more trauma from them well thats fucked up im in a similar position with my husbands best friend and his wife the husband used to at least defend me a little but now hes acting just like her i dont know if its salvageable for you or me because when people act with such a lack of respect theres not much you can do dont keep enabling your mothers bad decisions warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info good for you op doing the right thing in no universe is her dad entitled to that kind of behavior brynn and her family are completely within their rights wheres my dog honestly there are a lot of people who can just emotionally coast for a long time because things are good or why just arent self aware until the chips are down so to speak and thats not your fault things can even be great in a relationship and someone will decide that it just isnt for them even though they think the other person is great sending lots of hugs to you i know the pain is unbearable right now i know how that feels too its going to hurt so badly for awhile like everything is ripped out of you just take one step at a time grieve feel the love of your support people and know that you are enough and you did your best how did you do it thats amazing lol when someone tells you that you should be over something by now theyre not actually sorry or remorseful for what they did they still think theyre right and just want the argument to be over with it may be best to severely adjust your expectations of your dad to be honest a lot of old mendads ive met they dont change and just stay horribly the same at least your stepmom is someone you can communicate to and is willing to work things out with you seriously dont count on your dad plus its not fair if sex only has consequences for the woman sex has much greater consequences for the woman religion as well as men has no business or say being involved in the government or in the say of womens bodies the effects of pregnancy is not temporary though his wife is going to have to deal with her body being torn up and stitched back together stretched skin having to lose excess baby weight for someone with body dysmorphia i can only imagine how much of a nightmare this is and some of those things do not go away i see where youre coming from but im not sure that is the best system either im sorry to hear that charities misuse their funds so much do you know of a better alternative shes not being insecure and invasive thats straight up inappropriate behavior for someone in a relationship and if it makes her uncomfortable he should respect and care about her enough to set boundaries i relate to this i use figo pretty easy and has already paid for itself i super recommend
