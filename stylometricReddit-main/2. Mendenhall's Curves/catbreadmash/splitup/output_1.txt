whether she knows it or not you made the right choice in deciding to take things slow while she navigates through her breakup and betrayal you can tell her that its not you putting her in a box but respecting that shes in a vulnerable position and that you yourself need some time to take things slow and figure dog out too shes not the problem its a whole situation where youd like for the both of you to stabilize before moving forward some clarification then i am not saying your behavior is one to one but there seem to be some parallels in thinking and the kind of way you believe is your right to talk people controlling people dont see themselves as controlling they just think people should behave the way they want or will behave the way they want because theyre right cool i would respectfully disagree that im dragging trauma into my own post perhaps i come across as the most balanced to you is because i do my best to be aware of how words can easily become attacks being respectful of a different opinion and patience speaking about my own personal experience was my way of indicating that even if you dont intend to you may be coming across as a certain kind of person if someone were to word things nicely to your face but think in a way that was belittling or invalidating in their mind where do you think the real intent lies thats why people are focusing on how you talk about your gf nor did anyone told you to silently walk away they merely gave their opinion on ultimately they thought things would work out and sometimes why as for your first paragraph again to me it lacks compassion and an understanding of people being different from yourself i dont agree with it at all good luck sometimes were not great with words and how we find across in text doesnt have the feeling intended or how we would like in person so feedback allows us to understand how we are perceived by others i dont know you which is why i say im reminded of my ex not that you are me ex by your words people dont think youre horrible for wanting the dog to be better trained they think the way you are thinking of the girl for her reasons of why she has the relationship with her dog lacks compassion or a willingness to respect a view outside of your own if its a value that you cant bend on thats fine but saying its the only view people should have not ok again its fine to want the dog to be better trained and to be less invasive to everyone around it thats not the issue i understand you probably feel attacked but also understand that you were verbally attacking and invalidating advice or opinions you asked for as a growth oriented individual im sure you are able to self reflect on yourself and your role in the discussion how you talk about her indicates how you think about her regardless of how you speak to her the way you think about your partner is a very important indicator of respect and health the way you speak about her is concerning read your post wanted to add that yeah there are people who leave their dogs alone for more than 10 hours should they no its unkind and not a great quality of life for the dog copy pasted in response to him thank you op in my comment earlier i mentioned compromise is important if you want to be with this girl and working as a team everything you wrote in response to uculturalemu3548 shows an inflexible way of thinking and beliefs personally i think everything uculturalemu3548 said is thoughtful and quite spot on her relationship may not be normal to you but it doesnt make it objectively strange and unhealthy youre trying to change your gf to fit what you want youre not trying to be understanding or accepting youre just labeling things as right or wrong and the truth is youre not objectively right or wrong in this several people have expressed that you and your gf both have the right to live your lives the way you want in this regard but that it may indicate its not the right fit for either of you tbh more and more you come across as someone who looks down on how his girlfriend feels and just wants to change her i once broke up with a guy for many reasons but one of the major reasons was that he wouldnt respect some basic things about treating my dog never drag him on his leash he was astounded that i yelled at him in public for doing that to my small senior dog who weighed less than 7 pounds i yelled stop it and immediately took my dog from him and the way he spoke down to me about various things like the way you speak about how your girlfriend loves her dog and are responding to people reminds me of him not a good look op in my comment earlier i mentioned compromise is important if you want to be with this girl and working as a team everything you wrote in response to

girlfriend loves her dog and are responding to people reminds me of him not a good look if its a huge issue for you the only thing i can really see you do is talk to her about boundaries with the dog that you need in order for the relationship to continue that said i do think based on your description of the dog and her relationship with it you will need to come to a compromise about those boundaries and the role of the dog for her its also something that needs a lot of time to change gradually for her and the dog training the dog not to jump in people this is a fair request not coming up on the bed while having sex that might be doable shutting the dog out of the room may not work so you might have to deal with knowing the dog is looking at you from somewhere in the room keep in mind that her reprimanding the dog lightly is not a sign of bad ownership necessarily because negative reinforcement isnt healthy all you do is teach the dog to be scared not to respect or trust your judgment and learn boundaries remember that are living things too with the cognizant and emotional ability of five year olds time and repetition is key you could discuss a training plan with her an goals you both agree on to follow for certain situations to get the results you both want team effort that is more helpful than saying i dont like your dog or how you treat your dog change it honestly i know for myself and how i feel about dogs i dont know if i would be compatible long term with someone who strongly disagreed with his i wanted to live with my dog or disapproved of my relationship with my dog i would be really sad feeling like i have to choose another thing to consider is that maybe one of the reasons this girl is special and different is what makes her attached to the dog in his way doesnt sound like youre too needy at all more like this relationship isnt right for you funny he mentions compromise when it doesnt seem like hes compromising it is scary and sad to break things off with someone especially when they are a good person but you can find someone who wants to spend lots of time with you and feels fulfilled by it yes its understandable that its comfortable but the point is that it might be because of the churchs way of teaching certain values and expectations of married life that it may not be helpful in terms of counseling to work through the specific issues in your marriage of course you are free to do as you wish it is just something to consider especially if the church counseling doesnt work out thank you in complete agreement i was wondering if anyone else had this view thank you for breaking down the phantom of the opera so beautifully dont think beauty and the beast is an incel story either that would be a gross oversimplification what she did wasnt a prank but pure disrespect and mean i never would have done something like that to anyone at the age of 16 your fiance should have your back but instead hes justifying his daughters mistreatment of you and not prioritizing your feelings moving in with him and marrying him at this point will only enable him to continue being this way please dont let them erode your boundaries and treat you less than you are worth he doesnt seem to have true remorse only reason sam wants to make up with matt is because the uncle is giving him consequences no contact if it werent for that hed be content to keep going the way he is ive found that when people dont come to this decision on their own and only through an outside influence it usually doesnt last and this is a clear cut case personally i dont think you even have to forgive him yourself matt doesnt have to forgive him either i have a hard time believing this person is local bc if someone is that big of an asshole it does get around the island op never said that he wasnt going to address the situation just that he thinks its a major case of codependency and possessiveness rather than true romantic attraction op i dont know which one of it the matter is but the truth and result are the same shes disrespecting your relationship and ignoring reasonable boundaries shes not being supportive of your friend and his autonomy someone like her doesnt get better or change they just get more toxic unless the person theyre jealous of puts their foot down and even then it can still go very bad her mental health is ultimately her responsibility in this case i hope youre able to discuss this with your fiance and if he doesnt listen you might have to tell him gently that you love him and its his choice but its not something you can handle in the long run
