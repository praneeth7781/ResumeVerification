of the way isnt going to be easy either keep working on yourself keep doing those worksheets aimed at men who want to change did you find those good keep feeling like shite not because i think you should be miserable but because thats a good sign youre not letting your pride or shame get in the way of you acknowledging your abuse and how wrong it is shame can be a big problem its good you are being proactive and taking these steps understand that abuse is the opposite of love and why the problem with this is that its very difficult for you at this point in time to not manipulate or do these things i knew someone who was aware their behavior was becoming abusive and the wrong couples counseling actually made it worse couples counseling works on the basis that there is a dual dynamic abuse comes from your thought processes and beliefs and the whole point of the battering program is to destroy that basis of your belief you really should seek individual counseling any professional couples therapist will not see you at least my understanding from my own therapist if there is abuse have you looked into lundy bancroft his website in the articles section has stuff for abusive men who want to change just scroll down a little and youll find it its really great that you recognize and want to change its not the feeling its the thinking behind everything that creates the abusive mindset how do you view your wife how do you view your family individual therapy may be useful if you are completely honest about your goals one of the key things is that you need to start respecting your wife deep down you are not respecting her as an equal hopefully you will find exercises and therapy may help guide you to the way of thinking that creates a good marriage when i was severely depressed i didnt ive literally lost muscle mass from it then i slowly started to pull myself out of the hole by telling myself i am a strong independent woman what would a strong independent woman do it helped me deal with what was happening at the time on the way that i focused on bettering myself instead of well feeling like i was human garbage believing in myself even though it felt like a lie i read something that really stuck with me he will come to see you as you see yourself another thing that helped me was realizing things could change and be better that people dont care where you were only where you are to be honest that situation isnt going to improve unless you create boundaries and that also means being willing to walk away my husband dated a woman who was not trusting and quite controlling and it only escalated and got worse he was in that relationship for four years and by the end of it he was quite depressed and was being emotionally and verbally abused the level of controlling behavior is seriously abnormal and unsustainable and the problem is that it has become an expectation and entitlement seeing that you dont want to leave her i really advise for you to go to individual therapy because a therapist can help you decide how to approach these situations and how to create healthy boundariesintroduce change they can also give you strength in how to cope in the meanwhile or help you make hard decisions when the time comes to it i dont suggest couples counseling as your gf shows indications of being abusive x200b thanks for sharing your story with me im sorry you have that pain as well its great you have a brother who cares about you its important to be honest and selfaware with yourself about what you can handle or not some people want to believe they can get over certain things and it turns out they cant causing extended misery for everyone at the same time it all comes down to how much you want it and how much both parties are willing to work or do what it takes to succeed its up to you to decide whether you want to continue and then if you do discuss with her what needs to happen and determine if its realistic to continue being together you probably already know all of this uthewickedwombat speaks clearly its okay if its not something you can accept at the same time there are other ways to view this situation if you want to find a way to continue its hard for both of you you feel understandably betrayed and shocked your view of who she was has become questionable you feel your trust and the foundation on which you began your relationship has been violated her on the other hand seemed to clearly want to put that past self behind her and not let it define her in the future or dictate things you admit you wouldnt have continued the relationship its understandable why she would hide it doesnt mean its okay but its really understandable i dont think that user is judging whether someones mom is normal or not they are merely saying that it is unfair to hold people who were raised by unhealthy moms to the same standard that people who were raised by healthy moms are and by standard i mean that you cant expect someone to have a good relationship with someone who is toxic for them and to red flag them for that is harsh from an outside perspective as in my mom gives a shit as to where she is and who shes around youd think my mom is a funny outgoing and sweet woman who loves to tell stories about her kids i see a woman who verbally and emotionally abused me to the point where strangers would pity me and one even gave me their phone number she wouldnt take me to the doctor or let me open a bank account or have access to money she beat me quite a bit and when she tells stories now about my uniqueness and individuality i see what shes really doing which is trying to show off how defective i am while making herself look like a loving proud mom i assure you shes not i cant get by a single conversation without her insulting me somehow thanks for posting about your experience makes me feel better knowing im not crazy for having these kind of experiences too and that really there are just messed up people in the world and also that there are ashleys out there 3 how can i make my husband feel like hes a lucky husband the way you do have you guys had any really huge hurdles to overcome between the two of you hurt youve caused each other if so how did you overcome any perceived negativity towards your wife honestly i may not fear getting raped or murdered but im certainly wary and cautious about it one guy invited me for a work session we were in art school at his house i barely knew the guy he confessed to me i declined he somehow ended up screaming at me and then effectively ditching me by storming out of his house for two hours i left after two hours and receiving no responses then he proceeded to be hostile to me at our school workplace when he felt i gave a friendlier response to a student on the job than what i wrote to him over skype omw to work another man grabbed my ass on a tinder date ive had men offer to help me by giving me a ride and then start touching me and keep doing it even when i ask them to stop theres lots of nice guys out there who dont do any of this shit but the problem is that there are way too many who do who either feel entitled or want to take advantage so i would say its more like being careful because you just cant tell with people its unresolved for you the things in our mind that are unresolved that we havent found closure for tend to stick the longest this is going to sound messed up but perhaps you need to try focus on the more negative aspects of that relationship if you start thinking about it this is a tactic used to help break unhealthy attachment you might be idealizing it and more than ever need to ground it while its normal to wonder what could have been its getting to an unhealthy point and even you recognize you need to move on with your life on the other hand also focus on the positive aspects of your current relationship put more effort into romance devotion into watering the grass that you have gratitude you can do it i promise ive known people who stayed in love with others for years and years they only got over it when they realized they didnt want to spend the rest of their lives that way its not trying to destroy their relationship its more telling rachel the truth so she can have the truth and decide what she wants to do with the relationship its also not being a bystander and basically enabling dan in being a shitty person you keep saying youre going to lose all your friends why would you lose all your friends over this furthermore if all these people are saying that you shouldnt do it then that says something about the kind of people youre hanging around you say no one here is seeing where youre coming from but it seems more like that everybody really does see where youre coming from theyre just telling you that you have to do the hard thing if you want to do the right thing and that you should do it of course it doesnt sit well with you this whole situation because it puts you in a place where you are putting your image and relationships at risk its scary and you might not come out unscathed its not fair to you no its not fair to you that dan is a shitty friend whos putting you in this position or that your friends arent backing you up and you know why those people arent backing you up because they dont want to have something to lose and theyre hoping if they all dont look at it then its not their problem but its really up to you on what kind of person you want to be and what kind of people you want to be around people respect people who do the right thing a lot more than people who think only of themselves and how to get by without a scratch think about how you would feel if you were rachel down to having no friends how would you feel if people you thought were your friends all lied to you because they were your bfs friends first even though he was treating you like garbage if you choose to do nothing at least know why and what kind of person you are by doing that you may think dan is a good person outside of his relationship but people dont work that way hes not a good person he may look like hes a good person to you because hes fun around you and hasnt done anything actively shitty to you yet but hes not it just happens you are either ignorant of shit he is doing to you or he just hasnt had reason to do shit to you yet hes not a good person because ultimately its about him he is not a good person and honestly you need to stop justifying you covering him and your relationship with him
