to yourself by saying that its fine if you want to be friends with a shit person but at least be aware enough to see it for what it is hes a fun guy to hang out with he treats you well enough for now but hes a shitty person ive dated a guy who was a total narcissist and a horrible person to me in our relationship to everyone else he was great because he cared about how he appeared to them and it made him feel good to be liked by people it just happened to be in his self interest to be good to those people ive met other people like that too people who are good to you or their friends if it serves their ego or self interest but are manipulativedeceitful shady shits when it comes to getting what they want and unethical that is who they are the only difference between you and rachel is that he hasnt had enough of a self serving reason or opportunity to do something selfishly shitty to you he is not a good guy i feel like i dont have the right words to describe what im trying to say but i hope the point is getting across you only see dan as a good person because he hasnt done those things to you yet its a lot easier to think of someone as a good person when you see them doing shit to other people but theyre good to you or it feels fun guess what what feels good and fun isnt always good or the right thing the easiest thing isnt always the right thing to do right now the easiest and most comfortable thing for you to do is what youre doing right now which is covering up for dan and essentially lying to rachel but its not the right thing to do youre not a good friend to dan or rachel because you enable dans shittiness and you essentially lie to rachel perpetuating an unhealthy lie of a relationship rachel still might be your friend if you tell her because at least youre telling her maybe she wont be or maybe shell need a ton of space for awhile but you should tell her maybe dan wont be your friend anymore but honestly what right does he have to chew you out on anything when hes making you lie for him stop justifying to yourself why you keep lying for dan and trying to take the easy route for this situation how can you expect the girl who gave dan a blowjob to do something that you wont even do youre honestly just running away from having to do something hard even though you know its right its not messed up to call him out on being shitty its messed up to promote and enable someone being shitty and essentially fucking over someone elses life just because they are your friend first and that says more about you as a person than you think very much agree with utheyear1200 youre trying to do a good thing but its a hard line to walk because of the level of emotional intimacy it is creating your girlfriend is feeling increasingly threatened because her feelings are being invalidateddisrespected which snowballs into more lack of trust you and your gf should try couples counseling if its possible however if you do please dont go in with the expectation of changing her mind but of really trying to build trust and do better by her that will help create more security and perhaps the counselor can help you both discover the level of boundaries needed for you both to feel comfortable as well as rebuild trust with each other to be honest ive been wondering how i would deal with a similar situation in the future from your gfs perspective only probably kind of worse my husband is friends with an ex he was in love with for 7 years and who considers him her best friend i dont know the reason he stopped pursuing her except i do know she met her husband around that time the awkward thing is that sometimes she does things that trigger to me as inappropriate the way shell look at him sometimes and this was definitely inappropriate unnecessarily reminiscing in a certain way about their time together with a wistful voice or something ive found a short email where she babytalked to him and he babytalked back shes married with kids it does not make me feel more secure at all my husband swears hes platonic only but you know what as long as theres sexual attraction possible as in youre not straight there is a danger not saying youre going to do anything just that the tension and possibility is always there i know a straight women who then was with a gay woman for 35 years the straight woman never considered herself gay because that was the only woman she was ever attracted to my husband didnt see how things were weird my mistake was vocalizing it to him repeatedly in the wrong way until his ex recently did this reminiscing thing at our last get together not even he could admit that wasnt weird and it was only that incident that made him realize that maybe she does reminisce or think about him in a certain way that may not be entirely appropriate you may not be able to see the situation as well as your gf does because youre inside it and sometimes we dont know ourselves as well as we think we do or other people how did your husband say that to you and how long had the problem been going on im trying to find a way to get through to my husband who used to not be like that to me but it results in him freaking out or raging i end up silencing myself without even meaning to congratulations on making that change i grew up in an abusive household and had to change a lot of undesirable things myself its hard taking responsibility and even more so for changing thats really awesome of you to have listened to your husband and do all that hard work for your life together op ulimitlessclient has really good advice for you here dont let it go too far i didnt heed my couples counselors advice when he told me and my husband that my husband needed to take responsibility and i needed to stop making him feel better about doing bad things i didnt make the stand for myself early on and things only snowballed into a bigger monster that everyday im trying to figure out how to fix dont let her get into that way of thinking because that way of thinking leads to abuse the thing about abuse is that there is never a good reason to abuse someone especially your so your so is the person you should treat with the most love and respect because love is respect no matter how angry or despairing someone feels it is never okay to hurt and abuse another person under any circumstance the reasoning justifications and excuses are all the traps of an abusive mindset love is being kind and communicating in healthy productive ways uapprehensivelecture nailed it congratulations so happy to hear that youve found your way and are thriving its great that your daughter and son know what they saw for themselves and see how hard you tried wishing and hoping for the very best for you and be proud of yourself for finding the strength to carry on and for giving your all i read your previous post and its really commendable how you tried to break a bad cycle problem was that your wife was perpetuating it all on her own im sorry you had to go through so much pain if its alright may i pm you for some advice im in a situation that may sound familiar to you and your experienced insight would be so very much appreciated if hes a piece of shit why are you friends out of curiousity edit also you have my upvote because that is so true that assholes come in all forms sorry i hope that wasnt too much or too intense thanks im hoping that somehow this incident will magically come out better than i thought it will i just get sad because i feel like whenever i start hoping when things turn out otherwise it just hurts all the more the thing is though that the people who do that usually do it to people they can get away with the other people are usually in on it to some degree they like the instigator more and dont do anything about it it just sucks becuase it doesnt seem like theres much op can really do about it but at least you know that youre not a bad person like that op ya people suck i like your name utamagotchigraveyard ive been having a numbingly sad day but your username made me feel a little happy thinking of tamagotchies and frankly how massive their graveyards must be hahaha ive seen that video its one of jordan petersons better ones cant say im a fan of him but he does say some good things and for all things is an intelligent guy thanks for the link it was a good reminder and i wish i had watched it before even deciding to try ask him how he was feeling he gets so strung out and defensive asking him how hes doing feels like punishment i guess x200b it never truly goes away at least in my case its something i always have to be aware to try prevent slipping back down into i view it more as in how much better it is i can gauge that based on how positively or at least non negatively affected i feel about life and people the biggest thing is that im more proactive and actually have the initiative to want to do things and can even enjoy things or find them funworthwhile i can be more mindful of my sos feelings and support them better when i am depressed i dont want and cant feel the motivation to do anything everything feels tiring futile or pain i am incredibly tired for no reason at all and not even my little dog can cheer me up though he tries ruminating constantly what i found helps even though it feels like im lying to myself at first is just not allowing my thoughts to reach past a certain point if i start dwelling on negative thoughts i make efforts to stop thinking about it by doing something else or actively dismissing the thoughts i was only able to start doing this with the help of the right therapist and medication i had the wrong therapist for me before finding the right one and the results were disastrous even right now i dont think im normal or all better because i struggle on days where the anxiety feels like itll eat me up alive but im learning how to get through those episodes to feeling more normal i try to convince myself that maybe even if things arent great right now if i focus on making things good and not focusing on the bad things i can change the ending to my story by changing my story to a positive one so kind of like by believing in a positive outcome i can reach for myself it allows me to be stronger in doing what i need to do to make it happen doesnt matter if you mention it to her or not because thats how youre thinking in your mind which is reflected in your actions yes it is important to have understanding what
