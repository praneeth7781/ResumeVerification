what surrounds them abuse isnt a mutual dynamic there is such a thing as reactive abuse or a couple that lack conflict resolution skills if someone is truly abusive theres a power dynamic as you said with one in the position then couples therapy and even individual therapy is a bad idea because they tend to manipulate the therapists either way and the therapists only ends up teaching the abuser how to mask or justify their behaviors i agree with you and its so awesome you and your husband have reached that place thats super impressive and i hope to have that kind of tenacious love my impression of ops post was more describing situations where youre being taken for granted like my ex who waffled about being with me through his actions and words from the start if i had more self esteem i would have walked away instead of jumping through hoops for someone who could just not feel that way about me lol i had a roommate where if she likes you then shes just a social beam of sunshine with great morals but i dont believe kindness is a situational thing and she definitely makes it so she reads self help books but was one of the most selfish people i ever dealt with but justified it with modern self love language survivor bias i know people who got it and dont think its that bad and went around doing whatever because they already got it i havehad an ex with a small penis incessant lame crowing is a pretty great description hahaha thank you so much for validating the observation of how people retreat into unhealthy family dynamics of fear it is so frustrating definite power play good for you dont text him unless maybe to break up because that shit is unacceptable im sorry i hope things feel better soon yeah when i get the turn the other cheek argument i use the fact that all it really does is make you a doormat and the sad fact of life is that oftentimes respect has to be enforced sometimes it is only earned through enforcement like would everyone obey the laws if there were no police you teach people how to treat you you seem like a good husband and your wife sounds like shes very strong person esp in light of overcoming everything thank you for saying everything you did out loud here op its so true too many people want to avert their eyes because its uncomfortable for them to deal with it even want to admit so they blame the person standing up for themselves its wrong along with the fact that too often people dont hold other people accountable if theyre friends or its not happening to them i applaud your integrity its good she has you and its a nice narrative to help bring a sense of closure frankly in short what im saying is that she might have dodged a bullet and a bunch of other potential issues instead like what if he favored the other children blatantly over her or was a half hearted presence it is better to not have that contact than to develop a greater host of issues i understand where your wife is coming from however oh for sure i know someone who only contacted her bio mother for health history reasons other than that she was perfectly content with her adoptive family it does seem to not be the norm though and for the situation i described to be far more common whether the children are adopted or not i get the logic truly its just that ive seen so many people blind and clinging into to toxic family dynamics and traits because their brain cant objectively deal with the fact they might be directly descended from an asshole this is a grass is greener on the other side scenario its sad how we as humans have such an ingrained desire to be loved by our bio parents even if their not in our lives at all honestly gives people too much power to fuck us up more than they should have also contributes to unhealthy idealuzation and toxic family patterns yeah murakami really has a thing for ears generally its polite that if youre the one canceling that you make the effort to reschedule the event you canceled if not youre kind of sending the message that youre not that interested in the event happening that is so fucked up the inlaws and lily not you guys yeah thats the logic and maturity of an asshole pp it may not be that the partner isnt willing to support it would be hard for anyone to support someone if they were to obsessively only think and talk about this while derailing their lives by not working financial strain is hard and being the only support system partners are there to support but theyre also not therapists who are trained to deal with trauma both parties deserve some compassion because trauma is difficult to navigate through im having a hard time explaining to one of my friends that no matter how much better off someone else might be you cant keep asking them to loangive you money sounds like youre describing a person assistant doesnt seem like a bad problem i know someone whose boss just has to text her and shes the one scrambling to get the right people on the phone for the restaurant reservation and specific table for the plane tickets dealing with healthcare buying groceries driving all over town basically you have someone doing your grunt work huh i understand that feeling am not rich but if i died there are def people i dont want my stuff going to if you dont mind me asking what were those 4 years like has it affected how your feeling and how you see her permanently at all if you dont mind me asking what mindset did you have going in when you started reading the book like where were you in terms of self awareness i feel like the abusers in my life wouldnt even be able to grasp that the behaviors describe them to a tee theyd just blame it on something i did or find a way to make it about me not entering just saying its really cool youre doing this props to you generous human aw i love that story and that photo you two seem so happy and content i know someone who had a third kid by accident despite having an iud forget exactly what happened but that kid was not intended for yeah you cant rely on someone like that who is so selfish and self absorbed that they throw a temper tantrum literally endanger your life and only offer to help if you pay them in pounds of flesh fuck that fuck him good for you i admire your strength oh hitachi wand i highly recommend i understand what youre saying i just dont think thats a good enough reason there are other games and means to keep in touch with people you encounter through games and yes i used to play mmorpgs so i get the lonely factor and the appeal therapy for life mental healthcare is expensive so i can roll with that as a huge totoro fan i am in love with your work lucky son ops friend has been reprimanded before though and even in that case threw her relationship around with op too it doesnt seem surprising it can be pretty hard and quite expensive to go cruelty or carbon free for your everyday necessities ultimately games are not a necessity i do agree we should be careful of judging but as a general rule if anything we need to at least be judging when it comes the treatment of other humans and a persons response to it cruelty and discrimination to a person due to their face is wrong as well as for their gender identity or sex people literally being treated as objects and securely harassed is wrong and people who stand by say and do nothing side with the abuser because theyre essentially saying they dont see anything wrong we should be encouraging people to care and make change where they can not putting them down for it lol how is giving a monthly subscription to wow different talk about heavy denial thats disturbing i had an ex who would say and believe things like that which is why hes an ex now your bf having that view is a good indicator of his values he sounds rather entitled and tit for tat which is unhealthy for a partnership honestly family loyalty may mean that ops husband may not ever do anything or really care ultimately ops husband is siding with an abuser enabling and supporting toxic behavior enablers lie to themselves to justify their own weakness please dont be rude to pap smears those serve an important function towards womens health i had a weird reaction to getting a compliment from an acquaintances bf that to this day i still dont understand as i have no romantic interest in him and just see him as a super nice guy hes the kind that builds people up im pretty sure its because i never received compliments from anyone other than my sos i tucked my hair back after receiving a compliment and to this day i cringe because why ice cream what made him finally change his mind at the end of 3 months as someone who knows people who are genuinely celiac what are your thoughts on people who do it as an optional diet instead seriously though thank you for asking the world needs more curiosity in it basically when blizzard blocked one of their top esports players for supporting hk and when they made an anti hk pro china statement human rights and democracy nbd amirites sometimes people overlook a lot of things because personal investment or how that person makes them feel it was already upsetting seeing a lot of employees and peoples responses to the hong kong incident my faith in humanity was so low i didnt think people were going to care with this lawsuit im glad people did your post is lovely the thing that worries me though about her going to counseling with an emotional abuser is that they tend to manipulate the counselor and can do even more damage its truly a hard situation its frustrating when people idealized their friends without acknowledging the harm they are doing to others bias is real thats really sad has this affected your relationship with him his friends are good people to look out for your wellbeing like that oh the biggest shitbags are often the ones best at hiding it this would be expecting too much of people sometimes people genuinely dont care or they really just listen to the first version of the story they heard or nobody really knows and its just a mishmosh of things where people throw their hands up and say who knows what happened and by the time things get cleared up so much time has passed they just think well it doesnt matter anymore people also create their own versions based on the perception they have on someone sadly all we can do sometimes is know the truth ourselves and surround ourselves with people who support us and do the right thing just because it is the right thing oh it would definitely take a massive movement and thats why every single person counts because thats one little bit closer to getting the movement to be massive its the power we have as consumers and one of only ways we as consumers can hold them accountable and create consequences youre correct in that there are other ways to create awareness
