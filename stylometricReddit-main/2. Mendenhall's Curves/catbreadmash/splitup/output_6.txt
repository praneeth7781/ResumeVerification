as well however this way shouldnt be discounted either im so sorry your mutual friend was a horrible person like that thats not healthy behavior for a friend and it definitely would be in your and ultimately his best interest not to enable it a young man journeys to consult a forbidden god in a faraway land on how to survive his loved one on his loyal steed he seeks out and challenges gigantic creatures made from stone and magic hi may i please also have the link to the website with all the chapters for drifting dragon i came late to the thread thank you so much im curious what was your take on hong kong what made this the thing that caused you to quit no judgment here just wondering what was it that led to the finality of your decision im sorry youre going through this nobody deserves to live on eggshells when you say biding his time do you mean you think hes only staying until the time or opportunity is right so true controlling people dont see themselves as controlling or the fact that theyre really only thinking of themselves they see it as youre wrong im right unfortunately i was thinking man why are there so many shitty horrible people in the world and how do they keep on getting to to be that way im not that surprised the someone could be that horrible people can be truly selfish and cruel airbnb customer service has turned into absolute garbage and i say this from experience they could care less how your life is affected and they dont give a shit from over there in india i literally had the person in charge of my case ignore me for hours while i scrambled to find another place to stay as the place i had planned for canceled the night before and i couldnt stay longer where i was the only reason i got any help at all was because i called so many times i finally found someone who did give a shit hours later and got my case transferred to them fuck you airbnb im sorry i totally get the breakdown thing and the hopelessness and the despair i really hope something is available in time for your party and again fuck airbnb theyre just assholes speak kindly and nicely she may not realize things have been weighing on you conscious communication is a must hey petname i love that youre working hard at school im just starting to feel worn out from work and all the housework i do it would really help if we could divvy up the chores as its starting to feel like too much and take it from there she might fall back into old habits because this has been the way its been for so long but just remindpromptappreciate it and over time shell form new habits that will re establish and improve the work distribution thinking your partner is a bad person with bad intentions is never a good way to go into a discussion please dont yes a lot of people love him but there are also a lot of people who dont and just because his books are good did what they are doesnt mean hed be a good fit for continuing grrms legacy the creative process isnt always a simple straightforward one hes mentioned how taking time to live and do other things helps his creative process and i can very much believe that would you rather he rush it and probably create something that neither he or the fans would be happy with even if he never finishes the book series we can still be grateful and happy that he created the world that he has for us to enjoy and everything that has come from it its rather entitled imo to denounce his side projects as its still his life and he had the right to make it as fulfilling as possible for himself and there are lots of people who do enjoy those side projects a lot of people havent created and contributed content like he has that is enjoyed on such a great scale yet they are so quick to cast stones saying they are owed more game of thrones and cowboy beboooop oh thats refreshing to know i first heard of okeefe with people saying she drew vulvas and vaginas or whatever and to me i was like oh i just saw a flower speak up for your partner talk positively about her and her qualities praise and extoll her virtues so others may see them and stand up for your wife and put down disrespect when necessary aw looking through all your photos truly heartwarming such a cute couple wishing you all the best i have small breasts but i love wearing my bras i feel so much more relief youd be surprised at how conflict avoidant people can be or how manipulative yep my husband and i really dislike his best friends wife i loathe her at this point because she treats me as less than a person and because of how shes treated us and more or less prevents us from ever seeing him not to mention tries to use us when convenient but its not our place not when they got married and not now after they have two kids to say anything lol reminds me of a girl in college who hated me for having the same last name and for wearing shorts i had no idea i didnt even know her at all until a mutual friend told me turns out that girl also had major insecurities about being short and not skinny i was tall and slender sometimes its really just them not you that level of doneness looks gorgeous medium well is overcooked to be medium rare ftw my concern is that the buddha will lose theres a pattern where the author shows humans being strong and overpowering the gods in the beginning but the gods still win y e s love this i couldnt read the whole poll properly so i chose i want to see results oh my god i dated one and over time i just kept feeling he was more and more of an ass one big issue was that i told him i felt stigmatized by how he was treating me as i had been misdiagnosed at the time with bipolar disorder multiple doctors afterwards questioned this diagnosis and i am doing much better now he just brushed me off and told me im just trying to make you better its laughable remembering the times he told me i was being manic just because i was happy over time i realized this lack of empathy applied to everything and he only did things or cooperated because it appealed to him but did not care about what was best for me or my feelings at any time hello first off all thank you thank you for not supporting an abuser just because its easy or due to some fucked up loyalty it means so so much too often the mans friends and family side with the abuser enabling and strengthening it and cause the victim to think even more is it just me whats wrong with me as everyone else said approach only the wife for now let her know she can go to you guys and that youre both theyre for her that youre safe and support her to better know how to support her reading lundy bancrofts book is a great resource because it has a section for friends and family on how to best support an abuse victim and understanding what theyre going through it will also give you greater understanding should you read the rest of the book on why being abused is so absolutely mind fucking some things to start off with dont push or tell her to leave him that will only make her feel more cornered and judged she needs to decide that for herself otherwise its just more pressure validate her and her feelings and give your support time and care good for you for not supporting family in their wrongdoing and for supporting the people who genuinely need it and are victims of the wrongdoing dont be a doormat ive found that sometimes hard lines in the sand are still reasonable yes please tell us sounds amazing i one day want to visit italy and now even more so than ever oh i hope to go see your guys work one day what a dream tell and support the sister in law you love throughout this find a new job the rest of your family may choose to support your brother instead dont accept shitty toxic family members and dynamics please understand everything in about to say is for your safety and mental well being do not go to couples counseling do not recommend individual therapy for him it usually makes them worse get individual therapy for yourself please read lundy bancrofts books they will help you through this confusing and difficult time in understanding what is happening to you hopefully these things will help you gain clarity and help empower you to do what is best for you and your child while therapy can be an amazing tool it has been unfortunately overglorified a couple reasons being there are so many bad therapistsmatches and can easily become a yes man situation in regards to abuse different kinds of therapies are built on specific foundations and whats not commonly known is that couples therapy is based off the belief there is a mutual dynamic but abuse is not a mutual dynamic and therefore it makes things worse on top of just outright failing for abusive relationships god of war 3 as an example of an intentionally designed world as well thats a great example where you can tell it was intentionally designed because each area is made to fit the storyline and has very specific details to guide the player where to go i hope they go into some magical echo chamber where they cant hurt other people that toxicity would destroy oceans haha warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info i had a friend once in school i started attending the same college i invited her to go to a workshop together people said hello and came up to talk to me afterwards she messaged me on aim to say that nobody liked me and they were only talking to me to be polite and that i should quit bothering people she did a lot of fucked up things before and after but it was when my roommate said this person isnt your friend after seeing the messages i realized it wasnt me who was the problem shes very good at putting up a persona she would brag to me all the time about how people adored her cutesy self im not exaggerating and she has lots of friends i dont but at least im not a mean manipulative asshole another thing to take into regard though is the fact that it sounds like the wifes family treats op well so its not a drag or a pain in the ass for him to be around her family in fact it sounds like he appreciates them a lot for the wife its probably like getting teeth pulled bring around his family because of the mutual dislike thank you perhaps you should consider focusing on gratitude as well as look at things from your wifes point of view really understanding and being supporting can go a long way your resentment creates the blaming negative thoughts shes controlling etc due to for lack of better words feelings of entitlement it skews things
