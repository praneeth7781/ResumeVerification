you went through and are going through is monumentally hard and you can do it what a fun family i understand why you feel like that ive been in your situation you dont understand why he would do that because you love him and you wouldnt do that to him he doesnt love you he doesnt care for you the same way you do for him its hard to accept that because youve been together for awhile and you love him its difficult accepting that this person you thought you knew and what you thought you had with him doesnt exist he would not be the first and be far from the last guy that keeps a person around for the benefits and convenience its good your boyfriend is furious and wants to confront them and by doing so standing up for you so many people have the exact opposite problem ive been where you are thinking and wanting to play nice hoping it will get better but doing it that way it doesnt ever get better i also realize it was a product of my low self esteem and people pleasing desires maybe thats not the exact case for you but sometimes respect has to be enforced and your boyfriend is the right person to confront his friends on their shit its also good that he is clear headed enough to see that they are not good people even if they are seemingly outwardly good to him hes just one giant red flag a lot of things youre saying sounds like abusive behavior screamingintimidating to get his way in an argument then turning it into a pity party so he doesnt take responsibility for his behavior switches blame emotional manipulation garden of resentments and this is all without even counting the ex issues its only been a month in its going to get so so much worse point blank answer remove him at least for awhile if not permanently because he sounds very unhealthy and he needs help you cant and shouldnt give right now only you can uphold your own standard for what you want and how you want to be treated in a relationship and nobody deserves to be treated like that thanks for being so thoughtful and considerate and caring for her the way you did it was a great idea for you to call your girlfriend so she could feel safe i once made the mistake of thinking someone genuinely wanted to help me by offering me a ride as i was looking for someone they started trying to touch my leg and my hair and talk me out of my relationship i was lucky they let me get out of the car when i told them that i wanted to walk from that point on honestly this is what i hate about families rather than holding each other responsible they just enable because they dont want to deal with it they either dont want toaccept the fact one of theirs has done something bad or in most cases they dont care lovely couple wish you guys all the happiness you know youre a good match when youre together 247 and are happy this is so adorable im saving it to my animal crossing art folder what a cute doggo he must be very loved this is a great idea put the dog out of his reach until you get the extra keys back from him and hes completely gone while i understand why the last part might feel necessary due to his behavior it might be kinder not to say it there are a lot of people who use that as an abusive tactic to shut up their partners a consistent no and i need you to please respect my decision to end this i hate having to say this but that mentality of his is really hard and difficult to deal with being blamed for his bad behavior lashing out the toxicity odds are you wont be able to change him and he wont try to change until you leave and even then only if he really tries and realizes how wrong he is will he change his behavior is very entitled while maybe it seems like he isnt an asshole outside of this context as you put it in a comment the thing is that the good periods are just another part of this cycle he has it sounds like youve tried and maybe its time to show you wont accept that behavior anymore if he doesnt care enough to listen to you thank you for being someone who wants to do the right thing even when its not easy too many people say to stay out of things because they themselves are people who dont want to deal with things and dont care about other peoples trouble but the world would be a better place if more of us were like you and tried to look out for our fellow human being just be prepared for the worst possible outcomes such as 1 she may not initially believe you 2 he may try to turn mutual friends against you if hes that kind of person i havent been married very long and i was wondering what is it that splits couples like your first marriage apart after being together for so long thank you so much for this post do you care that your hurting your partner with your actions or do you just feel bad knowing you did something bad that reflects on who you are as a person the truth is you need to learn to respect and empathize with your partner and to allow her to heal with the time she needs not according to your timeline of how long she gets to get over it you must learn to accept the consequences of your actions over and over even though it probably feels unfair to you but its only one step in a lifelong fight against the entitled mentality you have developed and your endless defense mechanisms you must learn to face the hurt you have done to your partner in its entirety if you are still causing new incidents then you still dont respect or love your partner you must train your brain to do this there are exercises out there for men like you who want to change you must understand that what you have done is wrong on so many levels i know this sounds harsh but its the truth you also need to find a batterer group and not just do individual therapy this is a very bad idea never ever do couples therapy with an abuser or encourage someone to it has been found that the abuser ends up manipulating the couples therapy and their abusive mindset becomes more engrained abuse and anger management are also extremely separate things its not anger that makes an abuser abusive its their sense of entitlement and the way they think not feel if you want to learn more about this subject i strongly recommend lundy bancrofts why does he do this book there are a lot of general myths surrounding abusers and if you want to help people who are being abused its important to know more about the subject because the wrong advice can easily make a victims life so so much worse i know you have good intention and you are telling op really good standard advice that would work for a regular relationship abuse is just a whole different ballpark you talk like getting married as is a surefire way to know people wont engage in emotional affairs op is also allowed her dealbreakers and what makes her uncomfortable especially considering how things turned out she had good reason to be what a cutie you guys look so happy this picture radiates happiness that brings warmth to the heart thanks for bringing a little joy to my day thank you i truly appreciate you conveying that when communication brings together understanding it is the best feeling all the best to you as well i said if because from here on the internet i cant tell im not saying hes guaranteed abusive but that there are enough signs that perhaps she should study up on it to be able to assess for herself from professional resources lundy bancroft among several great authors helps explain the difference between an unhealthy relationshipperson that is struggling versus an abusive one as you said many people honestly i would say all of us have done something or other that could be called abusive without knowing or meaning to being an abuser is doing it deliberately to hurt and without remorse repeatedly there are a lot of general myths about abusers and certain things to be careful of because it can be used as a weapon by an abuser like couples counseling edit by looking into these resources she may also find tools that would help and unhealthy or struggling relationship thanks for sharing this cool snapshot from this slice of your life and thank you for everything youve done out there and for continuing to help people the way you do i saw your comment saying youre working as an er very much this the entitlement aspect is very indicative of an abuser the problem with couples therapy is that as it should it tries to validate both of the parties but this only works if both parties are reasonable and the relationship is not abusive the problem is that if your husband has crossed the line of abuse the entitlement and victim attitude couples counseling will only cause those attitudes to become more entrenched i dont know if i would recommend couples counseling because his behavior is abusive and abusers tend to manipulate couple counseling sessions they also tend to get worse as they use the psychology to manipulate the victim further i would recommend getting your own therapist and educating yourself about abuse so you can be prepared for the situations that you might encounter especially if you should do couples counseling if your partner hasnt shown proper remorse and youre already on eggshells i would bet money hes going to do it again soooooo cuuuuuuuuuuute my question is how is it you dont know that we in the us are that bad i dont say this in a judgmental way i genuinely want to understand how is it you view what is happening and how people are being right now as im sure youre not the only one who shares that mindset to some degree what is your logic i live here and its horrifying to me how we are i think you know this already but thats not something you should bet on nor should it wait that long its really scarring to be in the presence of such rage its going to hurt but you might just need to find new friends as much as it sucks cut off that friendship because its not a friendship i had a friend who did that but i still held onto the friendship making excuses for her she only grew even more toxic and hurtful she doesnt respect you its not worth it it will only become a greater sunk cost on the end remember that person wouldnt do for you what you do for her oooh what kind of in house date nights if you dont mind sharing i want to surprise my husband someone broke through to me by saying dont plan around how people should act but by how people actually act there can be a huge difference in the two she can still be a good person and at the same time adapt to situations in a way that preserves boundaries and self respect its not that she doesnt have awareness its just that the truth is inconvenient for her so
