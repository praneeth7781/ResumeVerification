and often applicable keep in mind that not everyone has the same reactionsunderstandingsbeliefs that you do so sometimes putting yourself in another persons shoes isnt enough you must actually understand them how they operate and how to communicate with them never wish your partner harm this is a toxic road you can never really ever take back something you say words are powerful and critical be careful with your partner even in times of great heat and anger remember that you love them and you want to be on the same team remember to respect them set healthy boundaries if someone is being violent or aggressive saying or acting in ways that are unacceptable let them know and walk away sometimes talking staying in any way engaging when the person is in their lizardbrain mode only feeds fuel to the fire walk away but let them know you will come back when they are okay again edit back to the words thing unless you have some kind of prior understanding or agreement do not utter the word divorce out of spite by doing so you will destroy your partners sense of security and safety in the marriage as well as trigger abandonment and trust issues because how can they count on you to stay through tough times if you threaten to leave all the time always put in effort make effort for romance making up dates any little thing you can do to make the other persons life easier theyll do the same for you if they are a good partner i heard from others without any source to verify that tolkien did intend to imbue some form of christianity and that he disliked the author of narnia for making christianity so blatant how did they find that he didnt mean to which i could and want to believe of course it doesnt change the fact that it is a christian allegory him writing it without that intent is very believable as our imaginations and stories are comprised of our own life experiences and understanding in some form as well as the stories we come across ourselves btw i loved your post op it was well written and informative it is so interesting how writings can take a life of their own once given to the audience it follows the original short story sonnies edge by peter f hamilton very well the beastie design aligns with what was described in the written story better than the example you provided i believe in the story they also needed human controllers its possible that the anime copied from the story regardless there are enough design differences to where it really cant be said it was stolen or copied nta please tell him the only thing that is preventing you from doing the right thing is your sense of self preservation and preserving the relationship you think you have with your daughter you say you have a great relationship what does that mean when its with a sociopath who has admitted to you that she cares nothing for you or her family members much less others youre just another person that shes comfortably pulled into her act please tell the poor fiance because this is something that has the capacity to change and ruin his life what if he has children with her to later find out shes a sociopath and get trapped in the marriage out of fear of what she might do to him or their children valuable years of his life that he could spend finding a partner who actually loves him will be instead spent on your daughter who will view losing him as a major inconvenience to whatever plans she has this man deserves to have full disclosure so he can make an informed choice marriage is about marrying someone you think you know well enough to spend the rest of your life with them this critical component of your daughter is not something that can be swept under the rug for his safety please tell him you already prompted her to tell him and she threatened you for saying you would do the right thing not the easiest thing thanks for your post its great learning about these additional details they add more meaning to the game bad news study has found that antivaxxers dont care about evidence or research if anything it just makes them double down the study that all antivaxxers use as the premise of their belief has already been proven to be false yet none of them care or will admit it it sucks that your sister has to deal with them i hope she blocks them it is horrible they are so disrespectful towards her as if having a kid with autism isnt difficult enough nothing against autistic kids or people just saying that being autistic or having a child who is autistic from what ive seen and what i can imagine is more difficult he doesnt speak if you summon him in battle sometimes but he always says something typically when you summon him even if its a repeat since picking him up i use him exclusively also if you google youll find some people do have an error where mimir doesnt talk or ratatoskr doesnt talk one way to tell is that if youre not in battle and you summon him ratatoskr should say something every time if he only makes squirrel noises multiple times in a row somethings wrong thats an unfortunate truth to hear i had a really great figure before im hoping i can get it back right now its so far from what it used to be i dont recognize myself in photos its funny because a lot of people find atreus annoying i find him pretty helpful and fun love the character dynamics and dialogue in this game for a kid hes pretty alright and sweet at least at the point im at im sure hes going to have some development or problems soon but who didnt as a kid we all had our annoying stupid phases and most of us werent able to shoot arrows to make up for it so your shield is shit or i have rabies are among many wonderful insults he throws hi commenting for a chance would make a nice surprise for hubby thank you for being such a generous soul my husband was panicking over getting us a tiny christmas tree because whole foods was no longer selling them and we couldnt find one anywhere finally he surprises me with a tiny fake plastic tree he gets from target and i know he tried so hard because he wanted us to have a little tree to celebrate with we had a lot of fun with it and decorated it with so much tinsel it basically looks like a furry boa tree with ornaments on i dont want to take it down yet because i love it and what it stands for which to me is my husbands love and effort to make our place a home and a happy holiday for me when i was going through my grad term at my art school my husband would sit next to me while i worked and read a book to me it is one of our favorite memories together to this day these kind of moments are wonderful to have if youre feeling like this you dont really have much admiration or respect for your partner nothing in here indicates you admire her or really respect her you like her sure it honestly sounds like youre afraid to be a bad guy by leaving staying while having this huge amount of resentment and these sorts of feelings towards your partner is unfair for your partner it doesnt so sound like you want to work on things or help her learn to resolve things versus survive them it doesnt sound like you really love her so just leave instead of making everyone miserable and asking for approval from internet strangers if you want to move on and distance yourself you will need to stop seeing him its going to hurt because youre attached to him however sometimes you have to do things that dont feel good or hurt because ultimately its whats best in the long run doing the right thing is not always the easiest or most feel good thing its not good for you its not the right thing to do and this situation looks set up for someone to get seriously hurt he is in a poly relationship you want something monogamous and commitment at best you will be no2 because his fiance is his primary relationship because you dont desire a poly relationship this is really an affair more than anything as you want him for yourself and dont want him to be engaged anymore would you feel ok if you were his fiance and someone had these feelings for your husbanddid these things to you do you want to be that person i know how hard it is cutting off someone youre emotionally attached to even knowing its bad for you some of those experiences messed me up for a long time i really advise you find a way to distance yourself unless you really research polygamous relationships and have the confidence to place the proper boundaries and feelings accordingly but even then its really not a good idea as he doesnt seem to be able to put those boundaries and feelings himself no thats not a true friend and good person with integrity is willing to hold their friends accountable and do what is good for their friends growth not enable or just promote bad behavior for the sake of maintaining a friendship or their personal benefit just because you get accustomed to something doesnt mean it should be okay or something you should accept seeing this makes me feel so hopeful about my own marriage as we got married around the 2 year mark too how you describe the feeling of your relationship is beautiful i hope to have that feeling in my own marriage as well thats a beautiful photo of you two you make a beautiful couple you can have a bromance without being possessive or toxic some guys have unhealthy and possessive attachments to their male friends and in the few cases i noticed they were all guys who had problems with women or no girlfriend that behavior was shit i did back in like middle school and these men in their mid to late twenties were pulling this crap im glad im not the only one who noticed that some male friendships cross from having friendly intimacy into unhealthy possessive behaviors good luck hope everything works out and you guys come out stronger with a happy marriage this is a good example why couples counseling may not be the appropriate treatment for you and technically isnt your couples counselor did what couples counselors do which is focus on a dual dynamic between the two of you the problem with that is that any kind of blame on your partner feeds your abusive mindset it doesnt matter how little its feeding your mindset when it needs to not be fed and to be eliminated completely the treatment towards abusers is designed towards focusing purely on you and your way of thinking and is different from couples counseling your wife doesnt deserve any of the treatment youre giving her and she doesnt owe you praise for behaving decently the way you should behave source lundy bancroft x200b its hard and not cheap but you may want to look into individual therapy or perhaps making the effort to go to the battering program despite the other people who attend it whats more important the drive or your pride seriously the fact you are self aware is a huge step realize the rest
