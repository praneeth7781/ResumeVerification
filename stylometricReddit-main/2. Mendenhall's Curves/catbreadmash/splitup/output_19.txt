i was trying to explain to you is that there is a way to make someone feel understood and heard and sometimes that means just saying that youre sorry you can explain separately why you behaved that way and say your behavior was inexcusable regardless of the reason but if youre apologizing it may be best to only apologize because bringing up your reasoning might just sound like making excuses for yourself or like youre blaming her which you sound like you are like what your response to me sounds like right now i had untreated depression it doesnt make the things i did okay while i was in pain or make my husbands hurt any less saying but i did those things because of something you did that hurt me just sounds like blame right now you need to focus on healing your wifes hurt before you can expect her to heal yours yeah i get you had different views but ultimately her body is the one carrying the baby we probably have different views on abortion however it doesnt change the fact youre making the abortion more about you than the two of you or her which is at the very least a huge reason you are in this situation to begin with the problem is that when you are telling someone youre sorry and then add but i did it because of this it doesnt feel to them like you are truly repentant it feels more like youre justifying your behavior yes you want her to understand one of the triggers for you however it indicates there is a lot more going on with you for you to have that reaction and treat her that way for years to have those reactions if youre sorry youre going to have to be sorry and not try to defend yourself while owning up to your behaviors youll have to be extremely consistent to save your marriage yes thats a very good point i totally agree hey op good for you thats awesome its great youre getting out of those unhealthy thinking habits yeah its pretty understandable since youre in a much better place now and even if you dont remember the rationale you remember the suffering you experienced with social anxiety perhaps you could try just provide emotional support or help teach ways that you achieved getting out of the social anxiety hole to others ehhh im a female and that is so not true especially as you get older what it comes down to a lot seems to be competence if youre really good at something or really really good looking people will give you more leeway and naturally have more interest i do agree that its more difficult for men due to societal stereotypes and how theyre raised however its not as easy as you claim or a cakewalk for women i actually get the same reaction from people as a female and ive found that means youre talking to the wrong people most importantly people want to be around others who set goals and achieve them yeah i thought i got out my bad relationship habits in highschool but over a decade later im facepalming myself still over some of my exes like omg how could i let that happen therapy is really working wonders for me though because even if theyre just paid to do it i have at least one person who is being supportive and listening to me even regularly healthy people who enter abusive relationships have difficulty getting out once theyre enmeshed inside you could be doing all the healthy things possible and the abusive person will just use it as ways to entrap you whether they realize it or not so dont feel bad about that its a very common thing and youre already ahead of the curve because youre being selfaware have you tried the dog park you can let it loose in the small dog section and just go as frequently as you can regularly even for just like 30 minutes ive noticed a lot of dogs at least become more comfortable being around dogs even if theyre not proactively friendly towards them i understand if thats not an option though its tough finding a good park and getting the timediscipline to go to one my dog helped me with my social anxiety having a dog pushes me to go on walks or go to the dog park where its sunny and im doing a small form of exercise walking which makes me feel better serotonin yum it also gives me an easy thing to talk about with other people if you go to a nice dog park caveat nice its weird i notice the quality of people seems to correlate with the quality of the park with grass and hang out there with your puppy people may come up and talk to you but theyre primarily going to talk about dogs and everyone is very friendly the ice is broken because everyone there loves dogs it gives you something to bond over or at least have basic conversation ask them about their dog how they trained their dog how they got their dog etc if you dont want basic conversation just obviously have headsets in or something and people will leave you alone while youre walking or at the dog park having my dog also helps me when i go to group things where im not that liked because i can just hang out with my furry buddy i feel calmer when hes around i also feel more loved since youll be getting a puppy youll have lots of time to bond and play take your dog to a training class while its young and a dog park because then it will become well socialized and behaved also get it around kids walk it 2x a day feed it at regular times 2x a day for whatever exercise requirements it has and youre golden youre not only training the dog but the dog is really training you to develop good habits and discipline as time goes on you and the dog will bond and love each other and develop little things between you for instance because even though my dogs not a cuddly guy hell come up and lie down against me if im down hell try to cheer or get me up in various ways like i do this thing that annoys him where hell be all sleepy and i pick him up to lie him down cheek to cheek with me his tolerance has gotten higher and hell stay for a few seconds before getting off lately when ive been really down and im in bed hell come and flop on me of his own volition like a bribe to get me to feel better be sure to update us with what happens congratulations on your anniversary this month is our anniversary too reading my previous comment im not sure if what i said was clear like i said if youre talking to husbands then theyre speaking to you from their viewpoint as man to man which is to try be considerate of their wifes happiness if theyre talking directly to you they might say oh you have to do this and that just because they say you doesnt mean it excludes your wife if you talk to a woman in a happy marriage shell say the same thing only instead of wife she might say each other so or husband assuming its a heterosexual marriage marriage is a two way street where you both cater to each others needs you do this out of love and faith im not talking about faith in a religious context you do this because it makes the other person happy which makes you happy because your lives together are happy and if theyre a good partner they will do their best to cater to your needs too my concern is that you are not even married and you are already worried about what will happen if you devote yourself to trying to meet her needs i dont know where youre getting this advice to ignore yourself from just because someone says happy wife happy life doesnt mean you have to ignore yourself its a little concerning that you take happy wife happy life with that negative angle one of the biggest challenges in marriage is learning that your actions can hurt someone or make them feel a certain way doesnt matter if you didnt mean for that or if you were just trying to make a point you have to learn how to treat each other with respect and communicate in a way that is not hurtful if you or her were to say to the other hey when you did this thing it made me feel like this and really hurt my feelings then it is on that person to take responsibility for their actions and as the guy above put it how their actions affect their partnermarriage instead of getting defensive its not about being right its about working together as a team and being there for each other i didnt say you were bitter i do think however that youre thinking primarily of yourself and how to protect yourself fear based rather than thinking as a unit youre already worried and caught up in how youre going to lose in a sense and thinking how to protect yourself what im saying is that marriage is going to be harder than it has to be if you start off and go through it thinking like that instead of investing more into your marriage as a team youll be thinking more tit for tat and thats not going to go well dont compare your relationship to someone elses having a successful marriage starts and ends with holding yourself 100 percent accountable for your actions and their impact on the marriage and the keys to knowing how to be a better husband are to show her empathy this not just what i copy pasted the whole thing also applies to wives its not limited to a single gender or role it is excellent advice well worded i try to apply this to myself as much as possible for my husband what you are saying is not an absolute and goes both ways however people can only speak from their point of view so if youre talking to mostly men then youll probably hear this quite a bit i dont know a single women who says their marriage works because happy wife happy life my advice to you is to not start off your marriage bitter or feeling persecuted but with positivity and giving your partner benefit of the doubt if you start your marriage with a negative lens youre not going to build the reserves a marriage needs to stay strong when things get tough also please take into consideration the post history of posters you listen to there are a lot of people who are bitter and carry a disdain for marriage and what it stands for because theirs has effectively failed or they dont like their wife there are plenty on this sub and after awhile their names are easy to recognize because theyre always the ones promoting divorce or how marriage sucks and talk about wanting affairs thank you u3mnilez i am going to copy paste this advice for myself as it is beautiful thanks for taking the time to give out support and positivity 3 i hope your life is filled with love and good things really because what i thought you wrote in your comment about how they should believe her without pi proof was pointing out the obvious my statement was more along the lines of what upinkoveralls said which is that its one thing to know what is an unhealthy behavior and
