your anguish the loss of feeling in parts of your body is a common symptom of people who have undergone trauma and ptsd what you may be experiencing is not only grief but ptsd from the horrific and sudden loss of your most beloved attachment figure when the person we are most attached to is ripped away from us it is not only psychological but physiological we feel like we are dying a lot of people here recommend emdr which is something i am personally going to therapy for and am only just beginning there is a book that i think may be able to help you feel less alone and understand a little of whats happening to you as well as show you that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and most importantly show you how it is so important to have compassion and love for yourself through this difficult time the book is called the body keeps the score brain mind and body in the healing of trauma by bessel van der kolk in there are many peoples stories and so many insights near the end of the book he talks about how these people found solutions one of which is emdr which he praises greatly there is one womans story that i was reminded of when i read your post and she was able to heal through emdr although like others say some things work in greater efficiency than others thats what i mean by the light at the end of the tunnel that others have found a way out of their whirlpool of pain and that its possible for you to too you say you do not have much money right now and are saving up for a counselor so i hope that perhaps at least this book can provide knowledge and comfort for you in this time as you also say you are a book loving cat lady like the many other people here when you seek a counselor i hope you look for one that is specialized in trauma ptsd emdr and the other categories that people have mentioned because what you are experiencing goes far beyond grief i may an internet stranger but please consider me one of those people you can message even if its just to vocalize those thoughts have someone to listen or have someone who will respond and help you through those thoughts i am not a professional but at the very least i can give companionship and encouragement wow good job on your regime i would say so yes mind if i ask you about your regime your makeup looks great your skin looks like it has a beautiful glow to it and i love the pretty eyeshadow color heylo a lot of people made good suggestions i hope mine will be of use to you one thing i suggest researching is baking because baking is relatively easy you prep the ingredients then pop it in the oven and can easily clean up using aluminum foil you can also make things in big batches that allow you to save for future meals or have leftovers quiches chicken casseroles and its really easy to make tasty vegetable sides as well olive oil salt and pepper the foods you can make through baking are also delicious so its a nice return for not too much effort like others said it can also be a fun thing to do with your so and build fun memories psychologically cookingbaking can also be really rewarding when you find out you can make some delicious things for a fraction of the price that you pay out at restaurants such as bone marrow an appetizer that easily runs 20 bucks when i can get many more bones for that price and cook it in literally 15 minutes not only is it cheaper but in my experience you get a ton more marrow too and no i dont live on a farm i live in socal we ourselves are located in la but our actual wedding will be taking place in oak
