monthly 7k payment for the child and i dont know what else im assuming theyre not together anymore because my dad is currently dating his receptionist who is thai and who he will tell others is a nurse when she isnt its probably not worth your time to try figure out why hes like this while i dont know whether your relationship has gone so far as to be called abusive they do say that women in abusive relationships will often spend a lot of time trying to figure out why their partner says or does the things they do that are hurtful and in the end theres really no point to it because it comes down to them wanting to control you it sounds at the very least that this man is controlling they act nice because thats how they keep you hooked they act nice so you stay they then act badly then act nice so you will keep thinking that its not going to happen again and you know what happens its like a carrot on a stick a partner should not be dangling what a relationship should be in front of you they should actually give you a relationship where you feel loved and safe a person who idealizes you then cuts you down is not a healthy person to be with they want you to be someone they have constructed in their head instead of loving you as you are a little idealization is good but not like this i was in a relationship that started off great honeymoon although he wasnt really my type i ended up breaking that off because although he wasnt abusive he was far too controlling for me this guy sounds very controlling and selfish the two things you should definitely look to avoid in a future partner no matter what gender you are honestly for myself i dont even like those qualities in friends especially if they are like that in the first few months to a year because thats the time where people are usually on their best behavior if this is the best hes got then its not going to get better from here do your best to set boundaries because thats an important part of getting people to treat you properly as well no anal were not ready to go there yet feel theres much more left to explore and enhance still without doing that quite yet he doesnt watch porn i would be asking this eventually even if he didnt have this current problem toys tools fun things im pretty sure its psychological and the main thing is just making safe a fun safe and freeing experience i also just want to add more to our sex life i understand that by putting these both together in the same post why you get that idea it is mostly him at the same time i can still do the most i can and its partially me its a combination of things lots of physical issues like i said though i sort of ruled it out because he was like that before and there were no problems that and a bunch of other things concerning our relationship are factors im taking in too that id rather not get into here im considering editing the post to simply ask for reocmmendations because like i stated earlier they are things i would be asking about anyway because 1 cant orgasm without clitoral stimulation so would like to get clitoral vibrator that is easy to use during sex 2 physical problems have led to me feeling loosey goosey and id like to change that with kegel balls 3 even if our sex life was great doesnt mean i cant try find ways to make it better thank you for your insight and for reading my post because yes you are right the root issue isnt going to be fixed by any of these things i wrote about that other stuff in case other people had experience with such situations and could possibly contribute advice or anecdotal experience on how to treat it not necessarily solve it like a magic button though that would be great more like how to treat the situation as to try improve it or things that were helpful a really good resource book to look into would be why does he do that by lundy bancroft it will give you knowledge to assess your situation as well as valuable advice a friend of mine once told me instead of asking whether he loves you ask yourself whether he treats you well do you feel like you are loved accepted for who you are encouraged to grow and nurtured to be honest with you this behavior sounds abusive which is different from having anger management issues that sounds so cute what kind of hamster hamster tax my previous dog an elderly maltese was quite smart one testament to his intelligence was when the overnight animal hospital he was staying in gave me a check in call the caller remarked how smart he was because they noticed he would only bark when his pad needed changing rather than sleeping in it once he barked and they saw that his space was clean so they were like they checked him over and found out that his medication needed adjusting you couldnt tell just by looking at him they had to do tests and things he didnt like it when my roommate yelled at me once during a fight he would sit in front of me a tiny 5 pound maltese and stare at my roommate never letting him out of his sight or at his back he would rotate himself he stared so hard my roommate felt really bad also my dog was kinda grudgy so he was snubby towards my roommate for awhile after that we moved and i went for a walk in our new city i said time to go home and started walking in one direction my dog refused to move and insisted i go the opposite way he actually ended up leading me home haha he also was very good at hiding his pill medications because hed put them deep under his tongue hold his mouth shut as tightly as he could and then wander off behind the nearest piece of furniture to spit it out as time went on his technique and follow through became more sophisticated i warned a vet tech who was going to take him to the back to give him some pills that hes very good and stubborn at hiding medication she was like yeah yeah didnt really believe me took him to the back she came saying you were right hes really good at that same dog would also slowly in a tactical way try to steal sandwiches off the table he was toothless so this was a lot more difficult for him than it was for a normal dog he would mouth the wrapper and pull it gradually inch closer to him whenever i looked away it was so incremental that i didnt notice until i caught him almost getting it off the table at the end he really liked meatball subway sandwiches my current little papillon is quite brilliant as well hes young so he doesnt have the causeandeffect knowledge my previous dog had quite yet hes quick and clever though and quite empathetic every morning while my dog was still very sleepy i would take him and flop him onto my chest in a way so that our faces would be touching cheek to cheek i would hold him for awhile like this i did this everyday one day i got very depressed and i didnt get up out of bed i didnt flop him that morning the little papillon tried to grab my fingers to pull me out of bed and licked my face when that didnt work he came over and flopped himself so that his face was against mine the way i did it every morning he knew i was unwell and he was trying his best to get me up this was a pretty big deal because while our dog is a velcro dog and enjoys having physical contact he isnt really affectionate or likes being actively touched to be honest sometimes i get the sense that men or people in general sometimes dont want to examine or admit certain feelings they are having they may be having these feelings but not willing to acknowledge them because those feelings make them uncomfortable either they dont want to admit it or think of themselves in that way or theyre just subconsciously avoiding it no matter how blunt or honest someone may be no one is perfectly self aware all the time we all to some degree modify our perspectives on reality to make things easier to bear and sometimes as the person on the other side of the situation we want to believe what theyre telling us is true because its what we want to be true too it sounds like theres baggage there because he is associating and reacting to so many things concerning her and their relationship ended long ago the thing that makes me think this is because he thinks of her whenever he sees his dog and because he asked you to change a song he associates with her would you say the 23 years of marriage beforehand served as a foundation to help him be strong enough to pull through that dark time for your marriage a good course of action to consider is to start couples therapy for you and your ex before the resentment gets too deep on either end hopefully couples therapy will help you guys open up communicate as well as receive perspective on the situation in a way that allows you two to grow and foster love for each other it will also give both of you support in moving forward and sometimes people will listen to a third party rather than the other person involved in the situation with them i strongly recommend starting sooner than later because when resentment roots itself in its very hard to get rid of and starts affecting everything i have experience with a similar situation we thought we could deal with the problem and honestly waiting so long to start probably made things worse we love each other but things are a lot more messy than they need to be other than people getting the wrong idea about me due to me being anxious thinking im weaker or lesser i do have one problem id like to fix when people sincerely apologize to me i usually dont know what to say so i end up being quiet and then they probably think i dont care or appreciate their apology and am therefore a jerk its because i do though that i end up not knowing what to say because in that moment saying i forgive you thank you seems incredibly awkward probably due to a low self esteem sort of thing though looking back that would have been the right thing to say now too much time has passed for me to really bring it up again to readdress it haha i wish i could do that where i live though people would view me as the bad one for doing that even though people who do that kind of thing deserve to get called out on thank you for going out of your way to suggest these things to me im excited to check those out ive been reading the nyt to start as i find their articles informative and so well written congratulations on your baby thanks for taking the time to respond im definitely interested in seeing alternative perspectives can totally relate to people having the wrong and lesser impression due to
