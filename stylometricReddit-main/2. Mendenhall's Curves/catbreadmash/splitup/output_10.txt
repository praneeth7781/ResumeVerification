getting pet insurance my pet insurance even has an app that lets me chat to a vet 247 once my dog was having bloody poops and his anus looked raw you can imagine my cellphones picture gallery despite it being scary to see the vets recommended waiting it out said what to look out for and said he probably ingested something upsetting his stomach i did and saved myself a vet bill hes exhibiting abusive behavior she should under no circumstances go to couples therapy with him and anger management wont help him because he needs very specialized help to become non abusive gordon ramsay is really nice to people who are trying to learn or better themselves and understand that they made a mistake he gets upset when people deny accountability and repeat the mistake especially at the expense of others chef culture is generally abrasive from what i can tell so take that with a grain of salt he also comes off as a very responsible parent since he doesnt want his kids to become spoiled from his success they dont eat at his restaurants unless theyre doing charity work and he intends on giving the majority of his wealth to charity upon death this is so perfectly worded im saving this its insane to me how some people grow up abused know they were abused and then see it happening to other people and go well thats my dad we forgave him so should you etc etc and im someone who came from an abusive home hi i have a friend with genital herpes and id like to know what is a good way to be supportive to her like i want to send her this ama but im also worried that maybe thats not a good idea for whatever reason like if it would embarrass her or something i guess i just want to know if there is any general advice youd give on how to be a good and supportive friend that is some nice glossy chocolate with this kind of situation you should respect jakes feelings anna is feeling guilty and bad and wants to feel better by apologizing but sometimes you reap what you sow jake is not obligated whatsoever to help her with this feelings and for all you know bringing them together is just another way youre catering to the golden child respect jakes boundaries that he has chosen to set with his family for his happiness and peace of mind some people are very particular about not having their things touched or used without permission it can feel very invasive and disrespectful especially if its an expensive item louboutin shoes are no joke people are allowed to choose how they want to share their things i myself am not like ops wife but i too would feel uneasy if someone took such a personal and expensive item without asking op its good you backed your wife up especially in front of your family its important to back up your spouse however perhaps behind the scenes you can speak to your wife to try get her to see things in a gentler and more forgiving perspective and speak to your sister gently as well to lessen the blow and so that there are not hard feelings thats amazing and wonderful if only all marriages could be like that to your 1st question it is easy for people to get caught up in a relationship and stop doing the things that defined their individuality or being their own person you are what you do and think its okay to change as you want to continue to grow you dont want to stagnate 2nd question be a desirable and valuable partner can mean many things for instance being financially stable is one or staying in shape being emotionally stable and supportive what people need in a relationship can vary but there are things that certainly help third your significant other is the person you yoke yourself to in this world words from a wise redditor i once read they are now your top priority because theyre the person you should now be most accountable to and also love and take care of as they should do the same for you your allegiance belongs to them first marriage is wonderful but also delicate in certain ways that need to be protected if your family or friends is disrespecting your partner you need to stand up for your partner for instance grandparents can be important but your so comes first and utmost always i love nugget dont listen or take into account the words of anyone who frequents mgtow or incel subs their beliefs are very misogynistic what happened after you found out he was being serious thats a good point you are right the point i was addressing is how abusers use the breaking point excuse to pardon their bad behavior its more of an orange flag than a yellow flag if he takes full accountability is remorseful and doesnt repeat it again then great hes not an abuser but its still an instance of abuse he is already minimizing what he did it is abuse because he had enough control to hide what he knew was unacceptable behavior from his mom unplug the lamp to directly smash it next to her it was right next to her when he smashed it that is too much control and directed aggression abuse can start at any time in a relationship and needs to be shut down immediately for what it is if it doesnt repeat and he is genuinely sorry then he is not an abuser but it will still be an instance of abuse even so thats still unacceptable behavior even if she didnt escalate to physical violence did she degrade you in arguments blame you for everything or could she take accountability for herself its still abuse even if things dont escalate to direct physical violence the thing is though that abusers usually seem fine or at least within acceptable limits of behavior for a very long time then something happens and the person thinks its a one time thing then it gets worse the next time it happens and it starts happening again and again the fact that he waited till his mother wasnt around to do that means he had enough control and chose to scare her in private because he knows that behavior is unacceptable that is a sign of an abuser yeah but the issue is that if an excuse abusers use all the time they blame their partner for pushing them past their breaking point that anybody would flip their shit but the thing is abuse is not anger management issues its an active choice to do unacceptable things the abuser makes to scare and silence his partner into compliance there is no excuse ever to behave like that congratulations what a victory good for you 3 and thank you for giving encouragement to others him wanting you to be financially dependent on him is strange and sounds rather egotistical its also probably not healthy for you or the relationship in the long run he should respect your wish to work and support you really cool im going to wishlist it now to remember my steam account information i would marry someone i adore i can also admire someone i adore there is someone i admire but ive never had romantic feelings towards him and cant even really imagine it i dont even see it as a possibility so for me the two can be very very distinct the family and friends of an abuser will turn on a victim quickly because they dont want to believe one of their own is doing bad things or that they might even be part of that dysfunction its easier to blame you than to confront him and possibly have to look at themselves and risk their own relationship with your husband theyre also probably not very good people please read why does he do that by lundy bancroft and you will see that you are not alone in the case of having everyone turn on you or what i imagine a lot of things in your situation i was a ta for my mentor a very famous and successful illustrator just awesome guy all around i was his first and only ta for a long time but as his classes gained in popularity so did the ta requests n was a girl i had befriended and she mentioned wanting to ta for my mentor normally my spot is reserved and i wanted to help so i took her to be introduced to my mentor n is an attractive girl and she knows it she uses it to get advantage whenever possible to get guys to give her a discount shit like that she wasnt very good at what our education specialized in either anyway we go and my mentor breaks the news to me that he has to open up my spot because he has gotten so many requests i was distraught and he spent a good deal of effort which i was not entitled to but an grateful for reassuring me he still wanted me to be his ta and to make sure i got the paperwork to him first thing when the next semester started because then he could give me my ta spot that hes taking the first people who apply so to make sure i get to him first n hears this and immediately slams down the paperwork she has with her saying heres mine and proceeds to bat her eyelashes at my mentor while standing proudly my mentor looks at her directly in the face and says i said i am accepting them first then the next semester and pushes the paperwork back at her my mentor later mentioned being irritated at how n tried to pull batting eyelashes and that crap on him complaining haha needless to say when i tried to talk to her about it i got the classic non apology of im sorry you feel that way and i didnt know you wanted your job lie but not even looking me in the face as she says it our friendship died that day as i realized the degree she was willing to throw others under the bus for her benefit hi may i please dm you i would really love to hear more about your journey im looking to find insight and perspective on my own also excellently worded post i saved it for future reference oh this one hurts the little mermaid obsessing and chasing over a man and giving up your entire way of life and your friends and family for a dude because of his statue is not a good idea making a deal with what is essentially the devil also not a good idea oh man king titan just becomes more relatable poor dad this isnt a book op should touch even if he does enter a new relationship unless he has been absolutely free of abusive behaviors for years that is how much of a different beast abuse is abusers are known to take psychology and use it as a weapon to defend and hide their abuse and to control their partner im not pulling this out of my ass if you would like to research this yourself i can dm you a great resource to read i honestly dislike commenting on posts but am compelled to particularly when i see posts on abuse because people generally dont know how abuse is so dangerous and how hard it is to eradicate i too didnt until i did a lot of reading on it and all im doing is passing on the information ive learned most general methods are designed for people with rational behavior for instance
