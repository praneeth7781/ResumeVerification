it would be better to take confidence and faith in the fact that he chose to defend you from his family and friends and didnt allow them to disrespect you value yourself more or a lot of people in life will find a way to make you think youre below them when youre not this is great advice my main worry is that someone who has gone deep into irrational behavior may not be able to get out of it by regular means but i hope for op and his familys sake that his wife can he gently persuaded to reach understanding yup i have a ba and honestly i cant hack the food industry im just not suited to it at all but i can say im much better at my own job even though it pays way more than fast food min wage so much respect to food industry workers honestly he may have good intentions in his mind and really think its not going to be a problem but what people say and what they actually do is different a lot of people dont understand themselves well enough to realize the full weight of what theyre saying even if hes not controlling or abusive its entirely possible he may lose respect over time and even resent you he may not view you as much as an equal because its his money at the end of the day and youre not his wife he has the power to take everything away you might also start feeling like you cant say no because if you do itll affect his goodwill towards you dont give up the power of your independence and ability to maintain your own life you love the way she treats you but you dont love her let her go instead of keeping her around for your own comfort she deserves someone who wants her for who she is honestly families dont hold each other accountable enough for the sake of family which is bullshit do what is best for you its hard facing pressure from other members but thats what it is pressure its more about them than you theyre not entitled to tell you what to do either decision you make is understandable omg hes a cutie husband and wife definitely outside of that youd have to know yourself well enough to know if you are able to do that same goes for the other person it may be possible but its not a given trying to support someone who is in an abusive relationship of any kind is tricky because abuse is such a complicated mind fuck for that person please read lundy bancrofts book why does he do that there is a section on how to support someone in an abusive relationship one of the most pivotal things is not to push for her to make a decision but continue to validate her when shes confused about how shes being treated pushing or or telling her to leave is similar to what the abuser does which is make decisions for her i know that is totally not what youre doing and that she should leave this is just the psychology of it it may also make her feel more isolated and misunderstood keep reminding her that she deserves to be treated and loved well that she deserves more than what shes getting and that its not wrong of her to want those things and that how shes being treated is unacceptable offer her a safe place to go if she needs to leave just wanted to say to please be compassionate towards yourself when looking at your past and the decisions you made its entirely possible that regardless of how long you spent dating that the outcome could have been the same because abusers are notorious for hiding their nature until the relationship reaches a certain level of commitment or maybe it would have taken you longer to realize hes abusive because he was not as abusive for so long its so incredibly awesome and strong of you to have gone on that journey and survived dont help him a part of you cares about him because you loved him and are a good person but dont allow yourself to be taken advantage of and made a fool by this horrible horrible man keep going as someone who does art for their living one of the most important things ive learned is to keep going and i love your mable handy maide the artist sells through her own website now apparently on her faq it says her things sell out in minutes wowww it looks wonderful which recipe did you use also what was your trick to not getting a soggy bottom beautiful job perhaps thinking of it this way may help your resolve do you want your daughter to end up with a man like him do you want her to grow up stressed and thinking that being treated terribly is acceptable are you okay with the possibility of her acting and turning out like her father because she thinks what he does is normal i have seen a whole brood of children in their adulthood from a divorced couple manifest horrible behaviors because they never had a good role model if that can happen imagine what could happen if she lives with him everyday if you are having a hard time doing it for yourself do it for your daughter and know that you can find a better man out there one day when the time comes the fact that he treats only his brother like this and no one else signifies that what ops husband is doing falls under the definition of abuse and is very typical of abusers thats why abusers get enabled and given passes so much other people dont have it happen to them so they think the victim is at fault or there must be good reason when in truth abuse is unacceptable by matter the reason it is unacceptable and shows how ops husvand believes that abuse is justifiable if he feels a certain way like towards his brother that attitude only gets worse if not dealt with he has a power dynamic over his brother right now that he is misusing he will have a power dynamic over his children the potential for him to abuse exists which is a problem abuse is abuse ucursethewind has the right idea and frankly has the attitude of someone who truly understands what abuse is and how it works sooooooo cute sharing a house with the neverending man 15 years at studio ghibli enjoy your description of alfie is very apt the other thing about alfie is that it is too disadvantageous to not make a deal with him that is alfies strength i was reading a book on a man who worked with miyazaki excellent highly recommend in it he describes japanese business culture in that the japanese think it is more important to know what it is the other party really wants rather than believing the words they stick in a contract seems to also apply to alfie so true rather than becoming adults who think its okay to continually pressure people to get what they want it automatically proves that he can get someone better for him honestly it seems anything with a bad ending is pretty much ruined great story bad ending leaves people much more dissatisfied than with middling story awesome ending iswhat ive generally noticed while the tv series decided to do the books ending or something like that they say game of thrones didnt lead up or prepare viewers for it properly result bad ending and what was once a pop culture phenomenon has been completely wiped out im not a psychologist so this is all conjecture i would guess its that and wanting to be loved the parent child bond is generally such a strong one that i think its hard for a child to realize that their parent may not actually love them the way they want them to and its hard to let go actually children of abusive parents might have a harder time letting go even more so than the regular child parent bond children cling onto inconsistent parents more due to trauma bonding its horrible but true theyre not asking op to take it theyre asking op understand that his wife doesnt like her previous partners more what shes describing in her posts about them is literally a trauma response and the way shes handling things excessively is a result of that trauma not a reflection of how she feels about him hi i know losing weight is super difficult lei me know if you would like me to share any resources or tips i picked up through dm just take small sustainable baby steps and work up your way to making overall big change it is so much harder if you are putting a huge lifestyle change immediately on yourself and mentally stressing yourself out im not in your exact situation but i struggled after weight gain from medication a doctor prescribed me and can tell you what helped me lol so the bf should let bil puff up like a rooster and get in his face and possibly punch him instead just so his kids can instead see how being an asshole is ok no better the kids see that being aggressive is not the way to handle a confrontation hahaha ahhh maybe its really just dependent on the cat i had a feral i rasied to be my own cat and she kept her collar on despite being outdoors most of the time yeah ive found the only way to get them to keep a breakaway collar on is to start them pretty young i dont know about other people but i would say no not if it is to that amount doesnt sound like a good foundation for being with someone for the rest of your life it sounds like you dont respect him very much and thats going to eat at the relationship both of you deserve to be with people youre crazy about and who are crazy about you wish i had better news for you but material generosity doesnt necessarily mean that someone loves you or that they arent narcissisticselfabsorbedentitled you can totally be both which is what it sounds your bf basically is hes the selfish one for not prioritizing what your niece wants for her dinner hes the thoughtless one for not seeing the gesture and effort behind his nieces gift hes grown more relaxed and comfortable in your relationship which in his case means taking you for granted that youll put up with such bratty behavior this behavior doesnt improve without serious correction and consequences you cant talk someone out of being like this 99 of the time youre probably going to have to sit down and talk about this and see where that goes and from there where you will go and what you should do umajere616 thank you yes yep i agree with you i was just saying that i wasnt just speaking as a dog owner and someone who loves dogs and me saying he doesnt want to give the dog a chance still stands people are capable of change by opening their minds if he wants to live in fear of dogs and be unaccepting of a culture where dogs are household pets thats still his choice but its ops choice and right to live the way she wants in her house agreed and ops pet sounds well behaved so theres literally no reason to shut him up somewhere the dog isnt going to calm down if hes locked down in a crate though hell probably be excited for 30 minutes when he comes out of the crate ops dog sounds
