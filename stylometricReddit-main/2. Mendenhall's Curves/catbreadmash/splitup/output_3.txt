and got mad at you for trying to discuss it a lot of people myself included would start feeling resentful because we feel that is something we deserve and need or as you could say are entitled to in this particular case op gets resentful thinking his wife is controlling when he is mad or angry he gets mad or angry because he wants his wife to make a much effort to spend time with his family as she does with her own and blames her for not doing so and consequentially for him not being able to spend time with his family of origin thats being entitled in the not good way in this context why does she have to make sure that they spend lots of time with his family when 1 thats not her responsibility in general 2 they dont treat her well 3 his relationship with his family is something he is supposed to maintain not her if they were reaching out to her to try make plans and she was intentionally not passing that message on to her husband that would be a different matter even then though they could reach out to the husband and make plans or vice versa i hope this makes sense he doesnt dodge dragon breath very well qq you winnie the poohed that asshole good for you its time to become part of a tree i just really like having wolf doggos my good bois looks like your gf had a good reason and was being a good person to help someone in need shes someone you can be proud of not everyone does that for someone else yeah thats my wishful hope too if i had found the twinblade earlier in the game instead of missing that early cave i would be rocking twinblades and not katanas for sure oh that sounds way cooler than how i did it haha ill have to look up that weapon now sounds sick how did you end up beating him i love hearing how people handle bosses because there are so many different approaches and playstyles its great and most importantly congratulations on your son this made me laugh so good this made me smile let me solo her uses bleed and frost too and of course insane amounts of skill you mastered the hardest boss of all the character creation i havent been able to get the actual ash of war just the ability on the claws weapon but thats pretty much what i use it for all the time zoom zoom zoom dont worry fedex doesnt care youll be lucky if your package even shows up im completely with you here ordered a very expensive package it doesnt show up the day it is said to be delivered a few days later someone leaves the trash from my package at my backdoor they open an investigation claim to call me back absolutely nothing happens including the call back and the guy in charge of the investigation refusing to take my calls i get a replacement shipped they say it arrived yesterday only its nowhere to be found so now i have to go through this all over again and my leasing office probably thinks im crazy cranky not knowing i have lost almost 1k in merchandise yes i left specific instructions on how to to deliver with the customer service people and on a fedex account nothing worked i still dont understand what is happening with that anatomy even after seeing miquellas image so many times warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info praise the sun and thank you im really enjoying the community so far thanks to people like you hahaha shrimp temple oh thanks thats really good to know first time playing a from software game so its been a fun learning curve why did i get downvoted for asking for advice lol um how do i kill these i have 6 faith at level 72 so no healing incantations for me is it worth leveling faith though im a focused dexint hybrid i felt bad for killing the sofria rivers one it was so pretty and it was already dead then i brought it back just to kill it lol i understand thank you for your service to the greater good 7 the one i saw was in the black knife catacombs it was helpful and kept me on my guard was your sign about crabs i saw one very similar if not the same recently some people care about the status of a diamond read a post awhile back about a mans fiance asking him to keep the fact the ring is a mossanite secret not saying whether its right or wrong just some people do care i want to order one haha edit amazing work thanks for sharing thank you what system is op playing on looks gorgeous my husband and i were giving each other crap he said well you have double the time and further than you are and i told him my goal isnt to beat the game the fastest its to explore and enjoy everything im still fairly new to the game so im in excited awe of this video what is that weapon and how did he get sleep into that godskin apostle i love this game theres so many ways to do things its amazing what a kind benevolent soul ah yes that goes well with dinosaurs being the test of the devil mm golden chicken foot yeah when he put on his dragon arm i thought dude how are you going to fit through the doors of your own castle thanks for this and everyone else participating im still piecing things together lorewise i was just thinking the other day how i always go to the church of elleh to chill sell farm and generally relax that and chat to kale because hes nice godrick keeps saying hes the lord of all that is golden and im like what is the deal with that sweet ill be looking out for your clips then i loved the cross naginata when i was using it polearms are fun im on the radagons wolf rn which will force me to learn how to dodge ha i get two shotted by this guy and shields cant save me like they did with godrick ill keep an eye out for reduvia were you dual wielding hero reduvias im doing my best to explore as much as possible and find hidden things even even actively looking its so easy to miss whats the offhand you used to apply scarlet rot thanks for the super helpful info regarding daggers its really good to know i should definitely try them out sometime i played with a cross naginata with inverted red hawk heater shield for a little bit and have swapped that out with the uchigana because lighter and faster though the cross naginata was really fun still using same shield ill keep in mind to find a good blunt weapon to keep around in case of yay for finding a new playstyle you love your new build sounds super satisfying and probably looks badass its great for the game lets you respec if you want to change things up thanks and yeah youre right godrick does seem easier than magrit no offense taken magrit is harrrrrd thats cool what was your bleed build around right now im concentrating on dexint and thinking of upping my arcane while trying not to be squishy how are you liking your new buildplaystyle hope these arent too many questions its just fun learning about others experience and adventure oh im fighting godrick right now went exploring through a lot of caelid cant get that needle guy though ugh and made some trips to greyolls barrows before then i had godrick down to the last sliver of hp and took a hit thinking i was dead turns out i wasnt and i stood there waiting to die instead of getting that final hit in so im currently trying to kill him still with varying results im still very much working on my ability to dodge and hit strategically im not very good but im still having a lot of fun edit just beat godrick bleed is congratulations d thanks for this post as a newcomer to from softwares games this was very positive and encouraging oh speaking as someone who never played a game from this studio before my logic was if i make these other stats higher then ill kill stuff before it can hurt me and adjust accordingly on the way took me far too long to realize vigor is important and im a little screwed since i only started leveling it very late the softcap is real had a similar experience where a guy stood up and said evolution is obviously not real it makes no sense absolutely dumbfounded the room same guy thought a childrens book about a child enjoying imaginary friends was a clear and disturbing sign the kid had mental illness love this having a job gives a sense or purpose and routine and the ability to self sustain it also helps us relate to other people the truth is people also generally respect someone more if they know they have a job being aimless with no sense of results makes people unhappy this doesnt mean all jobs are good and that people should stay in a job that makes them miserable if they dont have to the power of product design my mom once bought a bottle of wine and didnt tell her friends how much it cost they thought it was pretty good until they found out it was like 12 bucks then they started finding problems with it hahaha no need to be afraid just let them know gently how much time and effort goes into making those lunches and that you werent able to prepare that much food and be able to perform your own job well then offer to give them recipe if they would like to try make it themselves they would have to be a whole different level of entitled to demand you make them something they themselves are not willing to do sounds like they had blood work done which is a responsible thing to do to ensure there will be no dangers or complications during the neutering while doing it without blood work is an option and its clear theyre not in the best financial situation im not making a judgment on the situation as a whole in this comment just wanted to explain why a neutering could cost 500 perfectly put this is such a great photo of you guys you look absolutely happy you guys are a beautiful couple that looks like they have fun every day seems like op wanted to invite discussion to see what he wasnt getting or understanding about brandon sandersons books to see why theyre so popular nothing wrong with that sometimes im able to appreciate or understand something i didnt like before by asking what others like about it my husband and i dont like his books either we dont find the writing or plots of his books able to sustain our interests for long we can get past unsophisticated writing i mean we loved ready player one for its heart the writing is not very good haha i know hes really popular but i just dont like his work not that i could write a book myself so youre not alone edit want to add that this is a matter of personal taste and i respect sandersons work ethic and ability to produce as well as bring happiness to many people through his books you guys look happy and
