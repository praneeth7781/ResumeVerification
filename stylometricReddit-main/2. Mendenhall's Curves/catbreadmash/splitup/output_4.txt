fabulous beautiful family i love your sunglasses thats the ratio of berries and cereal i was expecting the first time i bought the cereal and the ratio i yearn for la was designed for cars not people or one crazy looking neopet hello kind benefactor if you edit the original post to say it has been claimed that should help reduce or stop further comments cant imagine the state of your inbox right now my room as a child was a converted attic it became one of the best rooms in the house hands down 778 stickers and emojis are so addictive if i win ill give it to a friend who has been feeling down lately plastic surgery can do a lot though i mean if you were a person with regular features you could essentially transform yourself assuming you had the resources and a doctor willing to do that for you you can be ugly and become pretty through plastic surgery assuming there wasnt some greater complication yep the sil accusing your wife of trying to intentionally outdo her is such a clear sign that she got the barbie as a way of trying to one up your wife to begin with because frankly if she really was just into collecting the barbies for the sake of collecting the barbies why wouldnt she just be happy for her sister getting such a rare and cool item youre totally nta and its pretty clear why the sister was able to continue with such toxic behavior towards her own sibling personally i would not apologize neither you or her or the barbies are at fault the sister was being a toxic dick and starting a fight in the first place i hope your wife can see she is not to blame and be able to move forward and enjoy her dolls again puppy face you mean hes not a puppy all the time he looks like a puppy at 12 what a beautiful guy i love them theyre so beautiful and really capture the heart of the witcher wolf insignia mashing cats into bread cries defenestration nation would be a fun band name where do i get these sponges what brand are they must have tiny hog made of hedges now no amount of anger justifies treating your partner like that or treating them like shit its understandable he was angry but that in no way excuses his actions ever theres a difference he should not ever think it is acceptable or okay to take out his anger on you so much agreement on everything youve said its the sad state of our society and the world that we often think its not our problem or so what what can we do about it even if it makes us uncomfortable its good to at least be aware and admit if were not doing everything we can and in an ideal world do what we can versus justifying it as the norm appreciate you op you worded why that phrase is so frustrating meaningless and borderline insulting so succinctly something which i have never been able to articulate i remember going to people for help being told they would call me back and getting a text with those useless words those words and those people now instinctively incite disgust it is one thing to offer comfort and another to mouth meaningless words lots of mothers dont want to think their son is bad or wrong when theyre the apple of their eye its easier to dismiss and deny or justify good on you for not allowing your son to disrespect women thank you op for standing up for whats the right thing to do regardless of personal bias or pressure thats really admirable and if only there were more people like you wow yeah that kind of cavalier attitude and refusal to look at oneself when being alerted to the inappropriate behavior is scary and runs deep this list made me realize how much of my life has ben impacted by mental illness lately ive been really sad and unhappy over how my life has become as a result of choices and decisions from when i was younger i love goog games whats the game next to doom with the little cartoon character looks really cool i want to try it out if you dont mind me asking what was the final straw that made you leave and how did you prepare yourself for it true and there are also people that are selectively toxic like theyre only toxic bullies to certain people but great to others too you did good sometimes the right thing to do is not always the most comfortable or easy thing to do but you did it what happened with those relatives afterwards was it ever something you addressed with them thank you for your post its written so well and concisely as well as spreading truth to fight a very common and dangerous misconception thats what we call survivor bias though im sure your therapist is very good this is not true im sorry to say abusers can be master manipulators welcome to bug citizen where there happen to be a lot of stars the game starts feeling better once the player starts living around the bugs unfortunately also if an elevator in grim hex has corpses in it do not go inside just curious how did you guys hit it off so well thats a lovely meet cute sadly if this bill passes i could see a lot of big companies just shutting down their la office to get around this and end up outsourcing more 35 hours isnt going to work unless that becomes the established new full time hours with benefits and pay that is matched to be equivalent of 40 hours because its already hard enough to live in a high cost of living area even with a partner very much so if youre single thanks for doing that its a sad world when what you did is the exception and not the rule most people just do nothing because they dont want to get involved makes me sick to my stomach what differentiates an argument from a fight for you its disturbing he didnt mind his mom walking in on them having sex that much thank you 1 to leopold spidercloud he was not pleasant all the way to the end no apology whatsoever the apartment numbers are labeled clearly on the windows there are loading zones around the whole complex if you entered the numbers and street name on a gps it would give you my apartment complex and the correct street doordash has us write instructions for you guys to make your lives easier if you dont bother reading them then thats on you not on the client you can also call thanks for being a good dasher really appreciate what you guys do mmm i envy the life you have lived to make your faith n humanity so strong and wholesome sorry for misunderstanding the way the food was splayed out required more force than from a crow edit lol it would be pretty funny seeing a crow carry a double meat bacon burger wrapped in foil though yup i can guarantee you we were not rude or impatient or in any way disagreeable people around here keep their dogs on a leash are pretty well behaved and weve never had that problem when people dropped bags off on front lol pretty brazen and touchy to just call someone psychopathic like that he just was confusing wouldnt tell me what street hes on just that he was there and he wasnt then all of a sudden he was saying that he was at cvs and suddenly thats the right address i was pretty to the point i told him the cross streets the apartment was at we are on the ground floor later he was like im at the entrance to the apartment building i pointed out there are multiple entrances could he please come to the cross streets i mentioned it was lilt trying to pull teeth they are its a sentence long cant get much more direct than that it was the address listed he refused to look for the apartment number thanks for letting me know what its like for you guys on the other side of the fence funnily enough my post got downvoted though i dont think i said anything wrong or out of line one time my husband went scrambling to find a driver only to find that the guy ripped open the sealed bags stole a burger and dumped the rest on the ground he had to sweep up all the fries the guy could have at least said he preferred text but when i kept asking he said nothing and just kept not picking up thats rude edit thank you for the advice though i will look into doing that next time im sorry i didnt bookmark it and have no idea how to find it it has remained in my memories because as you said it is an interesting story i really espect how she took her own life back into her hands lol i remember a reddit story about a woman whose husband ignored her repeated requests to deal with an issue his mom being offensive for years finally she gave up got her ducks lined up in a row and told him she wanted a divorce she wrote her husband was like when his brother got married and wouldnt take any of their mothers crap towards his new wife the husband came crawling back to her doorstep years later but it was too late this stuff can eat away at the foundation of a marriage oh i completely agree that one should ask them to pay due damages its just that making someone pay is hard as bad people will just refuse would she even have paid its impossible to get people to pay up sometimes unless you bring them to court oh yes so much yes here aw i couldnt stay awake through the first three episodes the changes were pretty
