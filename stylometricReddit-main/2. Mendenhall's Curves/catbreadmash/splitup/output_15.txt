crossing friends your room is cute and charming thank you for sharing it clever dont worry about your scars because it wont matter to the right person the poster uplatypuffs gives thoughtful and sound advice i definitely recommend the book attached it will help you understand how your style and your partners style interacts and be helpful as a way to overcome your avoidant style disorder through self awareness the road might be hard but you can do it the point the person is making is that you and your friend have different values your friend values transparency and openness with his gf when and if he gets married that will be even more so this is actually very common especially if you two are opposite genders you cant force him to change his values just as he cant force you to change yours the kind of emotional support youre asking of your friend would make him look very shady if he wasnt open with his gf about it hello i would suggest minecraft its a simple game where you explore and build things it doesnt look beautiful from a first impression but the more you play it the more you see the beauty of the game its got a really fun learning curve and can go quite deep very good for all ages your children and grandchildren can also play it with you if you guys get a server to play on so it can be a way to connect even if you cant see each other physically add discord a voice chat program and you guys can talk and play together minecraft is available and easy to play on pc which more than likely your childrengrandchildren have too so you wouldnt have to worry about getting a console another game although this is console is animal crossing new horizons its charming and simple and not really an action game whatsoever but some people find it very satisfying and fun more of a gathering and crafting game the multiplayer here isnt ideal but theoretically you could play with your family with this game as well i also hear great things about stardew valley havent tried it myself but im sure that one is lots of fun the games ive mentioned so far are all games you can take at your own pace when you play remember that you will need to be conscientious and extremely self aware at all times understand that until otherwise this will be a long and hard fight maybe even a lifetime long but you can do it and it will get easier the best thing is that you realized it and are owning it instead of blaming and running away therapy will be key go to lundy bancroft site and do his exercises for abusive people once of the key things you must know is that your behavior and feelings stem from how you are literally thinking and you must change how you think if you truly want to become better super easy and super delicious oh yes for sure it is not entirely hellofreshs fault however i doubt my direct complaint to the guy delivering it to me is going to do anything i hope by telling hellofresh they can put pressure or speak to whoever they need to in terms of delivery for better performance such as amazon used 3rd party companies to deliver packages to my complex some of these 3rd party companies were terrible one knocked and peered through my blinds kept knocking till i opened asked me where the leasing office was i told him he came back and asked me to deliver the package for him wtf this happened serveral times so i told my leasing office and they dealt with it through amazon and that no longer happens hey heads up i just saw online that hellofresh is stopping their promotions started 317 and free meal codes for awhile due to the current state of things so your code may not be valid for some time i used a groupon that said it would give me 90 dollars off and required me to subscribe the thing it didnt tell me is that it split my 90 dollar discount over several boxes so week 1 had a 40 discount week two had 30 etc etc while i dont mind this because i was intending to try the service it is possible that they might be discounting it over several boxes instead of all at once their customer help service is pretty good so if you subscribe and find out its not what you think you can probably cancel and ask for a refund the thing is shes established that you snapping at her makes her feel unsafe and affects her trust in you you see it as theres so many things you didnt snap at her for she might see it as i dont know when hes going to snap at me the thing about building or having a future with someone is that like another poster said mindset is a big part of it like seeing it as a cute quirk and being able to work together or handle things in a way that creates or maintains a sense of safety it really seems like she cant help it so perhaps there best thing to do would not put her in situations where the outcome might be you going babe please but if this would cause you to resent or lose respect for her then the relationship will suffer mindset and acceptance love and understanding these are necessities thank you good luck i truly mean this shouldve written it in my original comment all we can do is our best we all make mistakes and hurt even those we love but we dont have to stay that person we can be a better person starting today its great youve reached this self awareness to realize your mistakes and the epiphany of how precious this person is to you it seems like you are really remorseful and want to do good by her and really thats the important thing that youre genuine and care about her depression is a terrible horrible beast that takes different forms and leaves casualties in its wake you were the best you could be at the time so as another poster so kindly said forgive yourself even if it doesnt work out i hope it does for you though forgive yourself and be strong so you can understand her hurt and help her through it persevere and try your hardest that counts for so much a couple people i know who are either married or together now got together because one party really tried i really do wish you the best as i can relate to where youre at if you can show you genuinely care about her feelings and show real remorse consistently show her with words and actions and accept accountability for yor wrongdoing and really listen to her so she feels heard id say thats the stepping stone to get being able to rebuild trust and possible take you back it needs to be real keep in mind she is not obligated to do so even if you do all this and she decides that things are just too broken for things to continue in a healthy way then you will just have to accept that none of this means being a doormat but it does mean understanding the effort you need to put forward in order for her to even take you back as a partner and the effort to earn her trust in you as her partner back there will be some extra sacrifices you might need to make in order to move forward it would also be good to come up with a plan of action describing how you will improve and consciously prevent what happened from happening again and not take her for granted she sounds overwhelmed im not saying what youre expecting is unreasonable its just possible that it feels like too much to her for some reason things i can do now easily when it comes to taking care of my family home felt overwhelming and like drudgery when i was depressed i attributed my depression to feeling unfulfilled and lacking my sense of self sometimes people dont want to own up to their feelings because they feel like they failed or if the other person isnt a bad person they feel guilty sometimes they even try to make out the other person to be bad just so they can still be a good guy and justify breaking up honestly people will often unconsciously and consciously do anything to protect their selfimage and ego and the longer someones a terrible person the more embedded and difficult it is for them to turn around in the mirror and look because that realization is not pleasant at all nta posts like yours and many others which involve a work environment has just proves how people will do crazy things to get what they want essentially people are crazy and selfish that and people get all groupy the trouble maker is not your cat but that womans dog because she doesnt have it well trained enough to chill if your cat isnt causing issues with a majority of the dogs and is keeping to itself its her problems and her friends are assholes too warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info whether to have children or not can be a dealbreaker in relationships and it sucks that this area where you thought you were once compatible in has no longer become so in some cases you get people who are okay with having or not having children but shes made it pretty clear that she doesnt want any its better that shes honest with herself and you about what she wants rather than becoming resentful from having children and children suffering for it she may be acting like the conversation never happened because it sounds like otherwise shes quite happy in your relationship so she might just be hoping that things can go on the way they are it comes down to what is more important to you do you want to spend the rest of your life with her or do you want children neither of you are wrong for wanting what you want and if you have to walk away from the relationship because of it good for you on choosing not to defend fuckedup family and their complete lack of respect towards a human being and boundaries your brother did something terrible and frankly not something that could be forgiven as he wasnt even sorry he did it over and over again despite seeing the horrible consequences and suffering it caused another human its great you came to this conclusion im only one of many people on earth but i definitely think you made the right call putting the safety of your loved one first and their feelings first is important i have a question and i dont mean this to create guilt but really more because im in a situation in which im trying to understand the other party aka i wish they would open their eyes why did you try to get your girlfriend to forgive your brother and your family instead of standing up for her to begin with was it a matter of not respecting or loving her enough or is it really just a matter of ignorance on the right thing to do being torn between people who were good to you but shit to her and her why did you try to defend your family in the first place although the saying to put yourself in the other persons shoes is great
