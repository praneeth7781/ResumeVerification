so something needs to change you support him and her being friends but there needs to be boundaries and thats perfectly reasonable is your brothers girlfriend really hot or something i cant see any other way people would be blind enough to tolerate that kind of entitled behavior or for someone to get away with it this long in life ding ding ding bingo yup can attest they can be experts in one field and totally dumb in another but because theyre treated like god in their specific area of expertise they think they know best about everything they are equally capable if not more so of mental health stigma thank you omg what theres something for carsickness beyond dramamine lol alex will be able to find work in a couple years youre thinking everyone in the would cares as much as people who follow the try guys but they dont and she comes from a privileged position there are plenty who either wont know or wont care she just probably cant work on the youtube entertainment industry for awhile alex is an attractive woman speaking as a woman who is not as attractive as alex while you are correct that she is going to face stigma her attractiveness will give her much more cushion in the long run than say if she were an average looking gal attractive people like alex get a lot of benefits all their life just for being good looking and thats not just going to stop because of this her situation is definitely worse than neds but shell probably be able to get back up better than you think ive started doing this after having consistent germination failure with aerogarden pods totally worth it same theyve only ever arrived for me like this and the sponges have often fallen out of the cages im sorry youre going through this what were her reasons dying is part of the process enjoy it yep its not you for sure it was a complaint i saw on here i decided to try for it myself since why not it was in my kit mine was not very flavorful despite its thriving mint is a powerful grower as well so if you do decide to grow it again in the future it also needs to have the roots trimmed in my experience the mint in the aerogarden variety isnt very flavorful so that might not be due to the basil basil is a thirsty mofo whose roots need to be trimmed as well or it will take over the tank unless your tap water is very ideal distilled water is best gasssp charizarrrd and pikachu hopeful comment here d pretty please oh yes ive done that its also cool seeing peoples personal experiences here so i thought id ask i decided to buy some alternative brand grow sponges and just re use the plastic cages and domes hi update it seems to have been a nutrient and watering issue i added an extra capful and have been topping up the basil with water more consistently the weaker basil has resumed full growing strength and there have been no more deadening leaves d thank you so much for your tips now to figure out why my italian parseley and sage didnt germinate theyre in a different aero the others did so maybe just unlucky with those two well the ones in the aerogarden shared by the basil are all dead except for chives they failed to germinate not enough light probably i bought an extra little light and am debating what to grow next to them now i have my results mostly talked about how to nip above the node i hadnt seen anything defining what those tiny leaves were thank you im having a lot of fun with my first aerogardens i get quite happy just looking at my plants grow and its so nice seeing some green will that mess up any other plants i grow alongside the basil thanks so much for your responses im learning a lot from them how much more food did you give thank you i pinched one off worried it was a bud hope it grows back now haha cry oh thank you i pinched one off worried it was the beginning of a bud do they grow back even if i do that x whoops ohhh i see good to know im due to change water in a couple days ill investigate the roots then last time i looked at the roots i investigated them closely as for your questions yes and yes ag everything 6 pod aerogarden two capfuls every feeding no bugs at all as far as i can see right now it doesnt seem like light burn due to where the affected leaves are and bc ive seen my light burn the plant lol but im hoping it is because that would be an easy fix one leaf kinda died off which makes me wonder is it is perhaps root rot that seems pretty tricky to solve murdered a man for killing my dog and trying to steal my car thank you that is really helpful to know i didnt know about light burn at all thank you which size do you get for the aerogarden ive had a woman refuse my offer to get her something from the store because she wanted cash to buy a specific burrito across the street wasnt really sure what to think about that and yeah ive eaten plain bread by itself bread is delicious thank you i will look at these places is this an open offer if so i would love to take you up on it weve been considering the move but its hard since we dont know any other languages than english would be happy to learn though which makes meeting the requirements a bit difficult i dont see it at all what section is it under i love your design if its alright may i please draw it or put it in a drawing of course i will give credit that it is your purse design but did he apologize for saying such hurtful things and screaming you did something wrong unintentionally not contacting him to let him know though that was really understandable in your situation you apologized his reaction was really really shitty and intentionally disrespectful it didnt matter that you made a mistake first he needs to apologize for what he did or youre going to end up with a guy who doesnt apologize for his shitty behavior im really happy for you your relationship sounds like my ideal what do you think makes you guys so incredibly happy im married and i would love for my husband to be able to say something like this about our life together thanks for getting back to me unfortunately it turns out i had an additional problem on top of that which would not trigger the files to download tried troubleshooting

lone friendly face amidst a dangerous world what a fun video thoughtful picks too thank you so much for sharing my only real reservation is that of blaidd simply because his va does such an amazing job the va brings such richness depth and warmth to him that i struggle to imagine him sounding like anything or anyone else that kind voice makes you get so attached to him as hes your comrade there

he sneezes once the crystalian bursts into dust haha yeah i pretty much cast rock sling the entire time while running around on torrent feeding him raisins and using the summoning signs there is a great book written about it later the author committed suicide i heard it was because she found humanity truly horrifying and depressing fedex lost multiple packages of mine in a row and didnt care opened investigations service center didnt respond worst experience ive ever had and im not the only one i know whos dealt with this would not recommend fedex if you live in an apartment complex when you hear the noise of the chariot as it stops to turn shoot the rope of the pot have your aim ready so you release the arrow when you hear the noise that should do the trick if you somehow miss the timing with all the pots just reload at the grace church of elleh hanging out with merchant kale i love how this is so much like classical illustration beautiful draftsmanship color and composition the worst part of this for me is that i actually did read the description but silly me i was like well i was reborn okay so maybe its okay for boc because he has a larval tear like the ones im using maybe everyone else just didnt have a larval tear its my first fromsoft game and im learning to treat everything like murphys law most of the time everybody dies my husband just asked me yesterday

the tip though beautiful work so emotive an touching its these artworks that call out to people the ones we can feel youre not the only one multiple investigations and requests for info to their service center went unanswered when i had my packages stolenmisdelivered multiple times in a row they just dont care raises hand thats my class raised one point of faith just for this yeah its the same principle with pacing in movies too much of the same tone and intensity leads to viewers being bored or dulled by the movie theres nothing to create contrast entitlement isnt necessarily always a bad thing though the word itself has a bad connotation when used so for instance lets say your partner did something very hurtful but never talked it through with you or helped you heal from it
