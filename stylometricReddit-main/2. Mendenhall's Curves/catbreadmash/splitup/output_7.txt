and will poison your marriage if you let it dont let it do that if youre family doesnt like your wife much and are only cordial towards her she can feel that nobody likes being surrounded by people who they feel at best tolerate them with the most basic level of politeness and im only guessing that this is the situation realistically its probably worse and runs deeper than this it really sucks its not very realistic of you to expect her to try build a relationship with people that dont return the effort or arent willing to put that effort in themselves and please try to avoid idealizing your family in this situation your wife is setting healthy boundaries for herself you wanting to force a relationship without in regards to her feelings is selfish you might be able to create a compromise like maybe you see them together for certain holidays or visit x amount of times in so many months you yourself say that your wife gets along with a lot of other people and is a great partner she should be your priority you are responsible for talking and maintaining relationships with your own family in a way that doesnt damage or harm your marriage and thats not something you can put on your wife i had a friend who reported people everyday for a looong time she plays daily and is a very good player she said it was extremely satisfying to see one or two notifications on her lunch breaks saying action had been taken against the assholecreep players shed encounter oh my gosh what a beautiful boy wow thats just astoundingly rude and inconsiderate my dog is leash reactive and as a result i try to keep him away from other dogs unless theyve received full disclosure and are okay with him being near respect for each other is what keeps everyone safe i almost cried from gratitude when an apartment building neighbor actually offered to help train my dog to become less leash reactive with their pitbull love is not enough values need to be compatible and a guy who doesnt try to solve problems but create more in a fight is not someone who is thinking of you guys as a team its like nsync says bye bye bye hes not over her even with you around and its not going to work out with the way things are maybe one day in the future after you two have had time and space apart however right now he doesnt and cant fully appreciate you while hes hung up on someone else i say this as someone who has been in both your and his situation that it is definitely healthier for you to move on i never got the sense of judgment seems more factual in describing their lifestyle differences im sorry that happened to you uextrausername look up the 5 love languages and figure out which ones apply to your girlfriend that might be a helpful way to start and to get ideas the other thing is that being romantic takes effort so please dont beat yourself up over not being naturally good at it all the time just start putting in the effort that alone counts for a lot the more she gives in to her irritation and rage the more shell get used to handling things that way and it just goes downhill from there unless she seeks help or proactively tries to change that you guys will want to deal with it before it progresses further and becomes more ingrained there are therapists who do sliding scale thank you for being an advocate of the right thing versus the i dont want to deal with anything unpleasant even if its the truth thing it makes me so mad how people who catch it and get off with light symptoms dismiss the severity of whats happening and this disease rather than realizing just how bloody lucky they were wow uh was that person ever your friend i cant imagine saying that to anyone i respect on a baseline level of human there are people i hate and i wouldnt say that to them hmm kept saying we were friends but would badmouth me to other people when i got into her dream school because the vice president of admissions vouched for me she wasnt happy for me just sullenly remarked i got lucky and my department is easy to get into proceeded to neg me online through chat and tell me other people didnt like me at school that they were annoyed when i said hi to them which is weird because those people said hi to me first by coming over to greet me my so at the time and now good friend told me that she clearly wasnt a friend and to not talk to her same person proceeded to call me crying and apologize years later only to pull similarly disrespectful shit called her out on it when i finally got upset she denied it and got mad and proceeded to block me on everything i feel better and dont care she still gets hung up and does her best to badmouth me our mutual friend it doesnt work but the chain shows that it existed and thus you are not an idiot but a champion of communication omg hahaha thanks for explaining i should edit and fix that thanks whenever i late night cell phone reddit theres always some kind of goofy error i make hmm how is this self hatred sorry i dont quite understand his wife has made it pretty clear she wants nothing to do with me and it got to the point where me continuing to try was just becoming toxic so we are both happier not seeing each other at this point though i am sad for my husband sometimes people dont vibe and thats just life i feel bad because this is like what happened to my husband his best friends wife hates me and shows it in all the passive aggressive micro aggression ways possible while trying to look good on front of others i still kept tring to set up things so our husbands could spend time but she would never follow through or return calls she only picked up calls if i started calling her husband needless to say after four years of her shit i hate her at this point they have made zero effort to see us and we see them 01 times a year her husband has started to treat me weird too which is sad because he used to be a genuinely nice guy respectfully may i please ask how you differentiate between a boundary and an ultimatum ive been doing my best to discern the difference in some situations and i would love to get insight in how to clearly know when stating a boundary versus an ultimatum if he found you beautiful he would have said that to you what he said was uncaring and cruel why because he doesnt care about how it makes you feel i love your haircut your calico is very beautiful cat spit face cream hahaha your husband needs to shut him down its disrespectful and rude you tried it your husbands way and it didnt improve at this point youve given don enough chances and if you dont want to ever see him again thats absolutely your right its messed up that your husband allowed don to go on as long as he has good for you for standing up for your wife more men could follow your example instead of pardoning their families for being disrespectful jerks just because they are family you havent gone too far if hes bad in couples counseling because hes abusive individual will only make it worse as well oh i admire your husband for being able to recognize his family might not be good people thank you being family doesnt give you a free pass to be toxic abusive or enable abuse which falls under being toxic i love himz he is bootifuls one of the problems is that society now thinks therapy is a cureall while it is a powerful tool its success is still depending on various things and individual therapy does not work with abusers it usually just makes them worse the last thing you should be doing is asking her to go to couples therapy or individual therapy she needs a batterers program i recommend you read lundy bancrofts book why does he do that it applies to both men and women call the domestic violence hotline for resources and seek proper individual therapy for yourself it may help inform and bolster you to gain the strength you need to leave feel free to dm or anything if you just need to talk hes a great example ive only ever read people saying nice things about him and how hes really sweet i dig it im just guessing at why maybe the actor didnt want to be credited because its not like he knew that was how vader would turn out to be in the final film completely hypothetical guesswork on my part or maybe it was to keep vader more mysterious who knows thank you for loving that caring and fighting for that beautiful pupper the way you do i hope he fully recovers soon 3 he looks like hes getting his pep back yes but he probably didnt know that it would be a loved villain versus like the hatred jar jar binks received not for being evil but annoying still though there are many people who play unlikable characters and get harassed for it very cute proportions i love the face and its little fuzz mane bravo what you can do is offer your support so she knows that its there and no judgment offer her a safe place acknowledge that its her business and youre a stranger but that if she ever needs anything or even just a friend to listen that you can be that person do this in a friendly and kind way not a you gotta get out of there and im going to help you way and wont have romantic expectations or motives then give her space at those events wave smile act normal she will probably not accept immediately and possibly might not ever take you up on it but one day she will probably appreciate it even if she doesnt talk to you again you have good family my aunt would demand a good chunk of the money haha while what youre saying might be true ive been in the position and seen others where the woman in question was in a long term relationship even married but would act inappropriately much to the denial of the persons and my so while when being described from an outside view it would be more plain to see i do believe in male and female friendships but that kind of situation is more common than you would think because people get weird and proprietary although its possible the girlfriend could be reading into things too much it still isnt outside the realm of possibility actually people can be very blind to what they dont want to see the way he speaks reminds me of people who when given concrete examples would just brush them off and say its not a big deal or not what theyre thinking people dont want to believe when its inconvenient to them true theyre nineteen but we dont know enough about the situation hi you sound like me from younger years we pick the partners we think we deserve you clearly dont think you deserve him and find it more easy to believe his friends and family but the truth is that you chose him and he chose you
