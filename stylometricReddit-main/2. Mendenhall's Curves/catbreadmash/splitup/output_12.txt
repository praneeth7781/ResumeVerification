in your post at the very least hes not ready to be in a relationship with you its not worth being with someone who you have to coax and drag along by their teeth or who doesnt have the ability and foresight to see how you have to work together and compromise on some basic level in a relationship people can mature and grow in a relationship its just that where youll be starting from with him is going to make for possibly one very rocky road it just sounds like he wants to keep absolute freedom more than he in a relationship with you you can explain it all you want but odds are that if you actually do get in a relationship with him he might use this as an excuse whenever you want to set healthy boundaries or i dont know be treated nicely i mean hes already complaining about getting gifts the one thing ive noticed about most conspiracy havers is the distinct lack of critical thinking i dont think conspiracy theories promote critical thinking about a promoted truth as much as it just serves some bias or ignorance the strand of logic is weak if not nonexistent oh no worries thank you for taking the time to respond i really appreciate it thank you for this i havent watched the movies in a long time so im not sure but based off how they did the movies in general it wouldnt be surprising if it had been cut off or minimized in such a way that it lost impact the movies didnt nail the emotions or relationships of the characters well while also having a lot of unnecessary exposition you worded katniss so well her individuality and her determination directness her loyalty are some of the traits that draw them and us as the reader i enjoyed the fact that she felt socially awkward and felt like she wasnt able to connect with the people like the way her sister could and that those who got to know her could appreciate her her confusion over her feelings for peeta and the back and forth between him and g are also very relatable as human emotions are quite messy i didnt just see it as peeta making her feel safe but her also realizing that peeta is complementary to her and can together make the life she ultimately wants as what determined her final choice id like to think in a way she did realize she loved him more than gale though that would just be wishful thinking on my part yep very true i just remarked on haymitch in particular because the person i was replying to thought that haymitch deserved to be treated badly by katniss while they definitely sparked against each other at first their relationship definitely evolved into that of mutual respect he more than redeemed himself we all have friends who have bad traits but who we care for regardless because what they give us is so much more haymitchs bad traits are also just self destructive in nature he only hurts himself not others oh i totally get what youre saying im the same when i could go to the gym i was doing more strength training and it was great i didnt think you looked fat or out of shape or that you werent putting in efffort just as a fellow person who misses going to the gym and its benefits wanted to offer you the little things i found worked for me im someone who also has a hard time standing up for myself sometimes which is why i admire your ability to do so hey there do you have any dumbbells and a yoga mat there are some great youtube videos that can help keep the weight at bay and possibly even weight loss im saying this because you mention wanting to work out there is no good reason for your husband to ever call you a fat cunt ever him being dismissive of your efforts is fucked up and he obviously was just trying to sledgehammer you with whatever hurt he could im glad you have self esteem enough to require some major action from him to show hes remorseful im sorry i dont have any magical answer or solution to your situation but know that you are not wrong for being angry and he was wrong to treat you that way even if you were passive aggressive if you dont mind me asking how did you guys get past the shitty times you mentioned were those external things or were there struggles you two had between yourselves ive only been married for a couple years myself haymitch was a very tragic character the imperfection of katniss is one of the most memorable things of the book for me the conversation that she overhears peeta and gale where theyre asking who they think shell pick between the two of them and they both conclude that its whoever she needs more the guilt she feels from the knowledge of the kind of person she is and for their love the book also pounds in the truth that when youre fighting to survive you can only think of others so much that you are strained and stressed trying to just exist frankly katniss is a much more real person than most ya protagonists and probably more selfless than a lot of people in real life please take the dog with you sometimes people dont stop unless you make it clear how unacceptable their behavior is and back it up with consequences yeah im sorry you had to go through what you did with your in law and your own family your mil is not on your side be you shed get involved in a heartbeat if it was her son saying these things your husbands abuse is enabled by his family you guys look like such a sweet and happy couple you guys look great hope you guys have your happiness for a life time 3 congratulations really admire those who can go the distance and work hard to keep the love and spark alive hi please try read lundy bancrofts books daily wisdom and why does he do that reading them and knowing youre not alone and being able to see what hes doing might help you stand up for yourself a little better and bancroft provides good advice you can also call a domestic abuse counselor who might be able to provide you with good advice on how to keep him away welcome really i live in la and i thought we had the reputation of being pretty unfriendly as in if someone asks how youre doing the gut reaction is what do you want with some side eye saving this post thank you very much for this the snarling in your face throwing things its going to get worse your gut is right big red flags do not move in with him you can soften it and tell them the truth still saying something like i feel so very lonely because dating as a trans person has been incredibly hard and disappointing so far and its starting to wear me down im feeling really demoralized and im struggling because of it im hesitant to tell you guys because im so happy for you both that i dont want you to feel bad about me being single because youre both such great peoplemeaningful friends to me and i wish i too were in a great relationship like one the two of you have in a way its the whole truth because its these feelings causing the envy you feel in the first place if you were in a great relationship then it wouldnt matter its not really about them just you animals being hurt animals rejected and unloved animals dying all through no fault of their own seeing a polar bear starve because there isnt enough ice for him to hunt on the koalas and kangaroos and all the creatures fleeing from the fires the animals in the parks looking for food because the tourists have gone away and theyre starving the furbabies in cages and kennels left alone for the night while waiting for their forever home animals that die due to our stupidity our ignorance our lack of respect do you have any tips on how to cultivate relationships id like to make friends i love tolkien so much he could create such a epic sense of vision love lotr i can read it time and time again and find such beauty in the story and words always i experienced what youre describing with dune as well i had read sci fi before dune and people thought that i wouldnt like it because dune was old and many of the things that it had done many had done after it so it wouldnt seem that special they were so wrong because dune does it so well i couldnt understand why there were those who could not appreciate the greatness that is dune regardless of when they read it broken boundaries regardless of gender is still really bad guys can get really possessive and manipulative over other guys have you looked into therapists that have a sliding scale i havent had much luck but there are therapists who offer a sliding scale of pricing for people who cant afford it seriously consider having your husband with you present shut down your cousin as kindly as possible but firmly so she understands her feelings are entirely unreciprocated and will stay that way then she needs to go and stay gone so sadly true what sucks is that the smart ones get away with it a lot of the time because the other parties cant do anything without getting the situation flipped on them if only more men were like your sisters husband its like how weddings bring out the crazy in people in this case they didnt care until the proof was in the pudding that she wasnt going to be going anywhere dont feel bad op some families are just that shitty how your husband responds to this will let you know whether your marriage is going to work or not you want someone who can and will defend you till the end of time thick or thin not someone who only does it when its convenient or easy he should be someone that you can talk to when someone disrespects you even if its his own mother its better to find out now than later whether your husband can be the man for you traumatic bonding occurs not only in romantic relationships but in parent child relationships children hold on tighter to inconsistent parents warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info sorry to say i honestly think thats the minority once i was taking a childrens literature class and the teacher recommended that we the students all go to a playground and observe children then one of the dudes raised his hand and was like er sir theres a problem with that for anyone whos a guy and it struck me how men have to be careful with their image as to not come off as a creep also if you need a friend you can dm me its important you dont feel alone theres a really good book that might provide great comfort and support for all these different feelings and things youre going through right now it addresses things from feeling like youre made out to be the bad guy how to feel normal again the name is daily wisdom for why does he do that it will definitely help you know and feel that you are not alone you are not crazy or broken what
