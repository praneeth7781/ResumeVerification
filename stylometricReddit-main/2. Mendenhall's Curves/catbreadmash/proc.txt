whether she knows it or not  you made the right choice in deciding to take things slow while she navigates through her breakup and betrayal

you can tell her that its not you putting her in a box but respecting that shes in a vulnerable position  and that you yourself need some time to take things slow and figure dog out too shes not the problem  its a whole situation where youd like for the both of you to stabilize before moving forward
some clarification then i am not saying your behavior is one to one  but there seem to be some parallels in thinking and the kind of way you believe is your right to talk people 

controlling people dont see themselves as controlling  they just think people should behave the way they want or will behave the way they want because theyre right 

cool
i would respectfully disagree that im dragging trauma into my own post perhaps i come across as the most balanced to you is because i do my best to be aware of how words can easily become attacks  being respectful of a different opinion and patience speaking about my own personal experience was my way of indicating that even if you dont intend to  you may be coming across as a certain kind of person 

if someone were to word things nicely to your face  but think in a way that was belittling or invalidating in their mind where do you think the real intent lies thats why people are focusing on how you talk about your gf nor did anyone told you to silently walk away  they merely gave their opinion on ultimately they thought things would work out and sometimes why 

as for your first paragraph again  to me it lacks compassion and an understanding of people being different from yourself i dont agree with it at all good luck
sometimes were not great with words and how we find across in text doesnt have the feeling intended or how we would like in person so feedback allows us to understand how we are perceived by others  i dont know you  which is why i say im reminded of my ex not that you are me ex by your words  

people dont think youre horrible for wanting the dog to be better trained  they think the way you are thinking of the girl  for her reasons of why she has the relationship with her dog  lacks compassion or a willingness to respect a view outside of your own  if its a value that you cant bend on  thats fine but saying its the only view people should have not ok 

again  its fine to want the dog to be better trained and to be less invasive to everyone around it thats not the issue  i understand you probably feel attacked  but also understand that you were verbally attacking and invalidating advice or opinions you asked for as a growth oriented individual im sure you are able to self reflect on yourself and your role in the discussion
how you talk about her indicates how you think about her regardless of how you speak to her the way you think about your partner is a very important indicator of respect and health  the way you speak about her is concerning
read your post  wanted to add that yeah  there are people who leave their dogs alone for more than 10 hours  should they  no its unkind  and not a great quality of life for the dog
copy pasted in response to him thank you
op in my comment earlier i mentioned compromise is important if you want to be with this girl  and working as a team  everything you wrote in response to uculturalemu3548 shows an inflexible way of thinking and beliefs personally i think everything uculturalemu3548 said is thoughtful and quite spot on 

her relationship may not be normal to you  but it doesnt make it objectively strange and unhealthy youre trying to change your gf to fit what you want youre not trying to be understanding or accepting  youre just labeling things as right or wrong and the truth is  youre not objectively right or wrong in this several people have expressed that you and your gf both have the right to live your lives the way you want in this regard but that it may indicate its not the right fit for either of you tbh more and more  you come across as someone who looks down on how his girlfriend feels and just wants to change her

i once broke up with a guy for many reasons  but one of the major reasons was that he wouldnt respect some basic things about treating my dog never drag him on his leash he was astounded that i yelled at him in public for doing that to my small  senior dog who weighed less than 7 pounds i yelled stop it and immediately took my dog from him and the way he spoke down to me about various things  like the way you speak about how your girlfriend loves her dog and are responding to people  reminds me of him not a good look

if its a huge issue for you  the only thing i can really see you do is talk to her about boundaries with the dog that you need in order for the relationship to continue  that said  i do think  based on your description of the dog and her relationship with it  you will need to come to a compromise about those boundaries and the role of the dog for her its also something that needs a lot of time to change gradually for her and the dog  

training the dog not to jump in people  this is a fair request not coming up on the bed while having sex that might be doable shutting the dog out of the room may not work  so you might have to deal with knowing the dog is looking at you from somewhere in the room keep in mind that her reprimanding the dog lightly is not a sign of bad ownership necessarily because negative reinforcement isnt healthy all you do is teach the dog to be scared  not to respect or trust your judgment and learn boundaries remember that are living things too with the cognizant and emotional ability of five year olds time and repetition is key you could discuss a training plan with her an goals you both agree on to follow for certain situations to get the results you both want team effort   that is more helpful than saying i dont like your dog or how you treat your dog change it 

honestly i know for myself and how i feel about dogs i dont know if i would be compatible long term with someone who strongly disagreed with his i wanted to live with my dog  or disapproved of my relationship with my dog i would be really sad feeling like i have to choose another thing to consider is that maybe one of the reasons this girl is special and different  is what makes her attached to the dog in his way
doesnt sound like youre too needy at all more like this relationship isnt right for you  funny he mentions compromise when it doesnt seem like hes compromising it is scary and sad to break things off with someone  especially when they are a good person but you can find someone who wants to spend lots of time with you and feels fulfilled by it
yes  its understandable that its comfortable  but the point is that it might be because of the churchs way of teaching certain values and expectations of married life that it may not be helpful in terms of counseling to work through the specific issues in your marriage  of course you are free to do as you wish  it is just something to consider especially if the church counseling doesnt work out
thank you in complete agreement  i was wondering if anyone else had this view thank you for breaking down the phantom of the opera so beautifully

dont think beauty and the beast is an incel story either that would be a gross oversimplification
what she did wasnt a prank but pure disrespect and mean  

i never would have done something like that to anyone at the age of 16 your fiance should have your back but instead hes  justifying his daughters mistreatment of you and not prioritizing your feelings  moving in with him and marrying him at this point will only enable him to continue being this way  please dont let them erode your boundaries and treat you less than you are worth
he doesnt seem to have true remorse only reason sam wants to make up with matt is because the uncle is giving him consequences no contact if it werent for that hed be content to keep going the way he is ive found that when people dont come to this decision on their own and only through an outside influence it usually doesnt last and this is a clear cut case personally i dont think you even have to forgive him yourself matt doesnt have to forgive him either
i have a hard time believing this person is local bc if someone is that big of an asshole  it does get around the island
op never said that he wasnt going to address the situation  just that he thinks its a major case of codependency and possessiveness rather than true romantic attraction 

op i dont know which one of it the matter is  but the truth and result are the same shes disrespecting your relationship and ignoring reasonable boundaries shes not being supportive of your friend and his autonomy someone like her doesnt get better or change they just get more toxic unless the person theyre jealous of puts their foot down  and even then it can still go very bad  her mental health is ultimately her responsibility in this case i hope youre able to discuss this with your fiance and if he doesnt listen  you might have to tell him gently that you love him and its his choice but its not something you can handle in the long run so something needs to change  you support him and her being friends but there needs to be boundaries and thats perfectly reasonable
is your brothers girlfriend really hot or something i cant see any other way people would be blind enough to tolerate that kind of entitled behavior or for someone to get away with it this long in life
ding ding ding bingo
yup can attest they can be experts in one field and totally dumb in another  but because theyre treated like god in their specific area of expertise  they think they know best about everything they are equally capable if not more so of mental health stigma
thank you 
omg what theres something for carsickness beyond dramamine
lol alex will be able to find work in a couple years  youre thinking everyone in the would cares as much as people who follow the try guys but they dont and she comes from a privileged position there are plenty who either wont know or wont care she just probably cant work on the youtube entertainment industry for awhile
alex is an attractive woman  speaking as a woman who is not as attractive as alex while you are correct that she is going to face stigma her attractiveness will give her much more cushion in the long run than say if she were an average looking gal attractive people like alex get a lot of benefits all their life just for being good looking and thats not just going to stop because of this her situation is definitely worse than neds but shell probably be able to get back up better than you think
ive started doing this after having consistent germination failure with aerogarden pods totally worth it
same  theyve only ever arrived for me like this and the sponges have often fallen out of the cages
im sorry youre going through this  what were her reasons
dying is part of the process  enjoy it 
yep its not you for sure it was a complaint i saw on here i decided to try for it myself since why not it was in my kit  mine was not very flavorful despite its thriving mint is a powerful grower as well so if you do decide to grow it again in the future it also needs to have the roots trimmed in my experience
the mint in the aerogarden variety isnt very flavorful so that might not be due to the basil 

basil is a thirsty mofo whose roots need to be trimmed as well or it will take over the tank
unless your tap water is very ideal distilled water is best
gasssp charizarrrd and pikachu hopeful comment here d pretty please
oh yes ive done that its also cool seeing peoples personal experiences here so i thought id ask  i decided to buy some alternative brand grow sponges and just re use the plastic cages and domes
hi update it seems to have been a nutrient and watering issue i added an extra capful and have been topping up the basil with water more consistently  the weaker basil has resumed full growing strength and there have been no more deadening leaves d thank you so much for your tips

now to figure out why my italian parseley and sage didnt germinate theyre in a different aero the others did so maybe just unlucky with those two
well the ones in the aerogarden shared by the basil are all dead except for chives they failed to germinate not enough light probably i bought an extra little light and am debating what to grow next to them now
i have my results mostly talked about how to nip above the node i hadnt seen anything defining what those tiny leaves were thank you im having a lot of fun with my first aerogardens i get quite happy just looking at my plants grow and its so nice seeing some green
will that mess up any other plants i grow alongside the basil thanks so much for your responses im learning a lot from them how much more food did you give
thank you i pinched one off worried it was a bud hope it grows back now haha cry
oh thank you i pinched one off worried it was the beginning of a bud do they grow back even if i do that  x whoops
ohhh i see good to know im due to change water in a couple days ill investigate the roots then last time i looked at the roots i investigated them closely  as for your questions yes and yes ag everything 6 pod aerogarden two capfuls every feeding
no bugs at all as far as i can see right now it doesnt seem like light burn due to where the affected leaves are and bc ive seen my light burn the plant lol but im hoping it is because that would be an easy fix one leaf kinda died off which makes me wonder is it is perhaps root rot that seems pretty tricky to solve
murdered a man for killing my dog and trying to steal my car
thank you that is really helpful to know  i didnt know about light burn at all
thank you which size do you get for the aerogarden
ive had a woman refuse my offer to get her something from the store because she wanted cash to buy a specific burrito across the street  wasnt really sure what to think about that 

and yeah ive eaten plain bread by itself bread is delicious
thank you i will look at these places
is this an open offer if so i would love to take you up on it  weve been considering the move but its hard since we dont know any other languages than english would be happy to learn though which makes meeting the requirements a bit difficult
i dont see it at all what section is it under
i love your design if its alright may i please draw it or put it in a drawing of course i will give credit that it is your purse design
but did he apologize for saying such hurtful things and screaming 

you did something wrong unintentionally not contacting him to let him know though that was really understandable in your situation  you apologized his reaction was really really shitty and intentionally disrespectful it didnt matter that you made a mistake first he needs to apologize for what he did or youre going to end up with a guy who doesnt apologize for his shitty behavior 
im really happy for you your relationship sounds like my ideal
what do you think makes you guys so incredibly happy  


im married and i would love for my husband to be able to say something like this about our life together
thanks for getting back to me unfortunately it turns out i had an additional problem on top of that which would not trigger the files to download tried troubleshooting that to go avail  in the end i just uninstalled and reinstalled the game along with the program for the drivers that seemed to work thankfully
hi thanks so much for sharing your solution ive run into a problem steam says two files are missing but then it doesnt do anything to update and redownload the files how do you trigger this my driver is already up to date so thats not the problem
does that dog have enough to eat

boiled crab onry
but but the sheep come back
i look forward to finding them in every region i go to they are my lone friendly face amidst a dangerous world
what a fun video thoughtful picks too thank you so much for sharing

my only real reservation is that of blaidd simply because his va does such an amazing job the va brings such richness depth and warmth to him that i struggle to imagine him sounding like anything or anyone else that kind voice makes you get so attached to him as hes your comrade
there are so many sean beans in elden ring
wait whuhhhh i got some reading to do

fedex lost multiple packages of mine in a row and didnt care opened investigations service center didnt respond worst experience ive ever had and im not the only one i know whos dealt with this would not recommend fedex if you live in an apartment complex
when you hear the noise of the chariot as it stops to turn shoot the rope of the pot have your aim ready so you release the arrow when you hear the noise that should do the trick if you somehow miss the timing with all the pots just reload at the grace
church of elleh hanging out with merchant kale
i love how this is so much like classical illustration beautiful draftsmanship color and composition
the worst part of this for me is that i actually did read the description but silly me i was like well i was reborn okay so maybe its okay for boc because he has a larval tear like the ones im using maybe everyone else just didnt have a larval tear

its my first fromsoft game and im learning to treat everything like murphys law most of the time everybody dies
my husband just asked me yesterday after i mentioned his i didnt know if i wanted to be married to ranni or her consort etc he asked if id marry blaidd and i immediately said yes 100
this is my strat and every time im still fervently muttering to myself please go off in time please go off in time omg please hit aaaaaaa
the stat point went to good use i like progressing in the game being able to cast basic faith spells thanks for the tip though
beautiful work  so emotive an touching  its these artworks that call out to people the ones we can feel
youre not the only one multiple investigations and requests for info to their service center went unanswered when i had my packages stolenmisdelivered multiple times in a row 

they just dont care
raises hand thats my class raised one point of faith just for this
yeah its the same principle with pacing in movies  too much of the same tone and intensity leads to viewers being bored or dulled by the movie theres nothing to create contrast
entitlement isnt necessarily always a bad thing though the word itself has a bad connotation when used  so for instance lets say your partner did something very hurtful but never talked it through with you or helped you heal from it and got mad at you for trying to discuss it a lot of people myself included would start feeling resentful because we feel that is something we deserve and need or as you could say are entitled to 

in this particular case op gets resentful thinking his wife is controlling  when he is mad or angry he gets mad or angry because he wants his wife to make a much effort to spend time with his family as she does with her own and blames her for not doing so and consequentially for him not being able to spend time with his family of origin  thats being entitled in the not good way in this context why does she have to make sure that they spend lots of time with his family when 1 thats not her responsibility in general 2 they dont treat her well 3 his relationship with his family is something he is supposed to maintain not her  if they were reaching out to her to try make plans and she was intentionally not passing that message on to her husband that would be a different matter  even then though they could reach out to the husband and make plans or vice versa 

i hope this makes sense
he doesnt dodge dragon breath very well qq
you winnie the poohed that asshole good for you
its time to become part of a tree
i just really like having wolf doggos my good bois
looks like your gf had a good reason and was being a good person to help someone in need shes someone you can be proud of  not everyone does that for someone else
yeah thats my wishful hope too
if i had found the twinblade earlier in the game instead of missing that early cave i would be rocking twinblades and not katanas for sure
oh that sounds way cooler than how i did it haha  ill have to look up that weapon now sounds sick
how did you end up beating him i love hearing how people handle bosses because there are so many different approaches and playstyles its great 

and most importantly congratulations on your son
this made me laugh so good
this made me smile  let me solo her uses bleed and frost too and of course insane amounts of skill
you mastered the hardest boss of all the character creation
i havent been able to get the actual ash of war just the ability on the claws weapon but thats pretty much what i use it for all the time zoom zoom zoom
dont worry fedex doesnt care youll be lucky if your package even shows up
im completely with you here  
ordered a very expensive package it doesnt show up the day it is said to be delivered a few days later someone leaves the trash from my package at my backdoor they open an investigation claim to call me back absolutely nothing happens including the call back and the guy in charge of the investigation refusing to take my calls

i get a replacement shipped they say it arrived yesterday only its nowhere to be found so now i have to go through this all over again and my leasing office probably thinks im crazy cranky not knowing i have lost almost 1k in merchandise yes i left specific instructions on how to to deliver with the customer service people and on a fedex account nothing worked
i still dont understand what is happening with that anatomy even after seeing miquellas image so many times

oh thanks thats really good to know first time playing a from software game so its been a fun learning curve

 why did i get downvoted for asking for advice lol
um how do i kill these i have 6 faith at level 72 so no healing incantations for me is it worth leveling faith though im a focused dexint hybrid
i felt bad for killing the sofria rivers one it was so pretty and it was already dead then i brought it back just to kill it lol
i understand
thank you for your service to the greater good   7
the one i saw was in the black knife catacombs it was helpful and kept me on my guard
was your sign about crabs i saw one very similar if not the same recently
some people care about the status of a diamond  read a post awhile back about a mans fiance asking him to keep the fact the ring is a mossanite secret  not saying whether its right or wrong just some people do care
i want to order one  haha

edit amazing work
thanks for sharing
thank you
what system is op playing on looks gorgeous
my husband and i were giving each other crap he said well you have double the time and further than you are  and i told him my goal isnt to beat the game the fastest its to explore and enjoy everything
im still fairly new to the game so im in excited awe of this video  what is that weapon and how did he get sleep into that godskin apostle

i love this game theres so many ways to do things its amazing
what a kind benevolent soul
ah yes that goes well with dinosaurs being the test of the devil
mm golden chicken foot
yeah when he put on his dragon arm i thought dude how are you going to fit through the doors of your own castle
thanks for this and everyone else participating im still piecing things together lorewise
i was just thinking the other day how i always go to the church of elleh to chill sell farm and generally relax that and chat to kale because hes nice
godrick keeps saying hes the lord of all that is golden and im like what is the deal with that
sweet ill be looking out for your clips then i loved the cross naginata when i was using it polearms are fun  im on the radagons wolf rn   which will force me to learn how to dodge ha i get two shotted by this guy and shields cant save me like they did with godrick
ill keep an eye out for reduvia were you dual wielding hero reduvias im doing my best to explore as much as possible and find hidden things even even actively looking its so easy to miss whats the offhand you used to apply scarlet rot 

thanks for the super helpful info regarding daggers its really good to know i should definitely try them out sometime i played with a cross naginata with inverted red hawk heater shield for a little bit and have swapped that out with the uchigana because lighter and faster though the cross naginata was really fun still using same shield ill keep in mind to find a good blunt weapon to keep around in case of  

yay for finding a new playstyle you love your new build sounds super satisfying and probably looks badass its great for the game lets you respec if you want to change things up
thanks and yeah youre right godrick does seem easier than magrit no offense taken magrit is harrrrrd

thats cool what was your bleed build around right now im concentrating on dexint and thinking of upping my arcane while trying not to be squishy how are you liking your new buildplaystyle

hope these arent too many questions its just fun learning about others experience and adventure
oh im fighting godrick right now went exploring through a lot of caelid cant get that needle guy though ugh and made some trips to greyolls barrows before then i had godrick down to the last sliver of hp and took a hit thinking i was dead turns out i wasnt and i stood there waiting to die instead of getting that final hit in   so im currently trying to kill him still with varying results im still very much working on my ability to dodge and hit strategically im not very good but im still having a lot of fun

edit just beat godrick bleed is 
congratulations d
thanks for this post as a newcomer to from softwares games this was very positive and encouraging
oh speaking as someone who never played a game from this studio before my logic was if i make these other stats higher then ill kill stuff before it can hurt me and adjust accordingly on the way took me far too long to realize vigor is important and im a little screwed since i only started leveling it very late the softcap is real
had a similar experience where a guy stood up and said evolution is obviously not real it makes no sense absolutely dumbfounded the room 

same guy thought a childrens book about a child enjoying imaginary friends was a clear and disturbing sign the kid had mental illness
love this 
having a job gives a sense or purpose and routine and the ability to self sustain it also helps us relate to other people the truth is people also generally respect someone more if they know they have a job being aimless with no sense of results makes people unhappy this doesnt mean all jobs are good and that people should stay in a job that makes them miserable if they dont have to
the power of product design
my mom once bought a bottle of wine and didnt tell her friends how much it cost they thought it was pretty good until they found out it was like 12 bucks then they started finding problems with it hahaha
no need to be afraid just let them know gently how much time and effort goes into making those lunches and that you werent able to prepare that much food and be able to perform your own job well then offer to give them recipe if they would like to try make it themselves they would have to be a whole different level of entitled to demand you make them something they themselves are not willing to do
 sounds like they had blood work done which is a responsible thing to do to ensure there will be no dangers or complications during the neutering  while doing it without blood work is an option and its clear theyre not in the best financial situation im not making a judgment on the situation as a whole in this comment  just wanted to explain why a neutering could cost 500
perfectly put
this is such a great photo of you guys you look absolutely happy you guys are a beautiful couple that looks like they have fun every day
seems like op wanted to invite discussion to see what he wasnt getting or understanding about brandon sandersons books to see why theyre so popular nothing wrong with that sometimes im able to appreciate or understand something i didnt like before by asking what others like about it
my husband and i dont like his books either  we dont find the writing or plots of his books able to sustain our interests for long we can get past unsophisticated writing i mean we loved ready player one for its heart the writing is not very good haha i know hes really popular but i just dont like his work not that i could write a book myself so youre not alone

edit want to add that this is a matter of personal taste and i respect sandersons work ethic and ability to produce as well as bring happiness to many people through his books
you guys look happy and fabulous beautiful family i love your sunglasses

plastic surgery can do a lot though i mean if you were a person with regular features you could essentially transform yourself assuming you had the resources and a doctor willing to do that for you you can be ugly and become pretty through plastic surgery assuming there wasnt some greater complication
yep
the sil accusing your wife of trying to intentionally outdo her is such a clear sign that she got the barbie as a way of trying to one up your wife to begin with because frankly if she really was just into collecting the barbies for the sake of collecting the barbies why wouldnt she just be happy for her sister getting such a rare and cool item

youre totally nta and its pretty clear why the sister was able to continue with such toxic behavior towards her own sibling personally i would not apologize neither you or her or the barbies are at fault the sister was being a toxic dick and starting a fight in the first place i hope your wife can see she is not to blame and be able to move forward and enjoy her dolls again

no amount of anger justifies treating your partner like that or treating them like shit its understandable he was angry but that in no way excuses his actions ever theres a difference he should not ever think it is acceptable or okay to take out his anger on you
so much agreement on everything youve said its the sad state of our society and the world that we often think its not our problem or so what what can we do about it even if it makes us uncomfortable its good to at least be aware and admit if were not doing everything we can and in an ideal world do what we can versus justifying it as the norm appreciate you op
you worded why that phrase is so frustrating meaningless and borderline insulting so succinctly something which i have never been able to articulate i remember going to people for help being told they would call me back and getting a text with those useless words  those words and those people now instinctively incite disgust

it is one thing to offer comfort and another to mouth meaningless words
lots of mothers dont want to think their son is bad or wrong when theyre the apple of their eye  its easier to dismiss and deny or justify  good on you for not allowing your son to disrespect women
thank you op for standing up for whats the right thing to do regardless of personal bias or pressure  thats really admirable and if only there were more people like you
wow yeah  that kind of cavalier attitude and refusal to look at oneself when being alerted to the inappropriate behavior is scary and runs deep
this list made me realize how much of my life has ben impacted by mental illness lately ive been really sad and unhappy over how my life has become as a result of choices and decisions from when i was younger
i love goog games
whats the game next to doom with the little cartoon character looks really cool i want to try it out
if you dont mind me asking what was the final straw that made you leave  and how did you prepare yourself for it
true and there are also people that are selectively toxic like theyre only toxic bullies to certain people but great to others too 
you did good  sometimes the right thing to do is not always the most comfortable or easy thing to do but you did it
what happened with those relatives afterwards was it ever something you addressed with them
thank you for your post its written so well and concisely as well as spreading truth to fight a very common and dangerous misconception
thats what we call survivor bias though im sure your therapist is very good
this is not true im sorry to say  abusers can be master manipulators
welcome to bug citizen where there happen to be a lot of stars the game starts feeling better once the player starts living around the bugs unfortunately

just curious how did you guys hit it off so well thats a lovely meet cute
sadly if this bill passes i could see a lot of big companies just shutting down their la office to get around this and end up outsourcing more 


35 hours isnt going to work unless that becomes the established new full time hours with benefits and pay that is matched to be equivalent of 40 hours  because its already hard enough to live in a high cost of living area even with a partner  very much so if youre single
thanks for doing that its a sad world when what you did is the exception and not the rule most people just do nothing because they dont want to get involved makes me sick to my stomach
what differentiates an argument from a fight for you

sorry for misunderstanding the way the food was splayed out required more force than from a crow

edit lol it would be pretty funny seeing a crow carry a double meat bacon burger wrapped in foil though
yup  i can guarantee you we were not rude or impatient or in any way disagreeable 

people around here keep their dogs on a leash are pretty well behaved and weve never had that problem when people dropped bags off on front  

lol pretty brazen and touchy to just call someone psychopathic like that
he just was confusing  wouldnt tell me what street hes on just that he was there and he wasnt then all of a sudden he was saying that he was at cvs and suddenly thats the right address i was pretty to the point i told him the cross streets the apartment was at we are on the ground floor 

later he was like im at the entrance to the apartment building i pointed out there are multiple entrances could he please come to the cross streets i mentioned  it was lilt trying to pull teeth
they are its a sentence long  cant get much more direct than that
it was the address listed he refused to look for the apartment number
thanks for letting me know what its like for you guys on the other side of the fence 

funnily enough my post got downvoted though i dont think i said anything wrong or out of line
one time my husband went scrambling to find a driver only to find that the guy ripped open the sealed bags stole a burger and dumped the rest on the ground he had to sweep up all the fries

the guy could have at least said he preferred text but when i kept asking he said nothing and just kept not picking up  thats rude

edit thank you for the advice though i will look into doing that next time
im sorry i didnt bookmark it and have no idea how to find it  it has remained in my memories because as you said it is an interesting story  i really espect how she took her own life back into her hands
lol i remember a reddit story about a woman whose husband ignored her repeated requests to deal with an issue his mom being offensive for years  finally she gave up got her ducks lined up in a row and told him she wanted a divorce she wrote her husband was like  when his brother got married and wouldnt take any of their mothers crap towards his new wife the husband came crawling back to her doorstep years later but it was too late this stuff can eat away at the foundation of a marriage
oh i completely agree that one should ask them to pay due damages  its just that making someone pay is hard as bad people will just refuse
would she even have paid  its impossible to get people to pay up sometimes unless you bring them to court
oh yes so much yes here
aw i couldnt stay awake through the first three episodes the changes were pretty terrible and it slogged was hoping it would get better but had my doubts based on the major changes already made looks like my hope is in vain super appreciate this post though op was good to read

wow i didnt realize a 7 out of 10 was extremely ugly  that seems more like average to above average
wow i dated a guy like that when i was young  didnt realize how much i was being undervalued and disrespected and what an asshole he was  youre worth so much more than some stupid blow job quota he shouldnt have even been thinking this much less planning it  you can definitely find someone better who will think it sun shines out of your ass which is how it should be  not this
lol blizzard such a lying morally bankrupt company  should have been punished more for hong kong as well
thats not the case if he misses her enough to hang out against the fact she any that guy wronged you
instead of forgive i would understand moving on with her life despite it  but her fathers actions do not deserve forgiveness not at all  thats rot in hell worthy what he did  thanks for being one of the good guys
thanks ill definitely give these a read when i have a moment  always appreciate learning new things and what surrounds them
abuse isnt a mutual dynamic there is such a thing as reactive abuse or a couple that lack conflict resolution skills if someone is truly abusive theres a power dynamic as you said with one in the position then couples therapy and even individual therapy is a bad idea  because they tend to manipulate the therapists either way and the therapists only ends up teaching the abuser how to mask or justify their behaviors
i agree with you and its so awesome you and your husband have reached that place thats super impressive and i hope to have that kind of tenacious love my impression of ops post was more describing situations where youre being taken for granted like my ex who waffled about being with me through his actions and words from the start if i had more self esteem i would have walked away instead of jumping through hoops for someone who could just not feel that way about me
lol i had a roommate where if she likes you then shes just a social beam of sunshine with great morals but i dont believe kindness is a situational thing and she definitely makes it so  she reads self help books but was one of the most selfish people i ever dealt with but justified it with modern self love language
survivor bias i know people who got it and dont think its that bad and went around doing whatever because they already got it
i havehad an ex with a small penis incessant lame crowing is a pretty great description hahaha
thank you so much for validating the observation of how people retreat into unhealthy family dynamics of fear it is so frustrating
definite power play  good for you  dont text him  unless maybe to break up because that shit is unacceptable
im sorry i hope things feel better soon
yeah when i get the turn the other cheek argument i use the fact that all it really does is make you a doormat and the sad fact of life is that oftentimes respect has to be enforced sometimes it is only earned through enforcement  like would everyone obey the laws if there were no police you teach people how to treat you
you seem like a good husband and your wife sounds like shes very strong person esp in light of overcoming everything
thank you for saying everything you did out loud here op its so true  too many people want to avert their eyes because its uncomfortable for them to deal with it even want to admit so they blame the person standing up for themselves  its wrong along with the fact that too often people dont hold other people accountable if theyre friends or its not happening to them  i applaud your integrity
its good she has you and its a nice narrative to help bring a sense of closure frankly in short what im saying is that she might have dodged a bullet and a bunch of other potential issues instead like what if he favored the other children blatantly over her  or was a half hearted presence it is better to not have that contact than to develop a greater host of issues  i understand where your wife is coming from however
oh for sure i know someone who only contacted her bio mother for health history reasons other than that she was perfectly content with her adoptive family it does seem to not be the norm though and for the situation i described to be far more common whether the children are adopted or not
i get the logic truly its just that ive seen so many people blind and clinging into to toxic family dynamics and traits because their brain cant objectively deal with the fact they might be directly descended from an asshole
this is a grass is greener on the other side scenario
its sad how we as humans have such an ingrained desire to be loved by our bio parents even if their not in our lives at all  honestly gives people too much power to fuck us up more than they should have also contributes to unhealthy idealuzation and toxic family patterns
yeah murakami really has a thing for ears
generally its polite that if youre the one canceling that you make the effort to reschedule the event you canceled if not youre kind of sending the message that youre not that interested in the event happening
that is so fucked up the inlaws and lily not you guys
yeah thats the logic and maturity of an asshole
pp
it may not be that the partner isnt willing to support it would be hard for anyone to support someone if they were to obsessively only think and talk about this while derailing their lives by not working financial strain is hard and being the only support system  partners are there to support but theyre also not therapists who are trained to deal with trauma  both parties deserve some compassion because trauma is difficult to navigate through
im having a hard time explaining to one of my friends that no matter how much better off someone else might be  you cant keep asking them to loangive you money
sounds like youre describing a person assistant  doesnt seem like a bad problem i know someone whose boss just has to text her and shes the one scrambling to get the right people on the phone  for the restaurant reservation and specific table  for the plane tickets  dealing with healthcare buying groceries  driving all over town basically you have someone doing your grunt work
huh i understand that feeling am not rich  but if i died there are def people i dont want my stuff going to
if you dont mind me asking what were those 4 years like  has it affected how your feeling and how you see her permanently at all
if you dont mind me asking  what mindset did you have going in when you started reading the book  like where were you in terms of self awareness 

i feel like the abusers in my life wouldnt even be able to grasp that the behaviors describe them to a tee theyd just blame it on something i did or find a way to make it about me
not entering  just saying its really cool youre doing this props to you  generous human
aw i love that story and that photo  you two seem so happy and content
i know someone who had a third kid by accident despite having an iud forget exactly what happened but that kid was not intended for
yeah  you cant rely on someone like that who is so selfish and self absorbed that they throw a temper tantrum literally endanger your life  and only offer to help if you pay them in pounds of flesh  fuck that  fuck him  good for you  i admire your strength
oh hitachi wand i highly recommend
i understand what youre saying  i just dont think thats a good enough reason  there are other games and means to keep in touch with people you encounter through games  and yes  i used to play mmorpgs so i get the lonely factor and the appeal
 therapy for life mental healthcare is expensive so i can roll with that
as a huge totoro fan  i am in love with your work lucky son
ops friend has been reprimanded before though  and even in that case threw her relationship around with op too it doesnt seem surprising
it can be pretty hard and quite expensive to go cruelty or carbon free for your everyday necessities 
ultimately  games are not a necessity i do agree we should be careful of judging but as a general rule  if anything we need to at least be judging when it comes the treatment of other humans and a persons response to it  cruelty and discrimination to a person due to their face is wrong as well as for their gender identity or sex people literally being treated as objects and securely harassed is wrong  and people who stand by say and do nothing side with the abuser because theyre essentially saying they dont see anything wrong we should be encouraging people to care and make change where they can  not putting them down for it
lol how is giving a monthly subscription to wow different talk about heavy denial
thats disturbing  i had an ex who would say and believe things like that  which is why hes an ex now  your bf having that view is a good indicator of his values he sounds rather entitled and tit for tat which is unhealthy for a partnership
honestly family loyalty may mean that ops husband may not ever do anything or really care ultimately ops husband is siding with an abuser enabling and supporting toxic behavior enablers lie to themselves to justify their own weakness
please dont be rude to pap smears  those serve an important function towards womens health
i had a weird reaction to getting a compliment from an acquaintances bf that to this day i still dont understand  as i have no romantic interest in him and just see him as a super nice guy hes the kind that builds people up   im pretty sure its because i never received compliments from anyone other than my sos i tucked my hair back after receiving a compliment and to this day i cringe because why

it was already upsetting seeing a lot of employees and peoples responses to the hong kong incident  my faith in humanity was so low  i didnt think people were going to care with this lawsuit  im glad people did
your post is lovely  the thing that worries me though about her going to counseling with an emotional abuser is that they tend to manipulate the counselor and can do even more damage  its truly a hard situation
its frustrating when people idealized their friends without acknowledging the harm they are doing to others bias is real
thats really sad has this affected your relationship with him
his friends are good people to look out for your wellbeing like that
oh the biggest shitbags are often the ones best at hiding it
this would be expecting too much of people sometimes people genuinely dont care or they really just listen to the first version of the story they heard or nobody really knows and its just a mishmosh of things where people throw their hands up and say who knows what happened and by the time things get cleared up so much time has passed they just think well it doesnt matter anymore people also create their own versions based on the perception they have on someone sadly all we can do sometimes is know the truth ourselves and surround ourselves with people who support us and do the right thing just because it is the right thing 
oh it would definitely take a massive movement and thats why every single person counts because thats one little bit closer to getting the movement to be massive
its the power we have as consumers and one of only ways we as consumers can hold them accountable and create consequences youre correct in that there are other ways to create awareness as well  however this way shouldnt be discounted either
im so sorry your mutual friend was a horrible person like that
thats not healthy behavior for a friend and it definitely would be in your and ultimately his best interest not to enable it

hi may i please also have the link to the website with all the chapters for drifting dragon  i came late to the thread thank you so much 
im curious what was your take on hong kong what made this the thing that caused you to quit  no judgment here  just wondering what was it that led to the finality of your decision
im sorry youre going through this nobody deserves to live on eggshells
when you say biding his time  do you mean you think hes only staying until the time or opportunity is right
so true controlling people dont see themselves as controlling or the fact that theyre really only thinking of themselves they see it as youre wrong im right
unfortunately i was thinking  man why are there so many shitty horrible people in the world and how do they keep on getting to to be that way  im not that surprised the someone could be that horrible people can be truly selfish and cruel
airbnb customer service has turned into absolute garbage and i say this from experience  they could care less how your life is affected and they dont give a shit from over there in india i literally had the person in charge of my case ignore me for hours while i scrambled to find another place to stay as the place i had planned for canceled the night before and i couldnt stay longer where i was  the only reason i got any help at all was because i called so many times i finally found someone who did give a shit  hours later  and got my case transferred to them fuck you airbnb

im sorry  i totally get the breakdown thing and the hopelessness and the despair  i really hope something is available in time for your party  and again  fuck airbnb theyre just assholes
speak kindly and nicely  she may not realize things have been weighing on you conscious communication is a must  hey petname i love that youre working hard at school  im just starting to feel worn out from work and all the housework i do  it would really help if we could divvy up the chores as its starting to feel like too much and take it from there  she might fall back into old habits because this has been the way its been for so long but just remindpromptappreciate it and over time shell form new habits that will re establish and improve the work distribution

thinking your partner is a bad person with bad intentions is never a good way to go into a discussion
please dont
yes  a lot of people love him but there are also a lot of people who dont and just because his books are good did what they are  doesnt mean hed be a good fit for continuing grrms legacy
the creative process isnt always a simple straightforward one hes mentioned how taking time to live and do other things helps his creative process  and i can very much believe that would you rather he rush it  and probably create something that neither he or the fans would be happy with   even if he never finishes the book series  we can still be grateful and happy that he created the world that he has for us to enjoy and everything that has come from it its rather entitled imo to denounce his side projects as its still his life and he had the right to make it as fulfilling as possible for himself and there are lots of people who do enjoy those side projects  a lot of people havent created and contributed content like he has that is enjoyed on such a great scale yet they are so quick to cast stones saying they are owed more

aw looking through all your photos  truly heartwarming such a cute couple wishing you all the best

youd be surprised at how conflict avoidant people can be or how manipulative
yep 

my husband and i really dislike his best friends wife  i loathe her at this point because she treats me as less than a person and because of how shes treated us and more or less prevents us from ever seeing him not to mention tries to use us when convenient  but its not our place  not when they got married and not now after they have two kids  to say anything
lol reminds me of a girl in college who hated me for having the same last name and for wearing shorts i had no idea i didnt even know her at all until a mutual friend told me 

turns out that girl also had major insecurities about being short and not skinny i was tall and slender

oh my god i dated one  and over time i just kept feeling he was more and more of an ass one big issue was that i told him i felt stigmatized by how he was treating me as i had been misdiagnosed at the time with bipolar disorder multiple doctors afterwards questioned this diagnosis and i am doing much better now he just brushed me off and told me im just trying to make you better its laughable remembering the times he told me i was being manic just because i was happy  over time i realized this lack of empathy applied to everything and he only did things or cooperated because it appealed to him  but did not care about what was best for me or my feelings at any time
hello first off all  thank you  thank you for not supporting an abuser just because its easy or due to some fucked up loyalty it means so so much too often the mans friends and family side with the abuser enabling and strengthening it   and cause the victim to think even more is it just me  whats wrong with me 

as everyone else said  approach only the wife for now  let her know she can go to you guys and that youre both theyre for her  that youre safe and support her  to better know how to support her  reading lundy bancrofts book is a great resource because it has a section for friends and family on how to best support an abuse victim and understanding what theyre going through  it will also give you greater understanding  should you read the rest of the book  on why being abused is so absolutely mind fucking some things to start off with dont push or tell her to leave him that will only make her feel more cornered and judged she needs to decide that for herself otherwise its just more pressure validate her and her feelings  and give your support  time  and care
good for you for not supporting family in their wrongdoing and for supporting the people who genuinely need it and are victims of the wrongdoing

tell and support the sister in law you love throughout this find a new job  the rest of your family may choose to support your brother instead  dont accept shitty toxic family members and dynamics
please understand everything in about to say is for your safety and mental well being 
 do not go to couples counseling do not recommend individual therapy for him it usually makes them worse  get individual therapy for yourself please read lundy bancrofts books they will help you through this confusing and difficult time  in understanding what is happening to you hopefully these things will help you gain clarity and help empower you to do what is best for you and your child
while therapy can be an amazing tool  it has been unfortunately overglorified a couple reasons being there are so many bad therapistsmatches and can easily become a yes man situation in regards to abuse different kinds of therapies are built on specific foundations and whats not commonly known is that couples therapy is based off the belief there is a mutual dynamic  but abuse is not a mutual dynamic and therefore it makes things worse on top of just outright failing for abusive relationships

i had a friend once in school  i started attending the same college  i invited her to go to a workshop together  people said hello and came up to talk to me 

afterwards she messaged me on aim to say that nobody liked me and they were only talking to me to be polite  and that i should quit bothering people she did a lot of fucked up things before and after  but it was when my roommate said this person isnt your friend after seeing the messages  i realized it wasnt me who was the problem 

shes very good at putting up a persona she would brag to me all the time about how people adored her cutesy self im not exaggerating and she has lots of friends  i dont  but at least im not a mean manipulative asshole
another thing to take into regard though is the fact that it sounds like the wifes family treats op well so its not a drag or a pain in the ass for him to be around her family in fact it sounds like he appreciates them a lot for the wife its probably like getting teeth pulled bring around his family because of the mutual dislike
thank you  perhaps you should consider focusing on gratitude as well as look at things from your wifes point of view  really understanding and being supporting  can go a long way your resentment creates the blaming negative thoughts shes controlling etc due to for lack of better words feelings of entitlement it skews things and will poison your marriage if you let it  dont let it do that
if youre family doesnt like your wife much and are only cordial towards her she can feel that nobody likes being surrounded by people who they feel at best tolerate them with the most basic level of politeness and im only guessing that this is the situation realistically its probably worse and runs deeper than this it really sucks its not very realistic of you to expect her to try build a relationship with people that dont return the effort or arent willing to put that effort in themselves and please try to avoid idealizing your family in this situation your wife is setting healthy boundaries for herself you wanting to force a relationship without in regards to her feelings is selfish you might be able to create a compromise like maybe you see them together for certain holidays or visit x amount of times in so many months you yourself say that your wife gets along with a lot of other people and is a great partner she should be your priority you are responsible for talking and maintaining relationships with your own family in a way that doesnt damage or harm your marriage and thats not something you can put on your wife

wow thats just astoundingly rude and inconsiderate my dog is leash reactive and as a result i try to keep him away from other dogs unless theyve received full disclosure and are okay with him being near respect for each other is what keeps everyone safe i almost cried from gratitude when an apartment building neighbor actually offered to help train my dog to become less leash reactive with their pitbull

hes not over her even with you around and its not going to work out with the way things are maybe one day in the future after you two have had time and space apart however right now he doesnt and cant fully appreciate you while hes hung up on someone else i say this as someone who has been in both your and his situation that it is definitely healthier for you to move on
i never got the sense of judgment seems more factual in describing their lifestyle differences im sorry that happened to you  uextrausername
look up the 5 love languages and figure out which ones apply to your girlfriend that might be a helpful way to start and to get ideas the other thing is that being romantic takes effort so please dont beat yourself up over not being naturally good at it all the time just start putting in the effort that alone counts for a lot
the more she gives in to her irritation and rage the more shell get used to handling things that way and it just goes downhill from there unless she seeks help or proactively tries to change that you guys will want to deal with it before it progresses further and becomes more ingrained

there are therapists who do sliding scale
thank you for being an advocate of the right thing versus the i dont want to deal with anything unpleasant even if its the truth thing
it makes me so mad how people who catch it and get off with light symptoms dismiss the severity of whats happening and this disease  rather than realizing just how bloody lucky they were
wow uh was that person ever your friend i cant imagine saying that to anyone i respect on a baseline level of human there are people i hate and i wouldnt say that to them
hmm kept saying we were friends but would badmouth me to other people  when i got into her dream school because the vice president of admissions vouched for me  she wasnt happy for me  just sullenly remarked i got lucky and my department is easy to get into proceeded to neg me online through chat and tell me other people didnt like me at school  that they were annoyed when i said hi to them which is weird  because those people said hi to me first by coming over to greet me my so at the time and now good friend told me that she clearly wasnt a friend and to not talk to her 

same person proceeded to call me crying and apologize years later only to pull similarly disrespectful shit called her out on it when i finally got upset  she denied it and got mad and proceeded to block me on everything  i feel better and dont care  she still gets hung up and does her best to badmouth me our mutual friend it doesnt work
but the chain shows that it existed and thus you are not an idiot but a champion of communication
omg hahaha thanks for explaining  i should edit and fix that  thanks whenever i late night cell phone reddit theres always some kind of goofy error i make
hmm  how is this self hatred sorry  i dont quite understand  his wife has made it pretty clear she wants nothing to do with me  and it got to the point where me continuing to try was just becoming toxic  so we are both happier not seeing each other at this point  though i am sad for my husband sometimes people dont vibe and thats just life
i feel bad because this is like what happened to my husband  his best friends wife hates me and shows it in all the passive aggressive  micro aggression ways possible while trying to look good on front of others  i still kept tring to set up things so our husbands could spend time  but she would never follow through or return calls  she only picked up calls if i started calling her husband needless to say after four years of her shit i hate her at this point they have made zero effort to see us and we see them 01 times a year her husband has started to treat me weird too which is sad because he used to be a genuinely nice guy
respectfully may i please ask how you differentiate between a boundary and an ultimatum ive been doing my best to discern the difference in some situations and i would love to get insight in how to clearly know when stating a boundary versus an ultimatum
if he found you beautiful he would have said that to you what he said was uncaring and cruel  why  because he doesnt care about how it makes you feel
i love your haircut
your calico is very beautiful
cat spit face cream
hahaha
your husband needs to shut him down its disrespectful and rude you tried it your husbands way and it didnt improve at this point youve given don enough chances and if you dont want to ever see him again thats absolutely your right its messed up that your husband allowed don to go on as long as he has
good for you for standing up for your wife more men could follow your example instead of pardoning their families for being disrespectful jerks just because they are family

you havent gone too far
if hes bad in couples counseling because hes abusive  individual will only make it worse as well
oh i admire your husband for being able to recognize his family might not be good people
thank you

being family doesnt give you a free pass to be toxic abusive or enable abuse which falls under being toxic
i love himz he is bootifuls
one of the problems is that society now thinks therapy is a cureall while it is a powerful tool its success is still depending on various things and individual therapy does not work with abusers it usually just makes them worse the last thing you should be doing is asking her to go to couples therapy or individual therapy she needs a batterers program   


i recommend you read lundy bancrofts book why does he do that it applies to both men and women call the domestic violence  hotline for resources and seek proper individual therapy for yourself it may help inform and bolster you to gain the strength you need to leave

  
feel free to dm or anything if you just need to talk
hes a great example ive only ever read people saying nice things about him and how hes really sweet
i dig it
im just guessing at why maybe the actor didnt want to be credited because its not like he knew that was how vader would turn out to be in the final film completely hypothetical guesswork on my part or maybe it was to keep vader more mysterious who knows
thank you for loving that caring and fighting for that beautiful pupper the way you do i hope he fully recovers soon 3 he looks like hes getting his pep back
yes but he probably didnt know that it would be a loved villain versus like the hatred jar jar binks received not for being evil but annoying still though there are many people who play unlikable characters and get harassed for it
very cute proportions i love the face and its little fuzz mane bravo
what you can do is offer your support so she knows that its there and no judgment offer her a safe place acknowledge that its her business and youre a stranger but that if she ever needs anything or even just a friend to listen that you can be that person do this in a friendly and kind way not a you gotta get out of there and im going to help you way and wont have romantic expectations or motives then give her space at those events wave smile act normal she will probably not accept immediately and possibly might not ever take you up on it but one day she will probably appreciate it even if she doesnt talk to you again
you have good family my aunt would demand a good chunk of the money haha
while what youre saying might be true  ive been in the position and seen others where the woman in question was in a long term relationship even married but would act inappropriately  much to the denial of the persons and my so while when being described from an outside view  it would be more plain to see  i do believe in male and female friendships but that kind of situation is more common than you would think because people get weird and proprietary although its possible the girlfriend could be reading into things too much  it still isnt outside the realm of possibility
actually  people can be very blind to what they dont want to see  the way he speaks reminds me of people who when given concrete examples would just brush them off and say its not a big deal or not what theyre thinking people dont want to believe when its inconvenient to them true  theyre nineteen but we dont know enough about the situation
hi  you sound like me from younger years  

we pick the partners we think we deserve  you clearly dont think you deserve him  and find it more easy to believe his friends and family but the truth is that you chose him and he chose you  it would be better to take confidence and faith in the fact that he chose to defend you from his family and friends  and didnt allow them to disrespect you value yourself more or a lot of people in life will find a way to make you think youre below them  when youre not
this is great advice  my main worry is that someone who has gone deep into irrational behavior may not be able to get out of it by regular means but i hope for op and his familys sake that his wife can he gently persuaded to reach understanding
yup i have a ba and honestly i cant hack the food industry im just not suited to it at all but i can say im much better at my own job  even though it pays way more than fast food min wage so much respect to food industry workers
honestly he may have good intentions in his mind  and really think its not going to be a problem  but what people say and what they actually do is different a lot of people dont understand themselves well enough to realize the full weight of what theyre saying 

even if hes not controlling or abusive its entirely possible he may lose respect over time and even resent you  he may not view you as much as an equal because its his money at the end of the day and youre not his wife  he has the power to take everything away you might also start feeling like you cant say no because if you do  itll affect his goodwill towards you 

dont give up the power of your independence and ability to maintain your own life
you love the way she treats you but you dont love her  let her go instead of keeping her around for your own comfort she deserves someone who wants her for who she is
honestly families dont hold each other accountable enough for the sake of family which is bullshit  

do what is best for you its hard facing pressure from other members but thats what it is pressure its more about them than you  theyre not entitled to tell you what to do either decision you make is understandable
omg hes a cutie
husband and wife  definitely  outside of that  youd have to know yourself well enough to know if you are able to do that  same goes for the other person it may be possible but its not a given
trying to support someone who is in an abusive relationship of any kind is tricky because abuse is such a complicated mind fuck for that person please read lundy bancrofts book why does he do that there is a section on how to support someone in an abusive relationship  one of the most pivotal things is not to push for her to make a decision but continue to validate her when shes confused about how shes being treated pushing or or telling her to leave is similar to what the abuser does  which is make decisions for her i know that is totally not what youre doing and that she should leave this is just the psychology of it it may also make her feel more isolated and misunderstood  keep reminding her that she deserves to be treated and loved well  that she deserves more than what shes getting and that its not wrong of her to want those things  and that how shes being treated is unacceptable offer her a safe place to go if she needs to leave
just wanted to say to please be compassionate towards yourself when looking at your past and the decisions you made its entirely possible that regardless of how long you spent dating that the outcome could have been the same because abusers are notorious for hiding their nature until the relationship reaches a certain level of commitment or maybe it would have taken you longer to realize hes abusive because he was not as abusive  for so long

its so incredibly awesome and strong of you to have gone on that journey and survived  
dont help him 

a part of you cares about him because you loved him and are a good person but dont allow yourself to be taken advantage of and made a fool by this horrible  horrible man
keep going as someone who does art for their living one of the most important things ive learned is to keep going and i love your mable

wowww it looks wonderful which recipe did you use also what was your trick to not getting a soggy bottom beautiful job
perhaps thinking of it this way may help your resolve  do you want your daughter to end up with a man like him  do you want her to grow up stressed  and thinking that being treated terribly is acceptable are you okay with the possibility of her acting and turning out like her father because she thinks what he does is normal i have seen a whole brood of children in their adulthood from a divorced couple manifest horrible behaviors because they never had a good role model if that can happen  imagine what could happen if she lives with him everyday if you are having a hard time doing it for yourself do it for your daughter  and know that you can find a better man out there one day when the time comes
the fact that he treats only his brother like this and no one else signifies that what ops husband is doing falls under the definition of abuse and is very typical of abusers thats why abusers get enabled and given passes so much other people dont have it happen to them so they think the victim is at fault or there must be good reason when in truth abuse is unacceptable by matter the reason it is unacceptable and shows how ops husvand believes that abuse is justifiable if he feels a certain way like towards his brother that attitude only gets worse if not dealt with he has a power dynamic over his brother right now that he is misusing he will have a power dynamic over his children the potential for him to abuse exists which is a problem

abuse is abuse ucursethewind has the right idea and frankly  has the attitude of someone who truly understands what abuse is and how it works
sooooooo cute
sharing a house with the neverending man 15 years at studio ghibli

your description of alfie is very apt the other thing about alfie is that it is too disadvantageous to not make a deal with him that is alfies strength

i was reading a book on a man who worked with miyazaki excellent highly recommend in it he describes japanese business culture in that the japanese think it is more important to know what it is the other party really wants rather than believing the words they stick in a contract seems to also apply to alfie
so true  rather than becoming adults who think its okay to continually pressure people to get what they want
it automatically proves that he can get someone better for him
honestly it seems anything with a bad ending is pretty much ruined  great story  bad ending leaves people much more dissatisfied than with middling story  awesome ending iswhat ive generally noticed

while the tv series decided to do the books ending or something like that  they say   game of thrones didnt lead up or prepare viewers for it properly  result bad ending  and what was once a pop culture phenomenon has been completely wiped out
im not a psychologist so this is all conjecture i would guess its that and wanting to be loved the parent child bond is generally such a strong one that i think its hard for a child to realize that their parent may not actually love them the way they want them to and its hard to let go
actually  children of abusive parents might have a harder time letting go even more so than the regular child parent bond  children cling onto inconsistent parents more due to trauma bonding  its horrible but true
theyre not asking op to take it  theyre asking op understand that his wife doesnt like her previous partners more what shes describing in her posts about them is literally a trauma response  and the way shes handling things excessively is a result of that trauma  not a reflection of how she feels about him
hi i know losing weight is super difficult  lei me know if you would like me to share any resources or tips i picked up through dm  just take small sustainable baby steps and work up your way to making overall big change it is so much harder if you are putting a huge lifestyle change immediately on yourself and mentally stressing yourself out im not in your exact situation but i struggled after weight gain from medication a doctor prescribed me and can tell you what helped me
lol so the bf should let bil puff up like a rooster and get in his face and possibly punch him instead just so his kids can instead see how being an asshole is ok

no better the kids see that being aggressive is not the way to handle a confrontation
hahaha ahhh maybe its really just dependent on the cat i had a feral i rasied to be my own cat and she kept her collar on despite being outdoors most of the time
yeah ive found the only way to get them to keep a breakaway collar on is to start them pretty young 
i dont know about other people but i would say no not if it is to that amount  doesnt sound like a good foundation for being with someone for the rest of your life it sounds like you dont respect him very much and thats going to eat at the relationship  both of you deserve to be with people youre crazy about and who are crazy about you
wish i had better news for you but material generosity doesnt necessarily mean that someone loves you or that they arent narcissisticselfabsorbedentitled you can totally be both which is what it sounds your bf basically is hes the selfish one for not prioritizing what your niece wants for her dinner hes the thoughtless one for not seeing the gesture and effort behind his nieces gift  hes grown more relaxed and comfortable in your relationship which in his case means taking you for granted that youll put up with such bratty behavior  


this behavior doesnt improve without serious correction and consequences you cant talk someone out of being like this 99 of the time youre probably going to have to sit down and talk about this and see where that goes and from there where you will go and what you should do
umajere616 thank you yes
yep i agree with you i was just saying that i wasnt just speaking as a dog owner and someone who loves dogs and me saying he doesnt want to give the dog a chance still stands people are capable of change by opening their minds if he wants to live in fear of dogs and be unaccepting of a culture where dogs are household pets thats still his choice but its ops choice and right to live the way she wants in her house
agreed and ops pet sounds well behaved so theres literally no reason to shut him up somewhere
the dog isnt going to calm down if hes locked down in a crate though hell probably be excited for 30 minutes when he comes out of the crate ops dog sounds well behaved if her sisters husband isnt willing to give the dog a chance thats not ops problem and its her sisters choice whether she wants to come  


when i wrote my opinion it wasnt just as a dog owner it was also as a person who found the hard way that just because someone is family doesnt mean they wont take advantage of you be selfish or shitty sometimes you have to set boundaries and they need to respect it unless you want them to keep trampling over it
i dont think her crating her dog to accommodate her sister makes her the bigger person and frankly that logic gets abused way too much people often say be the bigger person to someone because they dont want to deal with the trouble of the boundary breaker and because they think they can push that person over
stella is so cute love
she wouldnt compromise for you its your house  and your dog why should you compromise for her  the way she treats that dog isnt right and honestly it should go to a better home than to be banished to an attic and she claims to love that dog  shes made it obvious what her priorities are as an outsider looking in  thats my view  your dog doesnt deserve to be shut away and hes got a lot less time on earth than your sister does and the more you give in over time  the more your sister will expect it 

i know youre asking for a compromise but honestly i cant think of one and i doubt she would accept one i also dont think you should give one to her  but thats just me
with duck fat thats all the seasoning you need
hi speaking as a woman here

its entirely possible that its her association with those sex acts with that ex that make her not want to do those things now maybe shes ashamed of having done those things or because she doesnt want to remember those things with that person or maybe she doesnt want to be the person she used to be when she was with that ex maybe she didnt want to make videos because that shady ex of hers pushed her to do it in the first place and look at what hes doing with them now its so uncomfortable just knowing videos of you doing a sexual and intimate act with someone is out there

ive done things a decade ago that i dont want to do now no matter how much i love or desire someone i can assure you it is entirely and very possible it has nothing to do with how much she cares or desires you
that that is a beautiful friendship
oh im sorry thats a pretty straightforward reason
if you dont mind me asking  what led to you guys splitting after so long together
youd be surprised at how cold and how much people dont care once it starts inconveniencing them or it gets hard
dont put up with that bullshit i understand the yearning to bond with an immediate family member  the sense of loyalty but let me tell you from experience that they can be as toxic and unhealthy as anyone else  toxic is toxic being family doesnt grant you special treatment if anything  its all the more reason to cut them out speaking from experience  dont waste your time with him
lol reminds me how my friend ordered a super sick sports car her bf was with her when the delivery guy came and he kept trying to talk to the boyfriend and get him to sign her boyfriend had to say three times i dont know man its her car
that might mean you just dont love yourself enough then you are worth more than how this guy is treating you and dont allow yourself to be poorly treated by people because theyll keep doing it by letting go youll open up space and time for better people and things i know its scary but it can be better
lol manipulative people dont see themselves as manipulative they just know what they want and they do their utmost to get it by manipulating the people around them with words or emotions but they dont think of themselves as manipulative because then that would require they realize theyre not very good people and these kind of people just keep pushing boundaries and doing it because they get away with it and it works
i wish i lived in iowa so youd have a place to keep warm and for your cat to be safe while waiting for your new home  im so so happy for you its incredible  how you stayed strong and persevered through it all  you should be proud  and fuck the people who make little of you for it as people they are nothing compared to you  regardless of what material possessions they may own
im not giving her a free pass she admitted she was wrong and that she shoudlnt have done that no matter how stressed she was and she apologized that shows someone taking responsibility we all make mistakes like that under strain

youre correct that we only have one point of view but we are here to address the information she has given us based on how she has written it the husbands behavior is not normal and you seem to be giving him a free pass when it is clearly abusive behavior and abuse is not a mutual relationship dynamic you are also correct that our partners feelings affect our own however his reaction by being intentionally cruel and demeaning for hours is beyond the pale and is unacceptable strain stress of being provider all those things are things you talk about with your partner not things you punish and humiliate them for sure maybe op does that stuff in other situations but thats making a huge assumption because people dont normally behave like that why because its abusive and wrong

the fact you are so eager to defend this mans clearly atrocious behavior is very concerning
uh but his reaction was way wayyy overboard and he purposefully did things to hurt and sabotage her sure he didnt plot it ahead of time but he did things on purpose to hurt her for hours that is ridiculous and knew it could have consequences for her future he wouldnt even accept her apology furthermore it sounds like shes under a huge amount of strain that would cause anyone to snap now and then if internet strangers can understand that so should her husband i honestly think she is right to reconsider staying married because that kind of cruelty if hes allowed to get away with it will only continue because he knows he can  


having reactions is understandable and can be worked out purposefully being mean and coercive to your wife and literally humiliating her what is with the phone recording shit is flat out wrong youre supposed to work together not try to fuck each other over just because you can
thats so wonderful i wish i was young enough to get a zoom visit too thank you for being such a wonderful santa even with social distancing and for bringing happiness all over
i dont think hes forcing her to have an abortion  they tried to be safe  it didnt work  he wanted to try be excited and supportive of the pregnancy and came to realize he couldnt be and hes not ready  its better hes aware of his limitations now than to figure it out the hard way  rather than the kid to grow up with an inconsistent parent at best  and at worst an indifferent and resentful one  hes respecting her choice to have the pregnancy while allowing her to know his limitations  if she wants to pregnancy she can have it  but he cannot handle being in a relationship with her and being put in a father role

him demanding she stay pregnant or him pressuring or coercing her to get an abortion would be him being controlling over her rights to her own body  from ops account it doesnt sound like thats the case he told her how he really felt  and what they want is dealbreaker level incompatible
make sure you have your ducks in a row by checking eviction laws in your state to make sure she cant pull anything over you shes shown herself to not be trustworthy at this point
i wouldnt bother unless your parents basically beg and apologize and even then it would be a hard sell 

dont put yourself at risk for more trauma from them
well thats fucked up  im in a similar position with my husbands best friend and his wife  the husband used to at least defend me a little but now hes acting just like her i dont know if its salvageable for you or me because when people act with such a lack of respect theres not much you can do
dont keep enabling your mothers bad decisions

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment

good for you op doing the right thing
in no universe is her dad entitled to that kind of behavior  brynn and her family are completely within their rights
wheres my dog
honestly there are a lot of people who can just emotionally coast for a long time because things are good or why just arent self aware until the chips are down  so to speak  and thats not your fault things can even be great in a relationship  and someone will decide that it just isnt for them even though they think the other person is great sending lots of hugs to you i know the pain is unbearable right now
i know how that feels too its going to hurt so badly for awhile  like everything is ripped out of you  just take one step at a time grieve feel the love of your support people and know that you are enough and you did your best
how did you do it  thats amazing
lol when someone tells you that you should be over something  by now theyre not actually sorry or remorseful for what they did they still think theyre right and just want the argument to be over with it may be best to severely adjust your expectations of your dad to be honest a lot of old mendads ive met they dont change and just stay horribly the same at least your stepmom is someone you can communicate to and is willing to work things out with you  seriously dont count on your dad
plus its not fair if sex only has consequences for the woman sex has much greater consequences for the woman

religion as well as men has no business or say being involved in the government or in the say of womens bodies
the effects of pregnancy is not temporary though his wife is going to have to deal with her body being torn up and stitched back together stretched skin having to lose excess baby weight for someone with body dysmorphia i can only imagine how much of a nightmare this is and some of those things do not go away
i see where youre coming from but im not sure that is the best system either
im sorry to hear that charities misuse their funds so much do you know of a better alternative
shes not being insecure and invasive thats straight up inappropriate behavior for someone in a relationship  and if it makes her uncomfortable  he should respect and care about her enough to set boundaries
i relate to this
i use figo pretty easy and has already paid for itself
i super recommend getting pet insurance my pet insurance even has an app that lets me chat to a vet 247 once my dog was having bloody poops and his anus looked raw you can imagine my cellphones picture gallery despite it being scary to see the vets recommended waiting it out said what to look out for and said he probably ingested something upsetting his stomach i did and saved myself a vet bill
hes exhibiting abusive behavior she should under no circumstances go to couples therapy with him  and anger management wont help him because he needs very specialized help to become non abusive
gordon ramsay is really nice to people who are trying to learn or better themselves and understand that they made a mistake he gets upset when people deny accountability and repeat the mistake especially at the expense of others chef culture is generally abrasive from what i can tell so take that with a grain of salt he also comes off as a very responsible parent since he doesnt want his kids to become spoiled from his success they dont eat at his restaurants unless theyre doing charity work and he intends on giving the majority of his wealth to charity upon death
this is so perfectly worded im saving this
its insane to me how some people grow up abused know they were abused and then see it happening to other people and go well thats my dad we forgave him so should you etc etc and im someone who came from an abusive home
hi i have a friend with genital herpes and id like to know what is a good way to be supportive to her like i want to send her this ama  but im also worried that maybe thats not a good idea for whatever reason like if it would embarrass her or something i guess i just want to know if there is any general advice youd give on how to be a good and supportive friend
that is some nice glossy chocolate
with this kind of situation you should respect jakes feelings  anna is feeling guilty and bad and wants to feel better by apologizing  but sometimes you reap what you sow jake is not obligated whatsoever to help her with this feelings and for all you know bringing them together is just another way youre catering to the golden child

respect jakes boundaries that he has chosen to set with his family for his happiness and peace of mind
some people are very particular about not having their things touched or used without permission  it can feel very invasive and disrespectful especially if its an expensive item louboutin shoes are no joke people are allowed to choose how they want to share their things i myself am not like ops wife but i too would feel uneasy if someone took such a personal and expensive item without asking 

op its good you backed your wife up especially in front of your family its important to back up your spouse  however perhaps behind the scenes  you can speak to your wife to try get her to see things in a gentler and more forgiving perspective and speak to your sister gently as well to lessen the blow and so that there are not hard feelings
thats amazing and wonderful if only all marriages could be like that
to your 1st question it is easy for people to get caught up in a relationship and stop doing the things that defined their individuality or being their own person you are what you do and think  its okay to change as you want to continue to grow  you dont want to stagnate 

2nd question be a desirable and valuable partner can mean many things  for instance being financially stable is one or staying in shape being emotionally stable and supportive  what people  need in a relationship can vary but there are things that certainly help 

third your significant other is the person you yoke yourself to in this world words from a wise redditor i once read they are now your top priority because theyre the person you should now be most accountable to  and also love and take care of as they should do the same for you your allegiance belongs to them first  marriage is wonderful but also delicate in certain ways that need to be protected if your family or friends is disrespecting your partner  you need to stand up for your partner for instance grandparents can be important but your so comes first and utmost always
i love nugget
dont listen or take into account the words of anyone who frequents mgtow or incel subs their beliefs are very misogynistic
what happened after you found out he was being serious
thats a good point you are right
the point i was addressing is how abusers use the breaking point excuse to pardon their bad behavior its more of an orange flag than a yellow flag  if he takes full accountability is remorseful and doesnt repeat it again then great  hes not an abuser but its still an instance of abuse he is already minimizing what he did it is abuse because he had enough control to hide what he knew was unacceptable behavior from his mom  unplug the lamp to directly smash it next to her
it was right next to her when he smashed it  that is too much control and directed aggression abuse can start at any time in a relationship and needs to be shut down immediately for what it is  if it doesnt repeat and he is genuinely sorry  then he is not an abuser but it will still be an instance of abuse
even so  thats still unacceptable behavior even if she didnt escalate to physical violence  did she degrade you in arguments blame you for everything or could she take accountability for herself 

its still abuse  even if things dont escalate to direct physical violence
the thing is though that abusers usually seem fine or at least within acceptable limits of behavior for a very long time   then something happens  and the person thinks its a one time thing then it gets worse the next time it happens and it starts happening again and again the fact that he waited till his mother wasnt around to do that means he had enough control and chose to scare her in private because he knows that behavior is unacceptable that is a sign of an abuser
yeah but the issue is that if an excuse abusers use all the time  they blame their partner for pushing them past their breaking point  that anybody would flip their shit but the thing is  abuse is not anger management issues its an active choice to do unacceptable things the abuser makes to scare and silence his partner into compliance

there is no excuse  ever  to behave like that
congratulations what a victory good for you 3 and thank you for giving encouragement to others
him wanting you to be financially dependent on him is strange and sounds rather egotistical its also probably not healthy for you or the relationship in the long run  he should respect your wish to work and support you
really cool im going to wishlist it now to remember my steam account information
i would marry someone i adore i can also admire someone i adore

there is someone i admire but ive never had romantic feelings towards him and cant even really imagine it i dont even see it as a possibility so for me the two can be very very distinct
the family and friends of an abuser will turn on a victim quickly because they dont want to believe one of their own is doing bad things or that they might even be part of that dysfunction  its easier to blame you than to confront him and possibly have to look at themselves and risk their own relationship with your husband theyre also probably not very good people

please read why does he do that by lundy bancroft and you will see that you are not alone in the case of having everyone turn on you or what i imagine a lot of things in  your situation
i was a ta for my mentor  a very famous and successful illustrator just awesome guy all around i was his first and only ta for a long time but as his classes gained in popularity  so did the ta requests 
n was a girl i had befriended  and she mentioned wanting to ta for my mentor normally my spot is reserved and i wanted to help so i took her to be introduced to my mentor

n is an attractive girl and she knows it  she uses it to get advantage whenever possible to get guys to give her a discount  shit like that she wasnt very good at what our education specialized in either

anyway we go  and my mentor breaks the news to me that he has to open up my spot because he has gotten so many requests i was distraught and he spent a good deal of effort which i was not entitled to but an grateful for reassuring me he still wanted me to be his ta and to make sure i got the paperwork to him first thing when the next semester started because then he could give me my ta spot that hes taking the first people who apply so to make sure i get to him first 

n hears this and immediately slams down the paperwork she has with her  saying heres mine and proceeds to bat her eyelashes at my mentor while standing proudly my mentor looks at her directly in the face  and says  i said i am accepting them first then the next semester and pushes the paperwork back at her 

my mentor later mentioned being irritated at how n tried to pull batting eyelashes and that crap on him  complaining haha 

needless to say  when i tried to talk to her about it  i got the classic non apology of im sorry you feel that way and i didnt know you wanted your job lie but not even looking me in the face as she says it our friendship died that day as i realized the degree she was willing to throw others under the bus for her benefit
hi  may i please dm you  i would really love to hear more about your journey im looking to find insight and perspective on my own

also  excellently worded post i saved it for future reference
oh this one hurts
the little mermaid

obsessing and chasing over a man and giving up your entire way of life and your friends and family for a dude because of his statue is not a good idea  making a deal with what is essentially the devil  also not a good idea oh man king titan just becomes more relatable poor dad
this isnt a book op should touch even if he does enter a new relationship unless he has been absolutely free of abusive behaviors for years that is how much of a different beast abuse is abusers are known to take psychology and use it as a weapon to defend and hide their abuse and to control their partner im not pulling this out of my ass if you would like to research this yourself i can dm you a great resource to read  


i honestly dislike commenting on posts but am compelled to particularly when i see posts on abuse because people generally dont know how abuse is so dangerous and how hard it is to eradicate i too didnt until i did a lot of reading on it and all im doing is passing on the information ive learned most general methods are designed for people with rational behavior for instance anger management is designed for people who generally have trouble controlling their anger meaning they let it loose on anyone and everyone while abuse is an active and terrible choice the abusers make to hurt their victims as they dont do it to anyone else but people often think abuse means or equates to anger management and thats the danger because it doesnt it requires a specialized approach and even then most abusers dont stop abusing if op were to read attached it could easily become a weapon or actually hinder his progress in trying to become nonabusive
 this is a pretty good summaryexample of why generic therapy does not help an abuser one of the many reasons why is because abusers use their feelings when really its their value system and thought processes as an excuse to abuse their partner and they not only have an inflated sense of their own feelings but they see their partners feelings as lessernot important a generic therapist is typically not trained to deal with abusers and generic therapy is meant to focus and give validation to the patients feelings and is based on rational behavior the last thing an abuser needs is to focus on his feelings more thats the root of the problem he needs to focus on his partners feelings abuse is not a mutual dynamic abuse is not rational behavior an abusers warped thought process runs so deep they will start to manipulate or use whatever psychology they learn to further dominate and control their partners while learning how to hide their own behavior  


edit this is also not a theory this has been proven through a lot of study if you would like i can dm you a great resource to read if you need proof
understanding attachment theory isnt going to get rid of his abusiveness or even address it  if anything  the warped line of thought that creates the abuse in the first place will use it as a justification and an excuse he needs very specific resources dedicated to dealing with abuse because it is such a different beast  which people dont know thanks to the general myths about abusers 

the book itself is an excellent one and great to recommend in many other situations  just not this one
please seek out therapy that is specialized and designated for abuse and not give up even when it gets hard and challenging because the roots of what you have is very strong and toxic generic therapy will not help you and might actually make it worse its good you realize that you need to change not just for her but change period accept that this could be a lifelong process

one key thing is to really really think about how you must have made the other women feel realize what your actions really are take accountability dont minimize it dont diminish what you have done or justify it to yourself over time realize how wrong it is to intentionally hurt and manipulate people stop having an inflated sense of importance about yourself and your feelings stop silencing women for your convenience
you can unconditionally love someone and not enable bad behavior that is more of a real love youre a good person for recognizing the situation  wanting to do something  and i hope doing something  too many people in this world dont care about others or what people do to them because its not their problem
theyre not fixing or being responsible for other peoples drama theyre giving people the truth so those people can make informed decisions on their lives and acting as a person of morality and character would you can love someone and still not enable shitty behavior

its nice thats enough for you but for a lot of people they would want to know the truth if they were in that situation and feel betrayed if friends knew but didnt say anything and allowed them to be cheated and lied to nor is it about igniting conflict its about resolving a bad situation how they choose to go about the conflict doesnt make it the messengers fault
its fair to question her character and morality though
no offense but your wife doesnt have good morality or character in this area its not uncommon because there are a lot of people who when things are convenient as they are or frankly they dont care about the victim say its not their place to help she doesnt want you to tell him because its her best friend doing the cheating but if it was her best friend getting cheated on i would bet big bucks that shed be all for telling
do not stay with him  it will get worse and even harder to get out when you have a kid  the rages will increase in frequency and volatility remember people dont do this to those they love  he does not love you  he actively disrespects you and sees you as less than a person do your best to get out now before you become more enmeshed or emotionally invested  your daughter  your future second child deserves a good life as do you  free of fear
its interesting  when i associate sense of family i think of people who enable and defend unhealthy behaviors to support their family because theyre closest im really glad that sense of family doesnt mean that standard  ive always held it more as the meaning you mention in your post but lately i just encounter the enabling type in my association which makes me think perhaps i have just encountered people of low moral caliber and character despite their proclamations of being otherwise
congratulations
congratulations and good for you and your family  and your family to be 3 im so glad you have their support
katniss is also very aware of herself in the sense that she knows what she can move past from and what she cant she and gale had been drifting apart for awhile at that point because of their differing views towards the war him being the creator of the bomb device that killed prim was the final straw he himself knew that katniss would never be able to look past it and so did she
i know a woman that won the jackpot met the nicest guy at 36 got married at 37 now has a child if someone like that can have a happy family surely someone good like you can too someone who has went through much hardship and has so much kindness left in them you will surely find someone who can appreciate all that you are the key is to have confidence to enjoy and cherish yourself to make your own life on its own whole and full even if you dont have a partner and that will attract a healthy partner to you because you wont settle for less and thats the most important thing we tend to choose the partners we think we deserve
beautiful congratulations oh hes a gorgeous foal i love how gangly they are at that age
its your boyfriends problem his people  his problem  its actually good he wants to help and support you this way  i know you might be uncomfortable with the conflict it sounds like that  to me  but hes doing the right thing by you it doesnt really come off as him victimizing himself at all based on what you wrote you can need support without being a victim
it may not be a permanent solution but a temporary one the gf wants to keep things safe for the rest of the children they can negotiate and if its a hard line for her and a hard line for him  they can break up

killing a pet by throwing it down a flight of stairs and bring physically violent to the point of assault it is extremely stressful living in fear around someone  and living in fear that they will hurt the ones youre in charge of protecting it is hard being so severely limited in what you can do or not do because you are afraid of someone  the girlfriend may be reaching her limit for reasons unknown to us perhaps op has refused to set any boundaries whatsoever up till now and now things have just gone too far for the gf yes nicole needs help  but it might be important she go away for some time and get that help because it doesnt seem she can handle being around the family safely for now 

i knew a family who had adopted a girl from infantry the girl grew up and showed signs of being very disturbed  the final straw came when she threatened the father with a knife  and she was under ten years old  at that point the family sent her away to a boarding school designed to help children like her  they didnt give up but they knew when it was too far beyond their abilities to help or handle perhaps theyre is a compromise op can find to keep his family safe and still have a relationship his daughter
the girlfriend might be open to compromise and negotiation  its fair  and honest that she openly says what outcome she would feel best with and they talk it out from there its important that people realize when their partner is making a sacrifice and that goes for both of them  relationships are a lot of negotiation  i dont think shes necessarily demanding or trying to control him by what it sounds like  it sounds like shes tried to make things work but its legitimately afraid now they cant even have a pet because his daughter threw a living creature down a flight of stairs and she is physically violent 

this is probably not the case but ive also seen relationships where the person doesnt say their ideal outcome and immediately offers something reasonable and a compromise but the other party doesnt see that and continually demands more because they feel like if they say yes  then thats their partner getting their way when in reality the partner is already trying to compromise and cant go any further
hey there  just want to point out that while what you say is true  it doesnt apply to abusive marriages not saying ops marriage is or isnt abusive  abuse lies solely on the shoulders of the abuser its the attitude of the victim being also at fault one of many things that trap and isolate abuse victims

op definitely isnt in a healthy state of mind  though
especially if theyre family
i worry about this
the clever ones are manipulative and smart enough to get away with it  thats what drives me nuts
youre a bad guy if you do bad things and take advantage of another persons goodwill or basically use them l yes she is ultimately responsible for herself however it doesnt make him any less of a bad guy
if you can please dont watch the movie the main star spoke out against the people of hong kong having human rights and supported police brutality  it is disgusting that disney supported that as well as filming in an area where uighur are being kept in concentration camps

furthermore i heard the movie is a piece of shit as well as having no songs so it seems like it would also be a waste of time
it does seem like hes stringing her along sometimes people do that unintentionally negative they dont think about how selfish theyre really being  instead of saying i dont want a relationship with op which would end his supply of sex and companionship with her   he making excuses and trying to make it so he he can do whatever he wants without boundaries and still get sex
hes not mature enough to be in a relationship based on what youre saying in your post at the very least  hes not ready to be in a relationship with you  its not worth being with someone who you have to coax and drag along by their teeth  or who doesnt have the ability and foresight to see how you have to work together and compromise on some basic level in a relationship people can mature and grow in a relationship its just that where youll be starting from with him is going to make for possibly one very rocky road  it just sounds like he wants to keep absolute freedom more than he in a relationship with you  you can explain it all you want but odds are that if you actually do get in a relationship with him  he might use this as an excuse whenever you want to set healthy boundaries or i dont know  be treated nicely  i mean hes already complaining about getting gifts
the one thing ive noticed about most conspiracy havers is the distinct lack of critical thinking  i dont think conspiracy theories promote critical thinking about a promoted truth as much as it just serves some bias or ignorance the strand of logic is weak if not nonexistent
oh no worries thank you for taking the time to respond i really appreciate it thank you for this
i havent watched the movies in a long time so im not sure but based off how they did the movies in general it wouldnt be surprising if it had been cut off or minimized in such a way that it lost impact the movies didnt nail the emotions or relationships of the characters well while also having a lot of unnecessary exposition

you worded katniss so well her individuality and her determination directness her loyalty are some of the traits that draw them and us as the reader i enjoyed the fact that she felt socially awkward and felt like she wasnt able to connect with the people like the way her sister could and that those who got to know her could appreciate her her confusion over her feelings for peeta and the back and forth between him and g are also very relatable as human emotions are quite messy i didnt just see it as peeta making her feel safe but her also realizing that peeta is complementary to her and can together make the life she ultimately wants as what determined her final choice id like to think in a way she did realize she loved him more than gale though that would just be wishful thinking on my part
yep very true i just remarked on haymitch in particular because the person i was replying to thought that haymitch deserved to be treated badly by katniss while they definitely sparked against each other at first their relationship definitely evolved into that of mutual respect he more than redeemed himself we all have friends who have bad traits but who we care for regardless because what they give us is so much more haymitchs bad traits are also just self destructive in nature he only hurts himself not others
oh i totally get what youre saying im the same when i could go to the gym i was doing more strength training and it was great i didnt think you looked fat or out of shape or that you werent putting in efffort just as a fellow person who misses going to the gym and its benefits wanted to offer you the little things i found worked for me im someone who also has a hard time standing up for myself sometimes which is why i admire your ability to do so
hey there do you have any dumbbells and a yoga mat there are some great youtube videos that can help keep the weight at bay and possibly even weight loss im saying this because you mention wanting to work out there is no good reason for your husband to ever call you a fat cunt ever him being dismissive of your efforts is fucked up and he obviously was just trying to sledgehammer you with whatever hurt he could im glad you have self esteem enough to require some major action from him to show hes remorseful im sorry i dont have any magical answer or solution to your situation but know that you are not wrong for being angry and he was wrong to treat you that way even if you were passive aggressive
if you dont mind me asking how did you guys get past the shitty times you mentioned were those external things or were there struggles you two had between yourselves ive only been married for a couple years myself
haymitch was a very tragic character
the imperfection of katniss is one of the most memorable things of the book for me the conversation that she overhears peeta and gale where theyre asking who they think shell pick between the two of them and they both conclude that its whoever she needs more the guilt she feels from the knowledge of the kind of person she is and for their love the book also pounds in the truth that when youre fighting to survive you can only think of others so much that you are strained and stressed trying to just exist

frankly katniss is a much more real person than most ya protagonists and probably more selfless than a lot of people in real life
please take the dog with you
sometimes people dont stop unless you make it clear how unacceptable their behavior is and back it up with consequences

hi please try read lundy bancrofts books  daily wisdom  and why does he do that  reading them and knowing youre not alone and being able to see what hes doing might help you stand up for yourself a little better  and bancroft provides good advice you can also call a domestic abuse counselor who might be able to provide you with good advice on how to keep him away
welcome
really i live in la and i thought we had the reputation of being pretty unfriendly as in  if someone asks how youre doing  the gut reaction is what do you want  with some side eye
saving this post thank you very much for this
the snarling in your face  throwing things its going to get worse  your gut is right  big red flags  do not move in with him
you can soften it and tell them the truth still saying something like i feel so very lonely because dating as a trans person has been incredibly hard and disappointing so far  and its starting to wear me down im feeling really demoralized and im struggling because of it im hesitant to tell you guys because im so happy for you both that i dont want you to feel bad about me being single  because youre both such great peoplemeaningful friends to me and i wish i too were in a great relationship like one the two of you have 

in a way its the whole truth  because its these feelings causing the envy you feel in the first place if you were in a great relationship then it wouldnt matter its not really about them  just you
animals being hurt  animals rejected and unloved  animals dying  all through no fault of their own 

seeing a polar bear starve because there isnt enough ice for him to hunt on  the koalas and kangaroos  and all the creatures fleeing from the fires  the animals in the parks looking for food because the tourists have gone away and theyre starving the furbabies in cages and kennels left alone for the night while waiting for their forever home  animals that die due to our stupidity our ignorance  our lack of respect
do you have any tips on how to cultivate relationships id like to make friends
i love tolkien so much he could create such a epic sense of vision
love lotr i can read it time and time again and find such beauty in the story and words always

i experienced what youre describing with dune as well i had read sci fi before dune and people thought that i wouldnt like it because dune was old and many of the things that it had done many had done after it so it wouldnt seem that special they were so wrong because dune does it so well i couldnt understand why there were those who could not appreciate the greatness that is dune regardless of when they read it
broken boundaries  regardless of gender  is still really bad  guys can get really possessive and manipulative over other guys
have you looked into therapists that have a sliding scale i havent had much luck but there are therapists who offer a sliding scale of pricing for people who cant afford it
seriously consider having your husband  with you present  shut down your cousin as kindly as possible  but firmly so she understands her feelings are entirely unreciprocated and will stay that way  
then she needs to go and stay gone
so sadly true  what sucks is that the smart ones get away with it a lot of the time because the other parties cant do anything without getting the situation flipped on them
if only more men were like your sisters husband
its like how weddings bring out the crazy in people in this case they didnt care until the proof was in the pudding that she wasnt going to be going anywhere

dont feel bad op some families are just that shitty how your husband responds to this will let you know whether your marriage is going to work or not you want someone who can and will defend you till the end of time thick or thin not someone who only does it when its convenient or easy he should be someone that you can talk to when someone disrespects you even if its his own mother its better to find out now than later whether your husband can be the man for you

sorry to say i honestly think thats the minority
once i was taking a childrens literature class and the teacher recommended that we the students all go to a playground and observe children then one of the dudes raised his hand and was like er sir theres a problem with that for anyone whos a guy  and it struck me how men have to be careful with their image as to not come off as a creep
also if you need a friend  you can dm me  its important you dont feel alone
theres a really good book that might provide great comfort and support for all these different feelings and things youre going through right now  it addresses things from feeling like youre made out to be the bad guy  how to feel normal again the name is daily wisdom for why does he do that it will definitely help you know and feel that you are not alone  you are not crazy or broken  what you went through and are going through is monumentally hard and you can do it
what a fun family
i understand why you feel like that ive been in your situation you dont understand why he would do that because you love him and you wouldnt do that to him he doesnt love you he doesnt care for you the same way you do for him its hard to accept that because youve been together for awhile and you love him its difficult accepting that this person you thought you knew and what you thought you had with him doesnt exist he would not be the first and be far from the last guy that keeps a person around for the benefits and convenience
its good your boyfriend is furious and wants to confront them  and by doing so  standing up for you so many people have the exact opposite problem  ive been where you are  thinking and wanting to play nice hoping it will get better  but doing it that way it doesnt ever get better i also realize it was a product of my low self esteem and people pleasing desires  maybe thats not the exact case for you but sometimes respect has to be enforced and your boyfriend is the right person to confront his friends on their shit its also good that he is clear headed enough to see that they are not good people  even if they are seemingly  outwardly good to him
hes just one giant red flag a lot of things youre saying sounds like abusive behavior screamingintimidating to get his way in an argument then turning it into a pity party so he doesnt take responsibility for his behavior switches blame emotional manipulation garden of resentments and this is all without even counting the ex issues its only been a month in its going to get so so much worse point blank answer remove him at least for awhile if not permanently because he sounds very unhealthy and he needs help you cant and shouldnt give right now only you can uphold your own standard for what you want and how you want to be treated in a relationship and nobody deserves to be treated like that
thanks for being so thoughtful and considerate and caring for her the way you did it was a great idea for you to call your girlfriend so she could feel safe

i once made the mistake of thinking someone genuinely wanted to help me by offering me a ride as i was looking for someone they started trying to touch my leg and my hair and talk me out of my relationship i was lucky they let me get out of the car when i told them that i wanted to walk from that point on
honestly this is what i hate about families rather than holding each other responsible  they just enable because they dont want to deal with it  they either dont want toaccept the fact one of theirs has done something bad or in most cases  they dont care
lovely couple wish you guys all the happiness you know youre a good match when youre together 247 and are happy
this is so adorable im saving it to my animal crossing art folder what a cute doggo he must be very loved
this is a great idea  put the dog out of his reach until you get the extra keys back from him and hes completely gone 

while i understand why the last part might feel necessary due to his behavior  it might be kinder not to say it there are a lot of people who use that as an abusive tactic to shut up their partners  a consistent no and i need you to please respect my decision to end this
i hate having to say this but that mentality of his is really hard and difficult to deal with being blamed for his bad behavior lashing out the toxicity odds are you wont be able to change him and he wont try to change until you leave and even then only if he really tries and realizes how wrong he is will he change his behavior is very entitled while maybe it seems like he isnt an asshole outside of this context as you put it in a comment the thing is that the good periods are just another part of this cycle he has it sounds like youve tried and maybe its time to show you wont accept that behavior anymore if he doesnt care enough to listen to you
thank you for being someone who wants to do the right thing even when its not easy too many people say to stay out of things because they themselves are people who dont want to deal with things and dont care about other peoples trouble but the world would be a better place if more of us were like you and tried to look out for our fellow human being just be prepared for the worst possible outcomes such as 1 she may not initially believe you 2 he may try to turn mutual friends against you if hes that kind of person
i havent been married very long and i was wondering what is it that splits couples like your first marriage apart after being together for so long
thank you so much for this post
do you care that your hurting your partner with your actions  or do you just feel bad knowing you did something bad that reflects on who you are as a person the truth is you need to learn to respect and empathize with your partner  and to allow her to heal with the time she needs not according to your timeline of how long she gets to get over it you must learn to accept the consequences of your actions  over and over  even though it probably feels unfair to you  but its only one step in a lifelong fight against the entitled mentality you have developed  and your endless defense mechanisms  you must learn to face the hurt you have done to your partner in its entirety if you are still causing new incidents then you still dont respect or love your partner you must train your brain to do this there are exercises out there for men like you who want to change  you must understand that what you have done is wrong on so many levels i know this sounds harsh but its the truth  you also need to find a batterer group and not just do individual therapy
this is a very bad idea  never  ever do couples therapy with an abuser or encourage someone to  it has been found that the abuser ends up manipulating the couples therapy and their abusive mindset becomes more engrained abuse and anger management are also extremely separate things  its not anger that makes an abuser abusive its their sense of entitlement and the way they think  not feel  if you want to learn more about this subject i strongly recommend lundy bancrofts why does he do this book  there are a lot of general myths surrounding abusers and if you want to help people who are being abused  its important to know more about the subject because the wrong advice can easily make a victims life so so much worse  i know you have good intention and you are telling op really good  standard advice that would work for a regular relationship  abuse is  just a whole different ballpark
you talk like getting married as is a surefire way to know people wont engage in emotional affairs  op is also allowed her dealbreakers and what makes her uncomfortable  especially considering how things turned out  she had good reason to be
what a cutie you guys look so happy this picture radiates happiness that brings warmth to the heart thanks for bringing a little joy to my day
thank you i truly appreciate you conveying that when communication brings together understanding it is the best feeling  all the best to you as well
i said if because from here on the internet i cant tell im not saying hes guaranteed abusive but that there are enough signs that perhaps she should study up on it to be able to assess for herself from professional resources lundy bancroft among several great authors helps explain the difference between an unhealthy relationshipperson that is struggling versus an abusive one as you said many people honestly i would say all of us have done something or other that could be called abusive without knowing or meaning to being an abuser is doing it deliberately to hurt and without remorse repeatedly there are a lot of general myths about abusers and certain things to be careful of because it can be used as a weapon by an abuser like couples counseling edit by looking into these resources she may also find tools that would help and unhealthy or struggling relationship
thanks for sharing this cool snapshot from this slice of your life and thank you for everything youve done out there and for continuing to help people the way you do i saw your comment saying youre working as an er
very much this the entitlement aspect is very indicative of an abuser the problem with couples therapy is that as it should it tries to validate both of the parties but this only works if both parties are reasonable and the relationship is not abusive the problem is that if your husband has crossed the line of abuse the entitlement and victim attitude couples counseling will only cause those attitudes to become more entrenched
i dont know if i would recommend couples counseling because his behavior is abusive and abusers tend to manipulate couple counseling sessions they also tend to get worse as they use the psychology to manipulate the victim further i would recommend getting your own therapist and educating yourself about abuse so you can be prepared for the situations that you might encounter especially if you should do couples counseling if your partner hasnt shown proper remorse and youre already on eggshells i would bet money hes going to do it again
soooooo cuuuuuuuuuuute
my question is how is it you dont know that we in the us are that bad i dont say this in a judgmental way i genuinely want to understand how is it you view what is happening and how people are being right now as im sure youre not the only one who shares that mindset to some degree what is your logic i live here and its horrifying to me how we are
i think you know this already but thats not something you should bet on  nor should it wait that long  its really scarring to be in the presence of such rage
its going to hurt but you might just need to find new friends
as much as it sucks  cut off that friendship because its not a friendship  i had a friend who did that but i still held onto the friendship  making excuses for her  she only grew even more toxic and hurtful  she doesnt respect you  its not worth it  it will only become a greater sunk cost on the end remember that person wouldnt do for you what you do for her
oooh what kind of in house date nights if you dont mind sharing  i want to surprise my husband
someone broke through to me by saying  dont plan around how people should act  but by how people actually act there can be a huge difference in the two 

she can still be a good person and at the same time adapt to situations in a way that preserves boundaries and self respect
its not that she doesnt have awareness its just that the truth is inconvenient for her so she actively denies it and refuses responsibility it doesnt help that she and troy enable each other
mmm i love fish
congratulations on your home it looks so lovely and your dog is adorable much admire your perseverance through all that you have gone through may your home be a wonderful and happy safe place for all time
my pasta would still scramble even though the pasta was off the heat i found putting it in an ice bath would create the perfect temp in my case but it took a few scrambly spaghetties to get there haha
amazingly worded and so true
theres something unique about british comedy that just cant be replicated successfully
thank you so much for posting this because you just got me hooked
its not uncommon for people to withhold or water down their views while in the early stages of a relationship when they get more comfortable thats when the real views and stances come out if anything be grateful that you discovered this early rather than 10 years down the line the level of religiousness his need for you to be religious on the same level to the point of also adopting a stance of homophobia you will have to change yourself to accommodate which is not good its understandable that its hard to leave but  this is probably a sign of bigger incompatibilities to come
my husband bought a lot of tuna for the sake of stocking up i now have over a dozen cans of tinned tuna its probably like 20 and even though i have a good recipe for tuna salad i have no idea what to do with all of it  oh man i gotta try some tinned saba that sounds so good
haha i like your username anyway  i can see how that could happen  i had a guy really into me wanted to get married and all that  but he was dismissive controlling and didnt prioritize my needs someone willing to introduce you to everyone isnt a guarantee of a healthy relationship or compatibility but the majority of the relationships i had ever the guy wasnt proud of me none of those were particularly good and didnt go past a certain point
i didnt realize for a long time what being in a relationship should be like  as in being with someone who truly valued me a guy who really likes and values you  and isnt using you for the benefits  companionship  sex wants to show you to friends and family they dont insult you or dismiss your feelings  it sounds like at the very least youre going to need to set boundaries with him because right now youre teaching him that he can keep doing what he wants regardless of your feelings  since youre not going to do anything about it sometimes we need to teach people how to treat us
dune is amazing
love this also this gives me less motion sickness than the aquaman movie
i used to have really severe anxiety and clinical depression finding the right therapist wasnt easy or cheap however with hard work it really improved my quality of life and my ability to have any kind of relationship with people romantic and as a friend what youre going through right now is so painful and im so sorry this has happened to you it took a lot of things to happen for me to finally seek help  working on yourself is the best thing you can do for yourself all around and will help you not sabotage yourself further do you exercise much  if not  that is something actively you can also do that can help take your mind off things as well  and does help in handling anxiety and depression
looks so huggable  its lovely
so cute
cut off my own dad and honestly have not regretted it for a single day if he hadnt been at my wedding i would have been perfectly fine with that ever since i cut him off  i havent really thought about him or cared my life has become less stressful for it people in general  understandably try to hold onto bonds with their parents even if those parents are bad people or plain toxic but the truth is that you dont have to  you can build a happy  solid life away from them and not think twice
yeah for me the third horseman would definitely be horse mackerel
there are situations where people date someone who at first is great but then have some horrific  horrible blind spot or an area where they are frankly just an ass its sad but definitely a common and real thing
seems like you personally like her but you are allowing your friends judgements to affect how much you get to know her to be honest group dynamics sometimes dont differ from mob mentality very much  one person in a group doesnt like something  other people start ganging up on that person and they all think theyre right when really they didnt give that person a chance  all they did was take sides and see what they wanna see its optics one person could do something and be perceived as shitty while another could completely get away with it because they have better or stronger relations
trust isnt just a choice but something that takes time do your best to focus on the positive things shes doing for you and stay in the moment the best you can  perhaps you can ask her to help you through some of these fears  while sos arent therapists  they can still provide emotional support and that will give them the opportunity to earn a little of your trust back  please look into gottman books  they may help you and your wife understand what you are going through and how best to overcome it
hello how much for alfonso and the timmy misprint card
it might be more of a slight muzzle instead of a double chin
there are online therapy services available have you looked into those
and i thought i was the only person whose friends didnt play ac im not alone
theres a video on youtube that explores this pov its pretty good
my hippo biff wore this hat i gave him that he absolutely loved his response was extreme in its positive response  going as far as to say  you really know my style he still puts it on now and then bianca and apple both rewear clothes i give them too also proclaimed to love the gift so perhaps its a matter of how much they like it and whether you catch them at the right times
i checked no active projects no moving building or house the option sell land doesnt even appear
yes done all of that all of those villagers have moved in have everything i have 9 villagers to date who are fully moved in
i invited my campsite villager and he moved in awhile ago   and no forgotten plots as far as i can tell
my island has only 9 villagers tom nook wont give me another housing packet to make a 10th plot is this normal my husband and i both play on the same island as two separate villagers but i heard that shouldnt affect the number of npc villagers or housing you can have
what happens when you give your villagers gifts they dont like by dont like i mean instead of proclaiming to love it and putting it on in the case of clothing they just say thank you and maybe give you a little something in exchange  also i gave a villager clothing they loved but now i wish i had given it to them in a different color because the other color would look better is there a way to get rid of stuff youve given to them and is there an effect of giving villagers things that they dont like
think it might be just coincidence  ive had villagers i talk to and give presents to everyday ask to leave  and one of them lives directly next to another villager
congratulations and welcome new animal crossing friend
im going to save it to my animal crossing art folder it makes my heart happy looking at it
i love how your room has all kinds of things in it it has so much personality its really fun to look at and has such nice pops of color little plants everywhere and the hammy its great
hahaha how does one be a bitch on neopets out of curiosity i wasnt on that game for very long in my youth
aw its lovely the coloring is really nice too what an endearing little tom nook if you ever do a series you should definitely post it up here too for us to see
the last pic just deals the deal  thank you for this haha
thanks for your thoughtful reply  what would be a good example of what to say to assert myself when they cross a line i struggle with knowing whats a good way of holding boundaries when for most of my life i was taught just to suck it up but i want to change that thank you
question how do you not allow someone to disrespect you

edit asking because i have to deal with a similar situation with a very unpleasant person
sometimes people dont outgrow being crappy human beings and im not talking about op frenemies do exist even as adults whether we choose to label them as such or not
cue kitchen mix and match designs can be equally as wonderful as ones matching sets also i love that this game has a ricecooker
please pm me too about these  they are just lovely
its really understandable how a lot of rejection and hardship with people could lead to your perspective and feelings people can be very hurtful and its tough when youve got a little higher hurdles than others when it comes to that i myself have some including social anxiety 

getting a dog is a wonderful idea because they are the best buddies however if you do be prepared to be approached by people and have conversations dog people tend to approach other dog people dog parks are wonderful places for both dogs and people you can go there to just enjoy dogs and if you choose to you can even socialize perhaps rather than avoid socialization due to fear of rejection you dont need to seek it out but welcome it when it does happen if youre relaxed the other person will be more relaxed too
the problem with your first campsite visitor is that youre forced to invite them not talking to them the second time only delays your story progression and thats how i ended up with rodney
shes one of my starting villagers and i love her too sometimes shell come sit by me and lately shell sing in the evenings when i leave she stops singing but once i come back she starts up again
am limited to only favorite thing designing my little home and island  learning and acquiring new things to do it playing with my husband 
999 too many favorite things playing with my husband and getting new things to design the island environment and my home area at the top
thank you so much
its my first time playing this game too my husband has played the franchise before  the game is really enjoyable at the pace given  i was like how are people getting all this crazy stuff and my husband immediately said  time travel we dont want to  do that though because we want to extend the experience of the game and enjoy it that way not that theres anything wrong if you want to time travel i do sometimes wish we had more animal crossing friends 

your room is cute and charming thank you for sharing it
clever
dont worry about your scars because it wont matter to the right person the poster uplatypuffs gives thoughtful and sound advice i definitely recommend the book attached it will help you understand how your style and your partners style interacts  and be helpful as a way to overcome your avoidant style disorder through self awareness the road might be hard but you can do it
the point the person is making is that you and your friend have different values  your friend values transparency and openness with his gf when and if he gets married  that will be even more so this is actually very common  especially if you two are opposite genders  you cant force him to change his values just as he cant force you to change yours the kind of emotional support youre asking of your friend would make him look very shady if he wasnt open with his gf about it
hello i would suggest minecraft its a simple game where you explore and build things it doesnt look beautiful from a first impression but the more you play it the more you see the beauty of the game its got a really fun learning curve and can go quite deep very good for all ages your children and grandchildren can also play it with you if you guys get a server to play on so it can be a way to connect even if you cant see each other physically add discord a voice chat program and you guys can talk and play together minecraft is available and easy to play on pc which more than likely your childrengrandchildren have too so you wouldnt have to worry about getting a console

another game although this is console is animal crossing new horizons its charming and simple and not really an action game whatsoever but some people find it very satisfying and fun more of a gathering and crafting game the multiplayer here isnt ideal but theoretically you could play with your family with this game as well i also hear great things about stardew valley havent tried it myself but im sure that one is lots of fun the games ive mentioned so far are all games you can take at your own pace when you play
remember that you will need to be conscientious  and extremely self aware at all times  understand that until otherwise  this will be a long and hard fight  maybe even a lifetime long  but you can do it  and it will get easier  the best thing is that you realized it and are owning it instead of blaming and running away  therapy will be key go to lundy bancroft site and do his exercises for abusive people once of the key things you must know is that your behavior and feelings stem from how you are literally thinking and you must change how you think if you truly want to become better
super easy and super delicious
oh yes for sure it is not entirely hellofreshs fault however i doubt my direct complaint to the guy delivering it to me is going to do anything i hope by telling hellofresh they can put pressure or speak to whoever they need to in terms of delivery for better performance

such as amazon used 3rd party companies to deliver packages to my complex some of these 3rd party companies were terrible one knocked and peered through my blinds kept knocking till i opened asked me where the leasing office was i told him he came back and asked me to deliver the package for him  wtf this happened serveral times so i told my leasing office and they dealt with it through amazon and that no longer happens
hey heads up  i just saw online that hellofresh is stopping their promotions started 317 and free meal codes for awhile due to the current state of things  so your code may not be valid for some time
i used a groupon that said it would give me 90 dollars off and required me to subscribe the thing it didnt tell me is that it split my 90 dollar discount over several boxes so week 1 had a 40 discount week two had 30 etc etc while i dont mind this because i was intending to try the service it is possible that they might be discounting it over several boxes instead of all at once their customer help service is pretty good so if you subscribe and find out its not what you think you can probably cancel and ask for a refund
the thing is  shes established that you snapping at her makes her feel unsafe and affects her trust in you  you see it as  theres so many things you didnt snap at her for  she might see it as i dont know when hes going to snap at me the thing about building or having a future with someone is that like another poster said  mindset is a big part of it like seeing it as a cute quirk and being able to work together or handle things in a way that creates or maintains a sense of safety it really seems like she cant help it  so perhaps there best thing to do would not put her in situations where the outcome might be you going babe please but if this would cause you to resent or lose respect for her  then the relationship will suffer mindset and acceptance  love and understanding  these are necessities
thank you 
good luck i truly mean this shouldve written it in my original comment all we can do is our best we all make mistakes and hurt even those we love but we dont have to stay that person we can be a better person starting today its great youve reached this self awareness to realize your mistakes and the epiphany of how precious this person is to you  it seems like you are really remorseful and want to do good by her  and really thats the important thing  that youre genuine and care about her depression is a terrible horrible beast that takes different forms and leaves casualties in its wake  you were the best you could be at the time  so as another poster so kindly said  forgive yourself even if it doesnt work out i hope it does for you  though forgive yourself  and be strong so you can understand her hurt and help her through it  persevere and try your hardest  that counts for so much a couple people i know who are either married or together now got together because one party really tried i really do wish you the best as i can relate to where youre at
if you can show you genuinely care about her feelings and show real remorse consistently show her with words and actions and accept accountability for yor wrongdoing and really listen to her so she feels heard id say thats the stepping stone to get being able to rebuild trust and possible take you back it needs to be real  keep in mind she is not obligated to do so even if you do all this and she decides that things are just too broken for things to continue in a healthy way then you will just have to accept that  none of this means being a doormat but it does mean understanding the effort you need to put forward in order for her to even take you back as a partner  and the effort to earn her trust in you as her partner back  there will be some extra sacrifices you might need to make in order to move forward  it would also be good to come up with a plan of action describing how you will improve and consciously prevent what happened from happening again and not take her for granted
she sounds overwhelmed im not saying what youre expecting is unreasonable its just possible that it feels like too much to her for some reason  things i can do now easily when it comes to taking care of my family home felt overwhelming and like drudgery when i was depressed  i attributed my depression to feeling unfulfilled and lacking my sense of self
sometimes people dont want to own up to their feelings because they feel like they failed or if the other person isnt a bad person they feel guilty sometimes they even try to make out the other person to be bad just so they can still be a good guy and justify breaking up honestly people will often unconsciously and consciously do 
anything to protect their selfimage and ego and the longer someones a terrible person the more embedded and difficult it is for them to turn around in the mirror and look because that realization is not pleasant at all

posts like yours and many others which involve a work environment has just proves how people will do crazy things to get what they want essentially people are crazy and selfish that and people get all groupy the trouble maker is not your cat but that womans dog because she doesnt have it well trained enough to chill if your cat isnt causing issues with a majority of the dogs and is keeping to itself its her problems and her friends are assholes too

whether to have children or not can be a dealbreaker in relationships and it sucks that this area where you thought you were once compatible in has no longer become so in some cases you get people who are okay with having or not having children but shes made it pretty clear that she doesnt want any its better that shes honest with herself and you about what she wants rather than becoming resentful from having children and children suffering for it she may be acting like the conversation never happened because it sounds like otherwise shes quite happy in your relationship so she might just be hoping that things can go on the way they are it comes down to what is more important to you do you want to spend the rest of your life with her or do you want children neither of you are wrong for wanting what you want and if you have to walk away from the relationship because of it
good for you on choosing not to defend fuckedup family and their complete lack of respect towards a human being and boundaries your brother did something terrible and frankly not something that could be forgiven as he wasnt even sorry he did it over and over again despite seeing the horrible consequences and suffering it caused another human

its great you came to this conclusion im only one of many people on earth but i definitely think you made the right call putting the safety of your loved one first and their feelings first is important

i have a question and i dont mean this to create guilt but really more because im in a situation in which im trying to understand the other party aka i wish they would open their eyes why did you try to get your girlfriend to forgive your brother and your family instead of standing up for her to begin with was it a matter of not respecting or loving her enough or is it really just a matter of ignorance on the right thing to do being torn between people who were good to you but shit to her and her why did you try to defend your family in the first place
although the saying to put yourself in the other persons shoes is great and often applicable keep in mind that not everyone has the same reactionsunderstandingsbeliefs that you do so sometimes putting yourself in another persons shoes isnt enough you must actually understand them how they operate and how to communicate with them

never wish your partner harm this is a toxic road

you can never really ever take back something you say words are powerful and critical be careful with your partner even in times of great heat and anger remember that you love them and you want to be on the same team remember to respect them

set healthy boundaries if someone is being violent or aggressive saying or acting in ways that are unacceptable let them know and walk away sometimes talking staying in any way engaging when the person is in their lizardbrain mode only feeds fuel to the fire walk away but let them know you will come back when they are okay again


edit back to the words thing unless you have some kind of prior understanding or agreement do not utter the word divorce out of spite by doing so you will destroy your partners sense of security and safety in the marriage as well as trigger abandonment and trust issues because how can they count on you to stay through tough times if you threaten to leave all the time
always put in effort make effort for romance making up dates any little thing you can do to make the other persons life easier theyll do the same for you if they are a good partner
i heard from others without any source to verify that tolkien did intend to imbue some form of christianity and that he disliked the author of narnia for making christianity so blatant  how did they find that he didnt mean to which i could and want to believe of course it doesnt change the fact that it is a christian allegory him writing it without that intent is very believable as our imaginations and stories are comprised of our own life experiences and understanding in some form as well as the stories we come across ourselves 

btw i loved your post op it was well written and informative it is so interesting how writings can take a life of their own once given to the audience
it follows the original short story sonnies edge by peter f hamilton very well the beastie design aligns with what was described in the written story better than the example you provided i believe in the story they also needed human controllers its possible that the anime copied from the story regardless there are enough design differences to where it really cant be said it was stolen or copied
nta please tell him 
the only thing that is preventing you from doing the right thing is your sense of self preservation and preserving the relationship you think you have with your daughter you say you have a great relationship what does that mean when its with a sociopath who has admitted to you that she cares nothing for you or her family members much less others youre just another person that shes comfortably pulled into her act

please tell the poor fiance because this is something that has the capacity to change and ruin his life what if he has children with her to later find out shes a sociopath and get trapped in the marriage out of fear of what she might do to him or their children valuable years of his life that he could spend finding a partner who actually loves him will be instead spent on your daughter who will view losing him as a major inconvenience to whatever plans she has this man deserves to have full disclosure so he can make an informed choice marriage is about marrying someone you think you know well enough to spend the rest of your life with them this critical component of your daughter is not something that can be swept under the rug for his safety

please tell him you already prompted her to tell him and she threatened you for saying you would do the right thing not the easiest thing
thanks for your post its great learning about these additional details they add more meaning to the game  

bad news study has found that antivaxxers dont care about evidence or research if anything it just makes them double down the study that all antivaxxers use as the premise of their belief has already been proven to be false yet none of them care or will admit it it sucks that your sister has to deal with them i hope she blocks them it is horrible they are so disrespectful towards her as if having a kid with autism isnt difficult enough nothing against autistic kids or people just saying that being autistic or having a child who is autistic from what ive seen and what i can imagine is more difficult 
he doesnt speak if you summon him in battle sometimes but he always says something typically when you summon him even if its a repeat since picking him up i use him exclusively also if you google youll find some people do have an error where mimir doesnt talk or ratatoskr doesnt talk one way to tell is that if youre not in battle and you summon him ratatoskr should say something every time if he only makes squirrel noises multiple times in a row somethings wrong
thats an unfortunate truth to hear i had a really great figure before im hoping i can get it back right now its so far from what it used to be i dont recognize myself in photos
its funny because a lot of people find atreus annoying i find him pretty helpful and fun love the character dynamics and dialogue in this game   


for a kid hes pretty alright and sweet at least at the point im at im sure hes going to have some development or problems soon but who didnt as a kid we all had our annoying stupid phases and most of us werent able to shoot arrows to make up for it so
your shield is shit

i have rabies  


are among many wonderful insults he throws
hi commenting for a chance would make a nice surprise for hubby thank you for being such a generous soul
my husband was panicking over getting us a tiny christmas tree because whole foods was no longer selling them and we couldnt find one anywhere finally he surprises me with a tiny fake plastic tree he gets from target and i know he tried so hard because he wanted us to have a little tree to celebrate with we had a lot of fun with it and decorated it with so much tinsel it basically looks like a furry boa tree with ornaments on i dont want to take it down yet because i love it and what it stands for which to me is my husbands love and effort to make our place a home and a happy holiday for me
when i was going through my grad term at my art school my husband would sit next to me while i worked and read a book to me it is one of our favorite memories together to this day these kind of moments are wonderful to have
if youre feeling like this you dont really have much admiration or respect for your partner nothing in here indicates you admire her or really respect her you like her sure

it honestly sounds like youre afraid to be a bad guy by leaving staying while having this huge amount of resentment and these sorts of feelings towards your partner is unfair for your partner it doesnt so sound like you want to work on things or help her learn to resolve things versus survive them it doesnt sound like you really love her so just leave instead of making everyone miserable and asking for approval from internet strangers
if you want to move on and distance yourself you will need to stop seeing him its going to hurt because youre attached to him however sometimes you have to do things that dont feel good or hurt because ultimately its whats best in the long run doing the right thing is not always the easiest or most feel good thing its not good for you its not the right thing to do and this situation looks set up for someone to get seriously hurt  


he is in a poly relationship you want something monogamous and commitment at best you will be no2 because his fiance is his primary relationship  because you dont desire a poly relationship this is really an affair more than anything as you want him for yourself and dont want him to be engaged anymore would you feel ok if you were his fiance and someone had these feelings for your husbanddid these things to you do you want to be that person  


i know how hard it is cutting off someone youre emotionally attached to even knowing its bad for you some of those experiences messed me up for a long time i really advise you find a way to distance yourself unless you really research polygamous relationships and have the confidence to place the proper boundaries and feelings accordingly but even then its really not a good idea as he doesnt seem to be able to put those boundaries and feelings himself 
no thats not a true friend and good person with integrity is willing to hold their friends accountable and do what is good for their friends growth not enable or just promote bad behavior for the sake of maintaining a friendship or their personal benefit
just because you get accustomed to something doesnt mean it should be okay or something you should accept
seeing this makes me feel so hopeful about my own marriage as we got married around the 2 year mark too how you describe the feeling of your relationship is beautiful i hope to have that feeling in my own marriage as well thats a beautiful photo of you two you make a beautiful couple
you can have a bromance without being possessive or toxic 
some guys have unhealthy and possessive attachments to their male friends and in the few cases i noticed they were all guys who had problems with women or no girlfriend that behavior was shit i did back in like middle school and these men in their mid to late twenties were pulling this crap im glad im not the only one who noticed that some male friendships cross from having friendly intimacy into unhealthy possessive behaviors
good luck hope everything works out and you guys come out stronger with a happy marriage
this is a good example why couples counseling may not be the appropriate treatment for you and technically isnt your couples counselor did what couples counselors do which is focus on a dual dynamic between the two of you the problem with that is that any kind of blame on your partner feeds your abusive mindset it doesnt matter how little its feeding your mindset when it needs to not be fed and to be eliminated completely the treatment towards abusers is designed towards focusing purely on you and your way of thinking and is different from couples counseling your wife doesnt deserve any of the treatment youre giving her and she doesnt owe you praise for behaving decently the way you should behave source lundy bancroft

its hard and not cheap but you may want to look into individual therapy or perhaps making the effort to go to the battering program despite the other people who attend it whats more important the drive or your pride seriously the fact you are self aware is a huge step realize the rest of the way isnt going to be easy either
keep working on yourself keep doing those worksheets aimed at men who want to change did you find those  


good keep feeling like shite not because i think you should be miserable but because thats a good sign youre not letting your pride or shame get in the way of you acknowledging your abuse and how wrong it is shame can be a big problem its good you are being proactive and taking these steps   


understand that abuse is the opposite of love and why 
the problem with this is that its very difficult for you at this point in time to not manipulate or do these things i knew someone who was aware their behavior was becoming abusive and the wrong couples counseling actually made it worse couples counseling works on the basis that there is a dual dynamic abuse comes from your thought processes and beliefs and the whole point of the battering program is to destroy that basis of your belief   


you really should seek individual counseling any professional couples therapist will not see you at least my understanding from my own therapist if there is abuse 
have you looked into lundy bancroft his website in the articles section has stuff for abusive men who want to change just scroll down a little and youll find it   


its really great that you recognize and want to change 

its not the feeling its the thinking behind everything that creates the abusive mindset how do you view your wife how do you view your family individual therapy may be useful if you are completely honest about your goals one of the key things is that you need to start respecting your wife deep down you are not respecting her as an equal hopefully you will find exercises and therapy may help guide you to the way of thinking that creates a good marriage 
when i was severely depressed i didnt ive literally lost muscle mass from it  then i slowly started to pull myself out of the hole by telling myself i am a strong independent woman  what would a strong independent woman do  it helped me deal with what was happening at the time on the way that i focused on bettering myself instead of well feeling like i was human garbage  believing in myself even though it felt like a lie 

i read something that really stuck with me  he will come to see you as you see yourself 

another thing that helped me was realizing things could change and be better that people dont care where you were  only where you are
to be honest that situation isnt going to improve unless you create boundaries and that also means being willing to walk away my husband dated a woman who was not trusting and quite controlling and it only escalated and got worse he was in that relationship for four years and by the end of it he was quite depressed and was being emotionally and verbally abused  


the level of controlling behavior is seriously abnormal and unsustainable and the problem is that it has become an expectation and entitlement  


seeing that you dont want to leave her i really advise for you to go to individual therapy because a therapist can help you decide how to approach these situations and how to create healthy boundariesintroduce change they can also give you strength in how to cope in the meanwhile or help you make hard decisions when the time comes to it i dont suggest couples counseling as your gf shows indications of being abusive

thanks for sharing your story with me  im sorry you have that pain as well  its great you have a brother who cares about you  
its important to be honest and selfaware with yourself about what you can handle or not some people want to believe they can get over certain things and it turns out they cant causing extended misery for everyone at the same time it all comes down to how much you want it and how much both parties are willing to work or do what it takes to succeed its up to you to decide whether you want to continue and then if you do discuss with her what needs to happen and determine if its realistic to continue being together you probably already know all of this uthewickedwombat speaks clearly its okay if its not something you can accept at the same time there are other ways to view this situation if you want to find a way to continue   


its hard for both of you you feel understandably betrayed and shocked your view of who she was has become questionable you feel your trust and the foundation on which you began your relationship has been violated her on the other hand seemed to clearly want to put that past self behind her and not let it define her in the future or dictate things you admit you wouldnt have continued the relationship its understandable why she would hide it doesnt mean its okay but its really understandable
i dont think that user is judging whether someones mom is normal or not they are merely saying that it is unfair to hold people who were raised by unhealthy moms to the same standard that people who were raised by healthy moms are and by standard i mean that you cant expect someone to have a good relationship with someone who is toxic for them and to red flag them for that is harsh

from an outside perspective as in my mom gives a shit as to where she is and who shes around youd think my mom is a funny outgoing and sweet woman who loves to tell stories about her kids i see a woman who verbally and emotionally abused me to the point where strangers would pity me and one even gave me their phone number she wouldnt take me to the doctor or let me open a bank account or have access to money she beat me quite a bit and when she tells stories now about my uniqueness and individuality i see what shes really doing which is trying to show off how defective i am while making herself look like a loving proud mom i assure you shes not i cant get by a single conversation without her insulting me somehow
thanks for posting about your experience makes me feel better knowing im not crazy for having these kind of experiences too and that really there are just messed up people in the world and also that there are ashleys out there 3 
how can i make my husband feel like hes a lucky husband the way you do have you guys had any really huge hurdles to overcome between the two of you hurt youve caused each other if so how did you overcome any perceived negativity towards your wife 
honestly i may not fear getting raped or murdered but im certainly wary and cautious about it   


one guy invited me for a work session we were in art school at his house i barely knew the guy he confessed to me i declined he somehow ended up screaming at me and then effectively ditching me by storming out of his house for two hours i left after two hours and receiving no responses then he proceeded to be hostile to me at our school workplace when he felt i gave a friendlier response to a student on the job than what i wrote to him over skype omw to work  


another man grabbed my ass on a tinder date ive had men offer to help me by giving me a ride and then start touching me and keep doing it even when i ask them to stop  


theres lots of nice guys out there who dont do any of this shit but the problem is that there are way too many who do who either feel entitled or want to take advantage so i would say its more like being careful because you just cant tell with people
its unresolved for you the things in our mind that are unresolved that we havent found closure for tend to stick the longest  


this is going to sound messed up but perhaps you need to try focus on the more negative aspects of that relationship if you start thinking about it this is a tactic used to help break unhealthy attachment you might be idealizing it and more than ever need to ground it while its normal to wonder what could have been its getting to an unhealthy point and even you recognize you need to move on with your life   


on the other hand also focus on the positive aspects of your current relationship put more effort into romance devotion into watering the grass that you have gratitude you can do it i promise   


ive known people who stayed in love with others for years and years they only got over it when they realized they didnt want to spend the rest of their lives that way  

its not trying to destroy their relationship its more telling rachel the truth so she can have the truth and decide what she wants to do with the relationship its also not being a bystander and basically enabling dan in being a shitty person  


you keep saying youre going to lose all your friends why would you lose all your friends over this furthermore if all these people are saying that you shouldnt do it then that says something about the kind of people youre hanging around   


you say no one here is seeing where youre coming from but it seems more like that everybody really does see where youre coming from theyre just telling you that you have to do the hard thing if you want to do the right thing and that you should do it of course it doesnt sit well with you this whole situation because it puts you in a place where you are putting your image and relationships at risk its scary and you might not come out unscathed its not fair to you no its not fair to you that dan is a shitty friend whos putting you in this position or that your friends arent backing you up and you know why those people arent backing you up because they dont want to have something to lose and theyre hoping if they all dont look at it then its not their problem but its really up to you on what kind of person you want to be and what kind of people you want to be around  


people respect people who do the right thing a lot more than people who think only of themselves and how to get by without a scratch   


think about how you would feel if you were rachel down to having no friends how would you feel if people you thought were your friends all lied to you because they were your bfs friends first even though he was treating you like garbage if you choose to do nothing at least know why and what kind of person you are by doing that
you may think dan is a good person outside of his relationship but people dont work that way hes not a good person he may look like hes a good person to you because hes fun around you and hasnt done anything actively shitty to you yet but hes not it just happens you are either ignorant of shit he is doing to you or he just hasnt had reason to do shit to you yet hes not a good person because ultimately its about him he is not a good person and honestly you need to stop justifying you covering him and your relationship with him to yourself by saying that its fine if you want to be friends with a shit person but at least be aware enough to see it for what it is hes a fun guy to hang out with he treats you well enough for now but hes a shitty person  


ive dated a guy who was a total narcissist and a horrible person to me in our relationship to everyone else he was great because he cared about how he appeared to them and it made him feel good to be liked by people it just happened to be in his self interest to be good to those people ive met other people like that too people who are good to you or their friends if it serves their ego or self interest but are manipulativedeceitful shady shits when it comes to getting what they want and unethical that is who they are the only difference between you and rachel is that he hasnt had enough of a self serving reason or opportunity to do something selfishly shitty to you he is not a good guy i feel like i dont have the right words to describe what im trying to say but i hope the point is getting across you only see dan as a good person because he hasnt done those things to you yet its a lot easier to think of someone as a good person when you see them doing shit to other people but theyre good to you or it feels fun  


guess what what feels good and fun isnt always good or the right thing the easiest thing isnt always the right thing to do right now the easiest and most comfortable thing for you to do is what youre doing right now which is covering up for dan and essentially lying to rachel but its not the right thing to do   


youre not a good friend to dan or rachel because you enable dans shittiness and you essentially lie to rachel perpetuating an unhealthy lie of a relationship rachel still might be your friend if you tell her because at least youre telling her maybe she wont be or maybe shell need a ton of space for awhile but you should tell her maybe dan wont be your friend anymore but honestly what right does he have to chew you out on anything when hes making you lie for him   


stop justifying to yourself why you keep lying for dan and trying to take the easy route for this situation how can you expect the girl who gave dan a blowjob to do something that you wont even do youre honestly just running away from having to do something hard even though you know its right  


its not messed up to call him out on being shitty its messed up to promote and enable someone being shitty and essentially fucking over someone elses life just because they are your friend first and that says more about you as a person than you think
very much agree with utheyear1200  youre trying to do a good thing but its a hard line to walk because of the level of emotional intimacy it is creating your girlfriend is feeling increasingly threatened because her feelings are being invalidateddisrespected which snowballs into more lack of trust you and your gf should try couples counseling if its possible however if you do please dont go in with the expectation of changing her mind but of really trying to build trust and do better by her that will help create more security and perhaps the counselor can help you both discover the level of boundaries needed for you both to feel comfortable as well as rebuild trust with each other  


to be honest ive been wondering how i would deal with a similar situation in the future from your gfs perspective only probably kind of worse my husband is friends with an ex he was in love with for 7 years and who considers him her best friend i dont know the reason he stopped pursuing her except i do know she met her husband around that time the awkward thing is that sometimes she does things that trigger to me as inappropriate the way shell look at him sometimes and this was definitely inappropriate unnecessarily reminiscing in a certain way about their time together with a wistful voice or something ive found a short email where she babytalked to him and he babytalked back shes married with kids it does not make me feel more secure at all my husband swears hes platonic only but you know what as long as theres sexual attraction possible as in youre not straight there is a danger not saying youre going to do anything just that the tension and possibility is always there i know a straight women who then was with a gay woman for 35 years the straight woman never considered herself gay because that was the only woman she was ever attracted to   


my husband didnt see how things were weird my mistake was vocalizing it to him repeatedly in the wrong way until his ex recently did this reminiscing thing at our last get together not even he could admit that wasnt weird and it was only that incident that made him realize that maybe she does reminisce or think about him in a certain way that may not be entirely appropriate you may not be able to see the situation as well as your gf does because youre inside it and sometimes we dont know ourselves as well as we think we do or other people 
how did your husband say that to you and how long had the problem been going on im trying to find a way to get through to my husband who used to not be like that to me but it results in him freaking out or raging i end up silencing myself without even meaning to   


congratulations on making that change i grew up in an abusive household and had to change a lot of undesirable things myself its hard taking responsibility and even more so for changing thats really awesome of you to have listened to your husband and do all that hard work for your life together  


op ulimitlessclient has really good advice for you here dont let it go too far i didnt heed my couples counselors advice when he told me and my husband that my husband needed to take responsibility and i needed to stop making him feel better about doing bad things i didnt make the stand for myself early on and things only snowballed into a bigger monster that everyday im trying to figure out how to fix dont let her get into that way of thinking because that way of thinking leads to abuse  


the thing about abuse is that there is never a good reason to abuse someone especially your so your so is the person you should treat with the most love and respect because love is respect no matter how angry or despairing someone feels it is never okay to hurt and abuse another person under any circumstance the reasoning justifications and excuses are all the traps of an abusive mindset love is being kind and communicating  in healthy productive ways uapprehensivelecture nailed it
congratulations so happy to hear that youve found your way and are thriving its great that your daughter and son know what they saw for themselves and see how hard you tried wishing and hoping for the very best for you and be proud of yourself for finding the strength to carry on and for giving your all i read your previous post and its really commendable how you tried to break a bad cycle problem was that your wife was perpetuating it all on her own im sorry you had to go through so much pain

if its alright may i pm you for some advice im in a situation that may sound familiar to you and your experienced insight would be so very much appreciated
if hes a piece of shit why are you friends out of curiousity  


edit also you have my upvote because that is so true that assholes come in all forms
sorry i hope that wasnt too much or too intense
thanks im hoping that somehow this incident will magically come out better than i thought it will i just get sad because i feel like whenever i start hoping when things turn out otherwise it just hurts all the more 
the thing is though that the people who do that usually do it to people they can get away with the other people are usually in on it to some degree they like the instigator more and dont do anything about it   


it just sucks becuase it doesnt seem like theres much op can really do about it but at least you know that youre not a bad person like that op
ya people suck
i like your name utamagotchigraveyard  ive been having a numbingly sad day but your username made me feel a little happy thinking of tamagotchies and frankly how massive their graveyards must be
hahaha ive seen that video its one of jordan petersons better ones cant say im a fan of him but he does say some good things and for all things is an intelligent guy  


thanks for the link it was a good reminder and i wish i had watched it before even deciding to try ask him how he was feeling he gets so strung out and defensive asking him how hes doing feels like punishment i guess  


x200b
it never truly goes away at least in my case its something i always have to be aware to try prevent slipping back down into i view it more as in how much better it is i can gauge that based on how positively  or at least non negatively affected i feel about life and people the biggest thing is that im more proactive and actually have the initiative to want to do things and can even enjoy things or find them funworthwhile  i can be more mindful of my sos feelings and support them better  


when i am depressed i dont want and cant feel the motivation to do anything everything feels tiring futile or pain i am incredibly tired for no reason at all and not even my little dog can cheer me up though he tries  ruminating constantly   


what i found helps even though it feels like im lying to myself at first is just not allowing my thoughts to reach past a certain point if i start dwelling on negative thoughts i make efforts to stop thinking about it by doing something else or actively dismissing the thoughts i was only able to start doing this with the help of the right therapist and medication i had the wrong therapist for me before finding the right one and the results were disastrous even right now i dont think im normal or all better because i struggle on days where the anxiety feels like itll eat me up alive but im learning how to get through those episodes to feeling more normal i try to convince myself that maybe even if things arent great right now if i focus on making things good and not focusing on the bad things i can change the ending to my story by changing my story to a positive one so kind of like by believing in a positive outcome i can reach for myself it allows me to be stronger in doing what i need to do to make it happen
doesnt matter if you mention it to her or not because thats how youre thinking in your mind which is reflected in your actions
yes it is important to have understanding what i was trying to explain to you is that there is a way to make someone feel understood and heard and sometimes that means just saying that youre sorry you can explain separately why you behaved that way and say your behavior was inexcusable regardless of the reason but if youre apologizing it may be best to only apologize because bringing up your reasoning might just sound like making excuses for yourself or like youre blaming her which you sound like you are like what your response to me sounds like right now 

i had untreated depression it doesnt make the things i did okay while i was in pain or make my husbands hurt any less saying but i did those things because of something you did that hurt me just sounds like blame right now you need to focus on healing your wifes hurt before you can expect her to heal yours

yeah i get you had different views but ultimately her body is the one carrying the baby we probably have different views on abortion however it doesnt change the fact youre making the abortion more about you than the two of you or her which is at the very least a huge reason you are in this situation to begin with 
the problem is that when you are telling someone youre sorry and then add but i did it because of this it doesnt feel to them like you are truly repentant it feels more like youre justifying your behavior yes you want her to understand one of the triggers for you however it indicates there is a lot more going on with you for you to have that reaction and treat her that way for years to have those reactions   


if youre sorry youre going to have to be sorry and not try to defend yourself while owning up to your behaviors  


youll have to be extremely consistent to save your marriage
yes thats a very good point i totally agree
hey op good for you thats awesome its great youre getting out of those unhealthy thinking habits   


yeah its pretty understandable since youre in a much better place now and even if you dont remember the rationale you remember the suffering you experienced with social anxiety perhaps you could try just provide emotional support or help teach ways that you achieved getting out of the social anxiety hole to others
ehhh im a female and that is so not true especially as you get older   


what it comes down to a lot seems to be competence if youre really good at something or really really good looking people will give you more leeway and naturally have more interest i do agree that its more difficult for men due to societal stereotypes and how theyre raised however its not as easy as you claim or a cakewalk for women i actually get the same reaction from people as a female and ive found that means youre talking to the wrong people most importantly people want to be around others who set goals and achieve them
yeah i thought i got out my bad relationship habits in highschool but over a decade later im facepalming myself still over some of my exes like omg how could i let that happen therapy is really working wonders for me though because even if theyre just paid to do it i have at least one person who is being supportive and listening to me

even regularly healthy people who enter abusive relationships have difficulty getting out once theyre enmeshed inside you could be doing all the healthy things possible and the abusive person will just use it as ways to entrap you whether they realize it or not so dont feel bad about that its a very common thing and youre already ahead of the curve because youre being selfaware
have you tried the dog park  


you can let it loose in the small dog section and just go as frequently as you can regularly even for just like 30 minutes ive noticed a lot of dogs at least become more comfortable being around dogs even if theyre not proactively friendly towards them  


i understand if thats not an option though its tough finding a good park and getting the timediscipline to go to one
my dog helped me with my social anxiety having a dog pushes me to go on walks or go to the dog park where its sunny and im doing a small form of exercise walking which makes me feel better serotonin yum it also gives me an easy thing to talk about with other people if you go to a nice dog park caveat nice its weird i notice the quality of people seems to correlate with the quality of the park with grass and hang out there with your puppy people may come up and talk to you but theyre primarily going to talk about dogs and everyone is very friendly the ice is broken because everyone there loves dogs it gives you something to bond over or at least have basic conversation ask them about their dog how they trained their dog how they got their dog etc

if you dont want basic conversation just obviously have headsets in or something and people will leave you alone while youre walking or at the dog park

having my dog also helps me when i go to group things where im not that liked because i can just hang out with my furry buddy i feel calmer when hes around i also feel more loved

since youll be getting a puppy youll have lots of time to bond and play take your dog to a training class while its young and a dog park because then it will become well socialized and behaved also get it around kids walk it 2x a day feed it at regular times 2x a day for whatever exercise requirements it has and youre golden youre not only training the dog but the dog is really training you to develop good habits and discipline as time goes on you and the dog will bond and love each other and develop little things between you

for instance because even though my dogs not a cuddly guy hell come up and lie down against me if im down hell try to cheer or get me up in various ways like i do this thing that annoys him where hell be all sleepy and i pick him up to lie him down cheek to cheek with me his tolerance has gotten higher and hell stay for a few seconds before getting off lately when ive been really down and im in bed hell come and flop on me of his own volition like a bribe to get me to feel better  

be sure to update us with what happens congratulations on your anniversary this month is our anniversary too   
reading my previous comment im not sure if what i said was clear 

like i said if youre talking to husbands then theyre speaking to you from their viewpoint as man to man which is to try be considerate of their wifes happiness if theyre talking directly to you they might say oh you have to do this and that just because they say you doesnt mean it excludes your wife if you talk to a woman in a happy marriage shell say the same thing only instead of wife she might say each other so or husband assuming its a heterosexual marriage

marriage is a two way street where you both cater to each others needs you do this out of love and faith im not talking about faith in a religious context you do this because it makes the other person happy which makes you happy because your lives together are happy and if theyre a good partner they will do their best to cater to your needs too

my concern is that you are not even married and you are already worried about what will happen if you devote yourself to trying to meet her needs i dont know where youre getting this advice to ignore yourself from just because someone says happy wife happy life doesnt mean you have to ignore yourself its a little concerning that you take happy wife happy life with that negative angle

one of the biggest challenges in marriage is learning that your actions can hurt someone or make them feel a certain way doesnt matter if you didnt mean for that or if you were just trying to make a point you have to learn how to treat each other with respect and communicate in a way that is not hurtful if you or her were to say to the other hey when you did this thing it made me feel like this and really hurt my feelings then it is on that person to take responsibility for their actions and as the guy above put it how their actions affect their partnermarriage instead of getting defensive its not about being right its about working together as a team and being there for each other

i didnt say you were bitter i do think however that youre thinking primarily of yourself and how to protect yourself fear based rather than thinking as a unit

youre already worried and caught up in how youre going to lose in a sense and thinking how to protect yourself what im saying is that marriage is going to be harder than it has to be if you start off and go through it thinking like that instead of investing more into your marriage as a team youll be thinking more tit for tat and thats not going to go well
dont compare your relationship to someone elses having a successful marriage starts and ends with holding yourself 100 percent accountable for your actions and their impact on the marriage and the keys to knowing how to be a better husband are to show her empathy

  
this not just what i copy pasted the whole thing also applies to wives its not limited to a single gender or role it is excellent advice well worded i try to apply this to myself as much as possible for my husband what you are saying is not an absolute and goes both ways however people can only speak from their point of view so if youre talking to mostly men then youll probably hear this quite a bit i dont know a single women who says their marriage works because happy wife happy life  


my advice to you is to not start off your marriage bitter or feeling persecuted but with positivity and giving your partner benefit of the doubt if you start your marriage with a negative lens youre not going to build the reserves a marriage needs to stay strong when things get tough  


also please take into consideration the post history of posters you listen to there are a lot of people who are bitter and carry a disdain for marriage and what it stands for because theirs has effectively failed or they dont like their wife there are plenty on this sub and after awhile their names are easy to recognize because theyre always the ones promoting divorce or how marriage sucks and talk about wanting affairs  


thank you u3mnilez i am going to copy paste this advice for myself as it is beautiful
thanks for taking the time to give out support and positivity 3  


i hope your life is filled with love and good things
really because what i thought you wrote in your comment about how they should believe her without pi proof was pointing out the obvious  my statement was more along the lines of what upinkoveralls said which is that its one thing to know what is an unhealthy behavior and its another thing to be able to do something about it or for it to change stating that a situation isnt what it should be isnt really helpful on its own
just because people should be a certain way doesnt mean they are or they will act it same goes for words people say stuff all the time but what they do can be completely different
hm my husband is my best friend and he tells me im his all the time though sometimes i go and also more than best friends right haha were definitely each others best friend
lol you got my upvote for hilarity and wit
the therapist may be suggesting you also get individual therapy because relationships habe to have a certain amount of strength to be able to go through with it it may be entirely possible his therapist doesnt think your husband is ready  and im seeing some flags that make me believe this is quite possible

if there is abuse in a relationship if one person is abusive  then couples counseling is not recommended it is a big no no 

at the very least an individual therapist can help you cope and make sense of your situation 


im beginning to think this bordlover guy is just uoldfashionmarine in disguise or maybe i have a hard time accepting that more of these types of people exist and take the time to be so mean and hurtful so many of his posts are likedivorce and his advice is the most negative out there

just like those trolling mgtows who have try dump their poison on everyone and dont have the decency to leave everyone else alone because theyre unhappy  and trying to believe everything is someone elses fault and theyre the best thing that graced this earth

this guy just seems to want to get into a fight and its like why are you here what kind of loser do you have to be to dedicate your life to such self absorbed hate and bugging people on the internet about it must be lonely af
yeah
people arent always capable of the things they may want or wish for some people may try to work past being cheated on  but without the perfect blend of perspective  forgiveness and love  many can find it a deal breaker because they realize the trust is too shattered sometimes the cheater isnt trying hard enough either some people lack self awareness some circumstances are different from others


by getting married your typical monogamous marriage has the expectancy of exclusivity i wouldnt say its the cheated on persons fault for not being truly married cheating is a severe violation of that type of marriages principles 
thats a really noble and respectable way of responding to your situation  op  i know people who would try to manipulate or force the situation

i just wish the world rewarded people like you more i really hope that you find happiness and healing for your heart through all this
errr if you think race doesnt play a factor in peoples lives white male privilege does exist just because the obamas have reached success despite this doesnt mean that white male privilege isnt a thing and you hear about all these kinds of issues in the news about black people being unjustly attacked and treated much more harshly than white people just on the basis that other races are treated harsher than others means there is racial privilege

gender also plays into things you hear all the time about how women arent in the top positions or are getting paid less than their male counterparts have you read about the toxicity of pixars work culture

dont have to be a bat shit crazy left to see these things are real sure just like anything that term might get tossed around a little too easily but you cant just downplaygloss over it either
yes i understand i was merely addressing your statement i dont know enough about the situation op is describing through her knowledge to have an educated opinion on it i addressed your statement because as much as it is true in most relationships whether theyre healthy or struggling it is very dangerous and not true when applied to abusive ones
cheaters often trickle truth as well
actually if you read more into toxicabusive relationships and such there are situations where more responsibility lies in the destructive partner it is a common myth to think that in all relationship situations its two people there are situations where it really can lie within one persons issues

not saying thats the case here just that always is far too much generalization and there is psychology to prove it

source should i leave or should i go by lundy bancroft
you may be experiencing something called traumatic bonding it occurs in abusive relationships


hmmm perhaps try go to rweddingplanning  they are really good about answering those questions they can probably help with the specific wording and such  


i know a couple who asked specifically for no big gifts as they had to fly back home and got them anyway so keep in mind that youre probably still going to get stuff another couple i know asked that people just give them gift cards since they were moving to canada i dont think its too rude to ask as long as people know the circumstances
weirdly as much as i wish it was otherwise i dont think this part is true ive seen plenty of situations where either gender have no problem still pursuing for some it can even become a kind of fetish 

maybe it is just occasional just even then it feels like it happens way too much
i heard bear is tough to eat because of the odor however if done right it can be eaten in lieu of beef it seems  


source a blog post about a man who took home a bunch of bear meat and cooked with it
yeah i can second this experience people treat you more seriously as a unit and being someones spouse lends a sense of permanence and importance you are officially your own little family and a part of each others family 

admittedly its a little strange when someone who previously didnt really care to interact or get to know you suddenly become friendlier its like you didnt care or support me before

others may have a different experience but i have found that i feel different by being married as well theres a wonderful sense of commitment and security
i believe they make things specifically for this purpose  you stick it on the side of the tub and smear peanut butter all over it supposedly makes it easier to have a spot for your doggy to lick the pb and also to clean up after bathtime
upvote to that
why should any woman have to defend themselves from you it seems like you just want a fight and to invalidate them just like you invalidated the man who tried to answer you
 if you look at his post history  hes already frequenting rmgtow   

ive begun to notice that mgtows like to come to subs like this to either try provoke people or say rude hurtful things to people struggling
thanks for sharing this ive been wondering why sometimes my husband will accuse my intentions of being the worse thing possible i often blame it on myself because there was a selfish period i went through while he knew me not knowing who to date or who to trust yet i also know he went through an abusive relationship for four years ive been trying to show him that i mean the best and i love him sometimes its hard having to defuse situations that dont need to be situations if you know what i mean   


from your perspective if you dont mind me asking what are things that i could do to help show him that i am trustworthy and not trying to leave or hurt him
to be honest the time that i gained the most weight was when i was really unhappy felt friendless and further isolated myself i started losing weight when i went decided to go try expand my social circles through any venue possible as well as only store healthy foods in the house no chips etc 

i completely relate to your situation about not wanting to reach out to people because youre uncomfortable about where you are ive been there while i agree its not best to totally unload on people who come newly into your life whether a first time or again and that sometimes i just plain dont want to because im ashamed or uncomfortable with myself i have come to learn in my experience that having people in my life to talk to help me pull through you can take baby steps or go at a pace youre comfortable it may actually make you feel better than worse to try give the friendship a shot if you really dont want to though then thats also okay just it might be worth trying despite how you may feel about yourself right now and your friends compatibility 

like i said i know the feeling of totally not wanting to and being in that position the one thing that started to pull me out of it was when a girl at school wanted to be my friend friendships are harder to come by as we get older so people who come to you wanting to be a friend are truly a gift
love this post it was a much needed warming for my heart on a difficult day would love to hear more stories about these two what happened when they first met
as atheists we chose to get married because we fell madly in love with each other and wanted to commit we felt we could be with each other for the rest of our lives because what we experienced with each other was meaningful and different were also both more on the romantic and possessive side so for us its something we want and take pride in being married to each other sharing the same name the sense of permanency the ability to say this is my husband and for him to say im his wife he enjoys doing that knowing that we want the same thing and were going to fight like hell to keep it umedievaleagle couldnt have worded it more perfectly at the end of her post because i feel the same way about my husband 

to quote this man is my present and my future and i choose him everyday

were a unit and were still learning how to be a unit together for us my husband and i we werent thinking too much about the legal benefits when we became engaged we find those to be quite nice and appreciate them a lot though since we werent together for that long we just wanted to be married to each other
not really a surprise because my father had a history of cheating on my mom all the time while they were dating while she was pregnant

found out when my dad finally met a korean woman who took care of him the way he always wanted and im pretty sure is a former patient of his if not a current patient at the time they were dating bullied my mom into signing her half of the house over before asking her for a divorce came home one day on holidays and he has a surprise he needs to talk to us about turns out he also has a daughter so i have a little half sibling i am never allowed to meet my mom has her own issues 

jokes on him the woman got sick of his crap and sued him for a monthly 7k payment for the child and i dont know what else im assuming theyre not together anymore because my dad is currently dating his receptionist who is thai and who he will tell others is a nurse when she isnt
its probably not worth your time to try figure out why hes like this while i dont know whether your relationship has gone so far as to be called abusive they do say that women in abusive relationships will often spend a lot of time trying to figure out why their partner says or does the things they do that are hurtful and in the end theres really no point to it because it comes down to them wanting to control you  it sounds at the very least that this man is controlling

they act nice because thats how they keep you hooked they act nice so you stay they then act badly then act nice so you will keep thinking that its not going to happen again and you know what happens its like a carrot on a stick a partner should not be dangling what a relationship should be in front of you they should actually give you a relationship where you feel loved and safe

a person who idealizes you then cuts you down is not a healthy person to be with they want you to be someone they have constructed in their head instead of loving you as you are a little idealization is good but not like this

i was in a relationship that started off great honeymoon although he wasnt really my type i ended up breaking that off because although he wasnt abusive he was far too controlling for me this guy sounds very controlling and selfish the two things you should definitely look to avoid in a future partner no matter what gender you are honestly for myself i dont even like those qualities in friends especially if they are like that in the first few months to a year because thats the time where people are usually on their best behavior if this is the best hes got then its not going to get better from here do your best to set boundaries because thats an important part of getting people to treat you properly as well
no anal were not ready to go there yet feel theres much more left to explore and enhance still without doing that quite yet 

he doesnt watch porn
i would be asking this eventually even if he didnt have this current problem toys tools fun things im pretty sure its psychological and the main thing is just making safe a fun safe and freeing experience i also just want to add more to our sex life i understand that by putting these both together in the same post why you get that idea

it is mostly him at the same time i can still do the most i can and its partially me its a combination of things

lots of physical issues like i said though i sort of ruled it out because he was like that before and there were no problems that and a bunch of other things concerning our relationship are factors im taking in too that id rather not get into here

im considering editing the post to simply ask for reocmmendations because like i stated earlier they are things i would be asking about anyway because 1 cant orgasm without clitoral stimulation so would like to get clitoral vibrator that is easy to use during sex 2 physical problems have led to me feeling loosey goosey and id like to change that with kegel balls 3 even if our sex life was great doesnt mean i cant try find ways to make it better

thank you for your insight and for reading my post because yes you are right the root issue isnt going to be fixed by any of these things i wrote about that other stuff in case other people had experience with such situations and could possibly contribute advice or anecdotal experience on how to treat it not necessarily solve it like a magic button though that would be great more like how to treat the situation as to try improve it or things that were helpful
a really good resource book to look into would be why does he do that by lundy bancroft it will give you knowledge to assess your situation as well as valuable advice   


a friend of mine once told me instead of asking whether he loves you ask yourself whether he treats you well do you feel like you are loved accepted for who you are encouraged to grow and nurtured   


to be honest with you this behavior sounds abusive which is different from having anger management issues
that sounds so cute what kind of hamster hamster tax
my previous dog an elderly maltese was quite smart one testament to his intelligence was when the overnight animal hospital he was staying in gave me a check in call the caller remarked how smart he was because they noticed he would only bark when his pad needed changing rather than sleeping in it once he barked and they saw that his space was clean so they were like  they checked him over and found out that his medication needed adjusting you couldnt tell just by looking at him they had to do tests and things

he didnt like it when my roommate yelled at me once during a fight he would sit in front of me a tiny 5 pound maltese and stare at my roommate never letting him out of his sight or at his back he would rotate himself he stared so hard my roommate felt really bad also my dog was kinda grudgy so he was snubby towards my roommate for awhile after that

we moved and i went for a walk in our new city i said time to go home and started walking in one direction my dog refused to move and insisted i go the opposite way he actually ended up leading me home haha 

he also was very good at hiding his pill medications because hed put them deep under his tongue hold his mouth shut as tightly as he could and then wander off behind the nearest piece of furniture to spit it out as time went on his technique and follow through became more sophisticated i warned a vet tech who was going to take him to the back to give him some pills that hes very good and stubborn at hiding medication she was like yeah yeah didnt really believe me took him to the back she came saying you were right hes really good at that

same dog would also slowly in a tactical way try to steal sandwiches off the table he was toothless so this was a lot more difficult for him than it was for a normal dog he would mouth the wrapper and pull it gradually inch closer to him whenever i looked away it was so incremental that i didnt notice until i caught him almost getting it off the table at the end he really liked meatball subway sandwiches

my current little papillon is quite brilliant as well hes young so he doesnt have the causeandeffect knowledge my previous dog had quite yet hes quick and clever though and quite empathetic 

every morning while my dog was still very sleepy i would take him and flop him onto my chest in a way so that our faces would be touching cheek to cheek i would hold him for awhile like this i did this everyday one day i got very depressed and i didnt get up out of bed i didnt flop him that morning the little papillon tried to grab my fingers to pull me out of bed and licked my face when that didnt work he came over and flopped himself so that his face was against mine the way i did it every morning he knew i was unwell and he was trying his best to get me up this was a pretty big deal because while our dog is a velcro dog and enjoys having physical contact he isnt really affectionate or likes being actively touched 
to be honest sometimes i get the sense that men or people in general sometimes dont want to examine or admit certain feelings they are having they may be having these feelings but not willing to acknowledge them because those feelings make them uncomfortable either they dont want to admit it or think of themselves in that way or theyre just subconsciously avoiding it

no matter how blunt or honest someone may be no one is perfectly self aware all the time we all to some degree modify our perspectives on reality to make things easier to bear and sometimes as the person on the other side of the situation we want to believe what theyre telling us is true because its what we want to be true too  


it sounds like theres baggage there because he is associating and reacting to so many things concerning her and their relationship ended long ago the thing that makes me think this  is because he thinks of her whenever he sees his dog and because he asked you to change a song he associates with her
would you say the 23 years of marriage beforehand served as a foundation to help him be strong enough to pull through that dark time for your marriage
a good course of action to consider is to start couples therapy for you and your ex before the resentment gets too deep on either end hopefully couples therapy will help you guys open up communicate as well as receive perspective on the situation in a way that allows you two to grow and foster love for each other it will also give both of you support in moving forward and sometimes people will listen to a third party rather than the other person involved in the situation with them i strongly recommend starting sooner than later because when resentment roots itself in its very hard to get rid of and starts affecting everything 

i have experience with a similar situation we thought we could deal with the problem and honestly waiting so long to start probably made things worse we love each other but things are a lot more messy than they need to be
other than people getting the wrong idea about me due to me being anxious thinking im weaker or lesser i do have one problem id like to fix

when people sincerely apologize to me i usually dont know what to say so i end up being quiet and then they probably think i dont care or appreciate their apology and am therefore a jerk its because i do though that i end up not knowing what to say because in that moment saying i forgive you thank you seems incredibly awkward probably due to a low self esteem sort of thing though looking back that would have been the right thing to say now too much time has passed for me to really bring it up again to readdress it
haha i wish i could do that where i live though people would view me as the bad one for doing that even though people who do that kind of thing deserve to get called out on
thank you for going out of your way to suggest these things to me im excited to check those out  


ive been reading the nyt to start as i find their articles informative and so well written
congratulations on your baby  


thanks for taking the time to respond im definitely interested in seeing alternative perspectives 
can totally relate to people having the wrong and lesser impression due to anxiety the backhanded compliment is a hard one to respond to as well its like thanks for not thinking as little of me now

your post also caught my attention because im looking to actually expand my scientific and political knowledge  if you dont mind me asking would you have any advice on particular websites to look at or on how you personally continue to expand your own knowledge  


im trying to keep up better with current events for a start in terms of improving my political knowledge however i know i have a long ways to go
hey op just wanted to say thank you for your post as a woman who has dealt with unwanted physical contact from men its great how youre being so selfaware and want to be better and turn your shame into something good your post is already a sign of how your mentality has changed and are already better than you were before 
thanks for your thoughtful answer im happy for you guys that she got her heart transplant youre working things out so well and are enjoying each other 
if you dont mind me asking when you say you faced adversity was it conflict between the two of you or stressful life situations  what would you say helped strengthen versus weaken
heylo 

its great youre being so selfaware its not easy and responsible for your actions and not justifying your behavior  just continue your best to not repeat those actions and be as nice and loving as possible with him and over time hopefully you will be able to forgive yourself when those actions dont feel like they define you anymore its wonderful you recognize the good things in your bf maybe what will help you feel better is the next time there is a stressful thing going on youll do small little sweet things for your bf too your bf buying the cars is very cute and it is nice of him to put on the shower head

i may not have had the same situation as you but i do understand and know the feeling of being ashamed by ones previous actions as well as finding it hard to forgive oneself its good too that youre not brushing things under the rug being so self aware gives you the ability to be more thoughtful and nice in the future 
thank you for taking the time to read and providing me with a resource yes he matches some but not all i believe this behavior is rooted in his unhappiness with our lifestyle and how he feels i do not contribute there are a lot of things he doesnt match so in that sense i have some hope i do not think he is a bad person maybe to me he becomes a bad person but i dont think he is one i have a lot of faults especially that i am unemployed

i tried setting a boundary last night well see how it goes today he was yelling being scary and accusing me of stuff i told him i just want to talk calmly and that i do love him and want to be with him then i walked outside for awhile at like 2 am in the morning
this video is happiness inducing

hello im so incredibly sorry for your loss your pain your anguish 

the loss of feeling in parts of your body is a common symptom of people who have undergone trauma and ptsd what you may be experiencing is not only grief but ptsd from the horrific and sudden loss of your most beloved attachment figure when the person we are most attached to is ripped away from us it is not only psychological but physiological we feel like we are dying 

a lot of people here recommend emdr which is something i am personally going to therapy for and am only just beginning there is a book that i think may be able to help you feel less alone and understand a little of whats happening to you as well as show you that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and most importantly show you how it is so important to have compassion and love for yourself through this difficult time 

the book is called the body keeps the score brain mind and body in the healing of trauma by bessel van der kolk in there are many peoples stories and so many insights near the end of the book he talks about how these people found solutions one of which is emdr which he praises greatly there is one womans story that i was reminded of when i read your post and she was able to heal through emdr although like others say some things work in greater efficiency than others thats what i mean by the light at the end of the tunnel that others have found a way out of their whirlpool of pain and that its possible for you to too

you say you do not have much money right now and are saving up for a counselor so i hope that perhaps at least this book can provide knowledge and comfort for you in this time as you also say you are a book loving cat lady like the many other people here when you seek a counselor i hope you look for one that is specialized in trauma ptsd emdr and the other categories that people have mentioned because what you are experiencing goes far beyond grief

i may an internet stranger but please consider me one of those people you can message even if its just to vocalize those thoughts have someone to listen or have someone who will respond and help you through those thoughts i am not a professional but at the very least i can give companionship and encouragement
wow good job on your regime i would say so yes 

mind if i ask you about your regime
your makeup looks great your skin looks like it has a beautiful glow to it and i love the pretty eyeshadow color
heylo a lot of people made good suggestions i hope mine will be of use to you 

 one thing i suggest researching is baking because baking is relatively easy you prep the ingredients then pop it in the oven and can easily clean up using aluminum foil you can also make things in big batches that allow you to save for future meals or have leftovers quiches chicken casseroles and its really easy to make tasty vegetable sides as well olive oil salt and pepper the foods you can make through baking are also delicious so its a nice return for not too much effort 

like others said it can also be a fun thing to do with your so and build fun memories

psychologically cookingbaking can also be really rewarding when you find out you can make some delicious things for a fraction of the price that you pay out at restaurants such as bone marrow an appetizer that easily runs 20 bucks when i can get many more bones for that price and cook it in literally 15 minutes not only is it cheaper but in my experience you get a ton more marrow too and no i dont live on a farm i live in socal 
we ourselves are located in la but our actual wedding will be taking place in oak glen ca
