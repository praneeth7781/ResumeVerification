with no growth is that enough for you to cover your half for 30 yrs how about when your partner retires will your own money be enough to travel if you feel like or to do whatever you two have talked about you need to add some income to this partnership if you want it to remain happy and healthy yea you should bring it up to your dad not in a confrontational way but more in a maybe he doesnt realize this way he might be under the impression that step mom would be a decent person and split the inheritance when she passes equally when there isnt any guarantee of that point out that the majority of his and wifes assets are from him and not her ask him if hed be ok with his bio kids being totally cut out when step mom passes and does he really think shed have any sense of loyalty to kids that arent hers the most equitable way is for him to leave half to step mom if he predeceases her and half to his bio kids then step mom can divvy up her assets to her kids when she passes you say he didnt want another child and left his ex wife to completely raise his younger son by herself does this mean that he is involved with the first one yes thats what it means the ship wont actually leave cape town till 4 on sat and then you dock in richards bay on tuesday and the boat leaves the next day at 9 pm so you can usually stay out as late as you want before returning to the ship to sleep im not sure how embark would be tho do you actually have to board as usual which would mean be on board at least 2 hrs prior to departure timedo the muster and then are free to get off and explore of course usually people get in the ship way before the 2 hrs prior might just want to ask that you dont want to show up at 5 pm with your bags and check in was meant to be done earlier just leave her alone about this topic shes 19 a lot can change as she gets older im surprised one day with kids did it actually most people would have the attitude of my kids wont be like that or recognize 4 kids is too many maybe shes actually onto your little ploy and is screwing with you that would be hysterical that quote from your dad is great im filing that away to use if i need it you are being completely irrational on this issue they dont see each other on a regular basis they live far away from each other so im guessing at this point they phone or text each other probably when theres something to say other than an ongoing keeping up with each others lives why is this one person so threatening to you im sure theres other people that your bf has dated or hooked up with in the same city you live in where it would be more probable that you would run into could it be that you are jealous that he has such a lifelong friend who probably knows more about your bf than you do k knows everything your bf has done and thought since grade school its not a nice thought that someone else knows your partner that well but its also a testament that your bf can keep a relationship going for so long thats good for you in the long run your bf may say hell be ok cutting contact but somewhere in his mind hes going to be sad that his one constant in his life is gone that might lead to him unconsciously resenting you because youre the reason for that severing of ties you should meet k with a complete open mind you may hate him for legit reasons or you may just find that hes a genuinely good friend to your bf and your fears whatever they are will be alleviated a lot for you to think about here but dont borrow problems that arent there that age gap its gonna become a gaping chasm i have a friend who married with a 20 year gap she was spry and adventurous into her late 40s bad knees got her he was all but housebound happy to stay home with the pets he was tired and the health issues started cropping up thats what youll get caring for a 70 year old at 50 and if you have kids youll have a 70 yo h and a teenager hes a 50 yo mean man with health issues who thinks he hit the jackpot with his much younger gf and what do you get out of this you get to be his nursemaid when his ills come up and you get to take the brunt of his nastiness cut your losses find someone closer to your age and in the same stage of life you two can grow old and sickly together but hed probably be a lot nicer to you who are the same forces that are controlling j epstein i thought he was top of the food chain warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info youre n t a for wanting bro out but i have a diff take your h bot the house are you an owner also i understand being married but it will make a big diff to bil if you tell him whats gonna happen the whole fam will be told you threw him out and its not even your house just saying what bil will say not that its true you are more than expected to shut him down with any rude comments he may make and shut him down hard find anything you can that he may be sensitive about and use it but your h is the one who should be handling his brother as far as moving out you and him have to get on the same page and he needs to deliver it to bro nta he needs to find a new psych and get his own prescription and if he has no insurance hes going to have to it for the visits its ridiculous that youre sharing medicine one of these months you are going to really need it and its not going to be there then its gonna be a big problem and if hes taking 3 a day how many are left for you its nice that you might not need all of it but why should you not have it when you do need it thats fair sorry i was trying to see if theres a pattern of behavior you know him best think back and ask yourself is this how he always was if yes then in a way you allowed him to think youd always do the work and hed benefit from it then a division of chores needs to be struck and he has to agree to then if he doesnt theres your answer he will not ever change if he used to be a more involved partner then you need to figure out what happened that he suddenly took a turn for the worse do a huge self reflection on the whole of your relationship thru all of it see if there were things you missed or you overlooked thinking hed be better or do better as time went on youre so young and its scary when your life is not turning out how you thought it would it can get better but he has to be willing and he at 27 should be acting like a h and father instead hes acting like a teenager who has a part time job for gas money do not be afraid to break up if you think its the best for everyone involved including your baby i will add if the issue with your fam was due to something about him and you chose him it might be time to mend that relationship best of luck to you im gonna need to know what happened with your parents where did you live before this apt i really do not know why you would even entertain the idea of staying with him at this point he doesnt have a full time job he doesnt help you with anything hes semi neglectful with your 8 mo old probably because hes too preoccupied with gaming and when you finally had the guts to call him out for all that he pushes you how much are you willing to put up with how far is too far my advice go back to your parents tell hubby he needs to become a self supporting stable adult if he wants any type of relationship with you then hold him to it he needs a full time job and he needs to be able to support an apt on his own a couple sessions with a therapist would be a bonus maybe hell realize hes a father and he needs to become a partner in this marriage you should have just told her you werent going to see her again after you found out she had a bf you dont have to be mean about it what she does is her business you might have thought by blocking her it was a slight to her but it didnt slight her in the least shes looking for an explanation give it to her tell her to leave your friends alone and then the block her this is a really nice picture youre very talented who isnt remembering your bday its crappy if your parents or sibs forget but any relatives past that is whatever if its your friends why would they remember your bday in either case if your bday is important to you i cant imagine why you had not said anything leading up to the week or day usually something is mentioned about plans that youd like to do for the day honestly your friend should just leave jane alone like who just thinks hm which of my friends can i experiment with why would friend think jane would be receptive to this idea add to it that shes probably feeling emotionally vulnerable right now not having her sister as her go to friend is coming off a bit creepy to me its giving me the ick thanks please explain because i have no idea even if its court ordered it doesnt mean that they have to come to an agreement right samantha could just not agree to any kind of settlement and then it goes to court or can she agree to a settlement and then release any evidence she would have shown at trial that wouldnt be the worst thing but then we wont get to see the m testify this story gets even weirder you hunted for 2 hours you got the kids and then went home by when 7pm did she cancel just so you could come home and she could fight with you over this did the friend cancel and she thought shed be home all night alone which really is a good thing considering 2 small kids and being pregnant most of us would have been thrilled somethings off about her reasoning let this go this time but know you did nothing wrong you tried to do something nice for your wife nta im not sure im understanding why your wife is upset she still went out with her friends no so she got a kid free night out unless her friend also has kids and they were going to entertain each other it seems
