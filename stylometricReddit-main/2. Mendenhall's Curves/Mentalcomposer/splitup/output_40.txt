the ancestry in addition to the bio relationship kind of curious if all the kids ancestry would be exactly alike two birds one stone you know you should get out but why should you leave if hes done then he can get out but id worry about my name being on the lease if its just your name then he leaves if its both of your names then dont go anywhere until you can figure out something with the landlord to get your name off if he stops paying youll be on the hook for it omg just plan to have a meal with each parent and their so if you have to meet them pick a restaurant have a meal then d can go home with gma or gpa for her visit do you not talk with or visit when you drop off your d just how amicable is your relationship with each parent id be more concerned that since your dad is wanted in that country if they have been keeping tabs on him the govt might just know that his wife and d are arriving but i have no idea what country youre talking about t might be turkey in which case i dont know if id be that comfortable going just use the vacay money to bring a few relatives to you other than the house which i agree would cost them a lot of money each month and the nannies what else do they do that they pay for theyre not jetting around the world on humanitarian missions in which theyd need transport and lodging theyre not invited to award shows or hell even dinner parties with the a listers in which theyd need to buy something new to wear i dont pay too much attention to their day to day but theyve gone out to dinner what 2 times oh and cant forget he uvalde visit so if they werent so full of themselves and had to have a huge home for 4 of them theyd probably be doing ok edit nope they wouldnt be ok did some digging their monthly expenses are estimated at about 360000 plus repaying the frogmore renovations of 18000 per month idk maybe 20000 and this is not including landscaping maintenance which i couldnt find these 2 are screwed i have no doubt that she can have a platonic relationship with a guy especially if hes a family friend someones son that her parents were friends with and therefore they grew up together but if you know for a fact she lied you need to talk about it why did she lie you say youre young how young when we are just starting on our dating journey it is possible we lie because we dont want to upset out bf gf of course our inexperience leads us to believe the other person will not know but with social media it always comes out talk to her in a non accusatory way you know her best is she coming across as truthful does she seem like shes lying or trying to hide anything from you what is her reasoning to deceive you while snapping from another guys bed seriously where was he honestly if your gut is saying theres more to this there probably is trust it if youre not long term id say just cut your losses and move on of course im of an age where we didnt have sm so a lot of this is just bizarre to me love or need of her if he ditches her wheres he gonna go yeah what stakes there are no stakes its not a competition theres nothing to lose just go live your fn life and stop making every freakin thing about your what 72 days as a royal she really is a waste of life im sorry there is absolutely zero reasons why this bill should not be pushed thru and voted on it should be obvious to anyone in parliament that these two are not good for the uk never mind the rf and id be ok with a bill that strips the prince title too unless its better to try the second born son for treason in which case im ok with that too whatever it takes to get them distanced for the rf dont you want to spend the holiday with your family if you think this is a long term thing you may as well get used to switching off or just spend it with your own family again and meet up later dont tell him you hate spending time with his family we all grow up getting used to our own familys way of doing things try to find something you can relate to with his mom i know its hard you have nothing in common with a middle aged woman keep it light tv shows local news maybe your job places youve visited etc and im sure you know no religion or politics who was taking all these pics theyre not official royal duty pics so what they had someone follow them around while they were dating before they got engaged during wedding planning and the rf allowed this did she plan on a doc that early on thats some serious long con and adding in you know because no one protected my mum and we all know how that ended im gonna watch it have to see how they spin literally everything to their advantage but how else will they get sympathy if they dont play up how badly they are suffering if we dont see it oh yeah i read the daily mail every morning the amount of articles is unbelievable clicked one but only one since i read here about not giving them clicks to read harry saying something about not knowing what goes on behind closed doors ironic no considering what probably goes on behind their door i can just imagine tw waking this morning screeching to hazbeen look im everywhere just tell her she agreed to the 100 amazon budget and then spent more with her sis if she wants more it has to come out of her separate account its kind of silly to buy so much the first year half the fun is adding on each year and seeing how your tastes are going to change each year im going to assume your parents have met the bf and like him that is literally half the battle but oh boy this has disaster written all over it and i hate to say it but if it goes badly i think itll be your parents fault off the top of my head first off you have got to beat into your parents head that they are absolutely not allowed to talk about their wealth at all no way no how make them understand that saying anything that might reflect badly on his parents is just not done in polite society then forewarn his parents about how your parents are maybe explain that your values arent theirs and ask them to please dont get into it with them and to not take anything they may say personally as much as they would want to who knows tho maybe they will all get along and all your worries are for nothing good luck sorry i dont care how close friends they are those kind of flirty messages are never their way of communication if you have to live constantly checking his phone hes not worth it youll never get to a place where you trust him again therefore leading to never giving your all to this partner and a relationship needs those things its really not that hard to not flirt with others if you are truly invested in the one youre with nta should have done it long ago and just not said anything she probably wouldnt have even noticed and really she wont come over anymore second problem solved keep the album especially if you have kids both my parents are now passed my sister happened to take my parents wedding album home from visiting my step dad one day she brought it over and it was really nice to see them when they were young and in love they divorced when i was small and my dad passed a few years later and putting faces to grandparents i dont really remember they are memories you cannot capture from any other pics that might be floating around my truth your truth is your perception of a situation or your opinion or just you lying there is only the truth as bizarre as it is that he talked about his book and recounted stories its even more bizarre to me that hed get mad when others tried to change the subject like what these arent his friends he can get drunk and vent to these are business associates but i guess when you have no friends youll vent to anyone you can get and if he hadnt made this situation all on his own it would be really sad but he did so its not are you upset that he put down single and that he may get in trouble for it or are you upset that youre not on the house and think if he put down married you would somehow own half the house nah it seems to me that you havent had so much as a conversation with your mom about any of this somehow she found out on her own so can you really blame her for being a little salty about the whole situation she may be in denial or feel as many parents do that youre just labeling yourself because its popular to do so or she may be just hurt that you didnt come to her when you had this revelation stop the passive aggressive crap that shows your immaturity and could actually reinforce your moms thinking that you just want a trendy label have a real honest down to earth talk with your mom stay calm and explain to her whats going on with you even if she gets excited or nasty or dismissive hold your ground calmly she may not jump on board right away either but youre not making any progress as it is and when she agrees to your pronouns give her some leeway if she slips up 14 years is a long time to call you she her and now shes going to have to think before she addresses you every single time honestly i would think a nanny would be a useless expense and its not cheap hes home all day anyway he can take care of the baby and does he not think the baby needs him it is inconceivable that this man is writing all day every day most days hes probably not doing any writing at all thats how the writing process works why does he not want to care and nurture his child go to the office someone in this marriage has to sustain this family just spend what you can easily afford on something that you think she would like dont forget that after the engagement theres a wedding and a honeymoon if you blow all your money on one ring you have to scrimp and save for the rest that comes after yes you are crazy your bf and his friend actually asked to vacation at your deceased dads house without you then when you rightly said no they change their trip conveniently to where you are also going to be vacationing but youre all not going together why is that oh it gets better the friend not even your bf ask again to stay at your dads house oh but again youre not there but shes bringing her friend just tell them both to go to hell
