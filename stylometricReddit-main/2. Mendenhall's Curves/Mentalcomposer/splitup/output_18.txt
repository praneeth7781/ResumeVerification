better as you found out you really didnt like the way the first girl treated you take your time with the new girl dont go all in until youve dated for a while and make sure she is someone you have an actual real connection with and really get a hold of your emotions you should not be upset because you may have caused someone to be sad its going to happen doesnt make you a bad person and frankly the first girl doesnt sound like such a nice person with the way she spoke to you any partner is going to at times say something you dont like but its in those times that you think about what caused them to say it reflect and ask yourself if its justified and fight the times it is not and admit when it is first off dont have the open relationship talk until you have exhausted every other possible solution keep in mind even if she says ok she may not be and she will be home with your child while youre out with another woman which could then lead to a complete breakdown of your marriage tread very carefully here so its been 4 years and she hasnt given you any explanation explain to her that she can no longer put off having this conversation theres obviously something going on with her and you need to know what it is it is not fair to you or the relationship that shes not willing to discuss a fundamental issue that you feel you are having yes of course caring for the baby is important but not to the detriment of the marriage there needs to be a balance start there and see what she says and where the conversation goes did you ask why what did she say the reason is im surprised you stayed that long do you miss really her or do you just miss the idea of having someone in your life your whole schedule is all changed up maybe you just need to get into a new normal humans need physical touch we need to feel intimacy with our partners it almost seems cruel to me that shed withhold cuddling and kissing does she think you really cannot control yourself thats insulting do i have it right that she just decided after 6 mo of dating to no longer have sex because you were together 1 12 yrs but havent had sex in 1 yr nta wear what you like and have her son tell his mom that shes crossing a line with trying to dictate what you both wear i liked showers better when the bride or mom to be had no idea and was surprised your mil would have had a stroke if she saw what i wore to mine i didnt even know it was my shower so it was leggings and a long sweater with sneakers i dont think so id think they arent really hot like this these are a bit pricey so id shop around nta at all candles are dangerous and a 10 yo really cannot grasp the absolute seriousness of if something goes wrong anyway buy her a few of the battery operated tea lights that she can place in nice holders shell get the effect of candles with no risk you know what tho its a big bday you only turn 40 once youre already splurging for the haven go for it make this trip your ultra splurge for yourself im sure you deserve it live it up and one other tip if you drink red wine the eastwest red blend is really good its an ncl proprietary blend and the gerard bertrand cab is also really good figure out realistically how many drinks you are going to have from the premium list add in the cost of the excursions youre looking at taking and see if the cost works out to even close to what youd pay extra then id say yea if you really only like one or two baileys after dinner lets say then it might be cheaper to just pay for those few drinks and if youre gonna sit on a beach a few times or can excursions for much cheaper maybe not and your sis can get the unlimited wifi that she wants its all really a money numbers game but with sis not drinking i dont think youre gonna come close to it making money sense that extra 300 vs just paying gratuities on the regular free at sea drink pkg makes a big diff i would think i think a trip to dmv would be the next step hopefully you can get a decent person there that can help you track down where your license physically is right now maybe they can cancel that license and reissue one to your new address try having your license showing the physical address but your paperwork having a mailing address the po box i know dmv is the absolute last place you want to go but i would think thats the best way as far as the paperwork id use my married name show the ss card and ins card id make sure my insurance is in the married name like your ss card what do ppl who dont have dls do i wonder if they need more show the ss married nameold dl maiden and marriage certificate connect the two to prove youre the same person take a look at this page im looking into using this transport from livorno its 35 each but you have to get to livorno town from the port what they mean is you have the original invoice which shows the lower amount that you paid and shows you owe a zero balance that is your proof that you paid what was due your lower priced invoice should have a date on it and you can show that you paid the amount on the day you booked i would call them it doesnt seem like they actually understood what you were asking them they told you it was paid in full it didnt mention anything about why the amounts changed make sure you explicitly say that you have an original invoice with a diff dollar amount im grasping at straws right now but it looks like its the ksf discount is it possible the child discount is dependent on the age of the child and once you corrected your sons bday it put him into a diff age category so the discount is different idk never heard it being done that way thats what they just dont get they get elected and vote or support whatever their own personal opinion is on an issue or they just go along with the party line whether they agree with it or not or whether we agree with it or not how about they start listening to what their constituents want we elected them to do what we want not whatever it is they want these people are supposed to be our voice since you have your original confirmation you can ask them to go over each charge one by one to find the difference just throwing this out did they maybe add on their cruise insurance you dont have to get it but i would strongly advise you have some kind of insurance or did they add in the daily service charge which doesnt have to be pre paid but will be billed to your onboard acct each day you sail that is a cop out answer im sure she loves her kitchen at home the best but do you want your reception in her living room does he really want his mom cooking the day of his wedding all day does she even realize that shes going to miss her sons wedding by being in the kitchen is she gonna take the apron off for the mother son dance at least come on im sure shes a great cook but she can leave the cooking to someone else and just enjoy the day you work and hes a house boyfriend but hes your house boyfriend who doesnt live with you so basically youre supporting some guy who you dont know and somehow think this is an actual relationship and you think its perfectly reasonable to buy him a car and not just any car a luxury car and you think the biggest problem in this whole scenario is that his parents are going to think some other imaginary girl bought him the car he just magically shows up with one day esh he got mad that you werent looking at him while he was trying to show you something but he must not have been looking at you when he started this conversation about something you should look at or else he would have known you were looking at something else so he cant complain you werent looking when neither was he this is a stupid argument anyway my doc told me to just take vitamin d and calcium i think were trying to see if it will stave of osteoporosis my mom was on fosomax for osteoporosis and didnt have any side effects this was a while ago tho idk if theres newer drugs a nice photo album of the two of you through the years if you have any special thoughts on what was going on in the pictures you can write them in show him what all those years meant to you by having him in them and of course the obligatory 1 dad shirt or coffee mug i had barely knew my future mil when we got engaged of course we met but we didnt spend very much time together my mother had one rule she and only the the bride to be would be going dress shopping she paid for out dress and it was a motherdaughter thing no friends no sisters i have 3 no anybody else none of the mils had a problem with this once it was explained and my mil only had boys so she would never get that experience now i also have 2 brothers and saw how mom was left out of any wedding planning so i invited my mil to the food tasting at the catering hall just me and her h was workingand brought and showed her everything we were debating on i wanted her to feel involved it was her sons wedding also your sil and mil are out of order definitely no argument there but mil may feel hurt and sil is fighting her battle which she shouldnt so maybe just try to be a little more open with some of the other wedding planning you dont have to take her picks or advice but at least make her feel like she is in the know so to speak and remember its her sons wedding also she just doesnt want to show up and have no idea what its gonna be like nta i absolutely love your idea it showed everyone what was involved and exactly why they couldnt handle it and bravo for handling the grandparents brilliant i think your h should be the one telling the kids he can explain why it wasnt a good idea at this time mostly because he couldnt keep up with the conditions he might mention it wouldnt be very fair to mom who doesnt want the dog if she got stuck taking care of it as an added bonus i agree why william would ever want to even talk to h after such a betrayal is beyond me some things you just dont come back from and what h has done is one of them can you even imagine the deep hurt w feels coming from his only sibling i can see charles wanting some sort
