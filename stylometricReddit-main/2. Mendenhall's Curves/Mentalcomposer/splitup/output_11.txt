if thats where he draws a line pretty convenient for a guy who doesnt want kids but what happens if he for whatever reason decides hes not sexually attractive to you or what if you get sick and cant have sex for a while is it ok then for him to cheat because you know he just cant go without i feel like you are going to be doing anything you can to keep him from cheating probably to your own detriment and it wont make a diff anyway im thinking hes already cheating when youre not there he cant possibly be expected to go without his sex needs being met for a whole month gasp if i was you id slow this relationship way down if he wants to move to canada ok but hed be getting his own place but im not you so id get rid of this guy i want my partner to go into a relationship with the absolute idea that he has found the person he wants to be with and not having pre conceived ideas of circumstances of when hed cheat 11 hours non stop to hawaii in economy this was the smallest seat ive ever been in i dropped my ear bud right in front of my seat and had to contort my body to reach for it im not a large person either made it 7 hours ok but the last 4 were really really tough and then had to do it again to get home the whole family agrees that well never do that again im not in texas but im not so sure there are specific parking lot laws drive slowly thru the lot i think my shopping center has a 10 mph speed sign yes please stop for pedestrians crossing in front of your car the lane directly in front of the stores near me have stop signs usually close to each of the stores entrances exits you dont have to stop as soon as you see a person but it really depends on how far away they are from you if theyre like 2 stores away you slow down and or stop until they cross id wait until the person was pretty close to the other side of the road before scooching past especially if theyre older or have children with them just so they feel safer better to be safer and drive slow or stop if youre not sure nta i would not apologize for any of it substance or tone your tone needed to be what it was to get the message across that he is no longer welcome to stay too bad if it upset him you basically said what your mother has been unable to do on her own he needs to get out your mom said she needs a break from him so now she has it wouldnt the line be drawn by what are natural genetic advantages to a person if one is just as is said naturally gifted in a sport should they be not allowed to participate because its not fair to the other participants their genetic make up is basically what is making them what we would call naturally gifted but with trans women athletes they have an unnatural advantage over women due to their genetic make up as being born as men hormones may counteract some of this but it is never going to completely reverse the effects of the genetic processes of male puberty on things like strength and muscle mass are we talking during a marriage or a dating situation why would you think that just because one person cheated you will never find another who wont cheat if the cheating happened during a marriage i would say take some time for yourself dont be in any rush to get into another relationship treat it like a death you need time to grieve the loss and when you feel ready then you can get back out there if you were just dating this shouldnt be causing you so much angst that youd be averse to ever dating again this was one scummy person out of thousands you will meet in your life time millions of people cheat and as many get cheated on it happens we deal with it and get on with living its not the end of the world why are you letting him insult you this is a person who loves you id hate to see him when he doesnt like you i suspect he wants you to do better so you will have more money to bail him out with you know this but you are doing just fine you can pay your bills support your kid and really can buy whatever you want if not right this minute but with some planning stop giving him money and do not move in with him ever you will be stuck paying for it by yourself after 7 years youre finally getting tired of this i wouldnt have lasted 7 days be honest with yourself here he absolutely is not going to wake up one day and be secure enough that he will stop this behavior so you either put up with it or you break up hes way too insecure to have any middle ground first off dont change anything fundamentally you for anyone second you said youre studying for med school so use all this extra free time to do just that but get out at least for a bit every day take a walk study in a park coffee shop anywhere else than where you live third youre young but not a child you started dating as a kid tho idk what you did that he thinks you hurt him so bad that he doesnt want to date anymore but it does not matter this breakup is not totally your fault so stop thinking that way there will be others you will date and break up with use this as a lesson to not lose yourself to a partner fourth get back in touch with the friends that you let fall to the side if you did indeed lose them from studying too much they should understand fifth stop studying so much there is a point where it doesnt actually help studying is for review not for learning the material this all will pass and be a distant memory you will look back on and wonder why you ever wanted him so badly to begin with yup me too they wanted to make it look like she was and harry lobbied for her but the palace said no way then your wife had all the time in the world to pick him up from school and she should have plus your d was away and its a perfect time for some mom son bonding time your son is 13 hes going into some crazy years your wife should take those rides to and from school as an opportunity to just talk to ty about whats going on in his life and if that includes james even better they do say car rides are the best way to get kids to open up i think theres no reason you should have known who was picking up ty since im guessing your wife stays home with the kids and usually does the school runs but if your wife is home why is your 4 yo at grandmas for the last month since you had discussed not letting him have too much contact with your son i think it was short sighted of your wife to allow him to pick the kids up for weeks weeks i think for this instance you two need to figure out what to do together and tell ty together honestly i think a good talk about what he says and where its said should be enough what kind of punishment can you give for a kid saying stupid stuff but whatever but i also think you and wife should discuss that shes going to need to dole out the discipline when the issue happens and im not talking punishments im talking correcting bad behavior when its not even so bad so that it doesnt get bad this isnt 1950 where its wait until your father gets home because people now feel like every day has to be a good one a magical day where their partner makes them feel special at all times their lives have to be picture perfect their partner the perfect one the proposal and marriage have to be planned down to the last detail and one little bump just ruins the whole thing its all so superficial that is not reality a lot of long relationships are quite mundane but nobody wants to stay thru that to get to the next special moment but the mundane makes the special that much more add to that the sense of entitlement it seems people have everyone cannot have the dream job and make a million dollars so they can buy the biggest house and the most expensive car so people basically are unsatisfied with their own lives so they feel they have to jump from one person to the next looking for someone else to make their life satisfying married 30 years since our 20s and it just works because we are ok with the highs and lows we just take what comes and deal with it you sit back and take stock of whats going on in your own life then you decide am i going to let my life be dictated by others or am i going to take matters in my own hands leave the emotion out of it no issue is ever solved by the heart you need to use your head in this instance you get mad id be thinking who the heck does this person think they are to treat me badly when ive done nothing to deserve it hes obviously up to no good im not gonna sit here and take it im out he can do whatever he wants but im not sticking around and watching and then you say that loud and firm this isnt a discussion its a decision its your decision ok so you know exactly what kind of person he is do you think you deserve to be talked to in this way do you think a partner has the right to demean you to get what he wants why are you still entertaining being involved with him this is a person who has denied your existence to his family based on his religion im gonna guess and say his religion probably would frown upon him asking for nudes to get off to that in itself is so disgustingly gross to me that id cut contact with him he sees you as less than and you have allowed yourself to believe it tell him to take a hike find a real man who will treat you with dignity and respect have you ever met this guy and by that i mean have you ever lived in the same place and actually dated and are long distance due to one of you needing to move you find std meds and you didnt ask what he was taking it for did he willingly tell you he was going for an std test and you didnt ask him why he felt the need to and hes checking himself all night and again you didnt ask what he was looking for do you two even talk to each other yeah you know whats going on you guys have been together since youre teens its run its course ill be honest i would not continue dating him drugs are a hard no for me you say youre ok with coke at a party but really its never going
