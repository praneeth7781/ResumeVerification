difference did she even feel bad about co ti king to blow up at you partners can only take so much abuse before they snap and you did but at least you recognize that its not a point you want to get to ever again so thats good time for some serious lay down the rules talk if she does this frequently explain that its not making a happy home for anyone especially your children she should not be ranting and raving over everything if its a one off find out why this day in particular she was so obsessed with d being ready at the exact time and by making a huge deal of it im sure she didnt leave when she wanted to anyway so what exactly did she achieve she achieved having her h disgusted by the her behavior and ultimately his own nta how cheap is he that 40 is a big deal he knew it was going to be too big so its not really a surprise you didnt have another bag which he also knew so what did he expect you to do magically produce another bag out of nowhere your h is an ass im leaning toward you being the ah but not on purpose youre young and probably havent had to make big decisions yet between a so and your mom and its overwhelming youve only been together 7 mo you see each other all the time over the course of the year and youre both pretty young i sympathize with your gf its obviously a terrible situation but she has family that can help her deal with grieving and while it would be great to be there for her its not like she will be alone plus im guessing this is the first time youre meeting her family they might not want an outsider around at this time on the other hand your mother is alone and im sure was looking forward to your visit its one of the few times she gets to see you all year go home and spend the holiday with your mom your gf has support but i would do anything for my mom and would never leave her alone on a holiday yes its only one day but the thought of my mom celebrating all alone with no joy on the day would kill me of course my thought is that you actually like and get along with your mom if you dont get along and dread going home ever then take the out and stay away i think they are both trying to guilt you into doing what they want make up your own mind what do you think is the right thing to do in your heart and your mind edit i just saw your mom could spend xmas with your aunt and uncle and isnt alone alone so no judgement still but id go home anyway how long are you with your gf and also do you go to the same school or only see her occasionally why are you even going to your dads if he treats you badly youre old enough to decide where you want to be for holidays where is your mom spending xmas i would think your mom would love to spend the first xmas after her husband passed with people who also loved him also is your mom the mother of your sis and nephew that passed even more reason to spend it with her yta theyre both your nephews treat them the same or when the older one finally figures it out he wont want anything to do with you because of your disdain for him you might think the 20 yo is just being a bum and not actually finding himself but he may actually be trying to figure it out from experience not mine tho some guys dont want college but they also cannot see themselves sitting in an office all day but they also cant see themselves doing an outside trade job yes its irrational as it was to me to hear to you because there arent many other alternatives but at some point they get a spark of something and it all comes together for them give him time you dont have to like it it hes not your kid i literally laughed out loud at that so i guess chris isnt allowed out of the bed until she gets her cuddles in what a ridiculously immature thing to think as a 26 yo never mind text to the mother of his child youre not a loser nobody is a loser do you have a roommate why arent you friendly with him join a club at your school or an intramural team or volunteer somewhere on campus or just start saying hi and talking to every person you see in your dorm building why havent you done this the first week you were on campus when literally every club was looking for people youre not gonna make friends if you shut yourself away nobody is gonna come knocking on your door and say hi i want to be your friend and dont worry so much about attracting girls because with your attitude of thinking of yourself as a loser girls sense that and they want no part of it the gym is good as long as you go to better yourself and not just to attract someone get out there and just do something the pieces will all fall into place we just did a dinner out with immediate family godparents and grandparents your argument against judging by todays standard is spot on you dont have to like what the person did or stood for in their time but the fact remains that it was acceptable in their time it happened and was celebrated key point is at that time better to show those statues and have a discussion about the person the act the time in history than to lock them away and never discuss to understand what was going on at that time that is history for good or bad info how old is your son his kids and your younger kids does your dil work we used to rent strollers and when we returned the stroller we were given one but only 1 around 9700 thats where i got mine they are in the photo albums from the trip yes and honestly if they would drop the titles and go on their merry way without any mention of his mom his family her family the press i would wish them well in their merchandising endeavors well id really be rooting for failure but just go do whatever the hell you want to do as just h and or m write a blog do a reality show pick a cause and champion it just please no more podcasts that was painful just leave everyone else the hell alone and live your freakin life already ive been keeping up saw a bunch of clips read a bunch my post just tipped the iceberg as you probably know cant wait for the fallout from the book only the first episode did i miss something we loved that ride sad to see it go and we dont really like the new railroad thing some rides are just classic and shouldnt be messed with oh where to start this might get long try to figure out how they met theres been about 3 diff versions 2 diff versions of the proposal and one that she filmed and live streamed to a friend who does that now they might want these things to be private but then why even talk about it on a netflix show and out out diff versions pretty strong evidence that she had been planning to merchandise her and h and the royal connection since before they were married she lies about her childhood dumps her dad who raised her and suddenly her mom is in the picture to capitalize on her mixed race when up until then she was self identifying as white that rubs ppl the wrong way add in her admission of wanting to harm herself while pregnant but then not getting any help while being principals in a mh foundation never mind h admitting he didnt know how to get her help and the fam would not help when they didnt really ask for it m being on a royal tour complaining that shes not getting paid for this then she and harry are saying she was discriminated against based on her race if it happened they are right to call it out but they have not given one instance of it its all vague cryptic statements she claims being harassed by paparazzi but there is no evidence of that she claims the fam leaked stories to the press yet no evidence she didnt like negative stories in the press and wanted the fam to get them taken down the fam doesnt have that power but she took it as they wanted to slam her add in h harping on all day long about his dead mom and his generational pain and its just become a clown show at this point and a lot of his behavior has come out since hes been with her so what has she said or done to him to make him turn on his family she wants to be a globally known brand she wants fame and money and status shes been trying to do this for almost all of her adult life it hasnt happened even with her marrying into a very famous and influential family and shes grasping at whatever will keep her name in the spotlight hes just a middle aged man who gained weight and is in his own home where he can be comfortable we all have spent days just lounging around looking sloppy and so have our partners he looks presentable when he needs to cut him some slack on this one nta this is an absolute nothing your gf is being ridiculous good lord its like middle school your gf is getting upset over your passcode read that again your passcode on your phone you must be the most perfect man on the planet if this is the thing shes choosing to get upset about i dont care if youre good or bad with tech or know how to change it there is no reason to and thats what you should tell her mazda 3 were on our third one the 2009 is still being driven by first kid 2014 is now the second kids car 2017 is ours how else are we supposed supposed to hear his generational pain if hes not the one speaking how will we know how tortured his life was maybe hell choke up a bit at timesreally try to pull at the heartstrings if were really lucky we might get an actual sob yta for putting up with that loser and his freeloading sister and her kids why are you with him he obviously doesnt give a crap about you give yourself the biggest gift this year your independence from him you just started talking and youre already spoiling her in what way she comes with a lot going on living with baby daddy not financially independent and has 2 very very young kids you cannot possibly want to take on all of that can you afford to support all 4 of you and more importantly do you even want to im getting not on the up and up vibes from her id pass on this one there really isnt any upside for you i dont get angry or upset it just causes unconscious eye rolling which id like to avoid any qs where someone wants their so to basically have zero contact with anyone of the
