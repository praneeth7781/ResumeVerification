own invitation then youll be invited on your own not included on your dad and sms invite then find another single fam member and share a room with them to cut your costs you dont think they want you to stay home to watch the 3 yo do you thats a big fat no eatontown has the most retched people on the planet i put all the docs i needed on the counter spread out so she could see every one of them that stupid miserable human wouldnt pick my document off the counter i had to pick them up and hand them to her one at a time havent been back since ill go to hazlet much more civilized there but the inspection people are very nice especially the woman who works there nta but your bf and cousin sure are what was he thinking he doesnt even know these people and he says crap like that your bf is disgusting why would you still want to date him yta if you cant handle your mom being away while you open a letter how in the world are you going to survive being away at college its past time that you learn to handle stuff on your own try an audiobook i also like to scan the radio to see what kind of music is played in diff parts of the country how old and have you never spent any time with these kids before are they always a bit rambunctious or is it maybe being off of school and holidays and their schedules being out of wack have them a bit crazier than normal you need to decide if you want to be with your bf bad enough to actually try to have a relationship with his kids actually if youre married youre already a step parent doesnt mean its all on you but you cant just ditch out whenever he has them thats a shitty thing to do they wont always be small and by the time they are old enough they wont want anything to do with you so i kind of agree with you but just because i dont like oranges and im not a fan of mixed fruit salad theres always one fruit that gets mushy and then its mixed in with the other still good fruit warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info ok yeah his reactions are sketchy can you ask for a family meeting just to clear the air a bit obviously you dont want to live with any tension in the house you want your mom to be happy but this whole situation is out of left field other than that im out of ideas since youre getting nowhere with your mom have you tried talking to him just at least to get a sense of him if hes a decent person hell understand if you preface with something like this is all new and odd to me having my mom move a guy in so can we just have a chat about whats going on here considering i didnt even know you two were having this ldr like what kind of job did he have maybe hes early retired and actually has some money or it could be he never had much of a career which is a red flag how olds the d does she live with the mom is he planning on keeping up visits is he responsible at least to his d does he have family siblings and does he get along with them then after a bit you can ask if he has any plan to get his own apt and job you know sort of just live in the same city and date you never really know a person just from online talking he might realize he doesnt actually like your mom cant hurt to try he might not even want to talk to you which would be weird or he may be fine with your obvious inquiry as to whats going on its def a strange turn of events in your moms part okra i tried to expand my veggie eating but okra was just gross thank you is he planning on getting a job at some point his own apt for arguments sake lets say your mom and him really like each other fine his lease is up so they decide to have him move closer so they can date this is all ok as long as he stays with her but only until he can get a job apt and support himself if this is whats going on id say its crappy that she just sprung him on you did you even know she was talking to this guy like did she mention it at all what a wonderful find for my bridal shower my mom gave me a set of embroidered pillow cases that my grandma made for me i had no idea they existed it was a really nice sentimental surprise she had been gone for a while by then oh and its been 33 years and i never used them idk why not i think i just wanted them to stay nice are you saying you are seeing something diff if so id like to hear yours please i dont know anything about how tarot works but it would be interesting to see what differs while i agree she had to learn it somewhere but im not convinced its from her dad she seemed to have a regular upbringing by her dad albeit one where she was spoiled which would give her an inflated opinion of herself but once she decided to act is where i think she got the transactional idea i would think it happens a lot in hollywood you do this for me i do this for you it started with trevor i absolutely think she married trevor for that transactional relationship what he can do for her career and all she had to do in return was be with him when she had no use for him anymore he was discarded then it carried into everyone else she seemed to be friendswith sophie markus corey in every one of these relationships she was trying to do something that these people all were somewhat related to sophie and markus for highbrow connections corey when she wanted to be a food blogger or whatever the heck she was trying to do so with h it was a case of this person has intl recognition is widely thought of as a decent person concerned with the environment and veterans and i want that too just a thought i think its a matter of access if you always brought a person into the fold they can be family based on the person bringing them in my adult kids have brought people around sporadically but if i know my kid is invested in this relationship i treat them as one of the fam thats what you do you bring them in based on your child but i welcome everyone nta its not like he helps with anything else involving your apt so why would he think hed have to help with your nephews seriously hes nothing but a mooch all he pays for his his car and insurance so basically just his stuff why are you allowing him to freeload off of you nta i dont even know why there was any awkwardness wife had friends over husband leaves to give the girls time to hang out now if you told your wife in front of jamie that you didnt want her there then it would be awkward but im assuming that didnt happen because based on the rest of the post jamie would have started something your wife really needs to start standing up to jamie tho the part about you and w not taking someone elses grief seriously is just so out of line and your wifes voice raising thing is something you would think jamie would know by now how old is the brother does your bf hang out with him on his own if hes a bunch younger than you guys he might not want to hang out with old ppl not that youre old but to him maybe if hes closer in age then its up to your bf to plan a get together so you two can get to know each other better either way i say just go be nice dont try to force a connection if its not there i just dont understand why this wasnt a conversation does he frequently make plans that youre not invited to why cant you and d go brother is married so its not a boys thing especially that hes gone for nye since we were dating weve always spent nye together i dont like your h at all nta you are already committed to be groomsman in the friends wedding thats a perfectly viable reason to miss the cousins wedding nta but the second you walked in and saw the other dogs your h should have been the one to ask him mom what the deal was not you him its now days later you and h are upset at her shes probably pissed because she didnt see her son again and is of course blaming you and the fact that she lied to you about no dogs coming this year has still not been addressed its not gonna get better no matter what you do but h should be pointing out any snubs or nastiness from his mom every single time i agree on the counseling at this point your normal is explosive arguing and neither of you have any idea how to get out of this cycle but also as an idea think back to your last argument that spiraled out of control and dissect it from beginning to end try to recall exactly what was said and by who do this just for yourself not to find who was to blame but to try to see where the disagreement went off the rails its always a good idea to have some kind of understanding of how things turn bad again not to place blame but to analyze what the dynamic is like between the two of you and if you could have a do over what would you have said instead that may have changed the course of the argument a sort of self reflection he knows but she doesnt its not like hes leaking this crap he has no idea half the time what shes orchestrating that doesnt absolve him of going along with all of it after the fact tho and ill bet once he figures out that its her she admits it but whats he gonna do he cant contradict her once its out there so he has to play the game her game i agree there is no way back for them he might be brought back but not to the life he had hell be treated like andrew living a life far away from any royal duties he may be invited to select things like xmas church service but thats it well see him sporadically riding a horse or something im not even sure if the fam will let the kids back if she gets unsupervised visits h cant be anywhere near her alone once if hes free of her grasp too much risk that hell say something that shell exploit just have her cut down on both the riding lessons and the rock climbing unless she is competing in either sport neither of those two need to be done more than once if not competitive and money is an issue she already knows how to ride and climb after
