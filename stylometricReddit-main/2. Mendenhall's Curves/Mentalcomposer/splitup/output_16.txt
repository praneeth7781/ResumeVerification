huge ah but youre insane to boot who the hell do you think you are asking your supposed friends to wake up early to practice hair and make up for your stupid wedding these are grown ass woman who i am sure know how to do their hair and make up they dont need to practice and they dont have to make any sacrifices for your wedding leave them alone or you wont have any friends no does hayley have any friends it may be that she doesnt have anyone else to talk to vent to or ask advice of if not she needs to get out there and meet other woman or ideally other moms so she relies on the only people she knows does she even want to live in switzerland shes only been there less than a year no id maybe have a talk with her and explain that you and your mom cannot be the ones to solve her marriage problems its does no good to have the whole family involved in personal matters she needs to talk to her h about these things if she thinks its bad enough they can get some counseling be prepared with a counseling service because shell undoubtedly have no clue where to go i wouldnt write her off just yet shes had a lot of changes in a short amount of time she might feel a bit like a fish out of water and shes floundering barely having arguments just isnt a good enough basis for moving so fast you barely know this woman it takes longer than 6 mo to really get to know someone is her behavior in this instance a taste of whats to come idk and neither do you add to that she made you cut out your best woman friend that alone tells me shes a lot more controlling than you are allowing yourself to admit look im just saying slow things down a lot you say you both came out of abusive and toxic relationships so i have to wonder if you would recognize a healthy one youre so used to a bad one those old familiar patterns may seem normal to you youve been together 6 mo and are already engaged she has a best male friend you have never met accused you of cheating after dinner and took a pic of your lips gave you the silent treatment and wont even look at you this isnt the happily ever after you think it is its going to take her a long time to undo whats been ingrained in her mindset for so long but good for her for getting help maybe you can ask the therapist if it would be ok for you to put some small decisions back on her but only if the therapist says its ok small ones like what other brand to buy have a code word or phrase when she calls and you can answer with something like i trust you to make the decision there is no wrong choice so feel free to decide it validates her while also encouraging her to make these small decisions now of course youre not going to tell her if the brand or product or choice she made is wrong youre going to have to just go with it even if you dont like it thats a sure fire way to set her back she will see that she doesnt have to defer to you for everything and there are no adverse consequences to that the problem with hs mental health issues is that he hasnt actually had much legitimate help for it he went to a real therapist for a bit anybody know why he stopped but after that he went on a crusade of trying to heal himself through some very unconventional means he doesnt want to actually get better he thinks hes perfectly healthy he has it all figured out didnt he say something like paraphrasing here he wanted the whole fam to get therapy so they could understand that they are the problem they need to be made to see that they are the bad guys they treated his wife wrong they didnt protect them whatever the f that means they drove them out of the fam they made it untenable for them to stay etc etc etc as if him and the witch werent culpable at all he is just so out of touch with reality she probably didnt remember any of it and her bf had to tell her how she acted shes mortified about her behavior and is probably avoiding having to talk to you especially after she read your text maybe give her another day or two and text her again just ask how shes doing and see if she answers you i wonder if the bf actually put her out i saw a woman win over 1 million on a wheel of fortune game in atlantic city she was seriously shocked she said she doesnt usually gamble had no idea what to do just hit max bet i wouldnt hug when youre introduced just give a wave and say hi its not to meet you since you havent been around kids just think of them as small people you must have some idea what they like from their dad so ask about those and dont disparage anything they say you might not like snakes but the kid has a pet snake for example you dont say snakes are gross you say ive never been around a snake and you talk about feeding it and caring for it etc just be yourself dont be too quiet but dont take over the conversation either dont rush this is only step one slow and steady is the best way to go hawaii never had a huge interest in going but we did and it was beautiful lots to see and do or you can just enjoy the beach its also kind of expensive so a honeymoon splurge is justified were retired its only that organized out of necessity really a couple years ago they went off in the middle of the night of course no fire but we couldnt get them to stop so had to get the fire dept out after that my h started putting the install dates on them and this last episode we figured since the batteries were being changed might as well date them too and theyre only hard wired cause we had an addition put on years ago and had to bring it all up to code we change ours every daylight savings time but we did it about a month ago mine are hard wired and went off one night but it stopped and then went off again not the beep the actual fire fire so after realizing theres no fire we set out to figure out which detector was faulty in that process we changed every battery and a few of the older detectors of course the last one we had to check was the one that was faulty this detector was 10 years old none of the other ones in the whole house were as old most were about 3 years old have no idea why we never changed out this one so now every detector has a date written on it when it was installed and every battery also has the date we replaced them oh and detectors usually only have a lifespan of 10 years seriously its been 2 years and shes still not over her ex its not like shes just pining away secretly shes actively trying to meet up with him do you want to be her placeholder until this guy decides he wants her back and she dumps you im sure theres someone out there who actually wants to be with you cause this girl isnt it just to mention they could have had the cruise line book them up to two days prior to embark date ncl has that option of course that means they have to have more days off and pay for hotels and meals for those days so a lot of people cant do that or just dont want to personally i would never fly in on day of embark especially with an international flight its just too risky and travel insurance is great for this scenario but the dissapointment of missing my vacation needs to be taken into consideration also because it doesnt make any sense fed student loans were never going to cover the full cost of college the maximum loan that can be taken out thru the govt is 31000 divided over 4 years in the big picture this isnt a crippling amount people end up with huge debt because they then go out and get private loans for the balance or their parents take out parent loans with the agreement that the student pay it back so the govt makes the loan the student graduates and pays back the loan with interest the act of repaying this loan plus the interest is then used to fund the next batch of students that need them cancelling 10000 or 20000 for pell grant recipients of loans is essentially taking away some of the ability of this loan program to fund itself so that means the govt essentially every taxpayer is paying for this relief i have a definite problem with continuing a program that basically has no funding source other than more spending the govt is making loans to incoming freshman for sept of this year where is that money coming from so we cancel some amount now but what about graduates in 2024 and beyond do they get some relief too look i get the economy isnt great i have 3 kids that have this debt how about we ensure that students who took these loans satisfy their legal obligation they may have a few tough years as they begin their careers and life but it isnt like every other generation hasnt had mostly the same exact scenario of course some had it better at times but that is simply because of what was happening at the time and the economy and jobs and salaries all have ups and downs oh yeah youre fine then i thought it was a not seeing her ever thing but rethink the wedding mostly so your h doesnt have to go alone and he doesnt get all the qs about where you are from everyone unless he doesnt care then youre good im pretty sure shes the type that wont even notice youre there too busy being fawned over by her bridesmaids or yelling at the caterer while i agree she sounds unreasonableim trying to be nice the fact is that she is marrying into your husbands family which means whether you want to associate with her or not there are going to be times when you will be around her think holidays inlaw bdays children bdays family weddings not hers funerals etc so you have to decide how youre going to navigate all this without having the rest of the family get on your case for it the wedding you and h should go its his bro your parents should decline idk why they would even want to go they babysit for you that night the shower you decline and just say youre working that weekend they dont need to know its on call or whatever any other occasions you go your inlaws are not going to take kindly to never seeing their son on a holiday because you dont like sil and maybe your h wants to spend some time with his parents you say hi and bye and be civil theres ways to navigate thru this thanks for the update amazing that they admit its their issue and still refused to refund good
