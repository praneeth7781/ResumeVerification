dont change and compromise for anyone just so that wont get mad at you this is not love you dont love him he certainly does not love you get away from him now before he hurts you worse stop dating im serious you are way too young that this is your second abusive bf you need to understand that you are worth way more than you have been getting having a bf is not the be all end all find a few good friends to spend your time with or hell be alone for a bit enjoy your own company find what makes you happy that isnt a boy see what good relationships look like and see what the crappy ones look like then when you know what behavior you expect from a guy you will be able to leave when the first bad behavior comes up so i just looked up port charges for gc here i didnt even know this info was available but i took a shot and googled it cost 726 per person plus another 3675 for the ship so if we divide the 3675 by the number of passengers idk what ship so lets say 3000 passengers that comes to 012 cents per person so 726 plus 02 thats 728 per person the 10 credit per person works as far as a refund for port fees ncl gave you a credit to your shipboard acct instead of a direct credit to your original form of payment the only problem i see is in the future which most people dont think about hes going to get to a point where he slows down and you wont be able to do some things together think of the activities you do now with him as a 45 yo when you are 45 hell be closer to 60 hes not going to have the energy for it then dont discount his health you may find yourself being his carer and thats not an easy thing to do if youre in the midst of a career or are raising youngish kids or both at the same time i know 2 couples with at least a 15 year gap and the men are both facing health issues and their wives are of course doing what needs to be done but being a 50 something and scheduling your life around doctors and tests is not fun and neither has any kids just something to think about she just started a new job and believe it or not its a difficult one not just physically but mentally and add to that the fact that im sure shes stressed to no end wondering if shes doing this job right all that combined is a recipe for exhaustion she needs time time to feel like shes on a good footing with the job time to build the confidence she needs to go into school every day knowing shes doing a good job time to learn all those shortcuts that veteran teachers know that cuts her at home work down what she needs is a supportive bf who is willing to deal with this transition period of her life because he wants to support her to succeed she doesnt need a needy bf who jumps to a dating app the second his gf doesnt give him the amount of attention he wants id love to see what happens next year when youre up to your eyeballs in textbooks and lack of sleep and she wants you to hang out are you going to put off studying to hang out i didnt think so frankly you dont deserve her youre too selfish yta i am failing to see what is so wrong with him putting the ring in his mouth its really not a big deal nta its a perfectly normal question to ask your friend is hiding something let me guess they met online and are long distance and he never actually met her warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info just passing on what i saw the cd was in ops name effectively making it the legal property of op grandma verbally told op to give that one cd to nephew op emailed nephew nephew took a year to answer and then asked for gold op told nephew whyd it take you so long but ok ill send the check but the original cd was cashed and spent in expenses so the is coming from me personally nephew responds give me my money it shouldnt take this long oh and send it to my dad ops lawyer advised since the cd was never in nephews name nor was the cd or nephew mentioned in grandmas will op legally doesnt have to give nephew any money i think i heard costa rica mentioned but idk where i got that from so its not very helpful and theres nothing on the costa rica reditt either so im starting to think there isnt another one i saw a retired military somebody on fox dont slam me they carried the shoot down live who said biden wanted to shoot it down on wed and the military talked him out of it this guy made a point of saying biden needs to have a little sit down with those guys and explain the chain of command so i think theres more to this whole incident than we know yes i keep trying to find one news source about that balloon i cant find anything other than a blip that said us military was aware of one very strange this is what youre unhappy about he doesnt tell you youre cute or pretty every day he doesnt call you by your nickname he doesnt ask you how youre doing he hasnt asked you on a date since fall he says hes not good at planning you have not once said what it is that you do for him that you should be appreciated for im sorry but you seem a bit insecure are you not confident in the fact that your bf likes your looks and wants to spend time with you that might be why youre going through rough patches you expect him to act and be a certain way without thinking that maybe thats just not him its easy to be so enamored in the beginning and then it tapers off thats not to say he should never give you compliments or plan something but you want him to do all the work why cant you plan a date so see youre doing fine youre covering all scenarios and logically thinking things through just pay close attention over the next say 6 months if hes serious about you there is no reason you cannot start meeting his kids slowly at first and gradually to where you all can spend weekend time together thats a big tell to me about his intentions ooh his wife asked for the divorce ill throw this out just cause i want you to think about things you wouldnt think of some men just cannot be alone his wife ending things regardless of how he felt about you may have prematurely moved this relationship forward and im not saying he wants back with her im sure there were signs his marriage was in trouble im not saying this is true but roll that little nugget around a bit ok so i think it may have been much easier for you coming out of a marriage that you and your ex had already realized was over to go all in with the new guy as opposed to him who im gonna guess sort of blindsided his wife with the divorce to an extent so hes dealing with guilt of hurting the ex guilt about the kids while also trying to move on with you its been a year so hes probably getting closer to the point of no guilt and ready to move on and maybe knowing this trip was always going to be coming up which really was a stupid thing to do the parents havent been together for a year why make this trip why not just one of the parents take the kids why this charadehas hampered his moving on but the trip will be done he has no more reason to not wrap up his divorce and be all in also realize that his kids will always always cone first you will not have what you did in your marriage where its just the two of you and you can make plans on the fly and just go and be plans will be ruined if theres an issue with the kids and you have to be ok with that its the kiss of death if a relationship if you cannot handle all that if after this trip he is not willing to have you meet the kids then id reassess his true intentions but for the next few days while hes gone do something for yourself to occupy your time it might be better if you two dont talk so much a check in is enough you dont want to get jealous and he doesnt want to temper what he says to you and another excellent point to make this thread is so fascinating with all the ins and outs something about this whole scenario just isnt sitting right with me info please hes separated yes as in living apart but not with you from his soon to be ex wife seeing his kids whenever the custody is they agree on oh and there was no cheating by either of you then i can weigh in better id agree with that if china had relayed that info before this balloon was spotted so they have a few weather balloon malfunctions possible if theyre trying something new and perfectly reasonable but just come out and say that before it enters into another countrys airspace if they want to be believed they have to be transparent about it even then we know the conspiracy theorists would be out in full force but until it comes down or gets forced down we wont know what it actually is and even then we might not ever be told the full extent of its capabilities as i originally said i would have believed it was a weather balloon that went off course except that once it veered off and was clearly going to be entering close to or into another countrys airspace any country china should have said just that instead they said nothing now its possible they tried to play that story with either the us or canadian govt before it was spotted by whoever spotted it first but neither govt has said that was the case being that they didnt just leads me to believe that it wasnt just a wayward science balloon not to mention that theres another one and this one just traversed the country and is now over the carolinas where i believe we have large military bases could be wrong theres no doubt that most govts dont trust china but them being transparent about it would have gone a very long way to minimize the evil china theories ill believe the us and canada before i believe anything china says and thats just based in history not just anti china anything nta have you spoken to his bf and explained why hes not invited brother might be feeling its a rejection of him his bf but bf might just see the rationale as long as you and bf have always gotten along and there is no animosity he should understand and help to calm your bros thinking yta are you freakin kidding your son has been bullied and when he finally defends himself not start
