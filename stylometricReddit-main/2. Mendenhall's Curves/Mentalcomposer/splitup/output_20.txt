10 years when they married but of those for whom age information was available nearly all96were aged 16 or 17 years of those for whom age gender and spousal information was available 78 were girls under 18 years of age wed to adult men aged 18 years or older the national number of children wed decreased each yearfrom 76396 in 2000 to 2493 in 2018 table 2but is unlikely to get to zero without legislative intervention so 96 were 16 and 17 hardly what most people think of when they hear child marriages and the number for 2018 is 2493 total out of 350 million people in comparison one out of every five marriages in iran is a child marriage a total of 550565 marriages were registered in march 2018 to march 2019 in 112647 cases the bride was ages 17 years or less more than a fifth of marriages registered in iran during that year were therefore child marriages by unicefs measurefeb 9 2020 features twenty percent of marriages in iran are child marriages iran has a population of about 85 million people from the same article data from the national organization for civil registration records that around 1100 girls under the age of 12 were married in 20172018 more recently the figure has been around 2600 girls this is in the range of two or three marriages per thousand registered throughout the year which is a large and significant number considering the legal obligation to secure court approval the law permits a judge to issue a marriage license in all such cases when it is expedient to do so now i condone any marriage to a child in any country in any circumstance but two 16 or 17 yos who find themselves pregnant marrying each other is very diff than a 12 and under literal child marrying a grown man how long were you dating before you moved in it hasnt even been a year that youve been together which means you havent even scratched the surface of really getting to know this person it isnt all about love thats part of the problem you think that just because he loves you hes going to think of your wants and needs all the time hell be appreciative of any little thing you do for him and the household youre under the impression that the two of you are working toward something and that all he has to do is talk to you and all will be magically better but the reality is hes a depressed guy who wont do anything about it and just wants to get lost in his games so he doesnt have to deal with real life next time he tells you to leave do it save yourself and get out before you waste more time with someone who seemingly adds no value to your life thank you lots of good info that sounds like my kind of cruise what youre failing to realize is that the only reason you want him back in your life is that you are struggling with making connections with other people thats you being selfish you didnt like lily because she was in effect taking kaleb away from you you didnt want to share him now id say you probably didnt intentionally kill her because thats just too out there but you also didnt try to keep your dad and family from threatening to destroy kalebs life either did you you cant claim it was just your dad you were an adult at the time you didnt give kaleb time to properly mourn his gf someone who he cared for and probably felt extremely guilty that he was the one who brought her to the dinner that ultimately killed her you wanted him to just forget about her and concentrate all his energy on you and when he didnt you and your dad tried to rush him along and when that didnt work and he lashed out you essentially had him run out of town stop looking for him if he wanted anything to do with you im sure he knows exactly where to find you i am extra careful around mirrors and will not walk under a ladder i always say you never know so ill follow the superstition just in case now i have to stop putting my pocketbook on the floor never heard that one have you been on any other lines and can you compare them im not too worried about the food im not a foodie so unless something is clearly inedible im fine what was the sea day activities like and the night shows and casino oh and i also liked pic 4 are you a photographer because id never even think to take that shot yet its pretty great i think the earlier suggestion of seeing if any of the other people in these photos want them really nobody in the fam is going to want to look at them from a viewpoint of thats where aunt and uncle went and what did on their vacay but the friends they went with might want to relive those memories of course keep any that have no nudity in them landscapes signs etc so that youd have a timeline of their travels if anyone would really want to know just a thought i dont want to come off as mean but were you really tricked you really thought a 52 yo when he started dating you at 28 father of 3 adult children would have wanted to start all over again with a baby some might but the majority wont he wanted to date a much younger woman to stroke his ego if you want a child do yourself a huge favor and find a man closer to your age who actually wants to have and be involved in raising his child oh great now well have to hear all about what they got wrong do these two really not have any sense of humor laugh it off once in a while they must be fun at parties you have a lot going on so i dont know if this will be helpful or not but i can say that my hot flashes have on occasion come on fast and i did have the dizziness and nausea so that symptom may well be connected to menopause sorry but i cant help with anything else weve all seen on reditt that some parents have an obvious favorite child those examples are i think more the exception than the rule most parents dont have a favorite but we recognize that each child has something special or different that their sibs dont have one can talk to anyone anywhere and one takes a while to open up to new people one is an athlete and one is artistic ones a spender ones a saver those things and when we recognize these differences we try to cultivate and encourage that thing so the child can make the most of it for themselves so every child is the favorite if you want to call it that in a diff category at least thats how i saw and did it nta i think its perfectly fine for parents to go away without their kids but you are too young to be left alone for a week and its your parents responsibility to make arrangements for someone to take care of you for the week thats what makes your parents ta do you have a best friend that you can stay with you need to make your parents understand its the leaving you home alone that is not right i say go for it you really have no idea what your personal menopause is going to be like some woman go through it with minimal effect on their life others are hit hard and have a difficult time just getting thru the day you dont know where youre going to fall in the range and youll regret not taking this opportunity if you have an easy or even a temporary short lived hard time surround yourself with one or two very key employees that you can absolutely trust to have your back just in case id give a student teacher a bit more leeway just because they are figuring out the best approach to a lesson but i agree the mentor teacher should have had a chat about the approach also keep in mind just in general teachers try to explain things in multiple ways to cover all the diff ways kids learn thats not a bad idea its repetitive for the ones that got it on the first explanation but invaluable for the ones that got it on the last explanation im still not understanding you park your car on the street this is not a private parking lot or something is it is it correct to say that your car is not blocking their driveway but is parked between two driveways on the street so in front of a home are you parking in front of your neighbors house and thats why they are mad they do not own the street parking in front of their home can you not park in front of your own home i cannot imagine that a traffic officer would give you a ticket even if they have been called by the neighbor if you are not parked illegally how do you even call a traffic officer im not really sure what to tell you maybe take a picture of your car every time you park and then if you get a ticket take another pic with the ticket still on your car to prove the car was parked legally or see if you have a case for harassment on the neighbor if they keep calling the traffic police on you or call the traffic police yourself and ask them why they keep coming when they know you are parking legally if you dont mind can you expand on the increase risk of cardio vascular disease please im trying to keep up but honestly its too much info thats constantly being contradicted day to day and not making a lot of sense i thought the heart issues came about from the vaccine and mostly in youngish people your gf is insane none of this is normal she knows her big v day gift is a play she got a smaller gift on v day to mark that day you asked what she wanted to do on that day and did it with her none of that was enough she still wanted you to acknowledge and recognize your past failure on gift giving occasions hell no your gf has a way over inflated opinion of her worth how long or how many times are you going to have to atone for past grievances this is your first relationship so im gonna give you the benefit of the doubt since you have nothing to compare this one to but ill tell you this this is absolutely not how a mutual respectful and healthy relationship should play out you should not be tiptoeing around her trying not to upset her take a long hard look at what she adds to your life ill bet not much do you frequently feel as tho you arent doing enough do her wants and needs count for more than your own have you ever really wanted to do something or go somewhere that she didnt and you gave in simply put shes treating you like shit and youre taking it and asking for more please time to send her packing it could be as simple as keeping the good stuff he really had no reason to keep your clothes or nick nacks or he just couldnt be bothered to pack it up and ship it even if you pay for him
