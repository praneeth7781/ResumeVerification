nta for being upset that your bf didnt get a plus one id be upset at that for the fact that youre together a long time and additionally your bf is an adult and a plus one is usually how invites go for adults unless no other cousins were also no plus ones im sorry if i came off as harsh wasnt my intention at all do you have any friends that you can spend that weekend with in your hometown that you can stay with you can avoid your dad and go visit your mom yta maybe im confused as to why it takes you days to deal with your moms anniversary day i say this in a not mean way but in a you need to get a handle on it for your own mentally stable peace of mind please dont come at me yes i know everyone is different and people grieve in their own way i understand losing your mom was awful being young but you are an adult now and you need to find a way to deal with your feelings around this day without it seemingly being a multi day grief session that is not healthy in any way i lost my father as a grade schooler and my mom 10 years back so i am familiar with your feelings his fam saying you can just stay in the hotel is leading me to think theyve been around for this date prior and my thought that this is indeed a multi day thing is correct they may have been thinking you being alone isnt the best thing for you your bf will be home on the day of moms passing so thats not an issue he can support you however you need travel day is probably the next day on friday so you wont be in a happy jolly mood but you should be able to handle traveling the wedding is on sat emotionally you should be able to go to the wedding even if youre not the most excited there its a happy occasion so celebrate along your dads bday is tuesday and you will be home by then but you dont even talk to him so i dont know why this day would even be on your radar as far as the plus one that is a standard way of invited when being invited i dont know where you got the idea that you werent invited your bf is in the fam he gets a plus one hes bringing his gf there is a lot of emotional stuff surrounding these dates you need to talk to someone who can help you move past your grief and anger in regards to your family chocolate that weird chocolate truffle thing and when the father treats the white grand baby better than the step grand baby his wife will be all well its his blood grand baby this will not end well at all idk if her dad can change his views and mind but if hes not all in hes out esh i think amy is trying to stick it to her mom for making her wear dresses as a kid anyway obviously the dress code is different but its amys wedding but youre not going to change amys mind so do yourself a favor and just go with it its one day and unless you want to lose your d and her wife you are going to have to bite the bullet here your wife can wear a pantsuit that has very wide flowy pant legs that basically look like youre wearing a dress something like this these would look lovely with a dressy blouse yta your having a baby this april and getting married next year really by next year you will be perfectly ok with not taking a 1 yo on your honeymoon now to his child how long have you been together that you havent bonded with this child im not saying you have to fall head over heels for her instantly but by the time you marry this guy you should have stronger feeling then shes a nice little girl marrying a guy with kids means you will be another parental figure in her life if you arent willing to do that then you are doing all of you a huge disservice he will or at least should put his d first and that means if you dont get on board youll be the one sending your child for fortnight visits i hate the thought that his first d will always be less to you dont be that stepmom be better do better neither of these children should be going on the vacation that youre calling a honeymoon you realize waiting until you each get your fill of sex with other people over a few years is never going to happen i think you both have this romanticized idea in your heads that this is your person when clearly it is not you didnt like the sex with him but then had sex with 7 other guys but only hooked up with 2 how does that work and hated all those experiences too now suddenly the sex with him is good could it be that you realize sex for the sake of having sex is not your thing and you actually need an emotional connection to a person not just an act whatever is going on with you two is not sex related so while you both will be out there meeting others one or most likely both of you will find someone else you will want to be with long term youll both mature change and find that the young love you have now is not the love that will sustain you for a lifetime if its just a matter of being with other people then pick a number that you think will satisfy this crazy idea and get it done now of course that has its own problems with jealousy what you did what he did and with who it will just cause more issues between you two and youll end up breaking up anyway just admit this relationship has run its course and move on if by chance you both happen to meet up in the future and it works out then great but this isnt something that you can or should plan your life around i love those shows i look at the ingredients and think no way theyll be able to incorporate like candy corn and somehow they do maybe her partner should spend his time watching and getting some ideas nta if hes such a great chef he can make great meals with whatever you buy like those cooking shows where they have to make something from random foods in a basket when he gets a job and contributes to the household he can buy and cook whatever he wants i dont understand why he cannot grasp this youre talking about a celebrity who she is in all likelihood never ever ever going to meet its like being jealous of a ghost and there is nothing wrong with finding strangers attractive look there was a time where i only had eyes for my partner would actively look around and try to find someone who caught my eye not to cheat just to see if there was one and i couldnt find one did i think my partner never found anyone else attractive hell no did i think there was anything wrong with me or them no i was secure enough in my partner to know i had nothing to worry about its all about trust work on yours it sort of seems that you might be a bit insecure but in a way that you think your partner is i hate this expression out of your league shes with you she likes you enjoy it and as i said in my first post stop sweating the small stuff if you booked with an agent then the cruise line will not be able to discuss your booking it has to go thru the agent so call them first to cancel this way depending on how far off the trip is you will get refunded all or a portion of the cruise fare but you will get refunded any port taxes and fees and any other pre paid add ons next would be the travel insurance idk who or what policy you have but usually any 3rd party travel ins kicks in after your primary so your travel ins may just tell you to submit all bills later on after you have outstanding bills from what your primary did not cover hope your wife will be okay i was the last in the fam to get one and i only got my first one just because everyone else in my fam had one kept it because i cant even imagine trying to learn a new phone system i know thats a stupid reason i am very tech challenged started with a 5 and my 8 is still doing just fine nta he never even realized you dont shave and he never thought you were unhygienic before so his argument doesnt make sense that is the stupidest sentence i have ever read if youre uncomfortable when you dress for any occasion youre doing it wrong generally community colleges will let you enroll regardless of gpa unless there is an unusually weird amount of students enrolling that semester make an appointment with an admissions counselor at your local and see what they say they have seen and heard it all and wont judge you they are there to help you be prepared to take a bunch of remedial classes to bring you up to have the skills for 100 level college classes but thats fine i did a few when i was a returning student they helped me refresh all the stuff i forgot years ago you can do this you just need to start best of luck to you go to the financial aid office at your school explain everything to them and see if there are grants loans emergency aid that you can get see if you can be an ra in the dorms for this or next semester that way your room and maybe board will be covered you can still keep your job too how is no one realizing that this teacher is taking 20 4th grade 9 yos to a water park and is what letting them all go off on their own wherever water parks are dangerous no way any school ive ever had to deal with would allow that there would be parents going and assigned a group of kids to be responsible for as far as this situation i would have made sure my kid didnt have to babysit the boy no one likes and only if that wasnt done would i not let her go and i wouldnt have bought the vip tix for the same day id have done something else with my kid he has an older brother who is married and has a child someone said it is his step bro idk about that tho i do remember seeing her posts tho and the bro also posted about a scholarship or something i dont remember exactly if you were my d this is what i would tell you you have seen how he is for a whole year already do you think he is going to suddenly wake up one day and be a considerate non yelling insulting bf do you think if you just try harder to please him 247 then he wont ever get mad at you and call you insulting names i am telling you right now that will never ever happen and that his not what being a partner is you
