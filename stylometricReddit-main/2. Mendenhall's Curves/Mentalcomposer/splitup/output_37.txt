opposite sex no talking no friends on sm friends from childhood gone lab partners gone study buddies gone co workers they talk to gone exes gone theres only one person who they should cut contact with and that would be an affair partner and you you arent mature enough no matter your age to be in a relationship if you have this view edit and as soon as i posted the next feed is my bf is still friends with his ex insert eyeroll the driving might just be an age thing as stupid as that sounds but teens speed i might also let whoever that minor in the car with him that asking him to go faster is a def no go the more concerning part for me is when you said that when things are going well in life he feels uncomfortable if he doesnt know now might be a good time to open up about his moms behavior over the years is your ex actually diagnosed or are her issues your best guess if diagnosed it might help to move your son to be more open to therapy if he can see what his future may look like if he doesnt get a handle on it now its tough because you dont want him to think that you think in his teen mind hes crazy or mental or insane or any other euphemism he might use so tread carefully and why isnt knauf just releasing these writings i also find it hysterical that they seem to think knauf is biased because he was working for william they left and the guy had no job he was obviously good at whatever he did enough that the dumb dumb duo used him as their go between with amid the scabies so the royal household or office or whatever gave him another job was he supposed to just disappear into oblivion after being used by the despicable duo no not normally they might thank their parents and their guests for coming but this this is just cringy if you have to convince anyone that you have a grand love story than you dont have one unless she just doesnt whats gonna happen the rf wont allow a scene to be made they will once again do and say and get away with whatever they want best the fam can do is have them sit in the cheap seats along with other non family members maybe think of it this way you were the handful and got the attention you needed enough so that you cant even remember what you were doing to warrant all that extra support and wasnt it nice that your parents were there to do that h now its your bro needing the extra and youre upset but you need not be because his time needing the extra will end at some point then all will go back to normal with your parents being annoyingly up your butt again cause thats what we do its hard trying to be the all for everyone at any given time one kid or the other will need more and we have to give it and yes sometimes at the expense of the other kid but it all will even out in the end if you get to the point where you have a problem or issue that seriously needs to be addressed then you voice that to your mom or dad and ask for some one on one time outside of the house to concentrate on that one issue if they say no then you reiterate that this is important and youre not just being whiny but i will say that just feeling like they arent validating your existence isnt really serious if and thats only if your bros issues are a serious thing i dont know what hes dealing with it should revive itself once the kids get a little bigger but you have to keep it somewhat going or it becomes the new norm like its not gonna be ok the kids are all somewhat self sufficient enough to not be all energy consuming and youll both have this unbridled passion for each other it needs to be a constant even if its a once a month type thing now thats at least a constant then it becomes twice a month and then once a week or whatever is there anyway to heat the mm tube enough to soften the butter and banana enough that you can get the cylinder out maybe boil some water and put the tube in it for a few seconds or try to cut the tube with a scissor i am kind of curious how this situation happened if you dont mind sharing maybe some scratch offs small keychains packs of sports cards mini candies i wouldnt buy one but if you get an actual card then i could see people buying it just for the historical implication of it theres no doubt all his ridiculousness will be written about at some point might be kind of worth it to have one maybe thats the only reason i bought the 5 campaign buttons just to have a little piece of history because hes just that absurd please dont slam me for this yes i know it was another 5 in his coffers but whatever do these two actually believe anyone gives a rats ass where they are at any given point in time in case they or their minions follow along here no the answer is no nobody cares go away while i agree there will be headlines either way but what will they look like will it be they were snubbed and rightly so which seems to be the way its going with the response to the docuwhine or because of what the book says or whatever else they just feel like vaguely moaning about or will it be the rf or kc is too soft on his wayward son and what will it take to finally be done with them how far is too far he literally called his father a liar what he lied about is still anybody guess as they never give any concrete statements so i guess kc can use that as an excuse weve got a few months so lets see what else happens lady hussey really should have declined to even meet her what did she get out of it nothing the damage has already been done its not like marlene took the blame and admitted it was all a set up theres no way i would ever even want to make all nice with that conniving grifter for me the gospel choir at the wedding would have been a beautiful addition if and only if megan or even just her mom had a longstanding relationship with a church that actually has a gospel choir hell even if she used to go as a child and stopped as an adult to a church with one maybe she did and i missed that little fact i could be wrong but i equate gospel choirs with a predominantly black church which i actually like i think it makes the service idk less boring and it adds to the service lets face it church service is boring so the fact they added the choir literally just to play into her woc persona just didnt sit well with me as much as i enjoyed watching it i agree but his gf already doesnt want to stay at borgata we stay and play at b even tho we havent won there oh this made me think of something maybe it wasnt leaks to make them look bad but merely something they were doing in an official capacity but like everything else she does she missteps during it and thats what gets picked up by the journalists so for example if they visited a hospital of sick kids she refuses to touch or hug the kids the paper would say yeah they visited but she was repulsed by sick kids or something like that so the story was bad but not by any fault of the family or palace stay at borgata for the free room and go over to ocean to play if youre going very soon be prepared that borgata is in the midst of renovating some slot areas there are a bunch of closed off sections so it looks messy if your gf doesnt really want to go anyway shell def not like it once she sees it but shell pick and choose select lines from long posts that are someone commenting things like what if is it possible allegedly and i heard a rumor that and then say see theyre spreading all these lies shes not gonna show a post saying they did this on this day and then said this on this day whats the truth or posts that point out evidence of her obvious lies of course its gayle he wont be asked about anything thats been revealed as being a lie or deceitful shell lob softball qs that have been answered ad nauseam in three diff ways maybe hell have a fourth answer who at this point will even watch this drivel unless its live and a respectable hard hitting journalist i think im busy cleaning bathrooms that day i love this idea maybe explain a bit more to the child in an age appropriate way about why actually being called mom because she does actually have a live mom even tho she doesnt see her might not be the best name as opposed to whatever other name they come up with just so the little girl doesnt feel totally rejected its possible his collar is visible when hes carrying lilly that way if the collar is not buttoned all the way up like if you are wearing a tie they are actually roomy plus the front of the shirt would just slide up plus shes a small child she can def fit between his collar and his neck i dont know if its photo shopped or not but the collar is not a smoking gun to me but what kind of stupid ass would sign an nda after breaking up and if it was while they were together again what kind of stupid ass would sign an nda while dating a nobody i think they dont want to get pulled into her crazy i think youre getting ahead of yourself here lets say that someone legitimately not mentally ill gets kidnapped gmafb they will be placed assessed and have you ever thought that maybe just maybe they will be referred to somewhere that will help address whatever their issue is since its not mh this is a good thing you seem to think an actual mental health provider is going to hold people that dont need their services when in actuality those providers want to free up space for the ones that they can actually help stop looking for abuse everywhere give the program a chance before you condemn it you say if they want to help then get to the root cause well thats exactly what they are trying to do we were one of the million that actually watched the show we liked it too but even back then i remember i didnt like her character and it wasnt personal to her just didnt like her storyline but it never registered to me that she was mixed race i wasnt looking for it i dont remember it being in any plot line and i just didnt make the connection until her dad was introduced and then was like huh shes black then happily went back to watching and even now i dont remember if there was any substantial plot regarding her race but i could be wrong there all this is for
