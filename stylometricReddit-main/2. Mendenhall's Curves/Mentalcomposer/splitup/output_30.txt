to me that you both got to do something you wanted and the kids got time with the grand parents win win win for everybody if she has no underlying issue then honestly i dont wouldnt have a problem with messy rooms they have to live with it i have the king of messy kids the clothes literally are on the floor right next to the laundry basket dont pick up her clothes and if she doesnt already she should be doing her own laundry when she runs out of underwear shell figure it out if she steps on her art supplies and ruins them they wont be replaced until the next gift giving occasion bday xmas unless she buys it herself if she cant find something she needs amongst the rubble shell have to plow thru it all to find it the place i absolutely draw the line is any food stuff so i would literally close her door to the mess as long as the boundary becomes absolutely zero food or drink other than water is allowed in her room at some point i get life she will realize that being that messy is a gross way to live as much as h gives lip service to ending generational pain he just cannot see the harm he is doing to his own kids his kids are going to grow up with a very angry dad who blames all his woes on anybody else who has zero self esteem and a mom who can think of no one but herself meanwhile both parents are at least recreational drug users those things are going to make for two kids who feel unloved by both parents and anxious kids walking on eggshells around their dad at least they think theyre so enlightened but they have no clue how to raise happy healthy well adjusted kids its a shame really those kids could have had the best of everything those are going to be the longest years of your life maybe a sit down with d and bf is in order there are certain things he just cannot say and do and demand while in your home you all have to live together and respecting each other is paramount why exactly is your ds 25 yo bf living with you are they going to be able to support themselves after they marry or are you going to have to house them too he needs to go i love my 20 something kids but if they want to play house they have to do it in their own house hes been there a year already whats the plan im not overly thrilled with this age gap not that youre so old but shes too young for you its 3 months its not some long term thing happening you should break up with her and tell her to go see her school counselor to get some help with whats going on at home and her self harm you cannot keep dating her because youre afraid shes going to hurt herself she never said that so dont add to the drama let him keep walking these are your kids you make the rules if he doesnt like it too bad do not let your kids see that you are changing the rules because of what he says or does they need to see you standing up for them nta her son is having some issues enough that his dad travel 5 hours to be there for and her biggest concern is she needs a massage she needs her priorities straight leave at the agreed time and if shes not in the car she takes the train home do not rush into their room the second they make a sound on that stupid baby monitor of course go in when they are actually crying why because they will never learn to self soothe themselves back to sleep if you keep going in and bothering them while theyre sleeping learned the very hard way i kind of get the feeling h was too weak meek scared idk to actually think about distancing himself from the rf and when he found a woman who was telling him all the ways it was possible he jumped on it she gave him in his mind plausible reasons to leave and he didnt have to do it all on his own if he had thoughts of not having the life he was born into cause his birth did come with an expectation he couldnt even fathom how he could make that a reality but suddenly someone showed him how that they made a complete and utter mess of it is another story you might want to post this in r texas someone who lives there may be able to answer this forum is for help using reditt wait tho i thought megans friends initially leaked not the actual letter but a paraphrasing of it to people magazine and then her dad allowed some other publication to see it and they printed a big part of it no if thats not what happened then what did no its been 3 months if youre not into her chances are you wont ever be would you want to be with someone who describes you like you describe being with her someone who is repulsed by kissing you let her go now before she gets even more invested in you and since youre young ill add do not tell her you dont and never did feel anything for her just say its not working for you you think shes a great person but not your person nta you need to do two things get a court order for child support petition the court to allow you to move out of state for school he may not be involved now but if you pick up and move are you sure he wont say you kidnapped the child you dont need more problems your financial situation all stems from giving up any assets in the divorce if hes such a good guy maybe you should ask him to give you back your half see what he says if he wants you out thats how it can be done and then you can get the therapy you need what happened to your well paying job as for jenna and the friends theyre out of line did you tell ex what they said and why would he have those people over knowing youre in the house he didnt tell you they were coming and he didnt tell them youd be there whats his game yta for not giving your h a heads up i think son is seeing how dad is with the sister and is feeling like dad isnt doing as much with him now at this age as he is with sister it may just be that dad thinks son doesnt need as much from him and sis does just by virtue of their ages but it may be bringing up abandonment issues for son his bio dad didnt want anything to do with him and step dad was ok but not as paternal with him so hes not really a son to a dad is it true we dont know but son has the perception that it is you said dad went to games played with son etc so you need to figure out why your son all of a sudden feels dad is not dad enough i think you did your son and your h a disservice by claiming rights to your son so while h did as much as he did he may have stopped himself doing more because he was afraid hed cross some line with you not with the son he feels is his own you need to let h know whats going on so the two of them can talk about it your son might actually realize that the dad he wanted was and is actually the dad he got yta its not unreasonable to ask for quiet at a certain time of night i dont know why that would bother you so much stomping up the stairs and slamming the door did not just bother james but probably every other resident of the house taking out the trash is part of contributing to the upkeep of the home you live in if you lived with anyone else or even alone you would have to do some basic chores in the house i dont know how much of your stuff you had in the lr but if it was becoming unwieldy then yeah everyone else shouldnt have to live around your stuff im not commenting on the parking bc i really cant even figure out whats going on there do you think you should just be able to do whatever you want whenever you want when you share a house with others its called respect for your roommates you need to have some and she remembered that one convo exactly its a dead giveaway that it didnt happen like that at least paraphrase it say it went something like and i thought there was no conflict until they were at the fitting now were supposed to believe there was already a problem before the fitting and that c started it and that charlotte cried as soon as she put it on shes 3 she might not like the idea of trying any dress on but she wasnt crying over the fit of it if c had the dress at home and it didnt fit wouldnt she just get it altered oh and of course this whole thing had meg sobbing on the floor again maybe she washes the floor with all the tears she sheds while shes down there multitasking better to check it out hoping all turns out well that struck me as odd like are they sending contracts back and forth in a negotiation this statement makes zero sense so i dont think either of the two directly leaked to the press but i do believe they had other people do it so id like to see a journalist be a real journalist and piece together how the story got to them and that the only way its possible is thru the sussex camp they probably wont come out and name names but they can infer who the person was and that would only lead back to them example if it came from scobie they can say something about the book he wrote or being their main mouthpiece or something it wont shut h up about leaks but he again will be shown to be the ass that he is for spouting off crap he doesnt have a clue about youre going to have to describe this painting a bit more there must be something about it he finds offensive or maybe he just thinks its ugly but is it just that shes not following the religion or is it more likely that hes pointing out that she doesnt have to be religious but she shouldnt be mocking his religion in his own home if she didnt want to pray she should have done the adult thing and respectfully decline not make a mockery of it the bf didnt even blink and was willing to pray probably out of respect that these are his gfs parents and we dont know if he is religious or not d is flouting her independence which 19 yos will do and dad isnt happy about how shes going about it that needs to be a conversation where dad recognizes her as an adult and d equally acts like an adult her praying to her god bf should have been pretty cringy to everyone bf included hes old enough to recognize the immaturity of his gf he whispered to her probably to tell her
