flops in public especially on men so i really think you should put sneakers on how about nicer shorts a polo and a pair of sneakers youre still comfy but look like you made an effort there are a lot of recipes that hide veggies in regular meals try to look up some of them at least hell be getting some nutrients that way one i know is shredding carrot into meatloaf so things like that is it just a case of him not used to these veggies maybe try to get some veggies that he would have from his home country so hes at least eating something healthy does he eat fruit its not a substitute but its good for him at least then you can try to introduce new ones be patient everything is new to him and hes only 10 info how long are you dating and is this your first serious relationship if you care for this woman at all you would let her go you want to go back to normal but verbal abuse has no place in a relationship you admit you have verbally abused her for all 4 yrs of this relationship you are not a good partner because of your anger issues you need to stay single get some help for your anger issues and only then should you try to have another relationship you cannot solve your issues on your own and asking this woman to be abused more from you is cruel late to this thread but ive heard this is a new thing ccl is doing its not so much an offer anyone can earn it i read something about it but i think it works this way as you gamble on the ship you accrue points you always had an option to convert these points to free play while on the same sailing points do not transfer to another sailing so it didnt make much sense not to convert them you did however earn some perks on the sailing ie at 1500 points you get free drinks in the casino you might get a steakhouse dinner or a spa service but idk how many points you needed for any of them now however the new plan is that if you do not convert your points you are supposed to be given a certificate for the above amounts depending on how many points you earn but i believe these certificates are used for a future cruise so is it worth it idk but i just play whatever i would normally play and whatever i get i get i wouldnt overspend my budget just to get to the next level of points im harsh because honestly im gonna take care of me first what he does after you break up with him is of no concern of yours at this point id send a text tell him its over youre done tell him to get some help then block him everywhere and all those friends who hate you now once you block him you can give them a heads up that its their turn to take care of him you know since they care so much then block them too you dont need these people in your life id rather have no friends nta its not your parents event idc who is paying for it your fsil said pants or a dress so you can wear the pantsuit and i dont know you but a pantsuit will look great on you go and have a great time and after the wedding try and keep in touch more with bro and sil i have found that once i really get to know a potential romantic partner their attractiveness or lack of becomes a non issue like their personality just meshes so well with me that they in turn become sort of better looking in my eyes if that makes any sense i know this person would not be on anyones top 10 good looking list but that one trait just isnt a dealbreaker compared to the immense feelings when im with this person but if youre talking about do i have to find my partner attractive all day every day no we all go thru periods when were not looking our best did we gain weight happen to get a horrible haircut that changes the way we look did we radically change the clothes we wear cause were in a weird fashion phase those types of things come and go take a good look at your partner when theyre all slack and sleeping probably not the best look but that is them in a raw sort of way im thinking it wasnt malicious more so that the two of you you and sil are the babys main caregivers not great wording by mil i love my mil but i would have laughed and said something sarcastically funny like wait im the mom i did the labor and have the body to prove it or said to sil ok you get her when she wont stop crying since were sharing anyway i cannot fathom why your h and bil were included unless the gift was a ticket for each of you to go out somewhere together are you gonna get a fathers day gift too honestly i usually dont care if the story itself is a bit disjointed ill see if it evens out or ill even reread a sentence that sounds odd to figure out what theyre trying to say but spelling errors are a non starter for me a random one here or there ok constantly nope i just stop reading you want to be a writer ffs learn to spell or get even a friend to read just for spelling errors i want to know why you want to do this are you gonna wake up and have a couple shots in the morning or wait before bed there is absolutely no good reason for you to do this are you making up for lost time do you think itll make you a grown up what this just seems like a weird ritual to start this is what i would and have told my daughter he can be frustrated and rant and rave about that thing but he has absolutely no right to take it out on you get up and leave you do not sit there and take it you need to draw a line with him tell him in no uncertain terms that you will not be treated in this way this is your first bf know your worth and what you are willing to put up with and what you are not and this is not one saying sorry does not negate the fact that he scares and hurts you there are other guys out there oh yes i watch a lot of news programs the one thing that always gets me talking back to the tv is when anyone usually politicians are on there telling me again what the problem is and blaming someone else usually the other party so ok we all know the problem so instead of blaming someone else tell me what you propose as a solution id rather listen to a ridiculous idea than no idea just give her back the money for her ticket and take someone else wow had no idea about any of that so thank you id be up for building a bigger building you dont have to have a high credit line but you could call your cc and ask them to increase it for a medical emergency it might be helpful to call before hand and ask if thats something they could do in the event of an emergency maybe explain that you have insurance and can prove that so they know you will have the means to repay my policy is a pay now and get reimbursed so if i have to go to the ships doctor i pay and then submit for reimbursement but for example medical evac i call the insurance and they make the arrangements im not expected to lay out half a million for that what form of govt do we move towards correct me if im wrong but the system we have now was laid out in the constitution so in order to change it to something else wed have to effectively dismantle the constitution keep the good parts and change the bad parts that will never happen our system should work there are adequate checks and balances to keep things on the up and up but individual interests are always going to take precedent over the greater good im certainly not educated enough to know where it all went wrong and i suspect its been a long time of small incremental changes that have got us where we are today but it would be an interesting discussion from what i read and see middletown township has a really great special needs program like people move here just for that the problem is there arent a lot of rentals around and home prices are high id suggest getting a list of school districts checking out col see if you can afford to live there and take into account what your commute would be and if you can find anything about their special needs programs dont know if its published but then join the facebook group for those towns or cities and ask there ive seen moms ask and the responses have been overwhelmingly positive those that have been thru it are the most knowledgeable of the ins and outs i think i remember it being this way hospitals were so wildly overcrowded that the idea was that anyone who came from a nursing home and was deemed stable or on the way to recovery could be sent back to finish their recovery in the nh but the caveat was that the nh was supposed to be able to segregate these patients away from the other residents until they were no longer able to infect others if youve ever visited a nh youd realize that this is impossible to do besides there being no empty rooms usually each resident has an assigned room and as is the case with older residents they know where they belong suddenly moving not sick patients out of their room in order to use that room for a recovering but sick resident will not go over well and vice versa moving sick out of their room so i think nhs took back recovering residents either thinking they could make it work or knowing they couldnt but were getting so much pressure to alleviate the hospitals burden or the nh only gets paid from medicare when the resident is actually in house that they didnt want to forgo that payment i have a relative in a nh and i will say there is no way to stop the spread of any communicable illness most of the residents dont even ever leave the home even just to be outside on the patio some more mobile residents can get themselves out there but most need assistance and the staff cant be bothered and there are never any windows opened luckily mine never caught covid during the major surge but we suspect she had it prior i get that she thinks shell get a payout but it comes up so often that kc will be the one who pays that it just gets on my last nerve again with kc paying her out i really dont understand what the rationale for this would be even if she has an nda shell never stop she will find a way to get whatever she wants to get out to get out another leaked letter to a friend anonymous friend source spilling info cryptic statements it is not kcs responsibility to get
