understand the idea that if harry comes she has to also as much as i think its ridiculous but lets look at them as a regular family there are some where ones spouse is not welcome to family things its no secret the rf has no good will left toward mm so while it may cause a bit of a stir that hed be going and not her shell be the one to save face and put out a statement saying she declined to go so at least one parent could spend archies bday with him or some other bull that makes her look not as left out ok thats odd then you need to ask him to explain what his aversion to meeting these people is how is he supposed to get to know them if he doesnt hang out with them his logic is flawed there must be another reason does he have any other friends except you is he shy or have social anxiety if this is the case maybe have him meet one person for a very short time and then another person until hes somewhat comfortable with hanging out with these people the problem i see you having is that this person it seems is withholding work related things from you because you dont agree with her opinion of mm if you outrank her then its time for a chat she needs to know that regardless of her feelings about you based on your feelings of this topic the idea of withholding work related information is not acceptable and it needs to stop now you may want to wait to see if it happens again give her the benefit of the doubt but if it happens again then its time to take action it kind of sucks that shes giving you attitude and you might want to mention that too usually adults can be civil even if we disagree and this is such an insignificant thing for her to be so invested in but she really doesnt have to let him go does she he can just file and move out or share the house till its done its not like they both have to agree to a divorce now she may try to make his life a living hell try to smear him with whatever lies or truths she can get out there but after a while who is going to want to listen to her same old same old and maybe the rf will leak some of the more unsavory things they know about her to ruin her credibility even more yeah i wont read them in the hopes the dm will stop writing about these two i just come here to see whats new so thank you everyone it seems to me that he doesnt even have a communication style whats with the ignoring you nope you need to say out loud that you will not stand by and be ignored you ask for a hug and kiss and he just moves you aside with no explanation at all were you offended by this did you voice that to him and he did what said nothing and then continued to ignore you hours and days later why are you still there he clearly doesnt have any problem not talking to you so give him no one to talk to theres a lot more going on than a diff of communication styles we are one of the few that actually watched and liked suits that said even as we watched her character was the one we always said we didnt like she added nothing to the story lines we watched for the scheming of the rest of the shows characters i think we should all print this article and mail it to harry you know in case he missed reading it those are really cute do i think its a big deal that he played longer than an hour no not really i am not a gamer at all but i can understand the idea that sometimes you cannot just put a time limit on gaming things happen in a game teams are set up and you cant just drop out etc and your post made it seem as if he has been prioritizing you over his gaming for the past few months which to you is great but it probably really bothered him but he was trying to keep the peace with you that is not sustainable for any relationship with any hobby or outside interest i think you are more upset that his hobby is gaming if his hobby was long distance cycling would you be as upset that he goes on hours long rides every day probably not because youd see that as a good hobby as opposed to gaming which i suspect you see as a bad or childish hobby but thats not for you to decide for someone else and sorry but your family was quite frankly absolutely in the wrong adults dont admonish other adults for their likes and dislikes we accept that people are individuals and will like what they like if i was him i wouldnt want to stay involved with you knowing how your family was so dismissive and rude let him be to find someone who doesnt mind his hobby or who will actively participate with him in it youre not the one for him i thought the same thing he wants to get you a ps5 so that he can also play on it id let him know directly that you want a gaming laptop for your birthday you can buy the ps 5 together as a joint holiday gift to each other as far as i can see your bf will do something nice for you but then needs you to do something nice for him like tit for tat and you will do that just to make him happy yikes this guy wouldnt do all the dishes just his in his mind half who does that in what world does this seem like a normal thing to do and to boot you were sick and then he proceeded to only do his half of the chores uh uh no way is this ok seriously i dont care how long you are together he sounds like a nightmare to be with ill bet he never does anything for you just for the sake of doing something to make you happy but you do that for him this is a seriously unbalanced relationship and youre on the losing side ask yourself why you want to be with this guy what is he adding to your life theres a carnival ship that leaves port canaveral on sept 21 2023 ending in barcelona on oct 4 then on oct 28 theres a trans back from rome to tampa nov 12 so you can have 24 days to bop around europe and then sail back to the us all diff airports and i have no idea where youre starting from but it might be something to look about i cant imagine she was fired because its not like she wrote the article in a vacuum someone higher up would have had to see the finished article and approve it for publication so if allyson gets put on unpaid leave the approvee would get worse anyone know if someone higher up at the cut is also gone do we think harry will even attempt to defend himself and expose what shes really like or is he gonna be just as spineless as he is now nta your bros relationship may not be an actual sugar baby one but are you afraid that maybe she likes him just a little bit more since he is comfortable im sure she likes him dont get me wrong but does she also have a career is she established in her own right maybe thats why youre bothered by the comments somewhere you feel shes not kidding i dont know if this is something you can come to as middle ground she has said what she needs is to be left alone to study you have to be able to do just that leave her alone when she says she needs to study there is no middle ground there if your usual way of trying to be supportive is to constantly doing something for your partner then youre going to have to figure out how to not do something and reassure yourself that this is what she wants its going to be a long lot of years if you cant come to terms with this you might need to find something to do all the days shes busy youre a music major so do music play learn a new instrument compose whatever it is that youre wanting to make as your career when you two are together just enjoy the time together whatever you do
