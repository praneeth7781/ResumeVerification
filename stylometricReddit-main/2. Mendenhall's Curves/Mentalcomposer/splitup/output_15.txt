love someone you should never find any other person attractive youre going to find that is just not the case if you think your bf does not find any other girls attractive youre kidding yourself edit to add or you just were fed up with fighting with your bf and your subconscious is telling you to break up nta you didnt say anything even slightly upsetting the fact of the matter is that maddie is not your mothers d and the heirlooms are being passed down through your mothers family maddie might have a case to be upset if these heirlooms were passed down thru your dads family but they are not maddie is 17 she knows how this stuff works so you guys havent been together all that long is there any truth to him saying if it wasnt for the baby you wouldnt be together or was he just saying that to hurt you because you hurt him is his need to get rich now a new thing maybe hes stressing about what he thinks should be his role as provider for the family now with the baby on the way the thing is starting his own business is going to take all of his time to get going when is he gonna have time to be a dad get to know his baby give you a break from work and parenthood your text was a bit rough but the basic message needed to be said you should have had a serious talk about what you see the future like be the bigger person and go talk to him get this settled or itll keep coming up again and again how long are you two together do they have a registry if i could afford it for sibs id go with something big car seat stroller high chair etc if i couldnt afford that or im a younger sib who doesnt work yet or still in school id get a baby bath and fill it with bath supplies towels shampoo baby wash rubber ducky and diapers theyll need lots of diapers but not newborn size go one or two sizes up everyone gets newborn and they grow out of them pretty quick sorry this is gonna come off as slightly mean but what exactly are you bringing to the table you work when youre not sleeping most of the day due to your anxiety and depression you have no hobbies not that i think its a big deal but it could make you you seem to be kind of boring you dont like sex but are willing if the guy is successful enough frankly that is so gross because you seem to think its a transaction take me out buy me things and ill lay back and suffer while you do your thing yet youre looking for a guy who by your own admission seemingly has everything going for him oh and this guy has to put you on a pedestal ask yourself why this imaginary wish list guy would want to be with you youre going about this all wrong relationships take time and you have to put in the time stop looking for prince charming and find your own prince one who melds into your life not one who comes ready made with a lifestyle that you think you deserve build that lifestyle together just something to think about warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info can i ask what you mean by you work when you get the motivation do you not work full time have your own business im not really sure why location would have anything to do with laundering clothes but ill give some ideas im assuming you have a washing machine you can try just adding regular laundry bleach to your wash for stains best thing ive found is oxyclean i wet the garment put a little of the powder on the stain and work it into a sort of paste let it be for a bit then launder it i add about a half scoop into the washing machine along with whatever detergent i use i have also soaked generally dingy whites in hot water and the oxyclean i try to get the oxy to dissolve add the garment leave overnight and then launder if you dont have a washing machine use your bathtub im very late to the party but with regards to him mentioning his age it may be that hes saying that if you have met he may not remember it i think based off your lor which he read this prof probably found something in it that peaked his interest in you was there any mention of a project you worked on with the student maybe he is just interested in your particular field maybe he just likes to meet the up and coming people in the field either way i think it might turn out to be a very interesting lunch think of the stories he could tell you from years back in regards to your field of study i had an older prof of paleontology who had the most fascinating stories of his field work if you do end up meeting him can you update us please nta if shes your friend she would already know that you have been trying to have a baby for a few years does she really think you would plan to be pregnant or have had a baby right around her wedding on purpose shes literally being a bitch right now and the worse part for me is that the other bridesmaids felt the need to text you who the hell do these women think they are your pregnancy is none of their or anybody elses business they can all just fuck right off i wouldnt even go and even better i wouldnt even tell her im not showing up what a wonderful thing to do im sure that boy was thrilled well done nta has it occurred to your h that maybe his dad doesnt want to move its quite normal for fil to be sad and unhappy he just lost his lifelong spouse but it may be that being in their home brings him some amount of comfort it did for my mil and my stepdad your h and his dad just have to go through the grieving process it may take some time but they will get to where they are back to a new normal it takes time there is no rushing it your h doesnt want to hear it now but youre absolutely right his dad should not be making any major decisions this soon sorry but if mom has issues and the child who is still very young isnt in school and is spending 24 hrs with an unstable person then yes its much safer and better for the wellbeing of the child to be placed elsewhere until mom can get the help she needs its not like the 7 yo can raise a red flag for himself better they make the call and a trained impartial person can go and assess if all is ok if it is then great everything goes back to the way it is but if its not then both mom and child get the help they need im not saying you should go but heres a thought you should ask him to find out what the schedule actually is surrounding the wedding what activities does he have to be there for if any have him ask the groom what the seating is like sometimes the bridal party is sat at one table together with their dates or is there a get together prior to the wedding for the bridal party and their dates youll meet the other plus ones who if youre not seated with your bf youll be with the other plus ones but youll have already met them i cant imagine theres something wedding related every day for a week if theres a few days he needs to do wedding things then you visit your family if theres days hes free then you guys can explore the city together i only buy audiobooks for books that i have read i put them on when cleaning or driving or cooking or on a bluetooth when i shower its my background so i dont have to really listen so intently to get the story since i already know it if that makes sense if i listen to an audiobook that is new to me i wouldnt be able to do anything else because id have to pay attention to whats going on in the story if your d stayed home from may to dec did she even have any income that would require her to file income taxes call me crazy but if she didnt pay any income tax because she didnt work and stayed home with her kid while also pregnant theres no way she can get a refund i think youre fine but id check to see what would happen if she also files and you both get audited what will you need to show to prove you and not her supported this child keep the refund you earned it i had read about this before so heres the answer i loved those blankets took one home with each child when you feel its the right time and the other person feels its the right time but please pay attention to what your kids think and say about this person if they have any apprehension at all about you pairing up or spending time with your partner take a step back and introduce very slowly in other words dont force your kids to accept this person it will never work in the long term trust me i know more about planning than i ever thought i would need to just some people find it off putting in the beginning until they realize how good it can be and youre right about dates when dating heres a thought it takes some planning but it might help pick a night youd be ok having sex when he comes home or even during the day let him know sex is on the table for early evening ill guess hed shower since thats his usual and while you finish getting dinner ready have him hang out in the kitchen with you or he cooks whoever does whatever he should since he knows whats coming be flirty and affectionate with you and since you need that romancing itll set the tone then by a decent hour you guys have your fun hes happy youre happy and then you can do your night routine and get to bed at a decent time to get enough sleep and he can play his games while youre having a bath if he still want to play afterwards i get that planning sexy time seems idk weird strange but sometimes its just what needs to happen sorry but as someone who has a hard line at cheating he is totally justified in not wanting anything to do with you thats my one and done you lost this good one learn from that now figure out why you allow yourself to get so trashed when you go out he didnt get you smashed you allowed that to happen you met this guy for 1 month he went back home way across the planet did you really think hes going to want to be in an exclusive long distance texting relationship with you why would you even want that the smartest thing you did was cut him off for both of you now you can both find someone that you can have a real relationship with yta not only a
