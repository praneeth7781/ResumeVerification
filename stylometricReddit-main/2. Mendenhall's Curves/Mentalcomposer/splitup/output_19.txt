of relationship he is his son after all but i would like to think even charles realizes it needs to be a distant check in how you doing sort of relationship kind of like you dont wish any harm but you dont go out of your way to be close charles aside harry has to be seriously delusional if he thinks anyone in his family is going to want any kind of relationship with him and the wife not a snowbells chance in hell they had to pick a lane and they picked celebrity over family at the expense of family now they have neither the quicker they realize that the better from one 30 married to another ive always said thats the secret of course we love each other but we actually like each other thats a big distinction isnt it one im not sure some people understand wishing your husband a speedy recovery and more happy years to the both of you yeah sorry none of that is even remotely ok especially that disrespectful bs with the picture can he not have an adult conversation is it a matter of him not having any money but then he should have at least acknowledged the day does he not do anything for any special day at all you need a serious come to jesus talk with him how exactly does he see you and this relationship is he in love with you or did this pairing just move along until you had a child together and it evolved to where you are now sorry to be so blunt take a good hard look at your relationship im gonna take a guess and say this pairing is much more beneficial for him than it is for you the best way to act in this situation you reconcile this is your own head as you had a good time while it lasted but its run its course youve been long distance with periods of not seeing each other and now hes moving even farther away do you really want to keep this up a few days together every once in a while how about finding a guy who lives near you that you can actually try to have a future with info please ok you had the conversation but what did he say was the reason he did not do anything for v day we need to know what his mindset is before we can actually give any advice it wasnt your moms fault your mom just brought up some uncomfortable things that you and your partner should have been discussing anyway since you didnt your partner had time to think thru the issues your mom brought up and came to a conclusion that it wouldnt work was your gf supposed to go vegetarian and learn hindi your mom points this out but you dont actually say if this is what you wanted also long distance is hard your mom maybe didnt want you two separated for that long she likes your gf didnt want to see you break up the dream may not have happened but it made your gf really think if she could fit in with your culture i dont think your mom had any bad intentions your just sad and want to blame someone did anyone really need a study to know this i love a good full salad but i hate all the chopping that goes into it so i make a huge salad that can last about 3 days so as long as its readily available ill eat it maybe try that make a basic salad that you can add diff things to it to at least make it slightly diff each time the problem i see with even trying to have a conversation about his weight is that he knows hes overweight and hes probably embarrassed by it so i wouldnt harp on it too much for fear of making him feel even worse about it if he thinks you only care about how he looks instead of how he feels that will add to his feeling bad about himself not saying you do this just that kids might twist it to that maybe just a gentle hey kiddo covid lockdowns really did a number on all of us i worked so much i didnt really see what was going on with you or your bro im sorry im not judging you at all but we both have to realize that your weight is unhealthy if you want to or need help figuring out what we can do im here ill listen and well figure it out together and if theres anything else youre struggling with and need help well get some help i just want you healthy and happy then leave him alone about it maybe just give him a few extra hugs he knows what he has to do and he has a world of info with the internet if he wants to do it himself editing after seeing some of op replies therapy would be great but only if hes ok with it otherwise hell just refuse to talk he seems to have a lot going on teens seem to be coming out of covid with mental health issues add to that his confusion of his sexuality and its a lot for a teen to deal with have you taken him for a full physical covid weight gain is real but thats a lot of weight maybe theres a medical reason id at least rule that out nta lets see if mom is willing to support her i get the whole dont make her pay cause im the parent and all that but that only works as long as you can afford it what kind of child sees a parent struggle and still isnt willing to help a selfish one your d needs to be on her own for a while shell get a dose of real life im not judging at all just saying theres a lot missing from the info they put out i can see the 5 yo being with a parent getting gas perfectly fine so i wondered were they in the car caught in a crossfire or were they being babysat by one of the other teens and brought to a party not good how did it get that we have to actually teach our kids that we dont try to kill anyone we have a problem with its a nuclear option to use sad really right so there was an altercation at a party that spilled over to the gas station did someone bring the 5 yo to the party was the 5 yo there with a parent maybe and got caught in the crossfire but why would the child be out of the car so many questions time lots of time you need to date someone until you know them really know them we rush into relationship ships because we want someone anyone were so afraid of falling behind our friends our peers that we take good enough instead of good no guy is totally going to revolve his whole life around youc yea hes being mean and unhelpful to boot he needs to get out of that habit before your child gets older little people need lots of help finding their stuff ok nta whatever she did with it she should have picked it up i dont care how busy she is shes been in that bathroom at least a couple of times over the 2 days and then to yell at you and threaten no sex over it thats a massive over reaction time for a little chat about disrespect of your spouse did she leave her bra in the shower or just in the bathroom how did it get soaking wet i heard it a couple days ago its heartbreaking to think that no one did anything for the boy but i also wondered why the coaches were not required to know cpr even if not you try you have 911 walk you thru it just something i was a cub scout leader and volunteered as a coach for my kids grade school and it was required of every parent coach or for scouts every leader thank goodness mine are grown or now id be staying thru every practice and game warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info im so confused you dated kate but never met her family for 4 years how you must have lived in the same neighborhood if you went to the same hs next you break up with kate during college and what change colleges to the one thats a state over maybe things happen then you meet julia who wont let you meet her fam because she went nc because they sent her away where to take care of her sister would this be kate you finally meet julias fam who turn out to be kates fam and what do you know julia also lives in your old neighborhood and instead of acknowledging to the parents that you and kate had dated for 4 yrs before you met julia you say nothing you tell julia and shes just hunky dory about it and kate just happens to let this cat out of the bag that she had been pregnant in college not exactly what his think would be dinner convo but whatever then you yell at kate because why so i call bs on all of it so heres my very rudimentary explanation i dont own a gun the us is a relatively young country and when it was first discovered there was nothing except for the indian settlements but there was vast wilderness guns have always had a place in our country because they were a means of survival had to hunt for food protect land and animal stock and yes even protection from horse rustlers and robbers so then we fight for our independence from a country who had a national army way back we had no central army we had 13 colonies spread far apart and communication would take days so even if we wanted a central army it wasnt feasible so each state had its own militia to be used in case of attack by a foreign army thats why it was written into the constitution as a right to bear arms we were determined not to be ruled over again as the country became more industrialized and modern there were and still are very rural places where some people need to shoot prey animals you have to realize just how big this country is there are still vast swathes of undeveloped wilderness there are also people who move from those very rural places to suburbia or cities who genuinely enjoy going to a range and practicing their skill it was there way of life after all or they just enjoy hunting so while mass shootings are mostly done by someone who it later turns out had bought a legal gun you have to remember that the everyday random violence is mostly perpetrated by criminals who do not buy guns legally and that gets us into a whole other conversation so you cant bar someone from legally buying a gun in most cases it is their right but you also cannot stop them from using it to commit crimes theres lots of ideas going around but outright banning gun sales is never going to happen while your stat is true it needs to be put in perspective as per this website we found that some 297033 children were married in the us between 2000 and 2018 232474 based on marriagecertificate data plus 64559 based on estimates table 1 a few children were as young as
