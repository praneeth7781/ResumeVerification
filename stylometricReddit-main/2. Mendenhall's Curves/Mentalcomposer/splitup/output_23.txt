they make the mess normally its the opposite but your partner seems unusually messy during cooking have that chat give yourself some time to organize what you want to say and how you want to say it you might as well just come out and ask if they dont want to be here anymore since this is the impression they are clearly giving send child out to a friends house i have a feeling this might not go so well that article was condemned by pretty much everyone that read it since i dont know what can they do to clarkson can they make it so he can never write for a paper again fine him charge him with a crime or will they just condemn it like everyone else omg yes especially when its only a few months in if youre having this many or this big of a problem after a few months just get out why try to save a bad relationship laid out like this obviously the division of labor is wildly unfair im curious tho how did it get like this you didnt just move in and you were doing the lions share was it a gradual tapering off of them doing less and less did partner start out as a sahp which if chores went undone it wasnt a big deal cause child care and rearing take a lot of time but then did they just get used to not doing much this was me but any mention by my partner that things werent getting done caused some small level of guilt like i wasnt holding up my end of the bargain i wasnt being a good partner but thats just me you need a serious sit down with your partner does partner have any health issues that may be contributing in any way do they have a hobby that theyre dedicating all their time to and in a very non accusatory way you need to ask what the hell they do all day while you are at work kid is in school for most of the day i can see having to drop off and pick up but partner seems to basically do nothing make a list divide the work and specify specific days of the week things need to get done theres no reason laundry cant be done every other day for instance its a nice thought but it really would not stop brandon from drinking the bigger problem is that brandon does not recognize that he is an alcoholic despite going thru rehab its normal to relapse but he seemingly has no plans to try to get back to sober and its not that you dont like the real him you actually do like real brandon its drunk brandon you dont like maybe your fianc should be having a come to jesus talk with brandon its fine if he decides that wants to be a jobless drunk but brandons friends should be able to decide if they want to be friends with a jobless drunk regardless of how long the friendship has been yta im really curious why you adopted this child to begin with you already had one son when you adopted and went on to have another so its not a case of thinking you couldnt get pregnant and then miraculously did and she was no longer your only hope for a family as some may think its pretty obvious she isnt treated as a d but as an adopted d she is your oldest child why didnt she get a car and pay for her school even if she got some scholarship you think she had to take loans so why didnt you just pick up the difference do you really think she does not know that shes the not wanted child shes a part of this family in name only i wonder if you did her any favors by adopting her she would have been better off with a family that wanted to give her an actual living family and parents whats the rush with this guy or any other youre in your early 20s with already one marriage that didnt make it totally understandable and youre still not untangled financially from the first guy if you were with the first guy for 3 years and dating this guy for 1 year youre only 23 you got married at what 18 or 19 this guy might be the best guy ever but maybe you should just keep your separate space for a long while longer date him while being on your own for a while so thats what you tell him im not untangled yet and im not doing anything until that gets settled and im not jumping into living with anyone until i know them inside and out and been thru good and bad and very bad but why if you were happy with her and wanted to make a life with her are you so compelled to talk to women online you must realize that makes you pretty sleazy thats why shes leaving you not because of some grand scam she was trying to pull she might have been happy to leave everyone and everything she has back home for a better life with you but you didnt exactly treat her with enough respect to lay off the other women i dont really care that you never physically cheated just the fact that its been going on for the whole duration of your marriage is a testament to what kind of man you really are it just took her too long to find out this is all on you i hate saying it but youre right she should have never been alone the h knew she was having problems im sure his and her family knew even if they never dreamed in a million years she would do something like this because who would even think it at least have someone with her just to take some of the stress of everyday life with 2 kids and a newborn its just so tragically sad is it possible that hes starting to think that hes leaving his 70 yo mom alone and thats why hes pushing for her to go idk if he has siblings left behind that can look after mom if she needs it has he explained why he doesnt think your mom and sister cant be trusted to come with you thats an odd thing to say is he afraid your mom and sis wont contribute financially to the renting of the property because apparently his mom wont be and hes worried it will all fall to you guys so maybe instead of renting both homes as a unit you can each get separate rental agreements on your and their home so you and h wont be on the hook if they decide not to hold up their end idk just throwing out ideas its not what they do or say its what they do or say in that moment if they shut down someone being rude snarky or harassing the first time it happens that goes a long way to show people that you have confidence in yourself and arent going to take any crap from anyone you know hes kind of down in the dumps lately i think it would be a really loving gesture for you to do something nice for him without expecting anything in return you can agree to watching a movie together but maybe you can make a surprise nice dinner for you two maybe his favorite just to cheer him up or a dish you make really really well pick up a candy heart and share it as you watch the movie buy a bag of those hearts with words on them and trade them back and forth basically make a cute romantic night in express to him how much you value him for him not for what he does for you his situation wont always be this way so support him as you would want him to support you if the roles were reversed nta and congratulations you should be so proud have you explained to your parents about the hs grad party and the sweet 16 and why cant they just let you have this one thing that you are paying for on your own i would text all three of them and point these things out youre not asking for anything from any of them you just want to be celebrated once in your life for your accomplishments how they respond to the facts laid out in black and white should tell you all you need to know if they should be invited or not well done india lets look at the two people in this scenario in a 2 yr relationship that is not 100 solid you readily admit to mental health issues and what you are doing to help yourself get to a better place good for you in recognizing this should be your number 1 priority she on the other hand also has some mental health issues and is doing nothing to try to get to a better place now these mh issues have in some small way caused her to forget to take her pill thus contributing not solely to the pregnancy it is totally possible that she could have taken the pill perfectly and still have a pregnancy but the chances are higher by her skipping pills do you really think that two 19 yos with mental health issues who cannot afford to support themselves are ready and able to care for and raise a baby that is the reasoning you needs to speak with his gf about the actual practicalities of raising this child not your immediate feelings not her immediate feelings the actual nitty gritty who is gonna work to support this little family you her both of you then who is gonna watch the baby if you two both work how are you going to afford daycare you both work now and still cant afford to move out of your parents house can either of you earn enough to support all 3 of you rent food utilities car payments doctors formula clothes etc it sounds so exciting to have a baby but the truth is its the hardest job in the world to raise a healthy happy well adjusted person because thats what you will be doing for the next 18 years and if you decide to have this baby please heed this my very unscientific conclusion from fam and friends is that women are more fertile after having the first baby so lay off her keep that in the back of your mind i have no opinion on what you and her should do i just think you both need a serious sit down to discuss the actual realities of having or not having this child have you explained to him that long explanations get lost on you that you physically cannot keep your attention on a long monologue im not so sure that eye contact is needed sometimes i have to picture what the other person is saying in order to get it ask him to break it up and check that youre following him for ex first i unscrew this got it then i take this part off making sure i dont scratch it got it and on and on youll have to be honest tho when you dont get it and he may have to repeat himself but hell have to be understanding about that ah ok that clears up a lot i thought you lived with your bf family full time and that you havent been in touch with your dad for a while i am changing my judgement to yta just for asking bf to skip the wedding youre
