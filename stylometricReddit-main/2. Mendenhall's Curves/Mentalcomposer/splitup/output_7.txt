finding a lawyer he needs to find a better way of communicating the old heshe loves me so much they want to spend all their time with me excuse no its weird and controlling 5 pm for preschool yikes i still wouldnt do it its not your job and frankly you went to school to be a teacher not a bus monitor i cant believe the other teachers dont feel the exact same way this is an assistant problem they can figure it out id remove myself from the situation give the assistants the number to call for a sub bus monitor and be done if they cant get a sub one day then one of them does it you know because its their job nah so greeting guests means what after church when we walked out we stayed by the church doors and as the guests filed out we greeted them thanked them for coming and they have their congrats but this was both sets of parents then leading up to us if this is what youre doing why would you not have stepmom standing right next to dad while receiving guests if greeting guests is a mob thing then id think its a fob thing also are your new inlaws in this receiving line also and its really not all that much trouble to have her in the room where youre getting ready im assuming your bridesmaids will be there also this one seems petty to me like theres not really a reason for it other than exclusion and lastly ive never seen anyone but the best man give any kind of speech at a wedding but that could just be the norm where im from if your dad is making a speech then sm can stand up there with him she doesnt have to talk but its the acknowledgement that they are together and shes a part of your life and his speech should reflect on that nta i wouldnt do bus duty either if its not part of my job as a lead im sure you have other teacher duties that you need to do after school or at home thats the stuff you do and assistants do the bus you have 4 assistants its their job so they can take an extra day each week i would just tell all of them not my job i get car sick and im not doing it they are free to do whatever they want what time does school end that you get back at 6 pm this is really odd to me tho where i live the bus company hires drivers and aides for the bus any change in how they see him is only gonna change if they see him so if he wants any relationship with your fam he needs to start showing up thats really all there is to it so now im curious does she print her signature on everything like im thinking a drivers license or bank acct application my youngest is 26 and they were taught cursive the ex is certainly taking up a lot of space in your head why is that are you not secure enough with your bf how does she ever come up in conversation and what did he say when he told you she misses him but if you just want to break up to save yourself some drama then thats perfectly ok also it may be your intuition telling you that this isnt a forever thing not that hes cheating or anything more a feeling of shes always gonna be lurking somewhere and you just dont want to deal with it and honestly it doesnt seem like youd be all that hurt if you do break up so maybe youre not as invested which is good ill tell you this tho if you decide to stay make sure you go to every family function make yourself seen shes thinking she intimidated you into not going and shes right treat her like shes any other of sisters friend thats not really an ultimatum tho he hasnt really given you any indication hes into you but you keep trying anyway why im sure hes a great guy but theres not much coming from him his indifference is telling you all you need to know hes not the last guy in the world find someone who actually wants to be with you and stop wasting your time do you really want to be with someone that you have to chase until he just gives in then youll be here all sad because you chased and chased finally got him but it isnt the grand love affair you envisioned so its not really about having an independent life its all about having a partner well to attract a partner you need to be a good partner your mh is bad but you arent getting help for it you had a job but they cut your hours so you just stopped showing up instead of getting a part time job since you had extra time to work take a second and just stop and think what you need to do to get where you want to be ask for help if you need but no one else can just give you a life you have to make one just like every other person yta hes 6 hes not a man and you shouldnt be trying to teach him to be a man at his age honestly you sound terrible you can disagree with a book he reads or any other issue but you have a normal rational conversation with his mother and come to a mutual decision she left over this even if its for a night shes got enough sense to leave when you show how absolutely unreasonable you can be next time she may not come back i mean no offense but is there something about your autism that makes you not able to live independently and if you dont mind how old are you you need 2 things a job and an apartment do you have a job if yes then stay where you are for now and save as much as you can if no then figure out what you can or want to do and start looking for that work if you cant find what youre looking for right now take any job the idea is to just start having an income after you save enough money then you can begin to look for an apt and a room mate or two then come back here and ask how much you can afford to pay in rent based on your income and well help you figure that out also i think you over reacted to this situation she was with her bf who i assume you trust since he stays at your home sometimes i can track all my adult kids and only 2 still live at home but i rarely do because they tell me whats going on just like your d did we just always had it since they were teens why would you check that she made it to work what if she just up and decides one day she wants to skip work and go to a park are you gonna go to the park and make sure shes ok leave her alone shes an adult and doesnt need you constantly on top of her tracking is for when they up and disappears and i can tell the police where the last location was but even then the cops can get more info than i can anyway its not just rich people who want more money its pretty much all people there are exceptions of course some people are very content with what they have and arent always looking for more esh im just sitting here baffled that the h is actually complaining to his wife that he has to find a new job because wife told gfs husband about the affair like how is this even a regular conversation between them what should you do you turn to her and tell her cut the crap stop your crying like a baby because i saw an a on tv if you cannot get your insecurity under control this isnt gonna work go see someone if you need to ive been more than patient over the last 4 years but my patience is wearing thin and im tired of it now were here to have a good time and im not putting up with this you can go back home if youre going to be miserable for the next 4 days over something that literally literally does not affect either one of us and then you stuck to that stop giving in to her this might be the most absolutely ridiculous thing ive ever read on reditt and we all know the ridiculousness that is on this site keep in mind that while you would be ok with not having any contact with your family she isnt you and when faced with that choice i think a lot of people wouldnt so she cuts off her whole family and then what she has you and only you you cannot possibly no matter how hard you try replace a motherfather and siblings those are unique relationships that for most people cannot be replaced take some time to get over her and try to let go of some of the anger you have thinking that you were so easily discarded this was probably extremely hard for her to do life goes on and this too shall pass im sorry youre dealing with this you tell your parents what you told us here that theyre lovely people you love them and severing them from your life will be hard but if thats what they choose then youll abide by it but add that you refuse to be verbally abused by anyone at any time so they can call off the dogs you can add that you are absolutely positive in the fact that somewhere in their minds they know they have to know that being gay isnt a choice its the way whatever their deity is that they believe in has made you then you go live an absolutely wonderful life and surround yourself with people who love you being you please do yourself a favor and download a news app even if you dont read any full articles you will at least read the headlines and have a very vague idea of whats going on in the world nta what exactly does she want an apology for your wife is allowed to still be pissed and take some time she offered to drop the kids off what more does dad and wife want has the wife taken responsibility that what she said was done in such a way to make you and your wife look bad and why would she even want that because until she ponies up that admittance and apologizes for it theres no way id want to see her this whole fight was her doing no way is anyone holding my kids hostage like that grandpa will just have to get used to not seeing the kids then depending on the ages if the kids ask just say that grandpa is being a brat and hes in time out nta but your first mistake was not having your own acct have a joint for bills thats your 7030 a joint for savings decide on an amount and each have their own ideally each of your paychecks should be deposited in your individual accts and each person transfers what they need to by you leaving your extra money in a joint acct you are essentially giving her free reign in that acct since she can access it but you cannot access her
