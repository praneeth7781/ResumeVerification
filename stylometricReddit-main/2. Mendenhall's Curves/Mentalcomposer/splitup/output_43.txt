would be a little more busy to attend once they realized that these two were more interested in what can be done for themselves they knew they didnt want to be involved with them more a case of they came they saw and ditched them thank you for the duomo tips why do you have a problem with him hanging out with his friend im a little confused why he needs to be home when you get home its his day off he can enjoy it without you just like you can do what you want on your day off you dont need to be attached at the hip wait your bf was cheating on his ex for 6 months with you thats why you dont trust him to be out of your site i agree she did something related to the embassy that her uncle had a hand in arranging but bower says her dad paid for the study programme and her sister says she wasnt employed by the embassy but was at a school attached to the embassy that arranged work study so really which is it did her dad pay for a program but what kind of program is only 56 weeks or did he fund her living arrangements is the sister embellishing her recollection to make mm look even more like a fool that being said i certainly believe whatever she was doing there had nothing to do with any diplomatic relations whatsoever so basically just another lie to try and make herself seem more important which of course backfired im not really seeing what it is that you need to work on you got a little lazy once you moved in and played games for longer than she would like ok it happens she points it out and you adjust porn once and you have to tell your gf about it this is just silly if the urge strikes and you need a little help finishing why cant you do that does she have to control every orgasm you have i dont even watch but have no issue with it so shes stressed if she cant handle a relationship and regular life stress at the same time it kinda seems like she needs to do some work not you nta if shes as good a friend as you say then she would presumably already know your financial situation and she wouldnt be hurt by you not coming she may be disappointed that you cant be there but she shouldnt have any bad feelings toward you you need to get her on the phone and explain exactly what you told us here that you are upset you cant be there but its your last month of school and you just dont have the money to fly home in jan and then in feb when you have to leave the school ask if when you are home in feb can you celebrate her marriage see all the pics and get all the details of the day i hope shes understanding of your situation its only been a few months and hes cheated already its like he didnt even try to be faithful is that what you want to have in the back of your mind all the time you guys were friends before maybe you should go back to that before you get in too deep and of course dont snoop if your gut is telling you something is off trust it and confront him nta at all it doesnt matter what bil thought he was doing he was way out of line did no one say anything to him at the time your sis your parents not even your husband what exactly would you be apologizing for not sending him his own gold plated invite ridiculous and wedding invites are always addressed to the couple not each individual your sis and her husband can go pound sand do you even really want them there his reaction was way way over the top does he do that a lot please dont change anything on yourself because he doesnt like it today its eyebrows whats tomorrow going to be weight boobs clothes youll get to a point where you wont even recognize yourself nta i would think your parents would want you to go to the competition because of all the hard work youve put into it your sisters graduation is important but its important to her and your parents mostly not that you arent happy and proud for her but its not like graduation will be ruined if youre not there send your sis a text explaining how much this competition means to you and that its not that youre not thrilled for her but this is a one time thing for you signed the sister who didnt go to her older sisters graduation it also depends on your age and life circumstances if you live at home and are a student and its just for spending money then sure why not if you are supporting yourself then you have to figure out how much of that salary you actually take home and decide if its enough to live on since you say its a bit above min wage then maybe its not the worst job to take even if its just to get some experience or if youre in a spot where you need a job any job maybe one of these this is an argument i would have hes known this for 2 months and being that you scheduled this so far in advance ill assume you had to give that much notice and cant just willy nilly change your days im getting the feeling that you placate him more often than not and he feels entitled to dictate what he wants but did you tell him you were taking those days and then he decided to schedule all this private stuff thats the key here if he knew you were taking those days then hes wrong for scheduling on those same days i would tell him too bad he has to reschedule as your days were already set and no way i would be leaving my home for his stuff he can lock himself in a room away from where youre going to be i didnt even know he was in baywatch so i went and looked him up hes slightly more attractive then than he is now but still does nothing for me sorry i know its just me but him now just always looks dirty like he needs a shower so then tell him you cannot be with someone who is so irresponsible with money and break up tell him to call you when he has figured it out jason mamoa def successful and fit but hes just ugly to me yeah you should tell her but i wouldnt make a big thing out of it since youre the same age she might assume youre gonna graduate at the same time better to know now if shes ok with this and i cannot imagine why she wouldnt be youre just dating so i would think there would be a lot of conversations and do wonder why this hasnt come up before i think we all figured he would announce hes already come out to moan that arizona was taken away from lake im more curious to see who in the near future is going to support him and what the rnc is going to say and do sorry but i find it incredibly weird that you collect nudes like why and then to trade them like one would trade baseball cards says to me that your attitude about the girls who post or sell nudes is that they are lesser or maybe not be deserving of respect you think nothing if trading some other girls pics but god forbid you send your gfs pics anywhere shes better than that gmafb youre not a horny teenage boy who cant control himself and needs to troll the internet for exciting pictures to get you off youre supposed to be more mature than that but we know thats not the case dont we take a long hard think about that the absolute fact is that if he wanted to be with you more than his gf he would have broken up with her as soon as he realized that he hasnt so he doesnt he talks a big game wants to respect your values and boundaries but always trying to push them so right there i dont trust anything he says do you think he wont do and say the things hes doing and saying to you if you guys are dating unlikely dont hang out solo with him make sure you have a trusted friend with you when you hang out with him who will stop you from doing anything stupid are you that hung up on him or is he just nice enough and is there at this moment theres nothing to figure out you only know this guy a few months how close friends can you be this guy is still with his gf just the idea that he would even make a move on you shows you his character do you really want to be with a guy who while he has a gf is telling you hes not sure he wants to be with her while also trying to get with you you really have no idea what is going on with his gf he can tell you anything he wants you have no idea how to verify it your idea is solid he breaks up with gf he takes some time to get over her while you two stay strictly platonic friends while you figure out if you want to be with him dont compromise your values for anyone if they cant wait they are not worthy have you two ever even met in real life ldr is just not for you its perfectly ok for you to tell him you cannot continue this relationship wish him well and get on with your life then b has to tell c that they have no interest and to stop asking a to set it up i feel like youre missing a fundamental basis of marriage which is trust you married this person so id like to think it was because you love and trust him apparently not because you really stretched his innocent question about tinder for his friend to thinking hes going to cheat seriously i cant even do the mental gymnastics it would take to get to that conclusion if he was going to cheat im positive he would not be asking you which dating app to use calm down crappy ridiculous arguments like the one you had will eventually be the death of your marriage if you continue these silly arguments you your husband and your marriage will be much happier if you just trust in the fact that you married each other in good faith with the idea that its forever stop looking for the end before its even had a chance to start yta in addition to being an absolute dirtbag and disgust me you obviously have no respect for your gf and only think of her in terms of what she can do for you i dont care how bad the construction industry is in your area you get another job any job you dont pimp out your gf i hope your friend tells and i hope she kicks you to the curb you dont deserve her keep that money it may seem trivial to you but when you were little i am sure you brought joy to that woman by just spending time with her and sharing your amusing stories and she showed you how much she appreciated your company by gifting you
