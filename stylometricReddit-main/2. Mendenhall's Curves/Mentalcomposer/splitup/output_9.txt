a life together there will be other perfect houses skip this one well they shouldnt have been wasting time trying to clear up a stream of errors as it relates to m its a ridiculous notion that above all else they felt the need to devote their time to that just let it go not every freakin little blip needs to or needed to be contradicted that was the problem they wanted so badly to make it look as if m was this perfect person that wasnt real then and it isnt real now i like the idea that both of you on your journeys together great thought he wont feel so alone then youve got this one step at a time and you and him will get there ok so nta for not wanting to take total responsibility for your brother your parents tho total ahs they cannot just decide they are done being parents that aside you dont say what mental capacity your bro has so you need to explain to your bro that you are not equipped to handle being his caretaker and he needs to find whatever is going to make his life the best he can make it but its going to mean he has to work at it no one else can do it for him he is an adult now and a if a group home is the best place for him thats where he should be the idea is to get him as self sufficient as possible mom must have some contacts that she has used in the past contact them get bro evaluated to see exactly what his strengths and weaknesses are autism is a huge range but he at the very least will need mh therapy after that he may need some basic vocation training so he can get a basic job best of luck its not easy youll be overwhelmed at first but once all the pieces are in place you and your bro will be better off im so glad im not the only one who found the idea of him peeing too loud to be bizarre couldnt really care about any of the rest of it i was just stuck on that no not just anyone can go vote you have to register to vote then you get or at least i did but it was lots of years ago a voter registration card in the mail depending on where you live you are assigned a specific place where you vote you can only vote at that place because you will be on their voter roll the list of ppl registered to vote at that spot so when you go to vote you give them your name they look you up in a book you sign the book and they are supposed to make sure your signature matches what you signed when you first registered and then you can vote info i need to know how old your brother is so sit by your dad even if hes not conscious idk his state and just talk say whatever comes to mind ramble he will hear you and youll have no regrets you will have told him everything you havent been able to say in the past hugs to you from your comment i think it matters what he did during this fight that made you feel you had to leave if you felt threatened its completely diff than if you were just done fighting he wouldnt stop and wanted to just get some space in any case hes just embarrassed and even if some of your friends have reached out he thinks others will hold this incident against him so you tell him he either comes on thursday or he doesnt but he cant be sad if you go seems he wants you to avoid these friends so he doesnt look like the bad guy also i feel pretty strongly that you need at least one friend you can vent your problems to thats what theyre for its ridiculous that you would never talk about him or your relationship with your friends we all do it and dont hold it over the partner its a way to get an objective opinion on whats going on very sorry for what youre going through i think the answer is very different for everyone it will depend on what you already know so for instance was your dad military and never talked about it do you want to know that did dad have a first wife and youre curious why is he fighting with or do you just want to hear that you turned out alright in your parents eyes are you doing ok do they like your partner or kids maybe you want to make amends over an issue figure out what it is that you need or want to know and have those conversations maybe your dad should tell your sister that not that i think it would do any good she knew it was wrong and thats why she never said anything to anyone even if she was having a reveal youd think shed have spoken to your mom about names even just in passing conversation look you need to have a talk with pam explain to her that you actually love this guy and even tho you married im not even sure why for a lark a joke just for the trope of a vegas marriage that over the last year you guys realized you had more and are happy but let her know you arent going to divorce just because shes not happy you two are together ask why she is so upset is it because its her friend or did she want him or what because she seems to be upset for no actual reason something else is going on with her during peri i had bleeding that lasted weeks also that was pretty much my only symptom but it lasted years on and off my doc prescribed micronized i think thats it progesterone it stopped it then normal periods for a while and when it didnt stop i was able to just call her and shed call in another rx maybe ask if that might work for you i think youre in the wrong subreddit but i found this and its from jan of this year so its up to date i am not familiar with the diff between a lpr and a green card but you may be also found this i dont want c to pony up one red cent this is harrys burden to bear she can have half of whatever he has and he can pay his own damn lawyers and he can fight for custody on his own if he gets full or half or visitation or none oh well he had those kids with her c doesnt have to worry about those kids being in the los it is practically guaranteed they are never going to be anywhere near taking the throne and if she wants to go and spill all his dirty little secrets so be it he deserves everything he gets is this her first year in school maybe she is really stressed just getting used to it how long are you together maybe shes just over this relationship but the insults yeah id let her know she can think youre joke isnt funny but she cant insult you but by your own admission youre clingy she may have been ok with it in the past but as you both matured she might feel its too much youre both adults you should be ok without constant contact all day long talk to her tell her you feel shes pulling away or not being as receptive and would appreciate it if she just owned up to what shes thinking and feeling rather than you having to guess nta what is wrong with your bf even if this person likes you they did nothing odd or creepy to you so why does he care i would tell the person what bf did and that it wasnt you tho just to clear up the situation so this person doesnt go on thinking you like them go ahead and end this these games will never stop and your bf will never take accountability for anything he does mainly because my whole family is here parents are getting older my kids are here and i would never leave them i dont want to be hours and a flight away if there is an emergency plus my life here is good slight yta why is the bf not going to be in school if they would both be home all day then no i wouldnt let her i would have told her she can stay home on friday and have a nice 3 day weekend please be aware that just as adults need a mental health day so do kids my kids were always allowed to stay home just because because sometimes they just need a break especially by hs it can be mentally draining seriously its a month 30 measly days you are not in love you are not sexually satisfied and you dont want to wait so do what any one would break up and find someone whos not a virgin and date them amazing that at 30 yo you need to be told this it doesnt matter if one of you is home for him now this marriage may not last thats the problem how old are you guys she seems immature your wife needs to figure out what it is she wants either her marriage or affirmation from others because she cannot have both put a hold on the foster and have a heart to heart with your wife shes still talking to this guy which means shes getting something from him that she isnt fri you and thats not necessarily your fault no one can be absolutely everything for another person the last few cruises i went on they lined up the boarding group we had to put our bags on the floor and the sniffer dogs came by so be careful idk what vacuum sealing does but just saying and why does that not immediately scream that this guy is just looking for a wife anyone will do you are just way too naive to realize it hasnt he been in trouble previously how does he keep getting elected or how has no watchdog group been keeping a close eye on him i agree i hate the way it looks even tho i currently have this look haha i dont have very big roots showing but theyre there and i see it a lot more than anyone in my family notices brown to blonde isnt hard to upkeep but it has to be done very often and im due but i just got home from vacay so i scheduled it but its gonna be a few days also depending on what process i have the brown can be made to almost blend into the blonde so its not all flat blonde but highlighted blonde with still some brown so it isnt as obvious youre only 25 theres no shame in living at home if not now then when in your life would you ever be able to save as much as you can youre lucky that your salary affords you a chance to get yourself financially ahead why spend money unnecessarily your gf cares more about what your money can do for her she has said you two should have a lavish lifestyle and travel but the thing is she cant afford to do that only you can afford to finance her lavish lifestyle id break up with her honestly but you need to think about if you want a partner who has goals closer
