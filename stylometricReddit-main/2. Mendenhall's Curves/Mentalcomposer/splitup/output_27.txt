put up with your constant insecurity forever thats not how a relationship works you trust until they give you a reason not to and he hasnt so count your blessings stop looking for drama and have a stress free life with the guy who wants to be with you stop this you are way too old for this kind of stuff even if the bag is back in there do you really think his 11 yo son even wants them heres a clue no he doesnt oh silly me i totally discounted the happy part i hope op updates as each of your timelines comes to fruition oh come on shes actually going to make you move out over a guy who she just met thats ridiculous whats he gonna want next she needs to tell b that he hasnt been around long enough to start dictating who or what she can do with her apt and her life have a chat with a shes acting irrational over a guy i agree i cant imagine how hed act if there was a big problem perfectly fine take a class as an elective on what may interest you and youll find it you are someones perfect person you just havent met him yet do not settle for anyone who is not all in for you you will get over this one and move on to someone better congratulations you earned it what are you thinking of studying you will do great nta sm actually acknowledged that your dad put her before his own kids as if thats something to be proud of wow and your dad has nothing to say about that hes the biggest ah of them all sm would not be getting any apology from me ever for anything she is a horrible mom you need a little chat with dad about what she said nta sm actually acknowledged that your dad put her before his own kids as if thats something to be proud of wow and your dad has nothing to say about that hes the biggest ah of them all sm would not be getting any apology from me ever for anything she is a horrible mom you need a little chat with dad about what she said nta im not sure where she lives when shes not at yours so she can either remain there every day shes not spending time with her bf or she gives it up and moves in with her partner and pays her share of expenses its one thing to spend time with a so its another when shes there for days at a time theres no reason she should be freeloading off you three you need a roommate meeting and she either moves in or is only there when bf is there and if shes visiting she doesnt get to crank the ac eat whatever she wants or treat it like its her home not that she can hang around all day while hes at work someone correct me if im wrong please and ill delete this i think the point is that piers got fired from what i think was a pretty big morning news show when he dared to say probably amongst other things that he didnt believe what m claims so the fact that he was in a sense markled lost his livelihood and now hes back because he has an interview with the pm which is a big deal a couple of things off the top of my head if you can wait until after labor day a lot more states schools are back in session which might cut down the number of kids idk how big the ship you mentioned is but i would avoid any mega ship if your wife doesnt like crowds id stay with somewhere around 3000 people or less there may be less gimmicky things like rock walls or go carts or whatever riyal has we just returned from a carnival cruise out of miami and there were a bunch of lgbt couples and groups i dont know if it was the ship celebration very big or the port or that ccl has lgbt meet ups on all their ships which is attractive to the demographic but i didnt see or hear anything disparaging i realize im one person so that doesnt mean much this might cone off the wrong way but i dont know how else to put it so please forgive if it offends its absolutely not my intention idk if royal had a dedicated meet up but it might help to meet people like you and your wife see this part i didnt know how to phrase who you can be comfortable hanging out with and sort of have your own gang of friends who are accepting i know people hate carnival but ive been on them and ncl and really enjoy both lines carnival has really fun deck parties id go back anyway i cant possibly have another accident right yup im going with that we have 3 more booked for later this year but yeah it seems they arent gonna bill me which works for me saves me from dealing with the insurance company seriously needing evac is my absolute worst fear being so badly hurt that they want me off the ship is terrifying yeah had to do the report also they even took pics of my sneakers which i sort of understand in a weird way i would like to think its so they can see if theres a pattern to where and how accidents happen idk thats what i was thinking since it happened on the ship sounds like me hurt on day 2 it def put a damper on the vacation im sorry your dad went thru that its scary when youre away from home and dealing with medical issues thats what i expected to happen its just really odd that they havent charged me yet i have allianz also so its good to know that it wont be a nightmare if i do have to claim oh yeah i def misunderstood your comment sorry ill just wait and see what happens that is my worst fear and the reason for the outside travel insurance it covers the usual trip cxl and delay lost baggage etc but i got it mainly for medical and evacuation i tripped and fell on stairs and broke my ankle so really not their fault not my fault just a misstep i wasnt tipsy and was wearing sneakers it was just a freak thing they did tell me upfront that they dont take insurance which i knew and what all the charges would be for the doc and xrays after that i didnt really care what the charge was for the cast just do what needs to be done i did have to speak to security for an accident report maybe that has some bearing also idk i figured theyd put it on my ship acct because they didnt ask for my cc i guess ill just keep waiting to see if maybe they direct charge my cc at some point its been 6 days since i went to medical but only 2 days since debark thanks yeah my bill will def be higher than that so it cant be a threshold thing i was expecting a charge to show up on my acct but it never did weird nailed it in one perfect im a bit confused what exactly is he doing that is making you feel bad the only clue i got was you feel uncomfortable and or unwanted by him is this a result of the pregnancy is it a weight issue or what no way in hell would i ever see any doctor that sil has seen or is her babies primary doctor that will only give her more ammunition you have no idea if what shes telling you is really what her dr had said her baby is small she has to find something to brag about both these babies are under a year old do i believe her baby is some super specimen of muscles idk i guess its possible will he continue on that same path who knows dont engage her at all if she makes any kind of off comment ask her straight up what shes trying to say put her on the spot i was going to point this out hes using the majority of the food budget on his food and she has to basically eat whatever fits the budget thats some bs right there op make a new plan that takes food out of the shared acct each of you will then pay for your own food order for the week thats the only fair way he cannot hog the food budget and then make you feel bad that he has to add more money to it let him see exactly how much of that budget he has been spending and stop eating crap food you work you can afford to feed yourself whatever you damn well want to eat this is some serious next level shit with the sister i agree your h should be the one to shut his sister down every time but if hes not around heres some ideas her baby is younger it is not supposed to and is not going to be at the same developmental point as any other baby born before it including yours how to deal with her every single time she tries to make comparisons between babies just repeat oh im positive both kids will reach every milestone when they reach it no rush or something to that affect do not engage in the tit for tat her baby does this so you point out yours did or dies that all that will do is make her compare more just be very meh about everything she may just get tired of goading you when she sees you wont engage of course she may double down and get mean or snarky about you your baby or your relationship ship with your h in that case she went overboard and you are allowed to let loose on her this is what i think they want the family to make a statement admitting to some kind of unconscious bias within the monarchy along with a pledge to stop it an apology for not making sure the press didnt print anything disparaging against his wife in other words for not protecting her to be brought back to their half in half out as a way for the fam to make amends for being proven right about their accusations of course none of this will ever happen but the two of them somehow will keep pushing and pushing until they are proven right but they havent proven any of the accusations they have made so i dont know how they think their delusions will ever come to fruition they absolutely have no leverage against the family ive been out of the loop for the last 2 weeks so im not even sure where their support or popularity is at this point but if its low after all the interviews and his book they should seriously be looking at just working quietly on their humanitarian work if there really is any and stop trying to get a pat on the back every time they deign to speak about any subject the thing is the only real choice you have in that instance is whether you are going to be involved in the childs life the mom can take you to court for child support and then you will be required to pay every month for the upkeep of the child so if youre going to be paying anyway you might as well just be involved that child will grow up and
