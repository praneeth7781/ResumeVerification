rid of her what could she really know at this point nothing so earth shattering damaging to anyone but harry and i have no problem if she drags him thru the mud its just karma coming back to him nta personally moms attitude is crappy you are supposed to fund a gift and a dinner for 4 people just make her lunch at home and be done with it shes taking this mothers day thing way too far considering she only has 1 kid who has a job shes never going to see your side of it she needs to be right more than she needs a relationship with you your partner needs to stop entertaining his mom he needs to tell her if she has something to say to you she should say it to you not him and hes ending any conversation that goes that way shell either get in touch with you or not but your h being the go between at this point is ridiculous it doesnt matter dont analyze someone you are not dating its exhausting move on nobody should have any patience for a constant on off relationship we either want to be together and resolve our issues or we go our separate ways nta you have two other kids in that house that you need to protect not that they need to know i say you have every right to ask hes living with you and you are caring for him through this tumultuous time in his life he should trust you enough with the information but dont say that and just accept if he wont share his diagnosis tablecloths because i hate to see the fold marks when its on the table nta for keeping the letters i would have also do you forgive him the problem with lying is that once they lie you dont know what if anything else is true only you can decide if your relationship is real with him or not what did he say about all of this why lie about having a gf whyd he keep the letters what did she mean to him i have an idea about why he lied but id like to know what he said so im a lot behind on this whole story so if someone could explain please phone hacking i agree would be something to sue over but paying for a pi to get info any him or anyone else just seems to me like its a normal course of events so for example if im a tabloid or even just a newspaper how else could i report on a celebs activities if i didnt know where they would be seems like to hire someone to follow them would be par for the course also the suspicious phone calls what made them suspicious were they hang ups were they asking for confirmation if the subject was going to be at a particular party ceremony etc sorry but other than the hacking is hiring a pi even if its to follow someone illegal walk the strip and go into each casino hotel its fun to see the diff theming nta for trying but i dont think its going to do any good you can try to occupy him when its usually her days but shell just change up her schedule the fact that he proposed a poly says that he isnt willing to stop seeing her and that is the real issue why hasnt he if he knows you are not happy with her specifically why isnt he putting your marriage first what did he say when you said no to a poly situation she sounds a bit unhinged youre getting in the way of true love and its gods will does he not think these missives are a problem he may well be miserable in the gloomy grey cold winter time its a thing but also some people dont need to see their so every day you guys see each other at work so theres no reason you need to be seeing each other every night also when do you see your friends do laundry grocery shop pick one week night and make that your night wed is good its right in the middle then you can decide if and what youre going to do on the weekend hes telling you its too much not that he never wants to see you again give him space so basically you just dont want him to show up on mothers day with a gift from your kids and then you all go to his moms like youve always done because you had a fight and are still not talking if you successfully dodge him on moms day and he gets in touch on monday what are you going to do it seems like youre trying to punish him by making him go to his moms alone as for the picture chances are his d is putting hers in front of yours find another spot you dont want to go on vacay with his parents bc of whatever happened last year fine but has that situation been resolved at all if not why would you ever entertain mothers day with his mom no key did you ask for it back or were you waiting for him to make a grand gesture over it theres a lot of passive aggressive going on here speak up use your words look its been 9 years it either works or it doesnt and it seems like it doesnt work maybe it did for a time but realize this both your and his kids are seeing this and im sure its not the first time this is the way this is all what he thinks theres not one iota of what he says that would show that he actually knows for a fact that the kids watched or that the non existent party happened or that h tucked anyone into bed that night so basically this is a non story its really easy for anyone to say what someone else would do or thought or felt but those ideas are based off of what we ourselves would think or do or feel why even give this guy any interviews have they not caught on that hes not reliable at this point warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info did they actually say that do they really expect you to never have another partner that you should be alone and lonely while they go off and make their lives were not talking about children here who are still living home they should have some semblance of sharing a life with someone especially the 29 yo so if any of their marriages dont work out they are never going to look for another partner because they might be replacing the first one your kids are being selfish by denying you the happiness you deserve and im over here pushing my step dad to move on and its been over 10 years since my mom passed i want him to have someone to share his life with why should he be alone nta but your dad sure is the first person he should have told is his wife what does he hope to accomplish my telling you kids first is he hoping one of you will tell mom so he doesnt have to he makes no sense at all what if he tells you all and takes his sweet time telling mom do we all just pretend all is well mom might not see it coming but shes been as unhappy as him she might welcome the divorce i need to know how this person knows their partner did the partner move to nigeria after an in person relationship or is this an online thing if its online absolutely no way in hell should a parent leave their child to go meet someone they have never met and i dont care which country it is but doubly if the country could be dangerous if its a case of knowing this person and they had to live for a legit reason like a job then i might go but my partner would need to meet me at the airport and not leave me alone in an unfamiliar country doubly if its a dangerous country come on this is basic common sense even if i didnt have a child why would i put myself in a dangerous situation in a foreign country i have no idea if nigeria is dangerous to travel to i got the sense that you think its dangerous yeah and we have no idea if thats really what he said ive seen 3 or 4 diff interpretations of the lip readers i dont trust any of them i do find it hard to believe that h would talk about either his fam or m in this way so freely with jack unless they have been in regular contact like was jack asking how are you and h went into a litany of complaints or has jack been privy to any ongoing crap with m or the fam that theyve previously spoke about i didnt think they had that kind of relationship if they do it would be the only secret either harkle ever kept does your h understand that your dr has not cleared you to go back to work theres clearly a reason for this explain it to him again in plain english obviously his advanced degree isnt in english i will never be able to go back to my high paying job that i love that supports this family if i do not get myself mentally healthy in order to get healthy i need to rest and rest means not working a crappy job while you refuse to be a partner to me and a responsible dad to our children the answer to this is that you take over being the support of this family as i have been for the past 10 years if you cannot do that then you are not the man i thought i married that man would be worried that i had an actual mental breakdown at work that man would be doing everything in his power to support me until i am better and able to resume my career if that is not you then tell me now and ill figure out what my next steps should be because i cannot go on like this sorry but i cannot understand your husbands attitude at all i dont understand why anyone would change majors just because they arent getting straight as that was the first mistake your kid made straight bs gets the same diploma as as so they changed majors to something they didnt even like thats the second mistake so now theyre miserable just let the kid quit this job if they keep getting bad reviews they wont have a job and they wont have a god recommendation either let them come home get some therapy if they need it and let them figure it out from there this isnt a hard decision nta first off quit whatever job you have your health is more important does your h at least agree with the fact that the household needs an income that covers your bills and even more importantly has benefits that cover your medically fragile child this is a man who has a masters degree and is confused as to why he needs to get a job so what exactly does he think the solution should be too bad if its going to hurt her someone always is going to be upset in a breakup better her than you break up block her everywhere and move on youll be better
