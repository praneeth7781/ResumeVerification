to apologize i wonder if he had anything to say to her when they got home and thats your fault how exactly pretty sure he deals with this idk every year does he become unbearable to everyone or just you anyway nta so now youre already weak and cant drive im going to assume tomorrow wont be any better because you dont have the meds you need to keep you stronger so is he gonna get them tomorrow or do you just wait for winter when it cools down a bit hes not really a good partner if these meds are a life long thing how can you trust hell take care of you in the future or if your condition gets worse i was thinking you were talking about booking thru dvc because you referenced the 11 month mark which is when as a dvc you can start booking if you werent then disregard most everything i wrote because it will not apply i havent made a cash stay at disney but if the booking window only opens at the 11 mo mark then the advice to be ready at exactly that day and even as close to the hour as possible would still apply sorry if i confused you im a little confused they want to figure out why so many others of their own party but really its jan 6 ppl and trump are being investigated as opposed to what just sweeping it under the rug and not investigating or are they saying these are not legitimate investigations and are more being done based on party politics if you break the law you get investigated and probably usually maybe charged im getting a little sick of congress investigating anything they investigate while ongoing investigations are being done by other law enforcement agencies its just redundantif i was an innocent witness id be overwhelmed being grilled by le and congress as long as you have enough home points at either or both resorts you should absolutely be ready to book at the exact hour at the 11 mo mark check to make sure but im pretty sure you cant combine your poly and wl points to use at either resort at 11 mo youd have to use for instance your poly points at poly at 11 mo and then add to the res using your wl points at the 7 mo mark because one of them isnt your home resort at the other resort i hope that makes sense keep in mind if youre looking around at 2023 summer availability to get an idea of how it is its already past the 11 mo and close to the 7 mo mark so you wont get an adequate comparison if youre looking at 11 mo out availability just to see what it looks like in 2023 its not a good comparison because its a diff month and season if im doing it right that puts you in late nov early dec which is prime time what change exactly are they fighting for do they think just because they are an interracial couple they can eradicate racism by what just being a couple if it was that easy it would have been gone decades ago exactly what injustice has been done to them megan got some bad press well welcome to the world of a public figure it happens to any and everyone who has a public profile these two think that just because they want to be seen as doing no wrong no one is allowed to call them out when they do wrong anybody else just getting bored of the whole thing i come here to keep up but its just a never ending circle jerk and if no one reported on them theyd just do something even more outrageous to be back in the news and start the whole cycle over again yes i realize how that sounds as im commenting on them but its just all so absurd these two are so dramatic any visit they would have in the uk for any royal engagement theyd take a private plane cause they could never fly commercial and be driven to whatever royal house theyd be staying at their security guard they already employ could travel with them once there they have regular security for the house compound grounds etc thats already in place anyway then when they have to get to the engagement theyd be traveling with all of the rest of the family that would have security there is literally no way anyone could get to them not that anyones coming they really think theyre all that huh ywnbta its time you sit your mom down and lay out some facts that she either gets on board with or she doesnt come these people have done nothing wrong and have actually been good to you i think its great that you can have at least some of her dads fam in her life tell your mom that going forward its joint everything and that includes your fil she doesnt have to like everyone that you choose to be friends with but she sure has to respect your relationships with them her crying over this stuff is so over the top its childish the longer you allow it to go on the worse it will get 7 months on and off this is not a relationship thats going well no cut your losses now shes gonna find something else to fly off the handle for and youll be equally as baffled as this time and her following you is odd she was probably worried you were snooping in her room because you were taking longer than usual because of the spill which then also explains why she sent you out and she stayed behind to make sure everything was in its place do you want someone who doesnt trust you why are we even discussing kc paying her off he owes her nothing not even ransom to get his son back if h suddenly decides he needs out then he can go thru the divorce court on his own and they can fight it out so basically h just refuses to listen to any criticism of anything his bro and dad say about m megxit and bullying but when the bro and dad refuse to listen to his counter argument theyre in the wrong he just refuses to believe that she can be anything but an angel and thats why hes in the position hes in the 25 page bullying rebuttal is probably filled with excuses shes american she didnt know thats not how she does things shes direct not rude etc but it doesnt matter she joined a family that has rules regulations and a way things are done you cant come in and expect them to change for you and thats what they wanted they wanted to modernizean institution that doesnt need modernizing because to the witch that means making the brf a money making merchandiser and once again this is why the fam doesnt want to talk to him because there is nothing private im gonna be brutally honest with you you willingly got into a relationship with a man who cheats and leaves every relationship hes ever had and to placate him you decide to have an open relationship which really in this situation is just you agreeing to let him cheat how exactly did you think this was not going to end any other way than with him leaving you did you think as long as he was having sex with other women he would always come back to you why would you want a life of sharing the person you love with multiple others and the worst part you brought your then 9 year old at the time who grew up in this situation along for the ride think about what youve been modeling to your d do you want her to hitch herself to men who cheat and leave or do you want to model a monogamous loving relationship which is what you should be striving for you know what you have to do find some self respect and leave his sorry ass stand up for yourself and show your d now while shes just starting to figure out relationships what she should and shouldnt be accepting from a partner whats wrong with his health i havent heard of anything everyone already thinks andrew is scum so writing unflattering stories of andrew insulting or upsetting either one of them isnt going to elicit any sympathy for hm or andrew knows way too much about her past antics or hes not high enough on the pecking order knocking him down a peg or two isnt gonna elevate h to king or he needs to stay in beatrices good graces to get the inside scoop or most probable andrew just doesnt care enough to have any dealings with the lunatic fringe of the family he saw the train wreck coming and noped out seriously tho where did he get the hair did he cut it off her head in the coffin did she give it to him after a haircut and why would he even want it did he need it to make a witches potion im so baffled by this hair in a box yta a massive massive one there is no excuse for a 7 yo to smear lipstick all over anything your d showed great restraint in only yelling at the little brat the one who should be punished is layla she has been told repeatedly to leave your ds stuff alone and she keeps repeating the offense with no consequence you cannot expect your d to lock up everything she owns every single day and night in her own room that you moved her ss into because you wanted to marry her mother stop bending over backward to placate your wife and her kids thats ridiculous what is wrong with you how did you ever parent your own kids since it seems youre clueless give your d back her phone buy her a new dress and punish the 7 year old stop making your 16 yo teach the 7 yo what her mother should be teaching her oh and of course your wife thinks the punishment is fine her little angel of a d should never be made to cry be a better parent to your d come on man you went to the best schools from the age of 3 are we to believe that you never ever had a lesson on hitler and the nazis does he really expect us to believe that he had absolutely zero idea that costume was not just offensive but its one of those absolutely do not do things the fam def paid way too much for his education at this point the longest or shortest idc serving independent enough with d and r it stops the circus thats happening now i think willy and harold are honestly just snarky nicknames that had for each other as kids i could see harry calling him willy as in dick and w calling him harold because its like an old man name theyre were just making fun of each other as kids nta i agree it wasnt your secret to tell your wife is now realizing that her idea of honesty is telling everyone everything and that now that she sees the flip side of it she will change her ways this is a good thing she should let your d know that she realizes why d wouldnt tell her and that now that she sees the repercussions of her flawed strategy she will respect whatever d chooses to share with her this could turn out to be a good thing nono you got it all wrong megsie was the one wronged
