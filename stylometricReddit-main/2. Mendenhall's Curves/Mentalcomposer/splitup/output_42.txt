in the room with you and just chat away at them while you clean if youre making bottles bring them in the kitchen and do the same they will be fine if they fuss a bit its what they do as far as the formula im not even sure what your wife was upset about she had to tend to a crying baby while you went downstairs to make a bottle maybe her job should be to make sure there are enough pre made bottles made to last thru the night you can then clean and make them to last thru the day nta they are your assets and can go to whoever you want id think dan would know why he wasnt included if your son is old enough and has had a good relationship with his uncle before he cut off contact maybe one of your other sibs can give him dans number and your son can text him but be warned you dont speak to your dad your brother has turned against you do you really want your son conversing with someone who is going to talk bad about you you dont know what dan is going to say or if your son is going to decide youre the bad guy be careful what you wish for this is the only answer people cannot be won in a fight if they dont want you accept it and move on ywnbta this person has accused you of despicable things and then went oops sorry didnt mean to totally screw with your life cause really im sure the whole school heard the accusation lets be friends again how does this person even have any friends left after what they did nope how could you ever trust this person ever again id stay as far away from this person as possible as long as you find a dress that you absolutely love within your moms budget and i am sure you can i would just tell mil that while you appreciate her offer you really want your mom to be the one to buy your dress its a mother daughter thing and that doesnt take away any good strong feelings toward her and you appreciate all the help she has offered for the wedding she should be able to understand that md bond and respect it also can i give 2 pieces of advice plan your wedding for what you and fianc want his mom might want top tier everything or every option on the menu but figure out if these are things that you really want sometimes less really is more go dress shopping with just your mom you will know which dress is yours its a feeling when you see yourself in it your dress shouldnt be decided by a committee too many opinions will cloud your judgement ive watched too much say yes to the dress but i honestly believe this congratulations and dont stress about planning this should be a happy fun time how long have you been dating have you guys even talked about what the future would look like once the baby is here were you planning on being a couple look i think its unreasonable that shed choose to spend tgiving with another guy is it just the two of them or is she going to his familys holiday since i would think you two were in a committed relationship but idk her situation are you working that day does she not have family close or friends she could spend it with did you two even talk about what you were doing for that holiday her idea that two guys cant hang out alone is off the wall to begin with i dont even know how shed go right to must be gay you need to make some decisions do you want to be with her do you just want to coparent and not be a couple take today to decide and then contact her to tell her what you decided youre old enough to make these decisions about whats best for you either way id def get a paternity test and have everything go thru the courts especially since youre military and could be moved at any time protect yourself and your rights to your child talk about division of chores but realize that at times things wont get done its ok if some chores like dusting or vacuuming dont get done on sat every single week itll keep just be flexible with almost everything youll eventually find a rhythm that will work for you both i think theres more to this what did your friend mean about making better decisions about you the pregnancy the family friend what would make her jump to you are gay unless your friend texted more than what you know really just let her go dont even try to contact her if you think its your child go thru the courts for paternity testing visitation and support dont even try to work this out with her youll be in for months of crazy nta for all the reasons everyone else posted but also because as you stated youre not even sure if your d is telling the truth not yours or your d place to say anything warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info him having no one to hang out with isnt your problem he moved to a place he knew no one thats what happens you broke up when you were a junior in college youve moved on and its time he did too but you have to tell him or hell keep trying to force his way into your life its not odd that he moved to your city but did he have a job lined up other friends or at least a reason other than he likes it hes free to live wherever he wants but it does seem like he moved to be closer to you and thats creepy heres the thing you do not have to be friends or even talk to anyone you dont want to so if you dont want to talk to or be friends with the ex just tell him dont explain why this isnt a conversation this is you stating call him or text him it make it short i dont want to talk to you anymore we are not friends goodbye then hang up and block him if you called do you just let that talk to you that way or so you answer them back say it firmly and let them know in no uncertain terms that if they say anything else about your food you will not be back i realize theyre your parents but at this point it should be more of a reciprocal adult relationship not a parent child one they should treat you accordingly the thing is you can never be absolutely certain that a partner is not going to cheat its only been 3 weeks the hurt over his cheating is in the forefront of your every thought your fear will be brought into any new relationship you have maybe you shouldnt be looking to date and give yourself time to just be eventually you will find someone who you want to be with and the fear you have now will be lessened to the point that you wont be in paranoid mode paranoid mode which is not at all healthy will only lead to you questioning everything your partner says everything they do and it will drive them away nobody wants to be looked at with constant suspicion for just living their life dont let this fear take over your life this too will pass sorry no no one needs to placate their partner to the detriment of their own well being your wife is insane divorce over an over cooked chicken sandwich i cant even is she frequently this absurd have there been other issues that she goes insane over if you dont cave in to for me id just agree to the divorce to save myself from the crazy i am curious tho did she eat her whole sandwich how about the sister yta you certainly have a very high opinion of your family dont you most times when i meet someone like you i cant quite figure out why the fastest way to keep them together is to make them be apart and really you are a grown woman and you really are entertaining the thought that your 16 yo is going to be with this guy for the long term we all thought that at 16 and it never does for the majority anyway leave them alone your d will decide if and when shes had enough why doesnt he want your dads money is there any bad blood there how does your dad treat your h older kids have you told your h that its almost insulting that he wont allow you to help shes as much your d as his at this point and if its a trust then its your money not your dads no you can also go along with leah taking out the loans she wont have to even start paying them back till 6 mo after she graduates at that time maybe your h will soften his stance and you can pay off the loans i thought i heard read that your phone does listen to what you talk about but if you turn siri off it cant anybody know if its true theres a lot of anxiousness when they leave the house in the beginning a lot of texts saying they arrived wherever then after a bit it becomes commonplace and youre actually glad you dont have to stay up late to pick them up from wherever they went go on the trip memories with your friends will last a lifetime you cannot know what the future holds you or your gf will get to uni and the distance and freedom may cause one of you to want to explore what else is out there why will it take him time to figure it out does he not read newspapers or magazines does he not have friends who know whats going on with them hell if hes so close youd think hed try to keep up with whats being put out there i just cant figure out what the end game was supposed to be with this display the connection to diana can only go so far he may have a soft spot for harry but she has been instrumental in harrys misery elton should sing about that im pretty sure this is illegal why would you even want to be married to someone under these circumstances you will be putting your relationship life on hold for the foreseeable future are you really willing to not have a real relationship with someone you love it does not benefit your life in any way i say just tell her youre not comfortable with this and the answer is no nope theres nothing to discuss in my book this is a no coming back from break up thing brooke sivendra royals series and the james thomas series is awesome anything by megan march christin harber has a delta series thats pretty good i could be wrong but even up until the baby shower i think the perception of h and by extension m was that they were all about championing causes i could see the clooneys being somewhat in that circle they have a justice foundation and have a charity geared toward sudan now why amal was invited was probably more to do with m wanting to appear to be friends and cash in on that status but i would think amal
