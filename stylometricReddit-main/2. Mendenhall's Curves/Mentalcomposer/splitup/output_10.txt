to your own and she doesnt she thinks youre boring unless you can lavish luxuries on her and its only going to get worse as you make more money shell want bigger and better by your own chart it takes 95000 just to start up a daycare less if the contingency and working capital is lower so lets say you magically find a benefactor for that money im not sure i understand how youre going to lower the cost even if its not for profit it needs to self sustain at some point being transparent in how the money is spent is all well and good but it doesnt make up for the fact that running a business takes money you could run the tightest budget but there is an absolute bottom line needed to run teacher costs need to be in line with teacher salaries especially that pre school is in a sense a specialty i proposed the admin being paid at the same rate of a teacher so no excess bloat there and at a modest 45000 year for each of those positions were at 9000year per child ok so we take a loss for a year or two weve only got about 40000 contingency and capital how long will that last we add in older kids for a smaller ratio and increased income thats another teacher but we have to get them to the center after school do we need a van or a bus maybe we add night or weekend baby sitting service for a small fee we still have to pay an adult for that we can ask for volunteers older folks who are retired or moms that have their kids enrolled they dont add to the payroll but they need to be bonded maybe you dont have your own building maybe utilize empty classrooms in a school or community center of the town im sorry i feel like im missing something but am very intrigued to see a way for your idea to work so i think your idea sounds great in theory but a quick search brought me to the staff child ratio for kids 2 124 is 1t for every 10 ks so lets assume a teacher salary of 45000year conservatively that divides to 4500year per child just to pay for a teacher add to that at least one administratorrent insurance supplies and idk what else lets say we pay the admin the same as the teacher so were looking at 9000 per child before factoring in any other expenses the average cost of daycare in nj is between 1012000 a year so based on these numbers i cant see how you can run a childcare center for less than most parents are paying now and even if you dont take a salary to start at some point youre going to want or need to draw a salary now i dont know if the state has any programs that help with daycare costs if so then maybe its doable you might be better off getting a home based daycare license and having less children while also incorporating a learning atmosphere warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info maybe your friend is the boring one and he needs drunk you to make his party a success or youre just really fun at parties drunk or not and he just thinks youre drunk because you are such fun and hes too drunk to tell the difference i would be slightly insulted by someone saying that so go to the party have a few but dont get drunk and be your fun self nah you havent actually explained why you dont want your h to take this job has it occurred to you that he has been out of sorts for 3 years and maybe your h feels like he needs to work a lot of people get their self worth from working and contributing to the family plus you mention insurance which if you dont have is kind of important how is his health now can he even handle this job why exactly do you not want him working is it his health or do you need him home with the child so you can grow your business or do you just not want him gone for 2 weeks at a time because then you have to do it all does your business cover all of your bills or are you dipping into savings every month its always better to have more savings than less you need to find out why he wants this job at this time if he has legitimate reasons then maybe you should try to support him in this if you need to you can put your child in daycare while you work on your business will it be hard while hes gone absolutely but supporting our partners is part of the deal he supported i dont mean just monetarily you when you wanted to start your business ok i have to ask what exactly is he doing for work hes in an awful rush for someone who is a spender why is he in such a rush its been 6 years he can wait another 2 youre both still so young you say you have money saved for a house down payment i cant help but wonder if he sees you as his cash cow has he saved any money since he dropped out of school sit down and reiterate to him that you have always said you will not be married until you have completed your schooling and have a stable job let him know this is what you want and him constantly bothering you when you are still in school is useless because even if you wanted to marry right now you wouldnt im sure hes a great guy but think long and hard if you who from all youve said sets a goal and works towards them and achieves them while he seems more like flitting from one to another thing based on his whims you need to see how comparable you two are when youre both out in the real world rent bills chores etc you may find you want a guy who is more on your wavelength nta who believes that youre a fool if you learn from your own mistakes isnt that the point make mistake learn from it dont do it again does she keep making the same mistake over and over again in this case her saying she knows shes right and youll continue it at another time just means she will harp on this until you agree with her and she can then gloat about it yta how has this conversation not come up in 3 years stop brow beating the poor kid his mother has told you how she feels maybe you should try listening to her it is quite possible that you arent as all knowing as you think you are i will say tho one way to get kids in the habit of please and thank you is to just always say it yourself they hear it and model it it almost becomes rote to say it kind of like amen at church thats my experience anyway its 3 months youre not officially bfgf and hes asking telling strongly encouraging you to get rid of something youve had from your childhood nope not happening adults are allowed to have comfort things him saying hes there to comfort you is weird to me like only he can do that for you you keep that bear forever and take him out when you need to you got this now hope hes a good kisser okay i can better see why you wouldnt want her there but she really wont be able to outshine you at your own wedding as long as she doesnt get the dance which is easily done what else could she do you let the photographer know to put her in her place you get the band to ignore her requests and you warn her shell be tossed if she gets out of hand if you might want things to get better then ask sis if shes be willing to go to therapy with you maybe an outside person explaining to her why her attitude is harmful to you may just make her take a back seat at your wedding or just dont invite her but that plays into her idea that you know shes better than you and thats why you dont want her there good luck dont stress too much you have a year to figure it out how about at the end of the night when he drops you off at home you can just flirtingly say something like what no good night kiss it will only be a teeny tiny moment of fear but i guarantee you he will kiss you good night ywnbta im struggling to understand what is wrong between you and your sister i understand sm being nicer to sis but thats not her doing anything wrong she was a child at the time too so i can understand you not having anything to do with dad and sm but you got along well enough with sis to be a bridesmaid for her just so i understand tho you dont want her there because you think shes going to somehow have a fd dance with step dad at your wedding easily fixed you tell the band they cannot under any circumstances take song requests and you also let sd know what shes thinking and ask him to not dance with sis at all if he understands the whole dynamic and realizes the place he has in your life he should be willing to do that thats what i was talking about put that on your tik tok your insta anywhere you use social media and ill add the florida law has a rape exception also but it has to reported you may be toxic but that comment was not how about compiling a list of birth control resources put it on tik tok instagram twitter places younger women might frequent and fb for the older women take a diff approach and try to prevent an unwanted pregnancy instead of having to deal with it after the fact and have a connection resources that connects women willing to fund bc for women who cant afford it well the easy hard answer is to find a job in london and move there you have a roommate now so get one there or find a job in london and live in a suburb close enough to enjoy the city but less expensive what kind of engineer are you this is what i always thought also just let me get up and walk off then the rest can deal with getting their bags and while were revamping debark can we just board the plane by rows starting at the back please ill even let first or business board before me theyre not the problem find a boy scout troop in your area they would be happy to have it they do lots of camping and might have kids that dont own gear elementary schools have cub scout troops but boy scout troops usually arent run through a school but if you can get in touch with a cub troop they can put you in touch with a boy scout troop that they usually feed into tomatoes i could not stand the texture of the seeds even now i wont eat the seeds in the big tomatoes i cut them out but can handle the small cherry tomatoes i love the way he says itll never happen with you two because you arent going to have kids as
