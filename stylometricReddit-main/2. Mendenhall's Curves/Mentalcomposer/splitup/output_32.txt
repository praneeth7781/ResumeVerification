by all members of the family the media her ex husband her ex bfs her dad her siblings in all things ever they all caused the strife that was blamed on her and shell keep saying it until we all agree with her good point youre right they probably laid it all out for him and leaving out the details is what makes him look like a whining child im sure c had a legit reason for not wanting m there and even if its that he wanted just immediate family h cant say what that reason he was given because it would make him look bad to argue about it so he leaves it out thinking it will make c look like the bad guy but of course that would never happen because c can dictate whatever the hell he wants in regards to his mothers death whats meant by this its not hard to see why prince harry and meghan markle decided to leave england amid all this drama and tension and we havent even gotten into harry and williams physical fightwhich you can read about in detail below the drama and tension was started by harry and megan with their over entitlement with their feelings of superiority their jealousy of every other working royal dont want drama and tension dont start it you need to keep working on your jealousy issues or they will come into play and ruin every other relationship you will have in the future take your jealousy issue as the lesson you learned from this relationship and use that thought as motivation to move on and be thankful that this happened at a young age instead of having a string of failed relationships in the future i would advise that you not spend all your time with a partner its not healthy for anyone its not sustainable in the long run its not that you cant move in because youre so stuck on this o e girl its that you have no idea what to do with the time you normally spent with her find a hobby read a book do a puzzle anything so you dont just sit like a lump on a log and pine away for someone that doesnt want to be with you after the book if theres more vague crap the palace can legitimately make a statement saying something to the affect that even though the k will always have a fathers love for a son its become quite obvious that h m are doing their level best to distance themselves from the family for the celebration of the coronation the k has decided that he will adhere to their want of distance idk something diplomatic without coming out and saying no one wants them here no one is ever going to think it has anything to do with race that horse is dead beaten dug up beat some more and reburied most telling to me is this passage harry then accused his brother of acting like an heir unable to understand why his younger brother was not content to be a spare this is the crux of h he admits it all of his moaning and it all comes down to the fact that he isnt going to be king too bad so sad 30 years and he still hasnt come to terms with it i think being a global icon is her goal she thought she hit the jackpot when she bagged the dimwit she really thought that overnight her name would be recognizable to everyone and every possible door to fame and fortune would be opened for her so basically she thought shed be an icon for basically getting married in reality shes half of a couple with a victim complex who people are sick of hearing from and about i think an invictus show would have been interesting to watch if and only if h was actually working with an organization to benefit and help veterans if he did that and it got even minimal press i think ppl would tune in it seems to me that he hosts the games and then disappears theres zero follow up on the athletes the help they get nothing idk anything about invictus are they an organization that puts these games on do companies sponsor the games is it a money making endeavor what do the athletes get out of competing in these games i thought i saw somewhere that somehow the rf was instrumental in starting it these are the answers i would have liked to see answered from a docu of the games if its just disabled vets competing in sports then what sets them apart from the para olympics i guess theres something to be said for it being all vets so many arguments can be avoided if we just talk to each other everyone in my house knows when im going into the kitchen to cook did you not know she was in the kitchen making supper did you not go in and ask what shes cooking was supper supposed to be a surprise notice you didnt mention or even suggest having something hot since they were out in the cold all day was she tired from being out doing an activity all day and just wanted to make something quick and easy quite possible or she planned that meal before they went skating and already had the ingredients this is so petty by both of you you shouldnt have made a face and she shouldnt be mad that you wanted to eat something else that you went and made that is exactly what i said those kinds of opp sex relationships are the only ones that are acceptable to cut contact with im not sure how unpopular this really is if you cut contact with one or two of the opposite sex for an actual reason like theyre youre sexting partners who you dont have an irl friendship with then maybe its not a bad idea if its your decision but cutting all contact just because is ridiculous even more cringy is your new partner demanding that you cut contact with anyone of the opposite sex cant even like someones picture or make a comment those people need a huge dose of reality but i think these cases are more a result of immaturity nope one hit and im out i dont care what you said to him it really is that simple i could see him saying he had no idea what was going to happen at the coronation and that he had no choice but to say those words since he was put on the spot hell use the excuse that since nobody is talking to him they didnt explain what was going to happen at the coronation he just showed up thinking it would be like a church service or something could you just imagine the stupidly is endless i agree with checking but then why would the h not be experiencing any issues its only her if he goes out of the house to work and she stays home could it affect her that much more i dont really know honestly its not that hard to poke your head into whatever room theyre in to say hello when you get to your bf house you dont have to roam the house to find both of them but if theyre in the living room or kitchen its not that hard to do my kids so do that every time and then they go to their room the dog incident you should have had a lighthearted comment about it would have been nice to know before she eats my hand or something did you say hi to his mom at work or were you waiting for her to engage you if youre still at work go over and say something anything start the conversation maybe say you bf told you why shes annoyed and apologize tell her youll do better from now on this should blow over but going forward make sure you say hello its just common courtesy and please dont stay over so much even if you dont think it it does disrupt the flow of the house i see where youre coming from i really do and could understand where many people would have the same outlook as you but the royal family is not a govt its not a political body they have no legislative power they are however a focus of national identity and pride with a huge focus on service it is a thousands year old tradition that i would say has changed with the times as they are no longer the rulers of nations now if harry wants changes to the brf or the monarchy i have not seen one example of what he wants to change have you because if he did i missed it being a rebellious teen is nothing new but its a far cry from airing every perceived slight you have ever had in your life and again what terrible attacks has megan be subjected to the paper that printed the compton thing was chastised for it the tiara issue is in line with protecting the actual royal jewels the issue of who made who cry happened it wasnt some made up story someone let it slip but m and kate werent the only ones there something happened and neither you or me know the real story the fact that m cut off her whole family is true its human nature to want to know why and the media is right in trying to delve into why she was a very popular person at the time and most people thought it was a horrible thing for her as in what could they have possibly done to her for her to take so drastic a measure on the flip side there is no video evidence that they are or were being relentlessly pursued by paparazzi which they claim there is no verifiable info that anyone said or made any racist overtures to her which they claim according to them the proposal could be two diff times they were married 3 days earlier proven lie they didnt help with the finding freedom book thats a proven lie there were leaks i agree im just not convinced every single one of them were coming from the palace so what benefit could mh have for leaking some themselves hmm theres just a lot i mean a lot of discrepancies when they come out with their stories some probably have a grain of truth but the embellishment goes way beyond well agree to disagree and do it in a polite civilized way and thats a good thing ok im gonna say this not to be mean but just as a thought since you havent given us much insight to your actual level of commitment you were dating 3 months which isnt very long hes been gone for most of your relationship you two have barely spent any of these 11 months together if you even saw him at all since his deployment im thinking he may not be thinking this is as serious as you time alone is not a good judge of the seriousness of a relationship especially when you are apart do i think he likes you sure he does but not enough to rework his whole life around you but is he sitting in his bunk pining away for you maybe not sorry again not trying to be mean were you dating before he went in how long were you dating before he got deployed thank you for the award heres my take on all this id point out that these arent 2 young people even when they met he was 32 and she was 34 hardly the age of naive
