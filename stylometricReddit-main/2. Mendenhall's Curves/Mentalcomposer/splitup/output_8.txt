own acct how did you even agree to this i would say just use your new thought process of understanding to slowly work through to the next step dont look at the next big picture slowly work through the concepts one at a time until you have absolute command of that step then move to the next eventually the bigger picture makes sense abstract concepts are hard to understand is there really something to be learned in a sense if theres no definitive way of proving what the end is so maybe the point of your paper is to apply what you think believe to be the end result based on your individual thoughts im not sure this applies to you and what youre studying tho just to be clear hes a male 32 your post says 32f hes pushing way too hard i wouldnt even keep talking to him youre under no real pressure from your parents to get married right now but it seems that he as a 32 yo man who has up until this point hasnt found a match for himself is trying to push you into a marriage before you have even met i suspect being pressured by his parents stick to what you want a marriage where you are in love that means no more meeting people who do not live within a realistic amount of distance that you can actually date dont shortchange yourself on this picking a spouse is literally the most important decision you can make it is the one decision that can make your like a living hell if you get it wrong or can give you a lifetime of happiness if you choose right move to the other place take the manager spot there hire a nanny i dont know why you think you cant raise your child by yourself millions of women do it every day with a lot less resources than you seem to have youre an adult but you dont seem to want to do a lot of adulting time to step up here leave him to his deal with his child hell probably end up hiring a nanny too he cheated with your sister is this a man you even want to be involved with even if he didnt know it was your sister hes an older man with a very young wife who still cheated on her what more is this guy looking for whatever it is he has proved it is not a monogamous marriage i usually try to explain how im understanding it and the other person will then point out where my flawed thinking is so id say so x does this and y does this so when x does its thing how does y know how to do their thing this way the other person is seeing where im getting confused and explain just that part of it so i can make the connection so instead of hearing the explanation that still doesnt make sense they explain just the part thats tripping me up and thats why neither of them should be running after the last 2 elections we should not still have to choose between the lesser of two old horrible candidates im kind of hoping there are a slew of people just throwing their hat in for both parties someone new might just rise to the top yta do you even like your mom she wanted one thing and even paid for it tell work you cant make it you should have told work before you changed shifts that you have plans that day and needed it off ill bet you would have done that if you had plans for an outing with a bf or friend you wouldnt forget about those plans you wouldnt cancel on those people but this is just your mom and you dont even like the event so she doesnt get the same priority i would absolutely rat out sil to the company this woman is making fun of you for not being able to get a job while gloating about hers which really could have been yours if she didnt lie as for your sister being mean to you think about this her wife doesnt help her with any bills even tho they should be partners she was mean to you until you cut her off so where do you think sil put all that snark id bet on your sister your sister probably is not standing up to her wife so shes taking out her annoyance on you getting mad at you over little things could be because she feels she cant get mad at wife id get sister away from wife for an afternoon and have this very needed chat is she even still happy with her wife what is really going on there with any luck sil will be gone and you can get your sister back this is not your fight dont use a relationship with your kids and their aunt as an excuse your kids have other aunts and uncles they wont be scarred for life if they dont see this one aunt as long as they are told that mom and aunt are fighting and thats why they dont talk no biggie happens to a lot of families your sil is finding it hard that in her mind she did everything right and just how the parents wanted got a great job and yet her sister gets all the praise and praised for something sil probably doesnt think is such an accomplishment but thats whatever let your sil come around on her own time or not the new baby doesnt care if they meet auntie you cant afford decent groceries but theres money for weed priorities man if you cant afford your bills then every single non essential expense goes away thats weed cable eating out etc if she doesnt like it she can get a job and pay for those things nta why would you clean more than once without being paid its 45 hours that youre over there after 1 or 2 times she could have told him at this point shes using you shes using your labor to fund her vacation gtfoh please stop cleaning for her if shes so bothered by his messiness she can clean his apt id youre at the stage of a proposal you should be at the point where you can flat out ask her if she wants to give you an idea of what she likes if she wants to give you a few pictures of exactly what she wants and youll choose from that or if she wants you to just pick out the ring on your own the proposal will be a surprise as far as when and how its a phone call he has the time this is important to you you need to see him supporting you in this tell him that since your dad thinks the teacher was out of line he should call her and if your mom thinks shes out of line she should also call let them tell the teacher that your behavior isnt out of line or worrisome and that he doesnt appreciate her telling you it is or separating you from the class and to cut it out or hell be speaking with the admin of the school the very first time a partner hits me is the last time i would ever see them idc if its a man or woman doing the hitting it will not stop it will get worse get out now why would you want to be with someone who resorts to hitting when youre having an argument i want to know what she says the reason is that she wont get a job does she not realize you two cannot afford to live on your income id also stop buying her any special food wine and nicotine im not saying not to buy vegetarian food just not any specialty stuff that is not your responsibility honestly youve only been married 2 years id cut my losses split up and let her make her own way she is not adding anything to your life at this point i thought the same thing like what interviewer would even ask that question out of the blue why m of all the women out there it makes no sense the absolute only way id believe it is if the discussion somehow went to who would be a good model spokesperson for the line and since it is dm based in the uk they asked about m to somehow tie the article to the uk through h the prince and then of course flip flop the quotes so it seemed as if the m question was asked first of course tw takes this as a win that a rockefeller even knows who she is she should have answered with who how long are you together and how old are you all if its not very long maybe he just doesnt think its that big of a deal its a lot to meet the whole fam at once so going to the baby birthday is his out im not so sure that because his friend is a girl is as big a deal as youre thinking it is this girl is with the father of her child i doubt shes looking to make moves on your bf your friend has im sure tried to talk to her friend about this guy and it fell on deaf ears there arent some magical words that are going to make her see the light now so julie can go be witness at this mess of a marriage or she tells friend she wants nothing to do with it but if she needs help getting away shell be there for her and have julie start saving money for that plane ticket what kind of guy doesnt know how to cook a hamburger or a steak grilled chicken is stupid easy how about a salad i refuse to believe he only knows how to cook those three things i wouldnt order out just because of the expense but when its your day to cook make enough extra just for you to have it the next night or take a sunday and make yourself 3 or 4 portioned meals that you can heat up for when he slaves away in the kitchen and makes pancakes again oh no youve misunderstood his concern worrying about security to the spare means hes really worried that hell be swept for recording devices and or shadowed everywhere he goes to keep him in line he has no fear for his personal safety he knows no one cares enough to do him harm so what at least hell have something to eat at home and she shouldnt be as stressed if shes working so she wont stress eat ill repeat what others have said do not buy a house with someone who is not your spouse your gf wants to buy a house get engaged and have a wedding all within the next few years oh and go on 1 or 2 big trips and youre supposed to fund the majority of those endeavors must be nice to be her you need to decide what you want what is your priority is it a house then you buy it on your own if its getting engaged and marrying then you buy a ring and ask if its travel then you plan that but you have to tell your gf that her pressuring you is only going to make you rethink being with her this isnt the way partners go about things see how she responds but if she is reluctant then you know shes looking at what she can get out of it not so much looking toward
