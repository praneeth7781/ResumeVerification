of sm knows about it and talked about it we heard all about it talked about it speculated about it waited for all the details to finally come out and we got a list of people who flew in a plane virginia guiffree got her payday andrew is relegated to scum of the world je is dead and ghislaine is in jail what more is there to say no one who was kidnapped or trafficked has come out in public and accused anyone else im not even sure they named anyone in any kind of sealed legal documents sometimes relationships just run its course she was 17 when you started andnow shes an adult she wants to do all those things that she missed out on that all her friends got to do while she just sat on the sideline and watched i think its absolutely gross that she called you and basically told you she cheated on you and was planning on taking this random home that alone would make me lose any feelings for this person so dont concentrate on what you lost concentrate on the fact that she didnt even have enough respect for you to have a conversation about the fact that she was doubting this relationship and needing some time to decide if she still wants it she doesnt want you shell go play around for a while and is expecting you to be there when the grass isnt greener dont be that guy block her on everything youre worth more than that wait the dad didnt want one what did the wife want cause the fact that her best friend wanted one and they had it is extremely bizarre to me maybe its a good idea that his overbearing parents step in and actually get all of them on the right path even if hes depressed he seems to be able to do the farm work he just starts much later than most farmers but if he got to sleep at a decent time he should be able to get started after he puts the kids on the bus talk to him and his parents im sure the parents know this whole situation has to change and if theyre so overbearing i cant really see how they let it get so out of hand i dont think youre too involved you care about his family and only want whats best doe them i think youre trying to get him to be more responsible about his farm and getting the work done no if thats the case just waking him up isnt really going to help unless he stays up and does the work who is working his farm i think you need to have a serious talk with him if you guys were so close what happened when did fam dinners stop when did you stop working for him you said the behavior changed a year ago so what was it like prior to that and where are the kids mother does she not see them at all does she also just let them do whatever he needs to get his kids on a better schedule his 4 yo should not be up till all hours of the night what is he thinking by allowing this and his other 2 need more sleep than they are getting talk to him explain your concerns if you are as close as you say he might open up and explain whats going on with him is it possible for you to talk with his parents about the kids schedule or the state of the farm do his parents not see what is going on why do you want to get past this hes been doing this stuff for 6 years what makes you think hes going to stop see heres the thing as i see it yes she cheated and that in itself would be a reason to stay separated and ultimately divorce but you have to also realize that you werent a model partner to her either you lost your job over drinking and im gonna assume when you drank you werent exactly a great husband to her now i am absolutely not saying you drove her to cheat or am i excusing her cheating im saying that you two should both just cut your losses and split up at this point there are just too many issues that neither of you will ever be able to forgive forget or get over get some help for the drinking its no way to live and her affair partner can worry if shell cheat on him thats not your problem any more thank you now i understand what ppl mean when they say it can i ask what they nickel and dime you for i hear the words im reading in my head but i actually read too fast and find i dont retain what i read sometimes so i have to purposely make myself read slower and if i dont understand what i read i read it very slowly out loud pausing to make sure im getting it im curious tho have you tried to purposely read faster what happens do you retain the info i love that you know that much history of your family have you been back to hungary to meet your relatives still in the village there those pics are so classic 50s america i dont necessarily have a problem with these materials being shipped they have to be shipped somehow but id like the rail companies to have an emergency response team that is always ready to jump right in if something were to happen an approved maybe regulated plan from outside the company preferably good job on the script that way nothing gets taken out of context and you say all that needs to be said and i never meant to imply anything dangerous or reckless about the weed as far as the baby goes just saying its not the best in the long run for his problem ah big ones i searched quick but didnt find anything helpful so id say go to the er but id tell them they passed out the same day that way its an emergency and they have to treat im sorry i hope your relative will be ok while i agree you cannot make him go and get help i would have one more conversation about it frame it as this we have a child we need to make sure we are at our best for them if you wont get help for yourself at least do it for our child its not healthy that your child will grow up seeing dad have a panic attack every day and its not healthy to self medicate with marijuana ive got nothing against it it just ultimately isnt going to solve his problem its just pushing it down the road tell him youll go with him to any and all appointments until he finds a dr or therapist he likes id ask friends neighborsanyone for a recommendation and id call and explain his apprehension and ask them to please use kid gloves with him what kind of work up did the dr recommend i dont know about the er but id be surprised if they would do a work up there im assuming a work up would be like a check up with labs i found this tho specifically look at the medical walk in and wellness in metuchen it seems they are free and will do a check up which usually involves lab work idk how the lab work would be billed tho maybe give them a call and ask explain what happened and what the dr said we need to know why your son has seemingly cut contact with you until he needs you to sign over the car depending on why the no contact im not so sure id sign over the car since you had to pay off his sallie mae loan are you sure hes paying off his car you might get stuck with that too but i also agree i would never ever sign a blank document if youre going to sign it over id make sure to fill it out first you should know all then i do its asking for and take and keep a copy of the filled out form this is what i did and i am absolutely no expert by any stretch but this will at least help you to get an idea of how to get started go here this will give you an idea of how many calories you need to maintain your weight then subtract 25 of that amount and aim to eat that each day get a food scale to weigh everything then i just planned out what to eat for bl and dinner for the next 2 or 3 days i went shopping so i had everything i needed to stick with it i very rarely eat breakfast just coffee but i almost always had a huge salad for lunch with tomato olives carrot cucumber and a protein the protein was either left over chicken from the night before or even just a can of tuna in water i did add dressing but a low cal and never more than 2 tbspns dinner was 3 or 4 oz of chicken fish or beef and vegetables and a small salad lots of vegs and water was the only thing i drank lots and lots of water snacks were portioned out nuts or a string cheese or just plain carrots have a glass of water before you snack to see if you really want to snack or if you just wanted something it seems daunting at first but you will get used to it pretty quickly but weigh everything i even weighed out teeny amounts of carrot and celery for my salad a lot of times it ended up being like 6 calories but i still counted it you can do this just dont try to be so militant crazy to start because you wont stick with it its ok to be over your calories when you start but you want to be over by 50 not 500 i would cruise alone but make sure to go to the solo traveler meet up on the ship go meet other solos these would be the people you can hang around with on that sailing and you might get lucky and find one or two who you get along with and can plan future trips with i wouldnt trust rooming with a random stranger im a little confused about justin hes not the babys dad we know that you met him when you both lived in diff states and somehow he just decided he would be dad and you allowed that then you break up and he still wants to be dad even going as far as wanting to help with daycare have you even met this person have you ever lived in the same place all of this seems really really odd you broke up he wasnt in your life or your sons for all that long as a dad figure so why would you even entertain the idea of him being a father figure to your son now brian on the other hand do you know for a fact that he is the father because honestly it might be better for your son if hes not the in out is ultimately going to leave your child feeling not enough he doesnt support the child and you seem to be doing ok without him and now greg i would have him tested to see if hes actually your sons dad even if you dont want any support from him and even if he doesnt want anything to do with his child its better
