change the world attitude both of them have years of life experience and know the ways of the world and hes been in this family has known exactly how it was run and worked and i dont ever recall him speaking out previous to megan about any toxicity note he could have i wasnt and still not obsessed with everything royal they lieproven they implynever a definitive explanation of this person said i said they never show any proof of the so called leaks or planted stories racist behavior or snub by anyone makes it kind of hard to believe what they say and a lot of it is just so freakin silly and stupid stuff that if it happened in your real life youd be thinking why are we even having this conversation its tiresome at this point 3 years since they left theyre not going to change the way the monarchy works its not their job it was never their job i dont know why they ever thought it was add to this their idea that they were going to be advocates of climate issues humanitarian issues womans issues whatever else and they have done exactly zero on any of these fronts they have literally not done anything but whine and complain and collect awards they did not earn thats why people dont like them not because of some fan girling of the royal family so he drops the idea that the family or the palace planted stories when there was some kind of conflict ok then you would think any journalist with any journalistic integritys next question would be what was the conflict about and what story was planted can you give me an example but of course it never gets asked and were back to again accusations with absolutely zero evidence to back it up and this is exactly why i do not believe a word they say i believe there were conflicts either between members of the fam or even the palace bc thats just the nature of relationships at some point but i truly think the two of them wanted something wanted to do something or go somewhere and they were rebuffed for whatever reason so true to form for egotistical people they went immediately to a conspiracy against them instead of like a normal person trying to find a way to compromise and make it work and there were no leaked stories these two did something while out and about and the press wrote about it whatever it was showed them in not the best light but instead of realizing they shouldnt have done that or said that they jump right to it must be a leak or a plant these two are so delusional it defies any sense of rationale a couple things stood out as i read since the ultimate goal is for him to get his own apt hes essentially moving into your apt temporarily in that case i think he could make it a point to just not put meat or fish in the refig will it be a pain sometimes yes it will but its your apt he can eat meat when you two go out or pick up something from fast food on occasion or if he really gets an urge for a steak on a random day he can pick 1 steak note 1 on the way home from work and cook it or he can get 1 burger from the butcher in the grocery store basically just enough for him to eat that one meal at home yes its not as convenient as having these all in the freezer but it is what it is it will work as long as he fully agrees to all of this with out moaning about it and you need to have this convo now not in the spring he needs to know this is a non negotiable and agree to it and then once he gets his own apt you have to be ok with him having meat in his refrigerator or freezer id also have him buy his own pans to cook any meat in just for your comfort if you need that also keep in mind it might take him a while to actually find a job in his field does he have a plan b in case that doesnt happen oh i dont either but i was thinking thats the incident op was referencing so if he insinuated william cheated do we think william will need to make some sort of statement or do we think itll be written off as just another lie if he insinuated william didnt marry for love and there was another he wanted instead was there even ever another steady long term girlfriend that he dated who would believe that no way i believe william made any racist remark about what the baby would look like i dont know many men who would even think about it seems more like something women would chat about in a nice way ah thank you some kind of id makes so much sense id guess that when the ada for service animals came out there probably werent as many people faking and im sure way less people needing esas so it probably wasnt seen as needed because at the time who would ever question such a thing i thought you werent allowed to ask what service is being done but i didnt even know there were any papers that can be shown so i learned something thanks for that info isnt it true that there are no papers that show an animal is a service animal so anyone with a pet can claim whatever they want so the problem is theres no legal way to ensure that a service animal is actually one and thats why emotional support animals are being seen everywhere in my opinion a true service dog needs to have some kind of official papers that should need to be shown upon request to allow the animal into places that pets normally arent i dont think that anyone who actually needs a service animal would be put off having to show that it is an actual service animal anyone who could find fault with something i do every single day is not someone id want to be with does he never mess up i bet he does but you dont point it out and rag on him for it you both have some issues youre not dealing with and if you want this or any other relationship to work youre both going to have to get help to get to a point that youre both mentally stable you dont mention having any therapy but you both should be seeing someone idk what you mean about getting a huge boost about rejecting men but doesnt it make sense that one can be wanting to find a partner but isnt willing to be with just anyone who happens to be male or female it goes both ways everyone is only going to date people they are attracted to if they dont meet anyone who they like then why date them nta but your wife saying that you shouldnt teach your kids to act a certain way so people will like them is correct but thats not what youre doing in this instance you arent fundamentally changing who your d is youre pointing out that lateness when boiled down is really about not valuing the person you are meeting and that friends will want to be valued and not made to seem like their time isnt important you wouldnt ask your d to change her clothes hair hobbies or opinions to fit in those are the things that make your d who she is youre just making her see that other peoples time is as important as hers try explaining it that way to your wife listen to your mom we always discount her opinion but ultimately they are right she knows what she sees shes been thru it with your sisters this relationship is just not working its time to let it go for both of your sakes it will be tough for a few months but youll get over him and be fine yeah shes being stupid maybe she enjoys the danger of it maybe she thinks is exciting whatever it is you warned her shell be crying soon because he dumps her and she caught feelings or shell be crying when she realizes hes just using her for sex either way its gonna be ugly how does she know its really open if she wants to continue with this guy she should ask to speak to his wife to make sure it is really an open marriage in any event why does she want to expend any energy on a man who is taken why would you not immediately turn around and go home when he told you he was homeless was he homeless with his 2 kids that live with him like where did he think you were going to sleep he had no car and 6 kids raise this baby alone he is useless he cant even support himself how do you think hes going to support you you do not need the kind of support he is offering you seemed to be doing ok before you blew all your money on him plus his kids are a mess you will literally be moving into a nightmare please dont do that to yourself and your child i have to know the trip to england that you described was that the only time you met him and was that when you got pregnant omg that sounds like pure hell you have my sympathy youve got a few months till easter really work on hubby to get him on board with a schedule that doesnt have you running all the time when you want to talk about your struggles without her trying to fix it you need to tell her youre not looking for advice but to just open up to her because you trust her with these things and so she can understand where youre coming from as far as her opening up maybe she doesnt really have anything to open up about not everyone has or had struggles that they need or want to talk about or maybe she just doesnt want to burden you with her stuff being aware that you have enough going on and doesnt want you dwelling on her crap too you can always go direct with her and tell her you want to develop a more intimate emotional connection and see what she says nta you need to have a conversation with your husband and decide what you want to do for all holidays next year decide on easter thanksgiving and both xmas days thats four so its easy to split them between the 2 families dont let him railroad you hold your ground if his parents have to see him every holiday then they can come to your house once you two have come to a decision then you have him tell his mom what the plan going forward is as an aside i dont know if xmas eve is the holiday your family usually gets together for and to add yet another wrench into the mix you might want to do xmas day at home so your kids dont have to leave their toys every xmas thats the one thing my h always said sucked as for this nye there would be no way in hell i would be having 5 pm dinner and then coming home and hosting a party thats insane send him to his moms for supper alone or with your son they will survive not seeing you for a few hours just have kate send you your
