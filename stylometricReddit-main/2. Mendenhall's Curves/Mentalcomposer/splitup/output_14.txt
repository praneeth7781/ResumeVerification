for everyone involved to have a definitive answer to this question if he is then you can cut brian out all together because really who needs the problems he comes with hes out of state has 2 other kids is in and out on a whim and doesnt pay any support in short find out who the father actually is then decide if you want to go for support and visitation dont have some random out of town guy playing dad to your son live your life raise your son and dont be so quick to want to have a daddy for him yta show some respect for your grandfather and your grandmother is this really something you want to even have an argument with your family about at this time everyones stressed on edge and its going to become about more than what it actually is this is not the time or place for you to make this about you your clothing choices over the years or what your family thinks about your choices either wear the dress pants or bring them and change into them why are you even entertaining anything she says after telling her youre done this is not working for you anymore wish her well and hang up block her everywhere and get on with your life she lives 4 hrs away from you its not like shes gonna go around town talking about you or making your life miserable its not really that hard this has been my fear forever also not just being uncovered but i could never even have my feet hang off the bed i do not have any idea how people sleep with no covers not even a sheet nope i need an actual comforter even in the summer nta at all this is a lovely thing to do with your nieces and especially since its the younger ones first time it should be just the 4 of you this is something you and your sister can do forever with the girls and they will love it im sure your sil does things with her sibs and all the kids they dont have to infringe on your day ok so wait im confused the general tip box welfare thing what exactly is this are you saying the gratuities that we all pay is not going to the crew ive read its room steward and the other positions that guests dont see like cooks laundry etc workers who dont normally interact with guests i always pay mine and give the steward extra but id like to know that the behind the scenes people are getting their cut so if we dont pay it the cook and laundry people will still get their same salary but the company will then be shouldering the burden of that whole amount which they should anyway instead of being supplemented by guests if thats the case im taking my tips off and will try to find a way to funnel to those people and of course tip the steward his cut plus my extra am i understanding this correctly nah but he cannot always respond the way you want or need he doesnt know what you want him to do or what you need heres the thing tho youve been together since you were 15 and both of you are going to go off to college and will have a whole host of new experiences and meet new people not just him not to be mean but i would be very surprised if one of you if not both of you get to college and realize you dont want to be tied down to someone who is not part of your every day it could very well be you deciding theres someone else out there that youd like to get to know it happens and it should happen you both need to be free to grow and mature the summer before college is a weird time both of you are going to be anxious nervous about going away being on your own for the first time can you handle it will you find friends will you be able to keep up with classes etc so dont stress about hypothetical things when you have enough real things that will stress you out we went twice in one day and my h was that guy both times the rest of us loved it he was not amused nta for not giving a gift its costing you a lot to go and she did say its understandable so believe her before i say more tho what kind of reception has no alcohol and no food what exactly is everyone supposed to do during the party part of the wedding reception but theres a few things you say that come off as concerning why do you care that they are married but having the celebration later maybe they did it for tax purposes for religious reasons or just because they felt like it not your business your thought that she wont be giving you a gift when you get married next year is bizarre they are almost 10 yrs younger than you and your bf how much of a gift were you actually expecting from them not having alcohol at the wedding isnt odd at all really plenty of people make that choice im getting weird vibes as if youre taking her wedding as a slight against you personally somehow shes having her celebration before yours even tho youve been engaged longer she picked the worst time according to your schedule and her wedding is not what you deem acceptable her wedding really has nothing to do with you your bf or anyone else you understandably said its costing you a lot to go and how its really stretching the budget but youve already got 2 weddings youre going to next year undoubtably your friends or fam and i can see how youd say well those were planned and hers was a quickie thing that came up and wasnt really budgeted for but this is the family you are going to marry into so id stretch that budget go with a smile and dont burn bridges before youve even been accepted into the family and its not your place to fight your bfs family battles if hes always put last its up to him to fix it or not im still not sure what the parents or grands having money has anything to do with bf being put last tho i think it comes from our education system most people graduate hs at 1718 and years back it was pretty common to get married to your hs sweetheart so if youre married at 18 you have to be allowed to do all the adult things job mortgage kids etc and i agree with the other poster by 18 youve seen and heard enough to be able to make wise choices why some might not is for the same reasons why a 25 or 35 or any other age might not im going to assume youre still somewhat young ignoring him isnt the way to go about this or any other issue or problem that comes up use your words you think he was joking but youre not sure so you ignore him for 15 min but then after that amount of time you what just start engaging with him again as if nothing happened then what was the actual point of not talking to him in the first place look if he says something and you arent sure if its an insult or a joke you have two ways to handle this might be a joke answer back with a joke youre free to leave at any time theres the door and see what he says he probably would answer back with something like he just hates shopping thats like the hundredth store weve been in etc you banter back and forth a few times and its over you think its insulting then you tell him hey that hurt whats the problem and he explains the exact same thing as above hes just frustrated being in the mall learn now how to communicate it will save you tons of drama in the future think back to every place you have been since you last remember seeing it on the counter like literally sit down close your eyes and go back thru every single thing youve done check every outfit you wore every car you were in every couch you sat on every backpack or pocketbook you used were you studying at any time check in your books did you pack a carry on or travel bag check the outside pockets its only been 5 months why are you so desperate to keep this guy he treats you horribly and you keep going back for more block him everywhere stay single for a bit i think you need to feel better about yourself before you get involved with anyone check out ncl i dont know anything about any other lines as i havent sailed them sorry they have a deal now that the second person flies free but all the sailings in oct are at least 9 days you can do a complete mock booking so youll see the total cost of the trip with the air included the least expensive cabin will be an inside i did a mock booking 9 day southampton but ending in lisbon inside cabin for 2 their free at sea promo look it up if you dont know what that is with air round trip from chicago picked a middle of the usa airport and transfers from airport to ship and ship back to airport total 379246 do a lot of research understand what you are getting for that price look at the ship and decide if it has the amenities you would like booking air thru the cruise line means you get the cheapest flight they can get times might not be ideal i suggest paying for a 1 or 2 day deviation so youre in the uk early in case of flight delays check out costco travel also if you have a cc with miles see if you can use them for flights and then you can shop around for travel agent deals also but if you book thru a 3 rd party travel agent just know that the cruise line will not speak to you about anything to do with the booking because you technically are not the one who booked it i hope this helps i agree so much with this i dont like mexican food all that much but i have never even tried refried beans just the look of it never mind the smell makes me gag nta its pretty standard procedure which if hes a regular he would know anyway would it help if you mentioned it to the dr i would like to think the dr doesnt want him talking to his staff the way he did you dont say how long you are together in my opinion this is in no way cheating what happened was you saw a very attractive person and had a physical response to the level of attractiveness it happens whatever this guy looked like just hit your senses in a certain way it doesnt mean you dont find your bf attractive doesnt mean you dont like or love him i wouldnt say a word to bf all that will do is start drama of you dont find me attractive you dont want to be with me you want him honestly its just not worth it are you bored that youre not fighting anymore cause this feels like youre looking for more things to fight about you guys are really young but if you are under the misguided idea that once you
