that its just for practice plus i think learning sign language is awesome you have got to be kidding with this your bf wants nothing more to do with you youre a cheater leave him alone you cant get him back you dont deserve him i couldnt read the article so sorry if this was in it it might be effective depending on what happens when you test positive if youre quarantined until you test negative then maybe it will be effective i think the bigger issue is since china isnt very forthcoming with any data they may have variants caused by mutations that the rest of the world hasnt even seen yet my biggest worry is a variant that is more dangerous that starts to spread well be back to the exact place we were at the beginning this is less about you and your sister and more about what your parents should be saying to your sister they need to get her petty jealousy under control she made her choice of schools and you made yours it isnt as if your parents denied her the choice they need to explain that to her and tell her to knock off the rivalry your mom cant stay neutral when this is affecting the whole household and you dad needs to do more than just be pissed at sister maybe because he said they bonded over their shared military service we dont really know that op even knew his grandpa had any money or if he did he assumed it would go to gramps child ops parent op was at his lowest and sought out the person who could relate to what he was going thru after his deployment his visits could have started for that exact purpose but turned into wanting to make sure his grandpa wasnt alone in his last years its possible he actually enjoyed visiting i dont think we can understand what op went thru on deployment and how having that outlet was probably vital to his well being for all we know grandpa might have wanted op to have the money knowing he wouldnt be around forever and wanted to ensure op had the financial resources to get the help he needed in the future its happening whether you fear it or not so just dont dwell on it concentrate on the excitement of the baby and like the other poster said you dont care about anything but getting that baby out of you youre just done being pregnant obviously this relationship is not working why would you want to put more effort in break up but take some time to get yourself straightened out nobody wants a sad depressed partner who wont talk to them once youre happy with and by yourself you can be a good partner to someone if he says hes not very experienced i think in this instance you should believe him its possible he thinks you expect him to be good at sex given his age and since he doesnt have much experience he knows hes not and that makes him overthink and get nervous youve also only been dating for 3 months and as close as you are he might still need to be even more comfortable with you to be intimate dont stress over it and dont rush either the problem with roaches in an apt building is that even if your gf bombs her place with the strongest stuff she can find shes gonna get them back again because her neighbors will still have them and roaches will eventually get back to hers thats why the whole building needs to be treated at the same time and even then theres no guarantee why didnt you use the same stuff on your gf apt that you used on your place roaches aside youre mean to your gf the coat incident was inexcusable i agree i love a loaded salad its a complete meal yta so you make your gf leave your place after seeing one roach and that made her cry but then call her back to open presents then you gift her a used coat and when she doesnt want to wear it to this party you make her feel bad about it and tell her youll give it to someone else of course shes gonna cry whats wrong with you do you even like your gf she cannot help the roach problem you do know that right im sorry one hitched a ride over to your place but it happens then you get insulted she wont wear the coat because she wants to wear the other one she also just got and you go off on her leave her alone or be a nicer person ok so not a therapist makes the scene a bit better at least but also not really therapy more like a self help audiobook thanks i didnt watch past episode 1 but what kind of therapy is this and what ethical therapist would agree to have another person in a session taping it what kind of explanation could they possibly give to the therapist to make them agree to this there are two things going on here and they are both on her to address first the physical pain she is having is clearly not normal she needs to see a gyno and see what is available as far as treatment is concerned has she never seen a gyno or just never brought up this problem the second is her mentally she needs to address the fact that she cannot open up to you due to whatever happened to her this is non negotiable sex is as much mental as it is physical and she needs to address both of these for you two to have a healthy sex life you need to let her know that a healthy sex life is something you are not willing to forgo and that its up to her to get the help she needs or you dont see this relationship lasting its just that simple this is not a blame thing its just a fact that she is the one with the issues and shes not addressing them i also thought that at 20 its cute to wear your bf initial at 24 and after 4 years you grow out of the cute phase the thing is hes not really criticizing in your example he is saying that you should automatically know what he needs like are you supposed to read his mind hes an ass just for that comment alone thats not bad communication thats a normal every day question that people would ask another when they see them a bit out of sorts and you had nothing to apologize for you did nothing wrong but i do agree with him that once you know what the problem is its better to ask to help instead of solve the problem for him those two statements arent really interchangeable overall his ego and self importance is way over the top hes not being honest hes trying so hard to prove to you and everyone else that hes so much better than you and them and when you and they dont come to that realization he outright tells them and you i give you credit for sticking it out for all those years yup i did so of course i had to read the whole thing can i point out that we havent gained a new wealth your bf has access to his savings acct otherwise you are nta but your sister owes an apology to your bf nta what kind of weird crap is this im guessing you had no boyfriends until now and hes not even really a bf youre just hanging out but not really cause you havent even seen him just the fact that you physically leave the house freaks out your dad so of course the solution is to make you live elsewhere theres got to be more to this are you a deeply religious family is it usual to have an arranged marriage is the boy a diff religion race anything and whats with your mom not thinking your dad is a complete and utter wackadoodle and telling him so id say run as far and fast as you can cause your parents are nuts grandmas is looking better and better but i know you cant do that dont get stuff just for the sake of having pick walk art knick backs that actually have some meaning to them or youll end up with useless clutter every wall or shelf doesnt have to be full buy what you need and use what you buy once what is wrong with your son there must be something because 10 year olds arent usually this cruel and whats with him opening gifts before xmas yeah somethings not right here im worried what hes going to do to his sister to get back at her for him not getting any gifts thats how i saw it once her dad got the letter it became his property and he should be allowed to do with it whatever he wants can someone explain the court case where she sued the mail about the letter did the court find in her favor without a trial and then when knauf gave his evidence which clearly showed she lied to the court did the court really just chalk it up to her not remembering writing a slew of emails thanks awesome thanks putting it on my list do you mean its not a fun ship in general what are the entertainment options i really like the look of this ship but i want some fun activities not all out crazy but i dont want the ship to be quiet by 10 pm hows the casino if you went thanks so you hate your lying cheating secretive bf and you think your biggest issue is trying to figure out how not to have sex with him do you think hes suddenly going to have an epiphany of wow my gf wont have sex with me better change my ways so she doesnt leave me hes not going to therapy hes not going to change and hes not leaving the quicker you admit this the better you will be yeah ive always thought the opposite i always wondered how many people they actually convert or even convince to check out the religion they really dont start the conversation with a compelling argument its usually a boring can i talk to you about i think they like having to go on these missions just to see diff areas of the country hell tell you he appreciates all you do so that youll keep doing everything this right here is what you will be dealing with if you marry him he will not suddenly begin to pull his weight and his video game addiction will not just stop think long and hard about if thats what you want in 3510 years nothing else to be said you said it perfectly this is what she needs to hear and what she needs to do congratulations you should be proud of yourself im proud of you too if the filled bread is put in a panini press i call that a panini if i grill the bread filled with ham and cheese in a pan on the stove top then its a grilled ham and cheese toast to me is just toasted bread topped with something butter jellyetc and is eaten one slice at a time not put together like a sandwich and a sandwich is just two slices of bread with a filling whether its toasted or not there is absolutely no reason for your wife to get that worked up over something so trivial ten minutes is not going to make a
