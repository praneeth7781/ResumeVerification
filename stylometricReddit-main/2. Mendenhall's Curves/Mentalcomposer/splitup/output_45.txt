all of the household chores while she was working part time have you guys talked about the changes that were going to take place since youve been sick does she feel that since shes working full time she doesnt have to do anything else you know like you were doing for however long seems like this marriage has been unequal from the get go im sorry you got so sick i hope you get well enough to go back to your job it must feel awful especially being in the health fuel that the thing that was supposed to help protect you actually harmed you nta for trying your bro seems to resent your mom because of the divorce he needs to know if he doesnt already that it was your dad who forced the divorce your mom was not willing to just forgive and forget the affair so him being mad at mom is not sensible make sure there isnt more to it than that now if youre still gonna talk to mom you need to let her know that bro is not a baby and hes also not a very affectionate person its nothing personal to her its just the way he is even if it is just toward her hes a teen boy the last thing he wants is to hug his mommy if she needs affection that badly she should find a boyfriend i do agree they both that they both need therapy what could employees of a sandwich shop possibly divulge mayo or mustard i could see it not wanting to be known where they honeymooned but thats a 2 week nda at most these two are so over the top its absurd im not sure you were being selfish you thought of her and what she was feeling and what would be better for her instead of clinging to her because you need her as you go through a really serious time in your life are you sure you broke up with her because you want to be with someone who is all in for you that would be selfish or did you do it because somewhere in your mind you know that its unfair to ask her to be your nurse maid support person and girlfriend yet again that would be selfless it might seem like you made the decision for her but she probably would not have made this decision on her own how do you leave the person you love when they are literally fighting for their life the guilt would be astounding i wish you a full recovery and a wonderful life its not hate its disappointment in you and the friend you have been in a committed relationship for 2 years with a guy who obviously trusts you and his friend and both of you broke that trust and for what a couple minutes of funtime whats best for your baby is that it is recognized by its real father so that it can grow up knowing where they came from whether that father wants to be a part of their life or not you cant decide paternity based on who is in a better position to raise the child or who you would rather be with there are multiple stories on reddit where kids found out who there real dad was later in life and their whole world was blown up do you think thats good for your child you know your bf best how do you think hes going to react when he finds out the whole story maybe he wont care and will stay and raise the child with you maybe hell break up with you but either way he needs to know saying nothing is not the solution secrets will come out at some point there is no other advice to give you have to be an adult and fess up he should be able to decide if he wants to stay with a gf who cheated and also whether he wants to stay friends with the guy who would sleep with his gf and really his friend on a trip where the bf was there how did that even happen where was bf when you were sleeping with his friend 3 times i hope its the friends baby and the bf breaks up with you and dumps his friend you and the friend deserve each other but how did she react when you pointed out you thought you werent doing gifts since she got you nothing its very telling if she expects you to be giving to her and she has no obligation to reciprocate if she is mad then thats her problem not yours shell get over it but have the holiday gift talk soon save yourself any future grief usually id say its pretty standard to get and give your so a bday gift but you two are young do you guys even have disposable income to be able to afford gifts being that your bday is before hers there should have been a simple conversation about gifts either a price limit or an agreement to not exchange at all heres a thought instead of gifts agree to do something for both of your bdays supper and a movie an experience you both want to do etc this way youre both spending the same amount of money and nobody can get their feelings hurt over something pretty trivial you best have this conversation before the holidays come around i am curious did you say to her that she didnt get you anything so you just assumed you werent exchanging gifts this year what was her reply are you saying that you and your partner are still willing to hang out with them but you just want her inappropriate behavior acknowledged so does that mean the rest of the friend group is not willing as in does not want to hang out with them at all if this is the case then it is eric and amy that have lost all their friends not just you and partner if you watch tv while on the couch you could get up and move during every commercial walk in place walk around the house use empty gallon milk jugs refilled with water and use as barbells its not much but it makes me feel like im doing something you can also buy one of those foot pedal things to do while you sit there youd have to be watching regular tv tho so if not set a timer and do it every 10 minutes for a minute were there any people dancing did the b g even dance to italian rap maybe they like it if they were club people maybe they wanted it that way i agree it does sound awful tho even if i was a club person id want to dance to something i know nta mistakes happen but you still paid for something that you didnt get youre in the group chat so you should have just answered his message to everyone that you didnt realize that you didnt actually order but still paid thinking you did order and just wanted to figure out why there wasnt one for you and everyone didnt need to know anything about what happened why would they im sure you talk to some other team members and would have mentioned to them what happened you know like normal people do and the committee could care less about uniform ordering im sure thats why i said to explain what went on with your bro so that your parents dont have a negative idea about you which is ridiculous anyway they raised you they know who you are and what youre like why would they ignore what they see and know just because their other kid says so look you are probably still in school so while its great that you are interested in learning computer stuff it cannot be the only thing you do besides school explain to your parents that all learning and studying is just as unhealthy as all gaming you need balance just tell your parents what really happened what he said you said and explain it to them clear the air so they stop thinking of you as the problem child you get 50 every time you help him cant you buy your own graphics card your partner is not there to make you happy fulfill all your hopes and dreams and jump at your every whim stop sweating the small stuff work out the big things small its ok if your so didnt vacuum on tuesday like they said they would itll get done at some point big stayed out all night and you had no idea where they were treat each other like you want to be treated in return its a partnership not a competition of who is the better person after what he said about the dishes i wouldnt wash another one ever again fuck him know your place you know your place and it isnt with this ah stop this behavior oh yeah im stopping everything with you you have a job and an apt ready to go take the leap whats the absolute worst that could happen you need to change your mindset from scared to mad mad enough that you just say fuck it and fuck him call today and make sure you can get that apt then when he leaves for work tomorrow pack your stuff and leave you can leave a note but dont explain anything just say im not coming back and dont contact me then block him and get on with your life you can do this you did it before him and youll do it after him yes whatever this event is for its most likely nothing tw and her husband have done anything for because they dont do anything so id ask what have you done for insert event name and watch her try to word salad her way out of answering and then counter her answer and around and around we go until then just saying so basically you do nothing for anyone got it i agree its not any of the parents fault the kid is responsible for their actions and knows by this age right from wrong has the child acknowledged what they did wrong and what was the reasoning for it punishment should fit you took money so you earn it back to pay it back weekend chores around the house 1200 is a lot of money what did they do with it lying is tough to punish because its more a trust issue ie i cant trust what you say to be true idk what they lied about so these are example maybe once they are allowed back out with friends you make sure they can be tracked you confirm with other parents that who and where they are going is true if schoolwork is not being done then you arrange with the school to be informed of all assignments and you have them show you the work things of that nature until you can be relatively sure the lying has stopped or at least not for the big things cause the mundane stuff doesnt really matter in the scheme of things youve been advocating trying to help this child for a long time to no avail maybe now their parents will listen as the stepmom id be asking the kids dad what he was going to do about his wayward kid id also ask the dad to try and figure out why said child is doing these things you cant just blindly punish if you dont know whats going on with the kid oh and id also lock up anything of mine that has any value to it this i can sort if
