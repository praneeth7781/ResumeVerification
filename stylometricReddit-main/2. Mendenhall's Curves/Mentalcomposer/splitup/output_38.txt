nothing if theyre not even invited would anyone really be surprised if they werent dont announce theyre not invited and maybe use their pr to ask media to not even mention the are they arent they invited im sure m will make it known but if the uk press doesnt report it how much traction can they get after a while the us press will realize they as a whole are a non story no one treated her like a black person because no one even knew she was half black kind of what happens when you yourself hide that info of course when she starts to date h did anyone care to want to know anything about her background as would have happened with anyone he dated lets be real the press would have dug into anyones background and found the worst things they could but notice she has no instances of how she was treated differently the compton and chimp thing was over the line no doubt but as pointed out those were condemned by the press against the press if they release any recordings even if its so called shocking people who dont really have an opinion either way will suddenly have one and it wont be in their favor regular every day people know that families arent perfect and have their dirty laundry but we dont air it same kraft is great when i want quick but homemade is a treat to myself warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info sorry but ywbta to demolish it the prudent thing to do is to sell it and split the proceeds among the kids i can sort of understand your attachment to the home you built but really youll be dead you wont know or care who will be living there and think about it this way from your description whoever buys it will be wealthy and will go in and change it to how they like it and that might upset you to think about but its going to become someone elses dream house another family that will raise their children to have the happy childhood that you were able to give your kids that legacy alone should give you some peace the worst part of this whole story is that your kids are already fighting over who deserves the house more im sorry what here i was thinking your kids had an awesome upbringing going and then we see that they have turned into greedy self serving adults cause lets face it one of them will get the house maybe live there till they realize its too expensive to maintain it and then theyll sell it anyway and keep that windfall in the process their sibling relationships will fail stipulate to sell the house if one of your kids can afford it they are more than welcome to bid on it well that blows my theory out thanks tho its good for me to know going forward i probably wouldnt be able to do a perfectly proper curtsy if i was put on the spot which is a ridiculous claim that she didnt even know the q was going to be there but id sure as hell try to do something genuine looking the q seemed to have a funny side so if it came out looking like a baby deer learning to walk shed probably laugh it off id be mortified but id apologize anyway and promise to learn the diff is i would actually learn how but that witch of a champion of women feels its beneath her to even to the most esteemed woman in the world my theory is that when you first start out it allows for typos and small errors like missing accent marks as you progress it marks them wrong because it thinks you should know that by now as of now i havent been marked wrong for the accent marks yet and i hope it doesnt happen in the future im only unit 6 so still early and i may be wrong but words that i misspell are usually many letters so its easy to misspell when starting out but the ones that ive seen for a while get marked wrong she cant get specific because everything they said happened didnt its too easy to go back to that person and have them refute it all and they think theyre smarter than literally every single other person on the planet and that we wouldnt see right thru that at this point they can have a public ccv camera that recorded literally any mundane thing that they did and i still wouldnt believe it happened if it came from them they have lost all credibility and rightly so or she just doesnt like the name harry she thinks william got the cooler name h isnt a very oooular name in the us i dont think who knows in her deluded mind do you think she calls him hazbeen when shes raging at him that would be priceless i do agree with taking some time to cool off if you say thats what youre doing and its a short amount of time walk around the block go for a drive but op also says she went and stayed with her parents for a few weeks thats not really a cooling off period seems more like trying to solve that problem from afar and we dont know if h took a small time to cool off or hes still gone but again a short cooling off period is sometimes a good thing especially that both of them have left the home after an argument that is not a healthy way to resolve conflict love that last line its so simple but so true yta of course your son would be upset with you do you really think he would tell you hes gay if hes not or if hes not sure he has a boyfriend even how your son looks or his hobbies and interests have absolutely no bearing in regard to his sexuality i dont know why you would even think that you owe him a huge apology if hed even accept it be a better parent im sorry but i am failing to see what you are so mad about are you mad because they lied to you all these years well id be willing to bet that there have been a lot of people who over the years have lied to you about one thing or another this lie really has no bearing on your life it hasnt made it better and it def hasnt made it worse this is an absolute nothing i find it extremely hard to believe if you have never lied to anyone why was it ok for you to tell a lie but not anyone else or are you mad about the age gap being what it is in which case that really is not your business they were both adults when they got together and thats really the only thing that matters they have stayed together so that in itself should show you that they are happy together now you may feel a bit weirded out by the gap but that is your personal moral code and you have no right to impose or pass judgement on anyone even if its your dad it seems you are taking this news way too personal as if something was done to you your life was a happy one with sam in it why would you purposefully make problems when there really isnt one why are you even looking at 3 br homes your realtor should not even be showing you them keep looking you will find a 4 bed that will call to you just as much as this one and you will be grateful when 2 teen girls are not fighting over space i have 5 siblings i can honestly say i have rarely bought any of them gifts for their bday and i like and get along and hang out with all of them it just isnt a thing occasionally if its a big bday and theyre having a party for it then ill get a gift 253050th as far as im concerned parents get gifts for everything if this is your partners only sib then an xmas gift is ok since shed be left out when every one is opening gifts but id stop the bday gifts ah thank you i was obviously confused i thought the prince title could never be removed and i thought the king couldnt remove the duke title that it had to be done by parliament and that this bill would give the king the power good to know parliament can at least do some stripping of titles at some point ill refrain from commenting till i understand the whole issue it does get confusing personally id like both titles stripped from h he hasnt lived up to either of them as far as andrew as long as he keeps himself hidden away i can wait for his turn in the next round not that i condone anything he has done but hes at least staying within the bounds the q set for him parliament doing the stripping would be the best thing that could happen maybe kc can put out a weakly worded statement in opposition just to appear to give a sht but if it comes from above him theres nothing he can do about it maybe parliament can throw around some key words treason grievous harm prosecute etc youre not the only one who doesnt drink just dont make a big deal out of it or talk about those that do go to the parties grab a soda and have fun nobody is going to know or care since i have no experience in nursing but frequently am the visitor to a patient frequently admitted chronic issues i like the idea that i can go in to visit and connect with a nurse to give me the daily update too often i have no idea what the diagnosis actually is and the waiting for a nurse to have the time to come in and advise is usually long i dont think that aspect harms patient care many times i have questions later on and this would be helpful i dont have an issue with a virtual doing paperwork things like discharges but maybe the actual on site nurse should have to sign off on the paperwork thats been prepared thats a good check and balance in case something has been missed or overlooked by the virtual that isnt actually seeing the medical state of a patient im not sure about admission assessments i would think theres a lot of nuances that in person can pick up on i would think patients especially older folks would downplay their illness pain uncomfort but in house might pick up on all this the idea of a virtual monitoring labs or electronic monitoring info may prove helpful but only if its being done in a timely manner sort of like what good is a lab report that needs immediate action if its not being looked at immediately no matter whose looking theres always a fear with this that virtual nurses will evolve into doing too much and things will slip thru the cracks almost like how if an in house nurse is so busy the virtuals will eventually become too overloaded as well because really they still need to be paid and it does seem that hospitals are all about cutting expenses anyway do you think a program like this could eventually lead to too few actual nurses on the floor and what could that mean for patient care thanks for
