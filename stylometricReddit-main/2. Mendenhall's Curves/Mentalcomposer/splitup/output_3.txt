if youre not an outgoing personality is hard to do if one wants kids then its not going to work ever if its a matter of spouse just wanting to sponge off the other then you have to decide if thats a dynamic you would be happy with if you can afford to live on one income and the stay home person is willing to look at doing all the domestic upkeep as their job and the other will be ok with that then maybe try it out but if one feels that no one should be a stay home person then again its not going to work someone will always be resentful ooh how good would it be if no photogs even bothered to take her pic she gets out of the car no flashes she walks to the door no flashes she walks out at the end no flashes that would be awesome conventional wisdom says dont quit until you have another job lined up so thats what you should be doing use your unhappiness about your job and homelife to give you that push to find another job id you quit with nothing lined up you will be home all day in a place that makes you miserable you have an education so you should be able to find something else and dont just take anything find something you think wont make you miserable but also that will allow you to move out even with a roommate or two dont just go thru life start taking a pro active stance with your life its the only one you got thats all well and good if you want to believe that but the second i walked in and saw everyone else i would have had some questions of my sister and i wouldnt have stayed after such a blatant disrespect of my relationship i believe your hopefully ex gf never mind fianc knew all along theres no way she hasnt been around or talked to anyone in the family or friends in the lead up to this marriage for it to not come out why you are still with this person is beyond me you obviously arent her number one and if im marrying someone thats the spot they should be in well id like to think a 4 year old knows the word beautiful one of mine was reading by then who do i call to get an article about them it still just blows my mind that any and i mean any publication would print obvious puff pieces that have anything to do with these two i cant be bothered to check cause i really dont care but did either of these two publications cover the chase non chase or do they just exist to go give platitudes oh did you think she was actually going to do something ive figured her out since shes a woman and self proclaimed activist she thinks that is enough to get otherpeople to do something she just collects awards while others do the work i can understand her wanting stability you have a child together and she wants to be married for all the protections that come with that for her and your child so give her a wedding maybe not the one she wants but one you can afford stability in a relationship is more about the innate knowledge that youre in a partnership that person is there for the long haul through it all its less about the stuff you have but stability also comes in another form and keeping even one of the properties will give you instant financial stability in the future if the need arises for an immediate need for a large amount of cash a luxury apt is nice if its well within your income level to purchase and upkeep it which it isnt because you have to sell off both your safety nets to afford it not to mention one is your childhood home or would stability come from owning an apt that is easily affordable and you can then save more for experiences you both may want in the future travel or hobbies or extra activities for your child or if you have another or two or more children kids are expensive im one who has always believed to live below your means without denying myself certain things that i want and save as much money as possible investments and building wealth will always trump biggerbetter or more expensive every time for me just something to think about nta its absolutely astonishing to me that your gf wants to sell property as part of financing a wedding and not just 1 property but both of them how big of a wedding does she want and how expensive of an apt i could maybe understand maybe selling the apt if its not a place you or her do not want to live maybe you cant live in the country while working in the city or for whatever reason but in that case proceeds from that sale should be used only to buy something where you want to live even if you have to finance the rest the country house would be a wonderful place to have as a respite from every day life in a city talk to her it seems theres more to this is she looking at expensive luxury apts when you normally wouldnt be able to afford and wants that as status you should have cancelled the weekend with your sister on wed or thursday when you realized you are not up to having visitors idk about the secondary stress but if you cant even get off the couch i really hope your sister isnt expecting you to entertain her and the kids why would she even want to come if you are so sick thats just risking her and or the kids getting sick also do yourself a favor and lock yourself in your bedroom until you feel well enough sis can use your home as a base and take the kids out to do whatever she wants and she can feed them on her own also i would never still visit if i knew my sister was so sick your sister is being selfish thank you for that it would take a bit of getting used to for sure nobody thinks how parents feel when the kids move away for their careers or just because they want to try living elsewhere and i think it really depends on how often you saw them were in the same state as our parents and sibs but they both live an hour away we see them a few times a year each holidays birthdays etc we def think about that when we talk of moving away like how often do we really see everyone and we can just travel back yeah the whole thing with the cab and go pro was odd were they originally stopped for a red light or did they just get into the cab either way you get in and take off why would the security guy in the cab get out to try to shoo away the one guy all that did was make the cab stay stopped for a longer time thus more photos and none of the three of them even tried to hide their faces if you want to make the pics unusable you dont give them a shot you give them the most unusable pose you can yeah the whole thing with the cab and go pro was odd were they originally stopped for a red light or did they just get into the cab either way you get in and take off why would the security guy in the cab get out to try to shoo away the one guy all that did was make the cab stay stopped for a longer time thus more photos and none of the three of them even tried to hide their faces if you want to make the pics unusable you dont give them a shot you give them the most unusable pose you can i had heard it was because in coed classes the boys were getting more attention from educators and the girls were kind of getting lost in the shuffle boys called on more for answers girls questions not being explained to satisfaction those sorts of things so having all girls would let them be more involved in the lessons or discussions the problem i see with sending the photos to the friend is that you have no idea who else hes sharing or showing them to at least when your h shared he was in control im assuming by just showing the friend his phone and i hate to say it but you shouldnt need any affirmation from other men to make you feel good i understand missing your h but that could lead to a slippery slope and you might not even notice it happening i would let h know and hope hed blast the friend and i would let the friend know what his gf said then id send a scathing text to gf then block her and the friend so wait was there even any paparazzi trying to follow them the article says they didnt want it known where they were staying so they were driven around for a over an hour overkill much but was there anyone actually even following them it doesnt actually say that so then what go to the police station to what wait for another car oh and they had to be escorted to the next block before they could get into them other car these two are only important in their own minds so much drama for absolutely nothing this chick lives for pictures of her was she afraid someone was gonna break into her hotel room gmafb dont be so quick to judge lots of younger kids gain a lot of weight right before they have a growth spurt where their weight evens out with their height but when i see older kids within a family and all of them are overly big then i wonder why the parents werent more conscious of the kids at least like they can be however big they want but wouldnt you want better for the kids sandals are even better than sneakers if you have a lightweight button down that looks great with shorts too roll up the sleeves the idea that you both have to see other people in order to know that you want to be with each other permanently makes no sense to me there will always be someone else that either of you could fall in love with and that person becomes the one the idea is that when you find a person you want to commit forever to you stop looking but you two are young have been together since youre teens so basically what youre both saying is you both want to play the field sleep around and see if theres someone better out there because you havent and you dont want to regret it and thats fine to want to most people do that in their teens until their mid 20s or longer just realize this be honest and verbalize this if you want to pretend that dating others will be the catalyst to losing weight and solidifying that your current partner is actually the one you might be surprised with the reality and are you both prepared for that i think it depends on what youre doing after the grad ceremony if youre going to a lunch at a decently nice restaurant then please dress accordingly if youre only going to the ceremony to be there for a friend and not going out afterward then i think its ok but actually i hate flip
