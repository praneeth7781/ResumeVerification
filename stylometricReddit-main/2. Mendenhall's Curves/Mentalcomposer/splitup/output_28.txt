might come looking for you what possible explanation can you have for never being involved you were too young well you werent always that young you werent ready to be a dad well she probably wasnt ready either but she did it anyway it seems so easy to just walk away but will you really be able to just forget that your child is out there somewhere maybe not having a great childhood because you just couldnt be bothered to take any responsibility that is awesome great job how big is it she wasnt technically stripped of us citizenship she was never supposed to have it if she legit ever did she is still a yemeni citizen because her father was a diplomat of yemen maybe she should ask yemen to let her in too bad so sad stay where you are jellyrolls is a dueling piano bar thats a fun night out the abracadabar is nice for a drink or two i think the boardwalk has brought back the entertainment could be a magician juggler etc they set up and put on a show for a bit theres a few boardwalk games for a fee basketball throw hit the lobster into the pot water gun race so basically walk the boardwalk and see what appeals to you we absolutely love the boardwalk enjoy idk why but i like this question originally h took the side with the outlet for the alarm clock cause he had to get up earlier than me then we moved and kept the same sides until the baby came then we had to switch cause the bassinet only fit next to his side of the bed we just havent switched back yta all you accomplished was to make your d and h mad at you and made your d miss her sisters wedding im not a fan of the emo look but thats what your d likes she put the dress on and added what she needed to be comfortable in it thigh high slits are fine on a formal dress have you seen what sweet 16 and prom dresses look like i just would have wanted it to be finished not just a scissor slit if thats what it was no one was going to care some ppl might have looked at her commented to their so and then went on with the festivities i highly doubt your d was planning on parading around the hall so everyone could see how edgy she was but bower says it was violet that set them up if the story about the insta crap was true why would she send violet flowers i have a 2 problems with scobies if im following this correctly the timeline h says the baby was already born when the in labor statement was made ok but did h or m even ever tell anyone that she was in labor so for him to be all butt hurt that it was a lie was actually his own damn fault for not telling anyone i am sure if the palace was told shes in labor they would have released that at that time so the fact that she labored gave birth and was already home by the time the in labor statement came out points to me that they purposefully withheld that info from anyone he wanted no press so he got no press so why bitch about it the fact checking he says there were things he didnt put in the book that were told by the place but couldnt be fact checked so he left them out ok that would be a good thing but when told by the harkens people about the titles he took that at face value and reported they didnt want title for archie so no additional fact checks in that one so he takes what their comms team says as fact and it turns out to be false but doesnt take the palaces statements as fact of course we dont know which ones they are because we have to wait for his second stupid ass book as if theres some big revelation to be revealed this is exactly where im at even commenting that we really should do ncl more we even have 2 cruise next certs that we have to use at some point i really like ncl but the ccl offers are just too good to pass up and as you say the diff is pretty small i also like that i can see my ccl offers online and dont have to call to find out what they are with ncl i have to call they look up my acct and tell me what my offer is then since its a casino offer i have to pay that extra 20 pp per day admin fee and honestly for the time and money spent in the casino on ncl my offers arent that good so ill stick with ccl until i find an itinerary on ncl that i cant get on ccl nta its a ridiculous caveat on the trust is it even legal what if it stated you had to marry a certain woman could that be upheld but really you should have never confided in your sib should have made like you were cheating kept the ruse going pretend fight and then make up now sib is gonna tell the lawyer and theres gonna be issues or not the lawyer might think its a ridiculous rule too and just overlook it can they do that im guessing this is about knees and even an obese person needs those to walk painful knees while walking leads to less walking leads to weight gain sometimes its just a vicious never ending cycle what if that painful knee was from a horrific accident that had someone laid up in a hospital for months should they have not eaten all that time to not gain any weight dont judge you probably have no idea what someone has been through yta its not for you to decide they are the parents and they can figure out their own stuff pretty sure you just ruined your relationship with your future sil the most logical solution is to move game night for the boys to brothers house he keeps the kids and does what he needs to do in between playing he doesnt even have to play he can just hang out with the guys but at least everything he needs is in his own home and his wife gets a needed time off to enjoy something just for herself who knows he might even get some help with the twins if they both wake at the same time nta for not wanting to spend v day as a double date but she really didnt do anything wrong to you personally her parents enabled her and now her bf has to put up with her just tell your wife you want to spend the day with just her thats kind of the point if that particular holiday how did they even know you commented here do they go and look at every single person who has ever been on that site every day to see what they post sorry if this is a stupid q i dont understand she cannot possibly think any kind of project that has anything to do with her time in the rf can help to worm herself back in if anything the shut door will now be padlocked youre assuming that anyone else knew its not hard to announce a pregnancy use the moon bumps all along tell someone she went into labor when the surrogate actually did and then present the baby do we know that she saw a royal dr and theres that weird remark from h that babies grow so much in2 weeks when they showed him publicly and for all we know they could have contracted with a surrogate in a legal country idk where i stand on the real or fake pregnancies but i wouldnt put it past them to lie to everyone precisely because of the los issue gotta get that sweet sweet royal heritage oh i totally agree we were young 2326 im happy to say it worked out tho 33 years 3 independent kids who are in no rush to marry and were retired we made it work but we also were done with school had a house and waited 4 years to start our family everyone has to do what works for them i would never tell anyone to do what we did just because we did it so you shouldnt its actually very smart to wait if its for your education i believe that a masters program only comes with a small stipend to live on so how exactly would you and a wife who im assuming is close to your age going to support a household and of course the girl is going to be traditional also and is going to want to have children too the pressure from both families would be unbearable stick to your decision i could not even imagine being married that young and i married at 23 but we were both already in our careers its not a big deal thats the point h just wants to make it seem like it is you know cause his witch of a wife is just so caring she would be able to comfort everyone while taking copious notes on everyone and everything for her tell all i have found that the best way for me to retain info is to write it down so in class take notes and then when you have to actually study for a test re write what you need to know organize it so it makes sense to you the act of writing it helps to retain it nta for initially being angry but at this point when she brings it up youve got to not engage with her just tell her youre not having this convo again its done and over and she can either get over it or get out why did she go thru your phone 7 mo in she has no right to info about your money if she lost all trust in you then that was the time to break up youve been rocky since then so you have to decide if this is what you want or not any relationship that is that much strife and aggravation isnt worth it to me i didnt mean to disparage your step mom but its human nature for her to prioritize her bio kids its worth at least a convo with your dad dont ask questions you dont want the answer to especially during sex with your wife never mind you going soft i would have kicked you out of the bed but really what she did with her time and body before being committed to you is none of your concern you are a grown man stop pouting that you didnt get the girl first you were gone for years was she supposed to sit home pining for you yta the problem i see is that even if you are still contributing your 50 share to expenses that money is coming out of somewhere either your savings or your retirement funds great that you have them but at some point they will run short or be depleted at that time you will be expecting your partner to pay all expenses do you realistically have enough of your own independent money to support half of this household for another 30 years because you very well could live that long your combined cash and investments seems like a lot but half of that lets say your half if its evenly contributed is 750000 750000 divided over 30 years is only 25000 per year obviously
