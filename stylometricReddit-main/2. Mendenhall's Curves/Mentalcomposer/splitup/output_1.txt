nta haha your brother and his wife arent very self aware are they i hope you let him know all the years he and his wife tormented you about your weight is the absolute reason you can be rude to her good for you to all saying e s h she was a teenager being made fun of by grown adults that in itself warrants her clapping back gross does she know this time for an honest convo about where you two are she may think you are going to be a cute little family and youre over here thinking youll take care of the baby because youre going to do that right but this is not going to turn into a living together and being a couple its not unheard of that a hookup gets pregnant and you both comparent but not have a relationship id have to ask him about it if he was that drunk its possible he doesnt even remember it and continues to hang out with these people who are clearly not his friends youve known him for 4 years does he look 20 or 16 do you recognize his clothes as what he wears now or in the past look for little clues as to a timeline or he knows it happened and it was a one off that his friends were just screwing with him because he got so drunk way way too far but idk these ppl either way it warrants a conversation he may be embarrassed but if he cant discuss it with you after 4 years together i wont say its a problem per say but you two should be able to talk about pretty much most things by now right now im kinda obsessed with married at first sight its a train wreck but i cant help myself does it not seem odd to anyone that you live outside of the country your godfather gets diagnosed decides to rewrite his will and the only person gf told he gave you your inheritance already was your brother the one who got everything im calling shenanigans on your brother hes gross taking advantage of a sick old man youre broken up stop obsessing over did she or didnt she cheat what diff would it make to know at this point anyway will you be more angry and what purpose will that serve being angry at your ex will do nothing for you except hinder your moving forward do you want to be an angry ex to any other girls you might meet cause thats a sure fire way to stay single nobody wants a bf who is stuck in the past block her and her friend move on but theyre not that young if he gave them cars and expensive trips and they all still have their college fund they lose nothing while hes still alive he didnt say how many nieces and nephews he has but his wealth seems to be enough that even if they dont get the whole thing they will all still be getting a nice chunk of change its his million dollar insurance investments and his home and a summer home its sad really that these young adults are so selfish to think he shouldnt leave his daughter the bulk of his estate i wonder if anyone from his family has ever expressed any happiness that this man is becoming a father they all know how they felt when they had their kids this is your first relationship and it has moved way way way too fast the find my iphone thing would have been an instant break up if you break up her mental state is not your concern what did she do before you were around anyway what you need is some time to yourself stop picking her up every single day go back to your 3 dates a week you will have time for yourselves and will also have things to talk about when you get together maybe you should join a club or activity so you meet some people you need other things in your life besides her and tell her that you will not note will not entertain her ridiculous amount of texts throughout the day she can either stop sending them or be prepared for them to be ignored you are an adult you have a job you cant be watching tik toks all damn day you have to make your boundaries very clear to her or she will run over every one of them you need to have a talk with his mother is she as worried about him as you or is she ok with what hes doing if she is worried then you two need to decide what to do next if he has a therapist maybe it would be worthwhile to make sure they know what hes been saying maybe he needs in house mental health care im sorry youre going thru this its painful when your kids are struggling you are the teacher all teachers should aspire to be good job school dad if he had a draw id just throw them in but it feels odd to just throw them on a shelf all willy nilly idk now i feel like a weirdo im a woman and i do like your gf and it goes in a draw but i do the laundry and i fold my husbands underwear boxer briefs are bigger than my bikinis and have more structure to them his dresser is a tall one so he has shelves on the top where his underwear and socks go on the top shelf behind doors and deep drawers on the bottom so he stacks his undies so in order to stack they need to be folded makes perfect sense to me i agree the idea that shes more worried about talking to him is a problem she might find that after spending however long24 hrs with hubby she might actually enjoy alone time and she gets to hang with her gfs for her bday and talk about the wedding and honeymoon i realize tho that some people feel a certain way about their bday maybe shes one of them me ill celebrate whenever just wish me hb on the day and were good i dont even want a gift just take me to dinner i tripped coming down stairs and broke my tibia i sprain my ankles pretty easily so i thought it was just that hobbled on it the rest of the evening and until midday the next day i was on vacation at the time had a cast up to my knee and was told no weight on it at all got home a week later went to ortho and the break was stable so i got a walking boot and had to go for physical therapy its been a little more than 4 months and the swelling is gone but i still feel little twinges in the ankle or leg at times age doesnt really have anything to do with it i started with just store bought readers probably around 40 when they stopped working i needed rx glasses but at that time my doc did say that i probably would need distance glasses as i got not so young he never said the word old now i wear progressive lenses all the time cause i cant see near or far ill admit i still hate wearing glasses i never feel like they look good on my face ive also never wore sunglasses for the same reason i asked about contacts but that was a no go too its been a month if she cant compromise so you both can schedule your daily call earlier at this point she never will schedule a 15 min call at 8 pm then she can both go do whatever and you can go to sleep when you need to also texting is ok too you dont have to have marathon calls every night of course they did have to keep it till the 11th our so both sides can tout their compromises and their thats what we were proposing all alongs this whole routine is getting old i think it doesnt matter that its a you feel as opposed to her feeling that way shes not going to admit shes just with you for the lifestyle you can afford her so it doesnt even make sense to ask add in that its difficult to talk to her about money why is that you think this relationship isnt an equal financial partnership in addition to not feeling this is a romantic pairing anymore shes a gf not a wife there is no reason you have to stay with her if you want to move and go back to school she supported her d before you came along and she can go back to doing just that youre going to work part time to basically help support her and her d why would you do that youll be gone 5 out of 7 days of the week its time you decide what you want not what you think is the right thing to do as far as gf is concerned nta i dont think theres anything wrong with that we do it frequently in my family and we all live about an hour away we just had a childs bday the day before mothers day and we all gave the moms their gifts then no sense driving on sat seeing everyone and then driving again on sunday just give your dad a heads up that since youre making the drive for the graduation its silly to do it again just a week later he shouldnt have a problem with it nta hes afraid youll expose him as the abuser he is to the gf i might accidentally on purpose run into gf at daycare one day if at least ask the daycare people about her does she seem like shes nice enough to your d doesnt the daycare realize that all of a sudden someone new is picking up d and using her dads pin to do it you would think they would want to know who she is give her her own pin and have a contact number stop trying to find your one and only that will lead you to settling just so you have someone which is why you maybe stayed in an emotionally challenging relationship for so long take this little break to analyze what it is you want in a partner and what you are not willing to put up with this is especially important for people who had less than easy relationships you dont want to get back in the same routine just because its what you know does that make sense wasnt sure how to put it when you feel you are at your strongest then you can put yourself out there and start dating again and maybe you can be the one to go after the person you want to be with iow ask out the guy you want to get to know instead of waiting for him to do the asking how many guys do we not date because they didnt ask itll happen maybe when you least expect it but is he in therapy its great that your bro adopted an older kid but he had to know this child would come with some issues its been years what are they doing to help him then thats what you should do move out to the country you two are never going to agree on lifestyle and be assured where you live will dictate your lifestyle youll stay in london and be unhappy and years from now youll realize you should have left years ago nta as long as when applying for this job your
