on you for going higher heres hoping the refund comes soon have a great trip so i found this recipe im not so sure its a bad meal as its 285 cal for a 4 oz serving of the beef just trim any remaining fat which i think youd do anyway but it has a very high salt content according to this the first recipe is how i cook mine just put it in a pot and boil i add the cabbage and potatoes pretty much after the beef is cooked because i dont like when they get really mushy i cook the vegs just until the potatoes are soft and the cabbage is cooked thru but slightly firm i cant help with spring break stuff but if you really have to go to key west rent a car miami to key west is a 4 hour drive and orlando to key west is a 6 hour drive idk where youre flying into absolutely agree with everything you wrote but i didnt mean to imply drop them at the club all day long it seems a lot of people thought thats what i meant so to expand on that just if the choice is roam free or kids club id opt kids club at least the first few days for a bit to have a chance to meet other kids and i said if he meets a buddy and wants to do something else have the boy set a time and him and buddy can go do that or those things and if he has a phone even better he can text where theyre gonna go next were done here going for ice cream or in the pool or wherever so at least the parents have an idea of where he is i think thats fair gives him a bit of free movement without mom or dad tagging along but hes with a buddy or two and can get small doses of roaming free but somewhat controlled if that makes sense so just so im clear this is on government or company issued devices if thats the case i dont have a problem with it what am i missing if anything i know about china tracking and all that but theres got to be more to it since theres such a ruckus around it nta the main thing is that this is passed on through your moms family your dad and especially your half sis from him have zero connection to your moms side thats your out this is from moms side not dads tell her to have her grandparents write down their recipes she can have that youre not even close with this half sister so i have no idea why shed even care i wouldnt let a 10 yo roam around alone the kids club is where he should be if he meets a friend in the club and they want to do something specific like go to the arcade do the ropes course etc then he needs to ask if he can do that at a specific time so maybe dont put him in the club at that time but they meet up where theyre gonna go to meet the friend and then they go off but id walk him to the meeting place and at least meet the other kid does he have a phone so he can at least tell you where he is like after the arcade were going for ice cream then were going wherever nta your wife is being a bad mother in regards to your sons health your wife just doesnt want to admit that your son is unwell so its up to you now to help your son go to your son and ask him what he wants to do he seems to relate better to you anyway is that therapy or meds not painkillers more along the lines of an anti depressant or does he just want a semester off to stay home get out in nature or just have no stress dont dictate what he should be doing he knows hes unwell he probably has some idea what he needs at this moment then facilitate doing what he wants to do for himself she was granted legal custody and the dad asked for no visitation but dad was ordered to pay support so ill guess the court didnt decide visitation because he said he didnt want it now he and his whole family suddenly wants to see the son i really hate that every time i hear of a dog attack i automatically think its a pit bull but it is always a pit bull i keep hearing that these dogs are really sweet when trained well but these dogs were bred to be vicious so even if its a well trained dog there can be circumstances where the dog will revert back to its basic instinct of being vicious i dont know what circumstance this could be but it seems to happen anyone else just curious why exactly his parents need a no doing dangerous things in the house rule to begin with yta stop doing dangerous things in your parents house or you wont have a house or parents to come home to why do you want to be married to someone who is not in love with you how can you look at him a guy who lied and cheated pretty much the whole time you are together and not be absolutely disgusted by what you see that alone would make me lose any love i had for him dont sacrifice any more of your dignity and pride for a guy who will cheat andor move on from you when he finds something better in a heartbeat i am a parent although mine are out of school now i would not allow anyone associated with the school to touch my childs personal laptop if the school is so worried they can give my child a laptop that only allows access to approved sites for schoolwork only id ask your parents about this whole scenario totally agree shes pushing back school so she can go on vacation with money they dont have if they have extra money for a vacation that money should be used to pay down the debt its understandable now why they have such debt nta its really presumptuous of your bro and ex sil to tell your niece you would buy her a car or even worse that youd pay for her party they are her parents if they want her to have these things they can buy them if bro and ex own both homes why did they not divide them at the time of the divorce this is your bros fight to fight i wouldnt do anything either he made this mess he can figure it out in the event mom is forced to get out then you can discuss with mom where she wants to live and if that means buying her a house then you do it i really dont think i can take anymore of her truth now if she wants to admit to the truth i might listen but we know shed never do that it will make her look bad but do you realize that the loan you paid off including the interest actually funded the next group of kids that need loans the fed govt only backed those loans so they had enough money to fund the next round of loans i have kids that are all paying off their loans of course they stopped when it was on pause but i told all of them to make sure they didnt spend that amount of their budget for when they had to start repaying them oh and my h and i paid ours off too i agree i think first time employees need a bit of in office experience you def get a lay of the land that way you learn the in office politics and just a general how to behave in an office setting i like seeing them its kind of fun seeing usually older couples riding i always think the guy was a biker back i the day maybe and he had to give it up so this is the closest hell come to riding and he has his partner with him its nice oahu was absolutely gorgeous enjoy the med on a cruise italy greece turkey montenegro cannot wait spending a few days in rome then doing a trans atlantic back to fla its my longest vacation cannot wait just find a teenager in the neighborhood to watch your kids at your home while your wife works and ask your parents for the every other weekend or whatever their schedule can do paying might cut into the amount of money your wife is making but you dont really have a choice do you even if you get the kids in daycare is your wife really going to be making enough money to cover it if its just a matter of her wanting to work put the little one in daycare while the 5 yo is in school and she can work those hours your wife cannot be mad at your parents im sure it sounded good at the time but the reality was it was unsustainable long term for them and thats what you should have said at the time i also went to one store and found mine also only tried on a few but i had been looking thru brides magazine do they still have that for months i kept coming back to the same one and it was the one and 33 years later i still love it nah this person will not care what anyone else has to say take what responses you have gotten here and decide for yourself what your next move should be this is your life dont leave it up to someone who belittles you look at what 5pinktoes has to say about the power imbalance she is spot on you have none if you stay all of this is really odd why does he even care how long it took you to find a dress he should be thrilled now you wont be stressing that youre never gonna find one that happens a lot for him to get mad over this is uncalled for does he frequently get mad over trivial things maybe that should be a conversation youre not being sensitive every one of those examples are meant to demean you the person saying them seems to have a very high opinion of themselves and you wont ever measure up to them this person will not change they will not understand how these words bother you ever i wouldnt put up with it slight yta i understand that in your experience laying it out so bluntly has been the way to shut down any debate but i think you should have and in the future should explain the reasoning once if a debate ensues or your explanation is questioned then you go nuclear in other words nice first then nuclear and hey dont stress its one day it will be wonderful even if not perfect nothing is ever perfect when you feel stressed take a step back calm yourself and then go back to it one thing one decision at a time suppers done roast beef to let d know you were only dating the first girl for a little over a month so i do not think theres anything wrong with breaking up with her to start dating another thats the point of dating you date you break up when you find someone else you like better i would suggest not becoming exclusive with anyone until you date for longer than a month and get to know that person
