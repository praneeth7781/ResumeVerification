matter of what youre doing together you need to ask why he isnt willing to experiment some people just dont like some sex acts and really shouldnt be made to do them if it isnt their thing you matched with her first but your bro was texting with her before you started dating how did that even happen you both must have been at the very least texting or talking with her at the same time and how did you find out bro was talking to her look if you dont see moving forward with her just let her go why drag it out any longer so does your ex usually pick your son up at 9pm so he can sleep at dads everything about this is just off you pay your ex child support but you have him all day do yourself a favor and split custody with the ex 5050 no one pays child support and then youll have time for your bf so dont give her access to all the money sit her down and show her your finances take the 4800 for the month minus all your household bills by now you have an idea what the variable ones avg out to food etc take the net thats left and left decide how much goes into emergency fund long term savings and depending on whats left decide on a weekly amount she can use for herself open separate accounts for the emergency savings and one for her money leaving is impulsive she doesnt work and you have two small kids your finances are not going to be better supporting a separate household for yourself and paying alimony maybe and child support you say all hell breaks loose when you discuss money just tell her she can bitch and moan all she wants its still not going to change the fact that she is being irresponsible where was your mom for those 2 hours you should not have to sleep in the spare room unless you want to or your gf is so sickly contagious that its dangerous for you to be in your shared bed how long could it possibly take you to hang one load of laundry and in that time your gf went upstairs got ready for bed and also fell asleep oh and conveniently sometimes puts her glasses on your side of the bed so its a guess each night either she was not sleeping yet and purposely set you up to have a fight or she was sleeping and got unreasonably mad when you came to bed and woke her she really couldnt just wait for you to come up and you go to bed together thats pretty selfish in this instance considering she knew you were coming up pretty much right after her the thing you need to remember is this when we start to date we have no idea what were doing were all fumbling around trying to figure out this whole bfgf thing so we date and we break up a lot mostly with no rhyme or reason who knows what your bf is thinking but dating you just isnt working for him anymore doesnt mean you did anything wrong stop being sad look at this as a learning lesson the lesson is enjoy it while it lasts take a day or two to mourn it and move on but that doesnt mean on to yet another boy just for the sake of having a boy this too shall pass most people realize that the 2 party system the us has is not working i think mainly because theres an us vs them mentality most elected officials dont think for themselves and just go along with party lines thats not to say they dont personally agree with some issues but it is unrealistic to think one person agrees with every single platform either party has and third party candidates have mostly been one off random candidates from one state here and there thats why the third party is looked at as a water vote that out of the way how does this sound a third party but with candidates in every state where an election is being held with a pretty centrist platform take the most popular stances of each issue and endorse that or whatever it is national elections take place every evennumbered year every four years the president vice president onethird of the senate and the entire house are up for election onyear elections on evennumbered years when there isnt a presidential election onethird of the senate and the whole house are included in the election offyear elections so next year this third party could have people running who could theoretically change the whole look of all branches of govt im not gonna explain this correctly so bear with me how do we do this we let people in every state know that we have ppl running in all the diff states so me in state a can say i want to vote for party 3 and id like their agenda to be implemented i know one person from my state cant do anything alone but if a countrywide campaign can be implemented with a message of this party can get a majority of representatives we can implement our platform it might make people rethink the wasted vote of a third party could be that you just dont have an actual sexual attraction to that person her being good looking isnt really the only criteria maybe you need to have an emotional attraction to a partner as well sex is sometimes as much emotional as physical and just wash your hands and clean under your fingernails for me its not about trying to hold the family together its more the nephew is too angry for an 11 year old and i recognize that all is not well somewhere in his life it could be his mom has poisoned him against his dad and his fam it could be theres more to the story between his mom and dad that even the op doesnt know it could simply be that nephew is a troubled child but whatever the reason if he grows and gets to a place where he wants to make amends with his dads family he will have the knowledge that they always wanted him around and never actively excluded him thats just my take if nephew wouldnt show up anyway you might as well extend the invite it keeps the peace with your brother and if nephew ever realizes that this side of the fam is decent you can always say that he was included and he never took you up on it but if you can schedule on moms weekend youd be better off as an aside im still confused how his mom wanted nothing to do with the father of her childs family what did she want to happen shed raise the child alone and dad would just be ok with that dad needs to get some some help so the boy can stop being so angry nta its your money that you earned its not as if you spend some of it youre putting an undue burden on your parents the fact is even with a full scholarship there are day to day expenses that you need money for coffee with friends a movie gasetc why dont you explain this to your mom and ask for a monthly amount dont divide all the money you have so its gone by the last month of school just try to figure out a nominal amount that you can get by with youll have some spending money and youll also still have some savings when you graduate unless something big comes up in the next few years i found it odd too the woman tho i heard they have more info but not releasing it just yet something about who the man is that was seen running away the other guy it seems is a workplace issue the guy who killed him was an ex employee he was a gas or electric co employee so im not sure him being an elected official has anything to do with it now if the same guy killed both then we have a story honestly he sounds a bit too controlling for my tastes but we really dont know you nor what your individual needs are so if you say his what we see as controlling but you see as taking anxiety inducing decisions off of you then maybe its not as we see it have you tried to explain to your parents exactly how him making these decisions are actually helpful to you rather than harmful im getting the impression they arent seeing what value they add to your well being this is also your first relationship so you dont really know how it should work do you you have nothing to compare him against the good and the bad as far as staying home after you marry it sounds lovely doesnt it until he starts complaining that youre hobbies are taking up too much of your free time and youre not dedicating enough time on his needs and framing it as you just arent using your time efficiently be on the look out for that please thats when you should reassess the whole him making decision ideas maybe you should work part time a few hours a few days a week just to retain some semblance of independence maybe start with asking her to study or out for coffee you and she both should spend time together to see if you actually do like each other before you commit to something like the prom idk any proms that are soon so im basing this off the us version of a prom dont fall back into the its ok most days tho work it out now for everyones happiness yours theirs and your child you may open a pandoras box but wouldnt you rather know that now than years from now yes you would hey im on your side i just meant not to bring up the money part of it in a i paid for it way def ok to say why are you not done yet its been 7 yrs i would never hire someone to clean thats just a waste of money when someone is home all day with seemingly nothing else to do and absolutely do not being up being able to find another partner as tempting as that may be but i would say i didnt sign up to be and do everything in this relationship i need an equal partner and i have to know if youre willing to step up and be a partner or this isnt going to work for me youve gotten some great ideas how to approach the things that need to be brought up please organize and use them and let us know how it goes yeah no no way my partner would be waking up mid day thats just disrespectful on a whole other level id start waking them up when the rest of the household gets up in the morning your poor kid even recognizes that one parent is basically useless thats another point you can point out to your partner i need to sleep to get up for work and kid has in the past refused to even ask you to do a late pickup knowing you will refuse its affecting them and we cannot have that going forward its not fair to our child i wouldnt harp too much on the accounting course but it needs to be mentioned that may come off as a money thing even if its not instead of a it shouldnt take 7 years to finish a 2 yr program thing whoever cooks should be cleaning since
