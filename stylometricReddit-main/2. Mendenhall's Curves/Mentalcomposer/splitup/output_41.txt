i do not believe you and bf are so in love that you have to bend over backward to appease not only him but his friend also and why do you think that because she stood up to some ah that made fun of your accent how about you just start standing up for yourself to ppl who make fun of you and to these two users nta for not entertaining his ridiculousness its absurd that he would even ask you to give him advice on his relationship youre not a couples counselor do away with both of them like literally dont even pick up her calls or texts they arent even your friends you know her because she is friends with your bfs cousin which at best make you acquaintances she picked him and wants to stay so let her deal with her own messed up life nta but i want to know how old frank is this is not your situation to manage and you dont know or even like this guy if rory and frank want to see each other they have to figure out a way every time she wants to see him youre gonna somehow get your parents to go visit family in queens oh and youre just gonna conveniently being your best friend and then what disappear for a few hours to go see frank oh and her parents are strict about boys so add to this absurd scenario her parents finding out see how stupid this sounds really why cant you guys just find some nice boys where you live youre 15 youre supposed to be figuring out all this dating crap with other teens from school or a club or anywhere closer and as per usual the revenge dress will fail because it will be ill fitting the issue is not that you cant lose weight you dont have to lose weight the issue is you know youre at a healthy weight but you want to lose more weight to be skinnier you need to explore why you feel the need to be even smaller than you are do you see the difference did you tell the therapist that you are not happy with how you look and that is the reason you want to lose weight have you explained the binging purging and excessive exercise if you did and their advice was to eat more veggies you need a diff therapist your weight is perfectly fine you know this you acknowledge youre at a healthy weight do your parents know about your past issues with your weight if not now is a good time to tell them and if they do now is a good time to tell them if they dont make sure you see at the least your regular dr if not a therapist then tell a guidance counselor at school you need to get a handle on this now before you do irreversible damage to your health ok im looking at this a bit differently than the other 2 commenters because its not just her whose saying she regrets not being with others you said it too i think her coworker was totally out of line with his behaviors i cant even imagine what he was thinking so im not gonna comment on that thats a while diff issue you say that it was rocky at the beginning but its better and you love each other now i think you need to check in with your wife about that and also do a brutally honest assessment of your own feelings if yours was truly a loving partnership marriage there really should be no reason to need validation from others on either side your start was tough because maybe you didnt really know each other that well but after 7 years you both should know if this is your person or not it shouldnt be we stay together for the son or were just comfortable in our day to day or itll cause too much upheaval to split up or any other superficial excuse you could both come up with you both should be staying together because this is actually the person you want to be with if its not youre both just prolonging the inevitable not that i think 28 is old by any stretch but having wild times that you both think you missed out on just isnt going to be the same at 2830 as opposed to 2125 and having sex with other people just for the sake of having sex with other people is a really crappy reason its time for some real honest soul searching by both of you neither of you can try to spare the others feelings in this if its not working its not working is she gonna tell all about her early life where her dear mother was thru her childhood all about what her dad has done for her the story about trevor or even better cheating on corey with h were gonna get her spin from age 37 thru 41 get out of here with this nonsense what publisher would agree to any of this knowing how neither one of them can actually deliver on what they promise are you really saying that h would go back to his family and eliminate his brother and all 3 of his kids just so he and his wife can take the throne i hate them too but thats just way no to crazy land wth did i just read im gonna need to know what the argument was about that made you take a break for a week so without that some observations you seem to have a lot of control over him you read his messages and his journal and decide who he can talk too does he always do what you want him to and that crap about him having to break up with you no put your big girl panties on and make a decision thats middle school level maturity you dont want a marriage you want a proposal and wedding so you can pretend you have some great love story that survived through all your perceived struggles and your solution to this is to set an arbitrary date at which point if he doesnt want to get married you will leave i think my eyes are stuck in the back of my head from that hard roll you two both have a lot of growing up to do and i think it should be done separately you are a grown man why are you moaning to your parents about your job when you readily admit that you bore everyone about it theres only so much a person can take figure your shit out for everyones sake make up with your parents and get some help you sound insufferable im sorry i dont understand this at all godparents where i come from are not expected to raise or even help raise the child its a religious thing for baptism i never expected anything from my kids godparents she is saying she expects you to be all in with this kid from day one then no id decline thats mom and dads job of course everyone needs some help occasionally so then its grandparents siblings and friends very occasionally how does she treat the godparents of her first child are they bending over backwards for this child and does she talk badly about them if they dont id tell her you just dont feel you will have the time and energy to help raise her child and in addition you feel very strongly that you plan on focusing on your child when you have them and arent going to worry about anyone elses household shes a selfish person and as you know a selfish friend this decision might finally get you free of her think how much hurt youre setting yourself up for in the future people who love you do not tell you they dont love you talk shit to their family about you get an apt behind your back and seemingly try to get with their co worker he doesnt really want to be with you hes just too much of a coward to break up so he does everything he can do to try to get you to break up with him so hes not the bad guy give him what he wants exactly how will it keep you busy and away from him is he expecting you to go outside to his car and itll take you a while to pick the lock with a bobbie pin locking your stuff away is a sure fire way for you to keep engaging with him why exactly are you with him he seems to treat you crappy youre missing the barbells your practice mistakes and stories nothing about this makes sense they include you when youre single while some of them are attached but then start excluding you when you get attached if it was that their partners felt threatened cause youre the young chickie no offense to you just how older sos would view it id think the partners would be glad you found your own man they tell you when they got a raise or new car is it possible they are a bit salty that you as the young newish one is making the same money as them and theyve been their longer it have more experience obviously its not your problem but they have to take their angst out on someone you need to speak with the ones that you were friendly with and ask what the deal is thats the only way youre gonna figure out why the sudden cold shoulder your partner recounted to you the horrible things you said and you dont remember saying them think about what you said is there any truth to it at all even a little you broke up once are you sure you both agree those issues are resolved think back was anything you said related to that time all this to say take some time and be brutally honest about if he is really the one you want to be with maybe this whole thing is pointing to a reevaluation i always wondered if a meeting with both sets of parents and both kids and a school psychologist to mediate would be helpful get it all out in front of everyone why do you pick on or bully or throw things or whatever and no letting the bully not answer i think younger kids would probably stop the behavior but middle and high school is a toss up depending on what the parents of the bully are like trash parents make trash kids if that fails then yes my kid would be learning to fight ill give you one chance but ill be dammed if my kid is gonna be fodder for some insecure bully esh you both sound unorganized i dont mean to sound judgmental at all my first didnt sleep thru the night until maybe 9 months so i understand what youre going thru but why is your home always a mess two adults and a 6 mo old who doesnt even crawl yet never mind play with toys your wife didnt need to put together the high chair right that minute and how long did it take seems like it was hours you could have made supper while the baby sat in a playpen or a baby chair or just take the initiative and order something first babies are hard for the fact that youre tired youre figuring out a new normal and a new schedule put the baby in a baby seat or a swing or a playpen or whatever you use and go about doing what you need to do if youre cleaning the lr have them
