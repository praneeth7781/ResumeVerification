wife knew there would be travel i cant imagine you went thru the application interview process and accepted this job without talking to your wife about it but also its only 4 days with one almost 4 yo why cant she handle that i would tell her that instead of making excuses as to why she thinks hes still open to the idea she needs to just ask him its a simple do you want kids that is either a yes or a no question not a discussion although we all know he doesnt she needs to hear it point blank why in the world would you volunteer that info theres no reason for her to ask specifics of your where and what you did with a past gf and its kind of gross that you even told her maybe you should think about having some respect for the woman you date and not go blabbing a gentleman never tells reditt has a mix of everything i like seeing how diff generations deal with issues theres funny sad stupid weird crazy posts its amazing to see glimpses into how people live and sometimes i feel i can give sound advice you know from being soooo old buy bitcoin this was said in the very beginning by my 20 something son but at the time i knew nothing except i thought bc was being used for things on the dark web and since i dont even know how to get on the dark web thought there was no reason to buy yeah missed out on that big time now i listen when he suggests something especially when i dont know anything about it dont always do it but i listen does your state have aca insurance id look into that first the subsidies really can make it affordable but id start with just a regular doctor visit it may be something simple as an infection try to find a clinic in your area so hes okay with you feeding him but has a problem when you offer to feed his gf who just happens to be in the house its not like you only cook when shes there why is he afraid youre gonna steal her with food is he afraid shes only hanging out with him because you feed her ask roomie what the problem is and then stop doing what he doesnt like if that means not feeding her then stop feeding him too you sound like a great roomie you mow and offered to wash their cars who does that youre like southern hospitality on steroids so i saw that there are 175 or so winners of this award surely they all cant make an acceptance speech so my q is is tw slated to say something and if she is supposed to talk why her shes hardly the most esteemed of the list of winners i can understand others going to meet and make connections but no one wants to meet or connect with her shes hardly the it person at this point on the other hand might be nice if she went and was shunned but wed never know that anyway dont feel bad i think the same thing nta how did a bunch of 14 yos get to a cabin 2 hours away someone had to drive them and who leaves a bunch of 14 yos on their own the girl whose cabin it is had to have known there were no beds in the cabin everything about this was a mess from the get go you did nothing wrong you had company who were taking up sleeping space in your home and if you had a bunch of young girls sleep in the house with you and your friends i guarantee someone would have had a problem with that too and that optic is worse what kind of work do you do if it is mentally taxing that could be why youre exhausted dont discount the amount of energy you expend by literally thinking and problem solving if thats not it then you have the classic a body at rest tends to stay at rest get up and walk around every hour or so you also work 6 days a week and dont go home and just sit do something anything even for 15 min at first walk around the block do 10 push ups i have been down the alf and nh road with my sister the diff is she is disabled and had zero assets can you clarify something please assisted living costs 6500 month but you said your dad has an income of 6800mo does this money include his 401 he has enough income to pay for this why do you think he cant afford this he of course is not ever going to be able to give your brother any money ever ever ever again hell have 300 extra every month you can bring him what he needs from this money deodorant clothes etc when his money runs out he can apply for medicare and i know they cover nursing home not sure about alf i think only if disabled but even then we had to private pay for 2 yrs before my sister qualified your dad may well be ready for a nh by the time hes 86 i think this will work if he can pay cash for 6 or more years he can transfer the house now then it wont be in the look back period make double sure what the look back period is i think it may be longer but im going with this time since it seems to be the consensus in the comments also when you move him in go see the social services office they should have one explain to them that your dad is private pay his house is not needing to be sold in order to pay his bill and no one from the facility should be talking to his dad about it at all have them put it in his admission record watch them do it explain that linda is pushing this and its not going to happen you might want to get a poa for your dad that way he cant be held if he signs anything i love a sweeter breading on pork it just seems to go together i havent done frosted flakes just because i dont normally buy that cereal try adding some crushed almonds to it too nta because ops fianc bro to the sil was in agreement with how everything was planned did his sister go complain to him i wonder it doesnt really matter that sil blocked this couple in a couple of months they wont ever be seeing each other because this couple is banned from bringing their baby to any family functions anyway lets see how long that lasts no one can tell me that grandma isnt going to want to see that baby at christmas and op if your in laws want to do separate holidays so sil doesnt have to see your baby id advise against it we are either a family or we are not at this point send 1 group message to anyone who has your number then block all of them you dont need this crap from anyone id mention the fact that none of them contacted you when your bf of 4 yrs disappeared when you were pregnant and both him and his mother ignored repeated attempts at contact after that then mention the repeated attempts after the baby was born and passed then nicely mention they can all go to hell nta how old is this guy i wouldnt let him in either even if i heard him this is lower than even basic adulting he remembers to lock the door and that doesnt instantly make him realize he needs a key you can always tell him to wear his key on a string around his neck like the latchkey kids always did not going to be popular but oh well honestly i think your wife is just done with parenting altogether its easy to just say go out and play you bathed them took to urgent care went to pharmacy made breakfast and she hadnt even gotten out of bed yet then you still had to go fill the prescription and then she gives you attitude and decides she isnt talking to you im all for giving the sahp a day to sleep in and taking over the kids but when my spouse tells me its urgent care time you bet im up and seeing whats going on has she always been so irresponsible this relationship has run its course its extremely common when ppl start dating as teens but you are an adult and you have to know that cheating is not the way to get out of a relationship thats a cop out you knew on some level exactly what you were doing and you thought this would be a sure fire way for your gf to break up with you im shocked you were the one who had to tell her you havent said much about your gf reaction is she not upset how could she even want to still live with you are you planning on living together until sept thats a mistake doesnt your school break for summer go back home or find someone who has a graduating roommate and move in there me too just never liked her maybe its time to lay out everything sis has said and done to you to the kids if they dont know that way they will know to stay away from sis and not believe anything she says they are old enough to make a decision not to be around their aunt and id expect them to decline any invites where she will be your h can go alone he is the one who didnt put a stop to this nonsense from the very beginning i can understand partner worries about transitioning in that climate but what op is asking about has less to do with that the way i read it is that each one of them is asking for reassurance about the other still wanting to be a couple its their personal relationship they are worried about and in that case the transitioning one is not really reassuring op why shouldnt both of them be each others support ops life is drastically changing also she is going from having a male partner to having a female partner its a lot to handle and their concerns shouldnt be discounted just because shes not the one going thru the physical transition they need to know that during and after transition their partner is planning to still be there op you need to explain to your partner what youre feeling and thinking your partner should be doing everything in their power to reassure you when your insecurities creep in i dont think id want anyone in my home without me being there even if you know half this couple isnt it kind of understood that youd all be going back to your home together at the end of the night thats what i would expect if i was the friend maybe call your friend and ask her to thank her bf for the trinkets you should def acknowledge it i always wonder tho you spent a few hours with this new person did any of you actually try to talk to him get to know him its hard being the new one its natural to be the more quiet one in this setting if you did and he didnt really reciprocate or try to keep the convo going then great but usually its the group just doing their thing and expecting the newbie to just join right on in which
