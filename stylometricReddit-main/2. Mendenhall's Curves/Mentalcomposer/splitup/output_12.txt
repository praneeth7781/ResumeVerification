to stay at just parties and hes already tried heroin after 2 months im more curious tho about how he just picked up this little habit did he just wake up one day and say hey think ill use coke today and see how it goes if hes addicted its really really hard to break the addiction he will relapse he will lie are you prepared for this major upheaval in your life the highs when hes clean and the very low lows when he relapses the in and out of rehab id tell him he has to do this on his own for himself when hes clean and has his life all back together then to give you a call and you can see what you want to do good luck its hard to see someone you love struggle but its his struggle dont make it yours so the story i just read his lawyer argued he was mentally ill no mention of being autistic so that had no bearing on why he killed sorry i agree with the judge he should never see another day free he was 20 so even though technically a minor whatever law you mentioned shouldnt apply to him as he must have been tried as an adult whats to question youre a boy you are were attracted to this person who presents as a girl therefore you are straight now this person says theyre a boy but they still look like a girl so youre still attracted and still straight does this persons family know they think theyre a boy did you ask them if they think theyre a boy are they gay then since they presumably like you and youre also a boy still not going anywhere romantically just be friends ok i have to ask are you straight and thought you were dating a girl or are you gay and thought you were dating a guy if youre straight then obviously you cannot date this person because they think they are a boy and you are not into boys if youre gay then you can date this person because they think theyre a boy except for the fact that they look like a girl and you arent attracted to girls this is going nowhere romantically just be friends since you seem to get along so well then it wont matter if theyre a boy or girl how old are you two how is it that your salary is all of a sudden not enough what did the two of you change has rose explained why she never told you about being pregnant otherwise its going to be a very awkward dinner but i think youre trying to do the right thing its up to rose to realize its what her d wants sorry but she knows the real reason she doesnt want to have sex and its not stress or low self esteem she would have had to been super stressed every day for the past 5 years and really a lot of people will use sex to combat stress if she still has self esteem issues after being in a loving committed relationship for 5 years then shes got therapist level issues that she needs to address you two need to have an honest to a fault discussion about this ill bet shes probably more asexual than she will ever admit to you because shed be afraid of losing you but you cannot sustain a relationship without honesty especially on this subject maybe just stop lying have a sit down and explain you are so close to being an adult and you have to start making choices for yourself if they turn out to be bad so be it but at least you did it and learned from it and idk how your schools work but if you dont know history or geography how are you going to be allowed to actually graduate there has to be some minimum grade you have to get and if there is and youre making it just tell him that too your bmr might be off if youre using the same number from when you were 250 lbs recalculate it you do realize that your sole job is not to make him happy of course in a relationship each person makes the other happy but not from doing every whim the other has also you are your bfs first gf from what you wrote he didnt seem to have friends either and didnt leave the house much he didnt have the usual date around as a teen figure out all the dating rituals etc idk how you two met or why he was finally able to connect with you and have a relationship that might not bide well for the two of you as he may feel like he missed out on dating around and sleeping around plus most first relationships do not work out long term but those are usually had as a teen which he didnt his idea of having threesomes may be his attempt to experience others without losing you hell get to sleep with others and having 2 permanent gfs might be way of dating around hell have to navigate more than just one personality im probably reading too much into it but thats the first thought that came to mind i agree its sad almost i buzz my ha hair and i told him when he has nothing but a horseshoe we have to think about shaving it but i would not just not say anything but who knows maybe hs happy with it while i absolutely agree it is monumentally stupid for a 17 yo to have a car loan i suspect there was a lot more going on op says son wanted to live with mom almost full time so i suspect dad gave in to the car if not more just to keep son happy and not hate him and lets not forget mom probably had a hand in that decision also its not just dad he put money away for college and cars its not that the money he gave them to invest was going to be the only money they had for college some kids are spenders and some are savers and no matter how much talking showing and giving advice they will not change until they are faces with the consequences son can still go to college he just doesnt have the option of any college he got admitted to his list shrinks due to money issues remember too that d is making up the diff between what the parents saved for them which would be what they are willing to pay or can afford and the actual cost out of her savings yta massive come on dad as much as you are scared about what is happening with your wife double that for your son he is losing his mother the one person who has always always been there for him so instead of coming together and trying to hold both of you up you get mad because he didnt clean his room really how important is his room right this minute give him a break and im sorry but i dont understand the significance of the hair if someone could explain please the minute he told you to delete a friend for any reason is the exact minute you should have broken up with him when are young people going to understand this its irrational its jealousy and its controlling i say let bf pick whoever he wants as best man maybe ask your bf why if sb is such a bad person it would mean so much to him to be there is there more to the relationship between sb and bf that means so much to bf was sb good to him at a time in bfs life when he needed someone was sb a mentor for bf something anything then i would take that into consideration also it just seems odd that sb is pretty much hated by everyone but your bf isnt really seeing that and i wonder why bring back the hat and rename back to hollywood studios we still call it that anyway weve been going since 94 and dont even remember that hand sign i had to look it up to see what it looked like i dont like it then youre going to have to remind her of the agreement to not be in the room while you work maybe include in that convo that her anxiety seems to be getting bad again and she should start getting a handle on it now before it gets bad enough that her school and work will suffer maybe suggest she start looking for a new job now if she loses her job or quits will you be able to afford it dont wait until shes crippled with her anxiety to decide to address it at this point just swap rooms with her she can set up her school stuff in the br this way if she wants to stay in bed all day she can and if she wants to do her schoolwork she can also it seems like shes going to either quit her job or get fired so you might as well give her the bedroom now so when shes home all day you wont be dealing with this every day her motivation is to just hang on to you long enough for you to marry her then shes all set honestly i would be embarrassed if my date showed up to a family thing so woefully underdressed but only if i have already explained what the vibe of these parties are did you explain this to her if you did and she still made no effort that would be a big problem you didnt pressure him into not telling his family but you also only told him when you were 5 months along im sure he knew how could he not but it seems odd that you seemingly confirmed the pregnancy and was im guessing all excited but you didnt share it with him did you share this news with anyone he didnt get to have that surprise reveal from you and share the excitement im curious tho what family traditions of his does he not agree with my dermo told me to just moisturize them like thats gonna help i remember as a kid there used to be a commercial for age spots i think it fades them im thinking of looking for something like that but i cannot remember that exact name tho i had to go back to make sure but you are 16 you have years and years and years ahead of you to find that special person are you expecting to meet someone now that you will stay with forever its not going to happen teen romances very rarely last your teen years are for figuring out all this dating stuff so ask out any girl who seems to be nice cute or have a same interest as you and stop worrying so much desperation is not attractive at all you dont think youre attracted to her so give it one more date dont discount that you two could just be friends if you enjoy her company heres how i look at it as long as my partner is just looking and not engaging with any of these people especially if they dont even live anywhere near us i dont have a problem with it there are so many other people who could tempt my partner right where we live that i really am not going to be jealous or worry about a picture on a screen its basically harmless but thats just my personal feeling pretty sure anyone who reads a newspaper or had any form
