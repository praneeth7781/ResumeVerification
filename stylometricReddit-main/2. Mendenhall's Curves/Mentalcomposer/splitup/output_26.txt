not instigate but defends himself you actually think its ok to punish him more you are the absolute worst give me a break about this one instance ruining his future no college gives a rats azz about one suspension that can very easily be explained away those parents want to press charges let them and counter sue for harassment line up every single instance that your son has been bullied by these two over the years and absolutely obliterate them in court be a better advocate for your son hes needed you in his corner for years and you havent stepped up do it now im so disgusted by you and i dont even know you never heard that ok ill wait for a third to show up somewhere else too i might believe the balloon somehow got blown way off course if there wasnt another one over south america two just seems a little too much of a coincidence i guess it might be possible both balloons got caught up in the same winds or jet stream but eh im not sure that your love language actually is physical touch im thinking that you are just starving for some type of physical touch being that from your description of family you havent ever had much much of it explain to your gf this and let her know its not necessarily sex that youre looking for its more non sexual physical touch and closeness so you can hold hands while sitting next to each other while watching tv you want to rub her arm or leg if youre just lounging around youd like a hug hello or goodbye make sure shes ok with this level of touch tho see if thats what youre really looking for it will satisfy you and take the pressure your gf is feeling off nta her wanting to spend money you dont have is exactly why she is in debt you cleared yours probably by being diligent and prioritizing spending while she seems like shes a bit more carefree financially you two need to discuss finances in brutal detail and figure out if youre compatible on this topic as a couple you both should know whats going on with the finances and recognize that even though it may be an occasion sometimes its just not a good time to spend more she knows about all the expenses you told us about how can she expect to spend another 700 for 1 night i said it before they want the rf to admit to an unconscious bias in the monarchy as well as a plan to eradicate it they want then to admit they didnt do enough to stop bad press of tw even if her actions whatever they were were truthfully reported then they want an apology for the above two things and to admit that the stupid duo were right about everything they claim even tho they havent laid out any concrete proof they wont get any of it because its all delusions of two disturbed people did you pay with a credit card sone cards have some level of insurance check that i totally understand keeping separate but what happens when for instance you have a baby and one of you stay home id imagine it would feel a little weird not having your own acct of money i cant imagine the working spouse not being ok with the sahp having access to their acct but i was curious anybody experience that and what did you do im sorry you are going thru this but nows the time to be mad not sad much easier to forget all about him when youre so mad at what he put you thru so turn your thinking around be grateful you only spent 3 years with him and you have the best thing to come out of your relationship your d it shows just how invested he was that hes going away with his friends instead of trying to get you and his d back be mad about that he has an addiction but tries to blame it in you as if you drove him to the compulsion he has nope be pissed about that too he lied for years get mad about that you are going to have an amazing life and youre gonna do it all by yourself you dont need him so i guess serious humanitarian content highlighting their save the world complex is out great one more thing they wont get right as they know nothing about romance or comedy i dont understand who the victim is my point was trying to say that she has a preconceived notion of what this country is like and the only way he may get her to change that is to show her sounds reasonable to me she may go and hate it but at least she was there to make an informed decision by him cancelling the trip he may have in her mind validated what she has been thinking all this time she can then think to herself see he knows its awful thats why he gave up trying to get me to go i wouldnt say he has to cure her of anything more like getting her to be more open to exploring something out of her comfort zone its been over 10 years maybe just putting up with her for another month wouldnt have been the worst thing a mid range mobile will do the same things as a high end one talk text and data what else would you use it for youre not really gonna be able to do schoolwork on it so go better on the laptop nah i also think it depends on how often you are trying to get the guys together something every weekend thats not gonna happen no mom wants the dad out having fun every weekend while she gets child care duty something like a dart league is a weekly commitment most working people not just dads are probably reluctant to commit to that as its just another thing to add to the list of somewhere i have to be on that night every week instead of just trying to get the guys together invite the couples over with their kids to watch a game play a game or even just to hang out the guys only should be an occasional thing he had the side with the outlet for the alarm clock since he got up first then we had to switch cause the baby cradle only fit on that side of the bed its been that way ever since honestly you sound so desperate to find a partner and that desperation will become apparent to anyone you happen to meet thats not a good thing you need to figure out why you feel that the only way to be happy is with a partner there are always times in everyones life where they are single that in itself should not be as big a deal as you are making it out to be go out with friends join a club pick up a new hobby do something anything just for yourself something that you enjoy stop expecting someone else to make you happy youre so young enjoy this time of your life your person will come at the right time he doesnt want to date you anymore thats the reason but youre gonna hang on waiting for him to come up with some kind of problem or issue he has with you or your relationship and think together you can fix it did you ever think he doesnt want to fix it whatever it is if there even is a thing or theres no fixable reason he outgrew the relationship hes bored youre not what he wants anymore he met another and wants to pursue her but wont cheat on you so he breaks up just move on stop trying to figure it out hes not worth any more aggravation youll make yourself crazy agree totally why would she or anybody really fight for and want to be with someone who doesnt want to be with them ive always had that attitude which is why i get over heart break pretty easily first im hurt and upset then i realize they dont want me so i just move on which is what op should be doing yeah but theres something about seeing a foreign country with a native thats when and how you see all the great local things on offer its just sad she wont experience thatespecially with you her h but you wont convince her if she never goes there best thing would have been to counter whatever she says to whoever with the good things she moans about it and even her aunt telling her about going there didnt convince her she needs to see it to believe it and you just shut that down but also shes pretty awful to disparage your home country so viciously when she hasnt ever been there oh ok then itll be fine you dont have to do anything let it cool id wash it and youre good dont touch it till it cools off if there was nothing in the pan what happened to the pan have you told him you dont feel like you two are connecting since youve had the kids you need to sit him down and lay it all out tell him he has to decide what his priorities are is it you and the kids or his sailing if its his family then he needs to be present not just for the kids but for you as a woman and his wife explain he cannot possibly be giving his all to his job his kids his wife and his hobby something gets pushed to the back burner and you feel like its you and that needs to change not a threat just a statement of fact youre not getting what you need from him and if youre not then why should he even be there its only been a few months and you admit its not 100 so why are you still there this should be the honeymoon phase where everything is great 2 ppl finding out everything about the other sharing stories of their lives their families etc not constant back and forth push and pull please find someone closer to your age in the same stage of life as you thinking about and going thru the same things as you youll find it a much easier happier relationship i didnt go away to uni but dont most people have a roommate or 2 or 3 i would think you start there youre all in the same boat not knowing anyone so you pal around with the few you do know you can expand that into the others on your floor i heard keeping your door open the first week or so is a good way i guess the more extroverted ppl pop their head in to say hi idk then you join a club or a team or volunteer to do something and you meet others that way eventually you find the few that you really click with and they become your closer friends you should have been leary of a guy who seeks you out and professes to have a crush when hes never even met you that screams scam to me you dont say how long youve been together but i would delay moving in yes we all did but youve been with him for 2 years that alone should be enough to be able to say that you trust him if you do not then why on earth would you have moved in with him you have to decide if you trust him or not because he is not going to
