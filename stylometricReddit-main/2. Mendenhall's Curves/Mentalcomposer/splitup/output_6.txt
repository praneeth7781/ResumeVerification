for it no because in order for her kids to experience anything like this she would be forced to volunteer you know like an actual act of service and not get paid for doing it oh the horror youre missing the point here establishing paternity is in your childs best interest if he is the father then you can file for support thru the courts and he will have to pay that benefits your child but if you just want to keep going back and forth with him he will not just hand you money for the baby every month as he has proven split the cost of the test massive massive yta in the event this is actually true which i doubt strongly because no one can be this out of touch what exactly do you and your wife do in regards to your kids your bro has been doing literally everything for your kids between you and your wife you dont even bathe and put the kids to bed how exactly is him doing the kids laundry going to help you out so much seems to me you have an over abundance of free time after work and on the weekends since you dont do anything else you do realize he has a job and a life that doesnt revolve around your kids i really hope he just leaves in the middle of the night id love to see how that next morning goes so he asks if her robe is heavy whatever she said made him instantly uncomfortable maybe it was something like its a small sacrifice for the family crownfamily or service is a huge weight to bare or she really dug in with something like youd know if you stuck around no theres nothing to be embarrassed about this relationship isnt doing it for you anymore youre thinking is that there has to be a big reason to break up with someone but you can break up with someone for any or no reason dont stay with her or anyone you are not 100 invested in its not fair to you or them found this he needs to see a dentist and a doctor its possible that at 18 this ldr satisfied your emotional needs and even just seeing each other intermittently was doing it it may be tho that at 20 it isnt satisfying your needs and you need a partner in closer proximity or youre just really bored with this girl it happens have you tried redirecting the conversation or has your wife do the other men also add to these little anecdotes sex conversations will and have come up occasionally but they are short lived and not every time were with friends thats an odd topic to always come up maybe the other women keep bringing it up because your wife never has anything to share theyre trying to figure her out your issue is your frustration with your sex life not that your wife laughs along with the conversation its been 8 years you must have some idea what is holding your wife back is it something that can even be fixed with therapy if not all the therapy in the world will do no good maybe you as a couple should see an actual sex therapist gf is tah for not deleting the pic as soon as asked especially bc they know op doesnt want them to have those type of pics and op is tah for physically restraining the gf it should not have had to get to that point but gf did challenge op to come get it and they did so it seems as if your parents and his know each other do they speak often i ask because you said you argue with your parents over something and once they see they have no reasonable reason to say no they back down and you get your way i wonder if your parents can explain to his parents why they are ok with this trip and maybe that would help his parents get on board i understand its cultural but you both have the same cultural norms yet your parents are being more tolerable esh just the fact that she didnt delete it as soon as you asked is a problem for me especially that youve already had this conversation today its a picture what is tomorrow boundary break going to be i have to trust that my partner is going to respect me enough to not do things i specifically ask them not to ywbta if you say anything now this family is your uncles wifes no why would these people even be invited to your wedding i can understand being close to an uncle and his wife but her family other then saying hi and bye at occasions your uncle has you can absolutely not invite them plus youre no where close to even getting married so leave it for now i have no judgement because honestly i am not understanding this your friend wanted you to design her wedding invitations were you supposed to draw or write one invite and then shed what make photocopies and send them out were you supposed to hand write all the invites is there a reason she didnt just order invitations i would think he would be invited with a plus 1 and that would be you i wouldnt expect to receive my own invite to weddings of his friends or family you can always ask at least for his brother wont you have to make arrangements with work yes i am in the hopeless phase right now im in the having it all planned out in my head and just need to start phase dont give up just yet youre doing well with breakfast and lunch its just dinner thats messing you up so maybe try telling your wife thats a problem shes going to have to be supportive of what youre trying to do or this wont work you can go out to eat but watch what you order have a salad before your meal chicken or fish and a veg then when your meal comes half everything in the plate only eat that and ask for a take away box thats tomorrows dinner box it up and be done have a coffee after dinner and maybe a few bites of your wifes desert when youre going to eat at home youre going to have to plan for it grill up a bunch of chicken on sunday use that for a day or two add a salad or a veg its ok if you and wife dont eat the same things every night there were plenty of times i cooked for the fam and ate a salad and added a protein i almost always snack on nuts in the evening if i just need something to nosh on i find they satisfy that need with a small portion youre doing so well all day long dont let the one evening meal mess it all up this was your tipping point not the time you spent working while planning for and having a baby and he did nothing but tag along on vacation while you worked was that part of your plan you can have a year off with the baby so he gets one too im gonna guess that he isnt making the same money you did and thats why you need to have such a tight budget but did either of you think maybe he should have been working last year and you could have built up some savings you had a plan but it had some holes in it im afraid this is going to be a very long year for you youve been stuck for several years coincidently youve been with the bf for several years is it possible that part of your dissatisfaction is that you cut your traveling plan short to stay with your bf and youre wanderlust is creeping back in you have been working so its not as if hes been supporting you not everybody is going to be so career driven or always have another goal to reach a lot of people just fall into a career find its pretty ok and stay with it no one can tell you what you should do with your life but you like traveling and have had a passion for it so maybe try to find something in the travel planning sector or work for an airline to get the travel benefits theres also online teaching english which might be better than in class i think theres some kind of test you can take that shows what you have an aptitude for you might try that and see if it gives you any ideas otherwise just look at some job sites and see if anything sparks your interest you might get lucky and find something what has he tried to do to get his weight under control that after 2 years he hasnt been able to find something he can stick with we all know exactly what we have to do to lose weight and control our cravings and a lot of us just cant be bothered but when it becomes an actual medical issue thats when it shocks us into action is he not actually scared about this health issue why not you have to decide if you are ok with a relationship of no sex and a man 10 years older with health issues at 24 it would be a no from me you need to have a serious talk with your bf he wants to move and you dont have you discussed this at all have you told him why you want to stay your job daycare and family support what could he say to counter that you live together but are on and off how does that work when youre off does one of you stay somewhere else or do you just ignore each other on the regular while still living in the same place look this relationship doesnt sound very stable its good that you are conscious of stability for not just you but also your child but buying a house on your own with no discussion will not go over well at all and i could absolutely understand that from his point of view have the tough conversations now nobody wants to have them but you need to figure out what is going on with your relationship because honestly it seems like neither one of you are all that committed to the other once you figure that out a plan going forward will quickly emerge youll either both want to stay together and youll buy a house together or youll go your separate ways and figure out visitation and child support whichever way it goes at least youre both not in limbo thats the only way i like them firm and crunchy or dried is really good too but i like all my fruit like that theres something so gross to bite into a fruit and the juice goes everywhere we only do it for final jeopardy if we need time to decipher the clue during the game we just yell out the answers your art is stunning you are very talented so he keeps saying he wants someone on the same level as him in regards to some very specific things has it occurred to you that he threatens divorce just so you will bend to his every whim do you find yourself changing things you do after he threatens you shouldnt have to put up with a looming threat over your head every single the day from the person who is supposed to love you the most id tell him the next time he brings up divorce is the day i will be
