to ship it he may just keep the money and not ship it anyway dont read too much into it just write him and the keyboard off get yourself a new keyboard youre 2 months in it is totally unrealistic for her to be able to say whether she sees a future with you so early on is the honeymoon phase you and her need time in order to tell if this is a long term thing or not you have to really know the other person warts and all as the saying goes work on your anger issues and see how it goes dont pressure her to commit long term this early it comes off as insecure needy and obsessive she should have some idea that an engagement is in her future so its not out of the ordinary to scroll some websites together and see what she likes and doesnt like you can then ask if she wants to pick out the exact one or if she trusts you enough to pick one on your own we never even discussed rings at all and i love mine i looked at it like he got what he wanted me to have she may want you to do that also just ask her i have to say that in this instance i cant imagine you would even want to see your father for a while due to your own anger at after the way he treated your mom and its not a taking sides thing its more the way he went about leaving her it was unnecessarily cruel of him so youre nta for limiting contact at least for a while until you get your own anger and disappointment under control after things settle down a bit you can reach out under your terms to either see him with the kids or maybe just even have your h at your home while he visits hugs to your mom are you that busy that you cant look online and save some styles you like or just take a trip to a mall and look thru all the jewelry stores there to see what they have decide on a few styles you like go back to the jeweler and pick one theres no need for a middleman try to figure out why you are eating are you bored your life seems pretty active at school and when youre home youre probably bored you need to schedule more activity during the day or you can drink a glass of water every time you reach for food you might just be thirsty and if not it will at least fill you enough that you wont feel the need to eat right at that time also remember you arent burning as many calories at home that you do at school it may be that youre not even eating so many calories youre just not offsetting them with exercise but he expects you to have 23 hours to clean after looking after the house and kids all day and going to school im not even sure what level of clean hes looking for i get making sure the guest bathroom is clean for company but you could dust on monday and by tuesday night its back not as much but its there the kids toys shouldnt be scattered around the house but thats a 5 min task ask him what exactly he thinks will take hours very very slight yta just for phrasing instead of saying normal moms you should have said something more along the lines of you knew we were going clubbing why didnt you have your h watch the baby for a few hours im assuming these were plans made in advance did she ever give a reason why her h couldnt watch the baby im thinking this has less to do with whether she was invited or not and more to do with her mindset she feels shes not back to her pre baby weight and has nothing to wear shes has a mindset that moms dont do clubbing and shes tired so the last thing she wants to do is something active she just hasnt figured out a balance between being a mom and being her own person sometimes new moms get stuck in baby mode shes going to lose all her friends if she expects 7 other women are going to be happy with a social life that fully revolves around baby friendly activities so get more video proof id put cameras in every direction ones that can pick up sound so you have everything recorded you put up with it for a few years you can hang on another 6 months its not you but escalating isnt the way to go about it and you know the second you retaliate the cops will be showing up at your door you dont need that in your life think of it this way is it fair to the girl youre dating now to not be able to give her your all in this relationship no its not you need to tell her whats going on she deserves to be with someone who wants to be with her completely its a new thing so she likely isnt too invested yet and you need to take some time to get over your old relationship without dating im not in this fight but i found this just because i was curious its from 2021 so i have no idea if it is was ever implemented also its from a womans forum so i was surprised by their stance i think theyre asking what have you been given that isnt sex because in a committed relationship sex will be happening its just worded oddly it cant be off the table and also given stay home make a nice dinner both agree to dress up for dinner something your so really likes that you wouldnt normally be comfortable going out in him too tho something you like to see him not thats not the usual open a bottle of wine and spend the night connecting as a couple ah see i learned something new thanks for the diff between the two ah learned something new today thanks for the distinction excellent point this is a key distinction i perceive antisocial with being more aggressive maybe at or when meeting new people but someone who is or shy or introverted is just more uncomfortable amongst new people but willing to go out of their comfort zone to make new connections big diff in advice to be given they wont let you bring them on when you board and they will take them from you when you reboard and store them from you until the end of the cruise if you buy them in port so basically no but i heard if youre cruising europe you can bring alcohol on when boarding and also from ports that they will let you keep but you should confirm that get a library card and use their app to borrow ebooks for your kindle this way youre not paying for books you might not like how about reading the book of a movie you enjoyed theres usually a lot more nuance in the book that you cant get from the movie and you already know you like the story that might make you more willing to set aside time to read no its fine but do you understand the point i was trying to explain trying to explain why trans ppl get more hate than just lgbq people what youre missing is the baker wouldnt make a cake for the lesbian couple because he was religious and said it goes against his religious and moral convictions idk anything about the gender one tho but im guessing probably the same reason but thats a guess its not a matter of not agreeingwith lgbtq at this point we all should know that there are people who have diff sexualities but trans ppl arent as simple as a diff sexuality they are in a whole other place having more to do with gender than sexuality so i think that confuses people who dont understand how that can be so its as if they dont understand it it cant be true in a sense adding to that is young and really young kids claiming to be trans and all the medical treatments they are being given at such young ages doesnt sit well with a lot of people theres a feeling that its too much too soon is it right or wrong i have no idea then add in all the controversy of what bathroom to use sports competition moral issues like the baker and other businesses situation and it just becomes an us vs them fight and this is what were seeing now i liked it im not a huge fan i knew some of the songs i thought it was simple but at least for the most part it focused on her just doing what she was hired to do sing her songs i liked the floating platforms and the dancers around are were really good but i also dont like when theres so much else going on that the main act kind of gets lost in the shuffle when theres too much going on all at once sometimes the camera is one place and other things are going on in other places that way you dont really see the whole production the problem i see is that youve only been with your bf a few months you admit yourself that you do not know him well enough or know enough about him that you need to know and this is why you never should have met his kids if you start to know the things you need to and do not like what you learn and leave those kids will be sad and confused but im also confused about something is he a single dad because he seems to have his kids every day with an hour to spare to see you where is the kids mom was this how it was when you first met why cant you spend the evenings at his house and spend time with him after his kids go to sleep why would you even ever entertain the thought of sleeping with someone elses boyfriend this is just plain wrong you are old enough to know that this is the cardinal rule nobody should have to tell you this stop hanging out with him alone and getting drunk no good will ever come from this he may sleep with you but hes going back to his gf thats a bit harder to fix because its an issue for you but to him its not really an issue can you maybe schedule a few days a week i know it sounds so stupid to have to schedule your sex life but at least both of you are on the same page and sometimes it works just by the anticipation also keep in mind would you rather have sex for the sake of having it or would you rather have really good sex sometimes quality over quantity also maybe dont put too much pressure on him start with 2 times a week and work up to 3 or however many works but you should start to figure out if you can be in this relationship more long term youve already spent 7 years and its not easy to leave when theres so much good but you dont want it to get to a point where your resentment takes over either if its a matter of frequency then he doesnt see it as a problem because he thinks his sex drive is perfectly ok and it is its just that yours and his do not match if its more a
