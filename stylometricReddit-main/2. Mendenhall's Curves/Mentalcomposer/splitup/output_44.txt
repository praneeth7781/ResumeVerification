in her will you have to do what is best for you and this is not what you want anymore why would you put what he wants above what you want first thing find a new job its ridiculous that your job is threatened just because you work for his relative get that straightened out first then work on an apt in the meantime save as much money as you can as far as being heartbroken will you really be youre in an admittedly not healthy relationship its quite possible that you will feel relief as opposed to heartbreak will you miss him or will you miss the routine that you have been in those are two very diff things ultimately you will be fine just the fact that you recognize that you two are not compatible is huge i would think most people would just keep going along to get along you know what you have to do just get it started life is too short to be stuck with someone just because nta for not wanting to change your schedule but you really should have pointed out that you were hired for 25 travel and as of now it has been 100 travel if i was you i would call into the person that hired me and find out what the deal is if they want you to permanently work in the far place which it seems they do then you have to decide if this is a job you want to keep nta for being livid about him quitting before having a new job but youre having another baby who is going to take care of this baby for the first one he did and you went to work maybe hes thinking it would be the same way but of course he should be working up until the baby is born to have a bit of a money cushion and have you thought about how youre going to handle 2 kids on your own you will still have day care needs and someone to watch the other child before and after school and what do you do if you get deployed again can you count on him to stay in your area after you send him packing or is he gonna run home and then youre literally in your own you guys need to talk about all of this your job his job your budget child care dont just go scorched earth until you have had this conversation oh gosh didnt even realize that caught ever other typo i think except for the one that made a funny difference im not sure if this is sarcastic or not and idk about magical rights but there are provisions for parents to give medical decision authorization to another person for either a limited time period or until the parent can be contacted if i take my childs friend with us on vacation their parents gives me the authorization to approve medical care if something were to happen to them while on vacation or until the parent can be contacted service members do the same thing if they are going to deployed or otherwise out of contact single people may do it if they have no family and are having a risky surgery better to designate someone who knows your wishes than leave it to an anonymous medical team i think he has shown you enough of what he is really like im not convinced his drinking was to numb the pain of hurting anyone that would mean he actually had any empathy which he seems to be lacking toward you he was the one who blew up his life and family and i wonder why he did that since that was left out you just happened to be there so he wasnt alone anyone who would treat you bad while your father is right there helping you move out is absolutely not the person i would ever give another chance to hes obviously some years older than you let him go there are more stable less baggage guys closer to your age that you can build a solid life with why are you even trying with this one this is a def case of parents know best nta but your friend sure is she doesnt have to give you guardianship but she needs to sign something that says you have all right to make magical decisions for the baby if when she cannot be contacted id probably get it notarized while im at it so theres that now as far as holding her hostage oh no shes got that backwards lets look at this her parents want nothing to do with her when she gets pregnant then they say yeah come back into the fold but without the baby so your friend is just having it all isnt she she gets to dump yes i say dump because thats exactly what shes doing the baby on you whenever she feels like going home and then when shes good and ready to come back she resumes care of her child you are a saint for agreeing to any of this she needs to decide is she a mother to the child who she decided to keep full well knowing how her parents would react or is she going to pretend he doesnt exist to make her parents happy this baby isnt going to disappear you will be watching this boy for years to come because if her parents dont accept him now what makes you think that will ever change are you ok with that honestly you guys were young when you got together its possible this has just run its course he might realize he misses you or he might enjoy being free of commitment and enjoy being single for the first time in his adult life i suggest you also enjoy being single and free hang out with friends find ways to be ok with being single you shouldnt be of a mindset that this is the only guy for you most of us have felt that way but its rarely true spend less than you make cut out any expenses you dont absolutely need and invest the leftover put it in a mutual fund not individual stocks it may seem like such a small amount to invest but give it time once you start to see even a small increase in value it will spur you to keep at it once you are comfortable with the amount you can put away each month have that amount auto deposited each month from your paycheck and you wont even miss it it may be a slow journey but it will be worth it girl seriously you are a fool love is blind maybe but deaf dumb and stupid no you moved to be with an absolute loser who cant support himself never mind helping to support a kid what is it about him that you cant see he is using you i give him credit for being there for the child if hes the only dad the child ever knew but at the same time hes not really is he youre the one supporting him and the child the exs finances have absolutely nothing to do with anything these two will figure out what they need to do about the child without any help from you stop being their atm and if they dont thats their problem have you ever figured out how much he is really contributing to the household you two share wake up and get out heres an article showing their mortgage payment according to this their mortgage is 95 million with a monthly payment of 40000 youre still in school so there is nothing wrong with living home why cant she come over and hang out in your room or you can go to hers you can watch movies and cuddle no need to always be going out somewhere im sure she is well aware of why you live at home and why you dont have unlimited money and she still wants to hang out so dont stress so much could be 2 reasons someone on govt assistance might be easier to take advantage of since donors are paid or the payments to a donor may make them ineligible to continue on assistance its only been a few months and even though you talk a lot its hard to really get to know a person that way dont you feel that there are just some things that dont translate well over the phone how does a person act in social settings how do they talk to their family friends and even their child are they messy or neat do they have any odd quirks that def would not mesh with your life and more importantly will they and their child or you and your child get along with both other people its not enough that you like her kid so far but what if she resents moving and leaving everything she knows and comes to resent you or your son what if your son resents having strangers move in my advice keep doing what youre doing for a few more months then bring your son to meet them then talk to your son and have an honest conversation with him and she should have one with her kid how do they feel if theyre ok so far have them come to you and have the same convo again im guessing both kids are relatively young so it is either going to be easier cause they arent as aware or harder cause to the kids you and her are their while world and they wont take well with sharing their parent just some things to think about but please please do not upheave either child unless everyone especially the kids are ok with it put your kids feelings before your own did you really not realize that marrying someone after 2 weeks wasnt going to work seriously if you dont mind answering id love to know what was going thru your head at the time as it seems a lot of military have these quick marriages did no one try to talk you out if it so its ok that your d is getting sloppy two hundred seconds because he can take care of her and give you grand babies you realize a 35 yo man who is still able to attract a 19 yo has been around the block more times than you could probably count but your oh so precious s is so special that he cant saddle himself with a woman who may have had previous lovers what if she can provvide for him you do realize she can still have babies dont you hypocritical much i found this its a free text crisis service they are trained professionals maybe try them check them out go to someone at your school guidance counselor teacher there is usually someone in every school who is there for the students if that fails walk into a hospital and tell them you need to talk to a mental health worker best of luck to you i dont know about your scenario but if a parent was willing to do that why dont they just add your car onto their policy and you pay whatever the increase would be to your parents when the bill comes in it might be cheaper that way nta but maybe she has some weird aversion to doing the dishes like everyone has their one household thing that they hate doing ask her then you can swap out a different chore that she can do instead of the dishes you do dishes and she does one that you currently do i do wonder tho why you even while working full time were doing
