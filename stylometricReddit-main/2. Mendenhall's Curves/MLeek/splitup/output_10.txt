my job to sort out his parenting and custody issues with his ex thats insane he was being a shitty parent and trying to coerce you into doing the job for him this terrible attitude towards responsibility and work likely his assumptions about womens work was going to continue if he had won custody youd have basically been single parenting that infant can all but promise it breaking up over his lack of responsibility and blameshifting was completely wise and not at all petty then start with your obygn or a standard therapist and ask for a referral if youre serious about these concerns address them seriously addressing them seriously is not going to happen on reddit 33 isnt an older father those studies usually begin at 35 to 40 you should be talking to a doctor not google not reddit and not a sociopath i think trying to round your hall pass up into polyamoury before speaking to your wife is toxic as fuck swinging is completely and utterly different from poly most swingers will be the very first to tell you that and makes me perfectly comfortable expecting better from this man hes not a novice he should have the basics down so trying to build a new relationship outside of the marriage for weeks without speaking to his wife thats taking it past poor communication about boundaries into a realm id consider manipulative and coercive i say this as a practicing enm person who has seen a lot of wellintentioned people mess it up this is not a mess up i could assume was wellintentioned experience has taught me that people who really want to take good care of all their partners and relationships arent this stupid this mess up would mean both of these people are outta my life forever they are not safe or reliable im not a fan of keeping such an open mind that ones brain falls right out the best ill give this man he was very conveniently confused and when someones confusion is that convenient to them and what they want for themselves trust is severely damaged if i heard hall pass id assume it was a onetime hook up thing so yeah hit it and quit it and i probably wouldnt want to participate in that sounds dicey and not what id want in an enm encounter but i really dont know what a hall pass was in this marriage and neither does op and apparently neither did these two thats kind of the whole problem and its not ops problem so this chad was a sorta awkward and totally ageappropriate teenage boyfriend right no one dates someone 20 years younger then them by accident or because they are looking for a relationship with and equal rooted in mutual respect warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info you dont seem to be open to advice its reasonable for your gf to not want to marry you and live with your mom its reasonable for her not to want to marry someone who is planning on financially supporting his mother for the rest of her life it is strange that you find this surprising and its only coming up now this isnt insecure a bit sexist maybe but not insecure this is a reasonable boundary you should halt all plans and probably break up if you plan on financially supporting or living with your mother for the rest of her life outside of very conservative upbringings very few women are going to sign up to marry you under those terms no absolutely not you are not required to make yourself of service to this messy toxic man or his wife you are completely correct this is not yours to fix why are you still in contact with either of them there is nothing for you to gain from that this is not your circus not your monkeys if he violated their relationship agreement that is the two of them to sort out it has nothing to do with you if you feel like you want to do her this huge emotional service and massive favour invite her to contact you via email with her questions and you stick to factual responses ie not about what you felt but about timelines and what information you received when but even that i would not do if these two are at war with one another there is no good outcome for you if you go wandering out in the middle of the battlefield id advise you to end contact entirely with both of them i mean this with respect and compassion but you need to go touch grass youre giving over way too much of yourself to this and twisting this into stories just to get down on yourself stop trying to place those highschool pickme dramas into this thats not whats going on here your hurt feelings over this make sense for a few minutes but this is all a bit much dont wallow dont fixate she wasnt into you she probably wasnt into you for something causal either let it go a woman who plans to have somewhere to be after the date doesnt plan to have sex with you be sure this all adds up to not that into you honestly women in their 40s are well aware of that stigma and they will tell you if they are into something casual with you if she did not odd are very good she was not you need to relax and let them know which dishes you need to access and that you are not able to reach x y and z in the position they were moved too ask they be moved back or that you take a look together youll be fine its fine to ask for things you use frequently to be stored at a height you can access safely you can feel how you feel but she didnt do anything wrong you know this is about your insecurities and instead of taking it so personally you should be taking this as clarity she was correct you were not compatible as dating partners you were not looking for the same thing if you really want to be her friend then you can mention to her that he considers himself redpilled and suggest she google what that means before she wastes too much energy but you also dont have to be friends if youre not happy being her friend which may involve being aware or even seeing her connect with someone else you dont trust him dont fuck someone you dont trust its not complicated youre not as compatible as you had previously thought you were just end it two hours on the phone is a long time for adults with full lives if youre doing that several times a week im not surprised shes not on the whole time and that its not that satisfying ldrs are tough but you need to focus on the kinds of connection and length that fuels that relationship not the kind that just checks the box of we talked today you mean your exboyfriend right this is not rocky this is risky this is not just disrespectful behaviour its dangerous this is not about him getting off even this is about him taking sexual pleasure in deceit and violation of you and of other women this isnt about you or your body this is about the fact he likes lying and ripping women down generally this is what he does this is who he is that is what you can put your trust in you can trust 100 that this guy likes to shame insult and lie so he will do that the quicker you get away from him the quicker you can start to heal this is sexual assault hes dangerous he is going to lose control again because he feels entitled to use your body this way without your consent take your bags leave never come back unless you want to end up having a baby with your rapist because staying in this relationship will almost certainly lead you to being bound to him forever by the baby you have after he rapes you no dude quit it take that venting to the therapist your ex was an abusive monster no one is debating that or ignoring the impact it had on you and your family but that actually isnt the issue today the issue today is your current partner isnt behaving up to snuff in a home with your children fulltime and isnt prepared to do any of the work to improve the situation and your brillant plan appears to be treating her like a convenient income for the next four years or so and then see how you two feel about each other shell probably hate you by then if someone treated you like nothing but a financial crutch tell me you wouldnt get your kids and yourself the mental health support you can and seriously reconsider your ability to remain in the district without remaining in this relationship im not saying you have to leave but you and your partner both need to realize that is reality and a possibility that is the only way to untrap yourselves it to be willing to seriously contemplate life apart and then either choose to do the work to stay together or not dude just no this isnt ethicalnonmonogamy or openness this is just drama and you didnt even want opennesses to begin with at best shes confused and not emotionally available for a serious relationship at worst she lacks selfawareness and basic consideration to the point that makes her manipulative or even malicious just no your amazing partner didnt want you to fulltime parent your own kids and now you cant leave a relationship youre all miserable in because you feel perhaps correctly that you cannot afford to pretty obvious why no one feels secure or particuarly loved in this situation get your kids and yourself the mental health support you can and seriously reconsider your ability to remain in the district without remaining in this relationship part of fully acknowledging that what you did was wrong is accepting the consequences the consequences are that you are not welcome you dont always get another chance it doesnt matter if the other person is shitty or if you think you deserve it it doesnt always happen and frankly do you really want it too these people are insane and the brought out the worst possible behaviour in you a sane person would stay the fuck away from them and not try to seek their approval your bf needs to figure out how he balances his time it feels complicated but its actually not any more practically complicated than that accept have some grace ask for the time you need and respect that he still values some time with these friends hopefully he can recognize that the toxicity at this point is coming from only onedirection not you who has apologized and will now accept the situation with grace but his socalled friends who are apparently totally cool with assault and insults and regularly drink to excess this all rather gross for a bunch of 30yearolds any woman who doesnt chase you after shes slept with you is a woman who belongs to the streets tell me youre a shitty lay without telling me youre a shitty lay i agree there isnt we dont know and i wouldnt risk it not this one not if my instincts were what ops appears to be you really seem genuinely confused by this but its okay to demand more from a partner than just them not being abusive you dont have to stay with someone just because they dont
