pronouns if he decides they were being political or had a chip on their shoulder about it the ontario college of psychologists is positioned to discipline him and remove his license not because of his transphobia but because of his shameless trolling grandiosity attentionbaiting and pontificating on subjects way outside of his areas of competence if you want to behave like joe rogen you dont get to keep your license as a clinician and no official position on homosexuality is laughable attempt at a defence did you really type that with a straight face if you did you may want to read up on his official positions on climate change thats funnier and makes it all the more concerning if paul is following him unironically id been skeptical of this reading of him until the reunion he didnt mean nurturing he absolutely meant submissive and servile and he didnt tell her because the first rule of these philosophies is that you never tell a woman plainly what you actually think of her or her entire gender i dont like micah very much but i do believe she sincerely grew during this experience and she needed too she seemed far younger than her actual 27 years but her real crime with paul seems to be she wasnt quite malleable enough no man what she knows is she can do what she wants and then punish you for a while if you dare to point out shes being shitty that what she knows to expect if you dont want to date someone who behaves this way then you have to not date someone who behaves this way why on earth would you want to marry this woman she understands just fine she understands she can bully and torture you into even considering this absurdity and thats exactly the dynamic you want to maintain her looking ridiculous you looking bored keep the rest of this to yourself thats precisely my point this emotional reaction is as much as a threat to you if not more than her behaviour and this you can control her behaviour you cannot if you accept her premise that this is a war others will play along and enjoy the show immensely and youre far more likely to loose some battles along the way i didnt mean give her grace for her own sake i meant manage yourself because the thoughts you allow to fester will leak out and could impact the outcome here just bring a bit of grace to the situation even if she an awful paranoid little drama llama she had the misfortune to fall in with an abuser who would take advantage of those qualities to keep this even more toxic and dangerous her than they might otherwise be we dont have to like a person or agree with their choices to recognize they are also being harmed dont let her off the hook for her actions but keep your own thoughts free of malice yeah thats the shit you have to not give into the temptation to tell your coworkers dont say anything that would contribute to the narrative besides i am not surprised he has lied about me i really just want nothing to do with him dont get put on the defensive and dont become part of the story dont give them more to talk about or compare notes over the story in the workplace cannot be about your relationship from 15 years ago the story needs to be sandrine is really weird and running her mouth and op is just shrugging and saying not surprised but not interested besides documenting what youre hearing and how this impacting you in the workplace there is nothing to do a big reaction from you only validates their private little drama being disinterested and bored by her behaviour is what others will see its far better for you if you can ride this out until her behaviour is unpleasant for others nothing you keep doing nothing you let sandrine have her space and you speak to your boss if her avoidance is impacting your work shes frightened of him of the stories shes told been told its really not about you but entirely about his fictions if anyone asks you that is what you say it was a long time ago but if he is still anything like the man i knew im not surprised he has her frightened he was very manipulative in the past i want nothing to do with him and i am happy for sandrine to maintain whatever boundary she needs as long as we can work together cordially i know its hard to keep your cool but its your only shield disinterest is your best defence if someone asks you express some slight pity but understanding and reiterate i am not involved i will not get involved i am happy not speaking about him or to him i want no contact with him and sandrine and i can have civil workplace contact and nothing else sadie may have attentionseeking behaviours but this wasnt an example of one this was an example of you having some others issues with sadie and looking rather hard for a reason to confront her about her reasonable choice if you dont like your friends dont be friends if you like your friends stop micromanaging them and accusing them of shit if you want to fix this apologize for sticking your nose in shit that is absolutely none of your business without making excuses or trying to justify yourself she may still not want to be your friend anymore i wouldnt want to be friends with you if you were gonna make accusations over changing my top in a car one of the most common fantasies out there for heterosexual women this is just entirely personal reflection but i found that my ravishment and consensual nonconsent fantasies diminished a great deal as i became more comfortable expressing my own sexual desires for me they were a way to not be blamed not to be responsible for what i wanted i felt like i didnt have many healthy ways that i was allowed to say i like sex i am a woman with a higher libido and all the messages i got from most of my life where that i needed to be sort of a passive recipient lots of men and women responded negatively if i took on the role of pursuer or if i was really direct about what i wanted took me a long time and my life to unpack that i still enjoy that sort of play but its a much smaller part of the mix for me now not a danger flag but certainly a sign of incompatibility and disrespect his reaction is far far more weird than keeping a childhood toy some other things women consent to do when it benefits them load trucks operate cash resisters design buildings write code operate on brains women are so weird s his fees fees i mean hes super logical and not irrationally emotional like those females so there must be something factual behind his intense feelings right s it seems likely that your grandfather might have some age related difficulties i would recommend that you set a consistent time that you speak to your grandfather pick some thing that would work in your schedule and then stick to it religiously maybe early mornings would be great if hes an early riser as my great aunt got older i spoke to her for 20 minutes early in the morning on wednesdays and then spoke to her a little bit longer on sunday evenings other than that i screened her calls she was bored and confused often and i felt for her we were both most comfortable with really clear expectations about when i would contact her youre describing pretty normal dating for most normal people yes it absolutely does suck yes youre going to have a lot more rejection then dates you dont know whats going on in someone elses life and in the sorts of situation you never will you need to make sure that you filled your life with some other joys as well youre putting way too much into these initial connections it can be a tough roller coaster to ride but you got a level of the emotional floor a bit i mean this isnt working youre on again off again for a year you know this isnt working and shes was right she might also be petty and drama seeking but shes right telling you take a job you wanted to take and move for is quite different than you telling her what she needs in a relationship stop having stupid side fights this is over it wasnt working youre leaving have some damn graciousness if were nitpicking a 27 year old is not a girl if youre in an ldr with no immediate plans to be movelive together with if is appropriate for any plan that isnt the confirmed be honest and direct with her about your intentions clarity is important and scary to say things with certainty in these cases if shes hedging make is clear you mean to take these next steps the vast majority of photographers are going to have periods in their life of this sort of work if not make their whole career on it naked women sell shit if you dont trust his character in a room with a naked professional dont date him if he cannot address your discomfort without immediately talking about permission and artistic freedom dont date him he should be addressing your fears by talking about professionalism respect boundaries and goals were talking about collaborating with other people this isnt aboutma freedum or ma arts this is about being a good collaborator and creator with purpose youre not shitty to tell him youre uncomfortable hes handling this totally reasonable conversation in a super immature way this i think this is where youre messing up for me casual still includes a fair bit of friendship not necessarily dating or romantic activities but i definitely want you actually know youre person i want to talk to and spend a few hours with a drink and a fuck is a hook up maybe ongoing hook ups but a step down from casual in my book the word youre looking for a hook up yes it matters its gonna matter especially if your life stages diverge that doesnt mean it wont work out or that hes doing anything terribly wrong but dont be naive and pretend the gap doesnt exist dont be willfully blind youre not ageless thats a justification and a delusion and they always say youre really mature the 40 year olds who rape 12 year old say that the power dynamics fester because they are not immediately obvious to the younger person and the elder person enjoys them being mature for your age is totally different from being a compatible peer with someone who is older this is something youre going to have to keep eyes open to for several years in this relationship there is no dodging it its a challenge and a risk that exists here its been 24 hours the window is closing fast in my opinion what you really need to do is stop having sex and figure out how to manage your anxiety andor prevent condom breakage plan b is a plan b for some women it doesnt have much of an impact for others it is positively miserable thats before we get to the expense while you should be open with her about your anxiety and concerns that is a pretty big ask of her just because something felt off if this is where youre at mentally you shouldnt be having sex until you have a better shared contraception plan and a personal
