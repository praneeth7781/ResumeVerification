a boyfriend should be considered cheating so naturally i would assume that the same should apply to him if none of the other reasons cut it for you this one obviously should he shamed you and verbally abused you for far far less than he deliberately did behind your back and then he lied about it in the lamest possible way he thinks youre a moron whether or not you or i or he thinks this is cheating doesnt even matter it doesnt have to be cheating to be totally unacceptable dont get pulled into that argument with anyone this is all a very dangerous double standard from a man who is giving every signal he is willing to abuse you you dont owe him a conversation this isnt a debate this is him getting dumped for being dishonest and a dangerous partner keep yourself safe end it quickly and cleanly get rid of this man you are not completely innocent here because you violated the agreement when ella said she had caught feelings your responsibility was to say i understand but since that has happened i am no longer comfortable continuing with the sexual relationship youre not a monster but dont get attached is a hope its an intention its not a thing that can be promised it is not a boundary the boundary is if one of us catches feels we stop fucking so you had the exact same responsibility as ella had to end it when that happened i would actually say you had the greater responsibility at that point since she had just told you that her motivations and judgements were clouded by her emotions and her attachment to you continuing to have sex with her at that point was selfish and naive your actions were not reflecting the agreement you said you wanted when you continued to meet up and have sex with ella after that conversation youre not a villain but you did fuck it up you had a clear line with ella at which all sexual connection should have ended and you both blew right past that line maybe not everything ella thinks of you now is reasonable but it was not kind you should have done better you need to just walk away he may be a lovely partner in some ways but he is absolutely not capable of offering you a relationship you should feel at all secure in and hes been dishonest from the beginning trying to manipulate you into accepting something he knew was a rather lousy offer this isnt a situation where everything is great except this this is him this is a guy who dove into dating while still fullon living with his ex gave totally false timelines introduced his kids way too early and has not been prioritizing his separation or creating a healthy home life for his kids this may be a good guy making shit choices but more likely its a rather shitty guy making rather shitty choices breaks are bullshit they are slowmotion breakups that just prolong the drama its time to be broken up tell him hes welcome to call you if he gets his act together and starts to actually live separately from his ex and has the time to date and be a coparent but dont hold your breath far more likely hell move on to another young thing he can manipulate into accepting this shitty situation for a few months its a neutral term if you value your friends as friends what was their argument for misogyny that men didnt actually want her friendship so calling them that was offensive or a mislabel i think there can be a lot toxicity in fwbs situations because people forget to be friendly and end up viewing the other more like an amateur sex worker instead of buddy you share a fun activity with or they define down what would be objectively called casually dating into a fwbs situation but in my experience those issues are also pretty gender neutral men and woman both those mistakes hed never be so beta as to allow something like over a decade of data and welldocumented trends to penetrate his skull not when he saw with his own two eyes how the paid server smiled demurely at him not merely performing her job in the expected style but clearly begging for the leadership and protection of a man there are cultural norms there are affects there is no more truth in his racist delusions about what those norms actually represent in individual human relationships then there is truth is his understanding of human biology ironically he did figure out anal tho and with a healthy dose of idiots not being able to tell the difference between customer service and women being super into them warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info this guy is telling you stories stories about how he think its permissible to treat others believe him he will turn around one of these days and declare you are just like all the others and he will decide probably without telling you that he can treat you like the others then he will tell you youre not entitled to be hurt or angry with him because he warned you lots of people score a bit higher in sociopathic tendencies and recognize that means they need to work a little bit harder to empathize or to keep the ego in check people who struggle with this are pretty safe they compensate and focus on what healthy relationships really take people who say well this is just how i am and now you know fair warning are not you dont compromise you trust him so trust him to select his own friends and not hook up with strangers if you think he can be persuaded to cheat then you dont trust him and shouldnt date him hes a 20 year old adult not an 8 eight year old on the playground being bullied into eating dirt or some shit if he doesnt want to cheat he wont emasculated is one of those toxic traps where the more you help him the more blame youll catch continue to be realistic most entry level jobs are easier to get when youre physically present there is little reason for someone to want to employ an 18 year old who cant start tomorrow thats usually the appeal of teenage employees besides that just listen agree that it does suck and it is disappointing because it is that what it is not is a reflection on him as a man reminder him this has nothing to do with his gender and even less to do with yours hes a person not a potential provider she didnt want to talk to a group of people who had said nasty things about her this is not rocket science youre being a weirdo who is making it all about sex when its about not talking to mean people who have insulted or shamed you previously if she has an ex who is a basically decent person or perfectly reasonable to not be nervous about him but to be nervous and want to avoid a group of bullies what went down with her made sense your reaction was intense and really strange you need to figure out what was going on inside your own head that led to this her explanations for what went on in her head pass the sniff test just fine its honestly terrifying where americans even ones who might consider themselves democrats think the centre is i remember back in the day trying to explain to a few american friends that obamas policies were not left of centre in any other established democracy very centrist even sometimes right of centre which was a large part of his global popularity but the far right nutters just saw a black man lost their shit completely and now here we all are shes not your problem its not her job to fix the issues in your relationship shes not your ally and youre not trying to help her out youre desperately trying to manipulate her into helping you out because you and your bf cannot find an agreement that works your problem is that you are choosing to stay in a relationship with someone you believe is cheating on you stop pretending to be worried about her wellbeing get a damn clue and realize youre the poor girl involved in this situation who isnt behaving in healthy ways or with any selfrespect if you cannot resolved this by speaking with him then it cannot be resolved stick to the no this was a rather transparent move on her part to force a meet with the children to justify her curiosity about you you and your bf have not decided to make a relationship with the children part of this relationship yet continue to not include the children in your plans when you do decide you are both ready for that step then you and she may need to meet briefly while custody is exchanged that is sufficient she gets to shake your hand not break bread with you whats best for the children is you declining as much as possible to play her game or become more a character in her little drama hes 22 he is not a boy he doesnt need to be handled hes not a toddler going through a phase where he find poop hilarious it is completely realistic to expect a 22 year old to be honest about their own interest in and opinions on porn use while in a relationship and to keep a promise if they make it men are people not dumb animals who cannot help themselves he doesnt agree with you about porn he never has he thinks its acceptable in a relationship if you want a relationship with someone who doesnt watch porn you need to date someone else if you want to stay with him youre going to have to find a way to deal with this as a legitimate and transparent disagreement instead of a hard boundary this man is too old to not understand that not everyone has a close or meaningful relationships with their parents and adult siblings and five months is quick for this kind of pressure and judgment what is weird is that he is not making the effort to listen to you and i understand who is actually important in your life as sad as it is if she needs to break up over this youd be wise to just accept that and wish her well she withheld information that was clearly relevant to her about her virginity and sexual experience for five years youre not the asshole she needs do the work herself to move past this if she is not willing or able to do that then you need to have the strength to face the end i wouldnt date this man hes telling stories about money mean untrue stories about you because of his choices about his money its one thing to be bad at budgeting but telling mean stories that its someone elses fault that youre spending what youre spending is a serious character flaw and one that will likely impact other areas of his life too itll be your fault he doesnt have enough free time your fault hes gaining weight your fault the house is cluttered with things your fault the grocery bill is too high be very very wary of signing up for a lifetime with someone who externalizes blame like this his gfwife will always be the most conveniently located external person to take the blame for his actions romantic intimacy not requiring a big budget is not your real core problem
