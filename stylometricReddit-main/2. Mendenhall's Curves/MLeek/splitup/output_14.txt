another she knows youre overinvesting so shes keeping you on an information diet about her personal life she is telling you to either get a grip and respect her boundaries or opt out your expectations for a level of commitment from a woman you havent even met are extremely unrealistic if this connection is unhealthy for you or making you unhappy you need to leave it its not all her fault that you wont do the right thing for you it sounds like a 30yearold man who is mooching off his stepdad is also now taking advantage of your vulnerability to get yet more financial and practical support for himself it sounds like a 30yearold man who is mooching off his stepdad is also now taking advantage of your vulnerability to get yet more financial and practical support for himself living environment to another slightly less toxic and unsafe living environment but youre still not where you need to be your reaction to this was pretty intense for someone who says shes okay with porn and understands this isnt cheating the obvious problem here is that either he lied or he is so unaware of his own actions and motivations that he couldnt provide an answer for why he screenshots these i have no issues with porn but i find it immature and boundarybusting when people repurpose social media images as if they are porn those women arent producing those images for that reason or consenting plenty of women out there are there is no reason for it unless you enjoy the violation of women who are not consenting to be porn starts plus its just childish in my opinion what he did was probably within normal but lots of normal things are shitty and id be concerned by his lack of honesty andor selfawareness about this habit dude you came for advice youve been given it im not getting into what is the correct amount to charge them because you have completely missed the window to discuss payment you claim to full accept that fact but youre still trying to wiggle outta it the fact that february was within the initial agreement is why that was the appropriate window were not brokers for room rentals in your area were talking about the relationship you can ask for whatever amount you feel youre entitled to but youre likely to damage the relationship thats the advice its not about the dollar value you want to assign still gonna go with no but also who the fuck cares if it does seriously how is this beneficial to you to give your mental energy too youve already done the only thing you can do short of ending the friendship entirely learn to let go finding the baby voice unpleasant is a totally different opinion to express than asking her to silence or stop her affectionate text messages one is about style the other is about substance by all means give her notes on the style honestly the baby voice thing has just never been cute for me ive always found it a bit offputting but i wouldnt suggest you in the early days tell her that she should hold back on expressing her desire to be with you you dont seem to be describing bombarding here youre describing one text where she tells you she cares for you and misses you are you really that special that much a unique niche of an employment path really because i have a super niche path and career and i can still think of three people a few years younger than me who have made very very similar steps it never occurred to me to consider they were copying me we have similar goals and skill sets they are my professional colleagues not my mimics you are already doing the only thing you can do if this annoys you keeping the information you give him to a minimum besides that id advise you to get over yourself there is nothing to deal with except to decide if youre willing to put a positive word in when asked or not youre going to damage this relationship if you try to ask for payment for a gift youve already given to someone you say you basically consider a family member its as simple as that there is no magical way to demand payment now that wouldnt be hurtful they probably would accommodate you but it probably would damage the relationship because you handled the communication so poorly the time to revisit the could chuck us some money conversation from a place of respect was like february you missed your window by a mile i offered to pay for storage unit but the argument was why buy stuff if youre just going to store it but i like having rare sets to rebuild on occasion right so this is a thing to revisit as you take a deeper dive in your shared financial life but while doing so you need to recognize that while collecting or hoarding may serve a positive emotional need for you it may just as legitimately cause anxiety and distress in her to see more things piling up those are very real feelings you both have to be willing to acknowledge and address stop seeing this as a money problem and start seeing this as a feelings problem your gf doesnt feel secure with your shared saving plansgoals that is a problem worthy of addressing her feelings and opinions on that are fundamentally valid and worthy of your attention and time if you want to marry her you either need to increase those goalsplans or by help her gain more understanding of them so she can feel confident in the shared choices there are some financial advisors who specialize in helping couples have these conversations and building the emotional aspects of financial literacy the money isnt the core problem here the problem is that the money brings forward very different feelings in you both in order to build a life where she feels secure and you feel trusted and happy you need to come together to acknowledge and manage those feelings secondly and i could be wrong here but perhaps recognize that both of your nerdy hobbies dont just take up money they take up space collecting isnt just about money its about space and lifestyle she may genuinely dislike these hobbies but you still need to be reasonable enough to realize that a lego collection impacts her in ways sports tickets do not my ex was always on me about how i didnt respect his miniatures but i had no problem with him being nerdy and liking minis what i didnt like was the fact that he hoarded so many nerdy objects that my home was frequently uncomfortable and uninviting and he never parted with any of them accumulation without consideration was the issue not the money i dont care much for any of the people involved here and there is a lot of blame to go around but they were all responding to understandable stupid harmful pressures it does hit hard against that dichotomy want a happy life long marriage pick the adult woman you respect as an equal who really understands your goals and your values who is keeping the list today we are battery half of water the plot of the lion king or maybe just the villain arch the minions its a bit unclear please reread my post i suggest several avenues to bring these issues forward your bad feels are not the biggest issue here that the university can help you address the issue here is he is not doing his job and he is not being respectful when he communicates with or about students you need to frame your issues in a way that makes it easier for the school to understand and address i would jus speak to your student ombudsperson directly to get clarity on what is expected of this helper and what your actual obligations to him are in the meantime block this mans number fundamentally there could be reasonable causes for an adult instructor to call an adult student in university the boundaries arent the same as they are in high school however without further instructions i think youre well within your own rights to withdraw consent from this particular person reaching out to your personal cell phone edit the fact you met with him for an extended period and none of your classes got book ie the outcome of the meeting wasnt achieved is actually probably your stronger objective complaint against him remember youre not just a student deserving of respect youre also a customer and this guy is giving you shitty service start with your ombudsperson or get advice from your student union even your program director is a another possible avenue but id get my ducks in a row before speaking with then i totally believed this happened you can pop cyst like this during sex or riding a bike or getting outta bed too fast but it was not for the reasons he thinks it is so fucking rare for husbands to show up at all when their wife is in hospital that any one who does a smidge more than drop off clean undies a magazine is treated like a god damn prince some nurses are as guilty of this shit as anyone so it wasnt about your dick ya dumbass you were getting wildly praised and rewarded for the baseline of care that woman are expected to provide without comment or complaint and if you can at all help if do not be sold off into a politically advantageous marriage while still a teenager to a man a decade older who is definitely not over his ex if these mens version of a traditional woman requires that woman be in poverty and disempowered socially maybe there is something exploitative about wanting that kind of tradition how can you make it a nonissue that your husband is spiteful and doesnt listen to you or have any respect for your anxiety about money you cant not alone you feel rejected because you are being rejected and ignored not just misunderstood communication takes two people you cannot fix it entirely on your own the question you need to ask yourself right now is if you have a partner or not in solving this problem thats because shes bitter and hit the wall so they dont have to listen to her anymore s their system is flawless anyone who disagrees with them is always oldfatugly anyways dont try to jump the queue to become girlfriend by being friend with benefit that almost never works and it shouldnt you cannot be next in line for a relationship with someone if he wanted to date you he would he doesnt what youre considering would be harmful for you you dont want to be his fwb so dont agree to it only pretending to be an fwb while trying to wiggle your way into something more is dishonest and unkind either say no or admit to him what you really want youre arguing that you see the exact same percentage of women imagining the man in the service role is seriously flirting with them sure we cannot read minds we can read context like the context of someone being paid to be a pleasant sales associate or server because i spend a lot of time with women and while i have definitely heard a sales guy or bartender referred to as sucha flirt not a single woman i have met was confused about his role as a service provider there are plenty of errors that are just human but this one when it comes to flirting vs service is just not a 5050 cognitive error he told me that even watching porn when you have
