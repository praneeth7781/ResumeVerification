anyone of any age are gonna just not quite work out just stop texting him entirely you rejected him when you rejected his intensity and talk about future wifey that was rejecting him you didnt want what he wanted and thats okay it was the right thing to do let it be a rejection and let it be over then your marriage is over youve decided it youre just trying to bully her into being the one who says it out loud it may take years but eventually she will and youll tell yourself your hands are clean but they are not what you are doing is cowardly and manipulative at least as shitty as anything youve accused her of here if you actually want to be married stop this bullshit and go talk to a counsellor together youre the one who described actively threatening the relationship whats worse you dont even mean it you dont want to divorce right so youre just being manipulative and hurtful when you speak that way to her at least shes being honest with you about her unhappiness so why dont you shit or get off the pot stop making it all her job to leave your ass the rank hypocrisy is shocking you sound like a teenager not a 35yearold either get a marriage counsellor involved to help you both do better you yes you really need to do a lot better than this or stop being such a little shit and hire a lawyer yourself just let him avoid you its fine for him to avoid you this is resolved just fine stop trying to pursue the fwbcasual fling with him he is not equippedinterested in that dont get bent outta shape that a 22yearold cant explain his boundaries and emotional needs clearly just take the damn hint that hes not looking for what youre looking for and stop trying to get what you want outta him the awkwardness is a thing you can choose to ignore for yourself then you earned every downvote everyone who thought your question was insincere or combative or condescending or not worth engaging with was just objectively correct edit the fact that this got downvoted is both hilarious and pathetic that response really just supports the decisions of others to not engage with you if you want a sincere conversation in the future start by indicating youre willing to put in the effort to understand other people read through the thread ask for specific clarifications or identify common themes or things that seem contradictory to you reword what youve understood and ask if youve got it right these are skills were taught in grade school for engaging other people with ideas sincerely and respectfully and showing we are interested in comprehending new ideas dont just vaguely demand someone else spell it out for you especially in the context of this sub demanding someone else just spell it out for you is going sound combative and condescending and leave the impression of a very large risk that you are the sort who jumps into this sub feeling entitled to the emotional and intellectual labour of women who you intend to shit on regardless that is why i choose to ignore you the risk outweighed any possible benefit to me and still does im very likely going to regret this if thats not who you are then dont approach it like this does it matter if youre not compatible then youre not compatible it doesnt matter very much if that is personal or cultural if youre comfortable with this level of prudishness and insecurities sure i wouldnt be comfortable with this id remind her that i also kissed my ex while wearing pretty much every single shirt in my wardrobe and she had unzipped every pair of jeans i own and maybe have used every towel in the house while naked she also pet my dog even kissed his little nose can he stay if she wants to be absurd lets be equal opportunity absurd i wouldnt spend thousands of dollars to appease the irrational insecurities of someone im just dating especially not if they were phrasing it as a demand and not a request for support and understanding even though its a bit silly no this is a terrible idea shes either looking to wound herself with this information or shes gathering ammunition to wound you with this question is inherently combative and controlling it can only damage your relationship tell her she needs to trust you to maintain appropriate boundaries with people you find attractive as you always have before and that if this conversation is going to be a productive one its time to get the counsellor involved and examine what she is trying to achieve with this line of questioning i didnt say there werent many good things but look at what this bad thing is cause its a fricking huge one 1 he felt unsafe speaking with you about his unhappiness and concerns 2 you two disagreed about boundaries and you appear to be seeking to isolate him from external emotional support you say you dont want too but in addition to number 1 that is the toxic dynamic that is developing and deepening 3 you are now experiencing too much anxiety to join him in his regular activities or interact with people who are really important in his life its fine to decide the good outweighs the bad but the bad youve described here is massive and youre still firmly in the honeymoon phase you can decide to work this out and it might even work out but recognise that one of the important things about dating isnt just learning to work things out most of us will try to work out plenty more than we really should this sub is full of people trying to work out obvious incompatibles cheating and even outright abuse its really learning what is not tolerable for you so you waste less time with basically good people who are not the right people for you its normal to maintain keepsakes especially in a private place the fact you see this as a possible confrontation is a major issue this was not thrown in your face this was privately tucked away and your stumbling sounds a hell of a lot like snooping its understandable that it upset you but the issues here are obviously whatever insecurities youve got going on he didnt do anything to you he didnt do anything wrong youre doing all this misery to yourself you should be talking to him about those and maybe seeking support and treatment for them this book should be a nonissue the fact you think sentimental objects are disrespectful is absolutely not a universal opinion and frankly its a rather immature one one id expect from someone closer to 18 than 30 its been four months these sorts of issues so early on can and should be dealbreakers in another situation id tell you that you cannot obsess about your side and that your partner needs to have people in their life they can confide in about their struggles and concerns while there can and should be some boundaries relationships cannot be emotional prisons you shouldnt want to isolate your partner from their support network you must trust and respect those people understand they are only hearing one perspective most people do understand that but in this situation why are you trying so hard to make it work when it so clearly isnt dont worry about this guy hes not the issue this is not about apologizing are you getting medical support for your mental health right now youre in a really bad way and making really bad choices for yourself you just need to end all contact with this guy and get yourself some serious support and medical intervention this sequence of events was not about him it was about the bpd you need serious focused invention and treatment for your bpd no id say maybe big maybe if your true intention was simply to apologize for wrong doing but it isnt this is condescending youre talking about her like she was a secondary character in your life existing only to assist in your growth underneath this all is the assumption she requires your apologyinput in order to move on with her own life you know thats not right you havent spoken in years you know nothing you have nothing to offer except a sincere apology and what youve written here it not that sincere apology what youve written here is an inwardlooking bit of journaling about what a great person youve become this is selfcentring and personal validation not an apology its great if its all true for you but that has no value to her nearly every time i hear a longtime ex reach out to apologize i end up rolling my eyes its almost always just selfishness and guilt and they are using the other person to make themselves feel better demanding attention to an apology that is not really an apology but is about making themselves feel better is just not a good look dont do it the most important thing is to relax and keep on living your life youre just talking its been good but its just talking hes moving its reasonable to believe hes probably not dodging you moving is highly timeconsuming and brainspaceconsuming right now you are penpals trying to move things forward right away wouldnt be sensible or kind id suggest you not fight that and just accept it hoping that its temporary but not overinvesting youre going to stay penpals until at least a week after the move so think about how much time you want to give to a penpal and offer this connection only that much time once hes moved give him 23 days and then suggest a few days youre free and even a suggestion of a placeevent especially if he doesnt know his new area well if he doesnt confirm within the first week or so of moving cut him loose you cannot force this you cannot speed it up what you can do is decide how much of your energy youre gonna give this connection between now and when hes moved absolutely they have issues the one in my area is very closely moderated often to the frustration of new members but even still however there are also guys from online dating who are posted several times a month for cheating stalking stealthing and all sorts of acts from really rude to greedy to outright violent i absolutely suggest my friends on online dating be in that group to know who the repeat offenders in the city are but if you look at all the posts not just the juicy ones most get nothing but a good luck or even i worked with him he seemed cool this is totally old school analogue behaviour the whisper network in a digital space the criticism i hear from women is all like yours be critical of what you read check for the big risks not the whining but too many men are just terrified someone will say something mean about them as if they have never trash talked as ex or a hook up to their buddies and dont realize these networks exist because of a longterm systemic lack of safety for women a woman who writes the above just really really hates other women and still thinks perfect judgment can protect her from a skilled manipulator and abuser you might want to read some relationship books written more recently or by someone under 40 that sounds a bit regressive even for the 80s we are socialized in gendered ways sure but this kind of bullshit does more harm than good when two individuals are trying to understand one another this man isnt going
