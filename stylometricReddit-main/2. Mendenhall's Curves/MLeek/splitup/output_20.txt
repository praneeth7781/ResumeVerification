instead of me being broke or even homeless and him being dead also hate my basic physical autonomy as a person who may experience an unwanted pregnancy some day some will and hell be peddling male supplements and prepper supplies to make ends met like alex jones if his do not compete allows it tucker was bad habit tv most people will replace the habit they will get their hit but they arent necessarily loyal to tucker theyll be asking their friends where they get theirs now that the guy with good stuff is doing 2 years in federal same as any addict it really just sounds like hes listing the ways a lot of men loss a lot of money the amount the guys i know lost on crypto put my scented candle collection to shame theyd have been better off scrolling instagram this is rude and inconsiderate behaviour of those around you given your age there is a risk someone will say something nasty to you and nastier to her for letting you i would suggest you keep sexual touching private you know this touching is sexual thats why youre enjoying it so keep it private i honestly dont understand no one involved here seems to think anything happened except that she invited an old friend and a friend of a friend to a different public gathering of many friends all that i can see here that might have happened is your dude friend wanted to stir up some misery and drama in your life and found a super lame and weak excuse to do so which shamed you into a breakup after two years i wouldnt assume my gf wanted to fuck someone else just because she invited him to an afterparty its weird you seemed to however if that is what you thought then its best to be broken up being upset isnt getting you anywhere you need to start to be very clear about when you will be prioritizing your own family even without him and when you would like him to put his phone down and be present with you youve allowed a dynamic to form in this relationship that you are not happy with you need to tell him plainly its not okay and its going to be renegotiated you will be spending your time a bit differently and he will be expected to be respectful of that dating is really hard work its worse than finding a job it sucks but you did have really good dates that is what happened and its what should happen if youre mature and selfaware you should have mostly good dates but good isnt good enough to build a lifetime of romance and compatibility on and that is okay most good dates after two or three of them are gonna result in one of you saying eh youre good people but youre not my person if youre having largely good dates thats perfect thats really great thats what you want if you were mostly having totally shitty and disappointing dates then youd need to seriously reevalute your choices all you need to do here is realize its work its hard work it is often disappointing work it takes a shit ton of time outta your day if you are really burnt out on the work take a pause for a few months and then come back to it resilience is the name of the game for you resilience and remembering that good doesnt have to be good enough not for them and not for you ill take you one further employees and clients do this schoolchildren do this human beings do this its a normal part of human relationships forming sex and love isnt the only place were looking for compatibility and understanding of boundariesterms the engagement i have never shited tested on purpose but ive had two guys accuse me of it and they were both totally own goals one i asked plainly about his views on abortion mine were right up front in my profile and i dont date men who disagree with me on this subject and he refused to answer because it was a shittest so i unmatched and moved on then i had another guy accuse me of shittesting once because he suggested a restaurant where i had previously had an allergic reaction so i suggested another nearby and very similar where i could eat more comfortably he absolutely went off on me about shittesting him and gameplaying if it hadnt been so spooked by it itd have been really funny my only intention was to have a pleasant meal i could enjoy both cases they created shittests out of normal direct human communication by failing so utterly then im with udfahnz i dont know why youre trying to force this after three months youre calling her controlling demanding and unkind and thinking she cantwont change these patterns if your assumptions are unfair you shouldnt date her anymore anyways if your beliefs are bang on you definitely shouldnt date her anymore youve had fun for three months but that was casual intellectual fun i wonder if you are a bit more attracted to the idea of the clever concert pianist then the actual woman who is there the life you actually want to live daytoday does not sound like its going to be with her edit it always depends on the dog and the situational trigger but definitely make sure you encourage other adults who visit your home to help you by immediately becoming unfun if the dog jumps on them any big reaction positive or negative reinforce the behaviour if the dog is smart enough to know the behaviour is undesirable you start rewarding them for better choices ie a greeting that takes place on all fours or a good back up or off if youre really struggling get a pro involved first things first the dog shouldnt be jumping on anyone that actually is a training situation where perfection is the fair expectation its up there with no biting one dog lover to another you need to step up your game the expectation of not being jumping is not excessively demanding or controlling especially not if you two want to be parents with this dog in the household and is one you should be working seriously to meet by the time the dog is a year old very very few of my dogs were still jumping with any frequency by 1 year old the second thing is you dont actually sound as independent and confident as you think you are you sound like youre taking good advicefeedbackexpectations when she gives that but call it demanding when you dont like it instead of saying youre a smart woman but no thats ones not for me thanks the fact the dog kept her up is a problem a problem that should be solved by a simple im sorry the dog kept you up i understand that was really unpleasant for you itll happen sometimes but we do need to minimize it next time please wake me up so i can handle the situation and we can all get back to sleep i think you need to step back and realize your girlfriends directness and transparency can be a good thing when you meet it with equal transparency confidence selfknowledge and directness maybe she is a deeply toxic and unkind person trying to change you maybe shes abusive i really cannot tell what i can see here is that you take what is useful to you and get quietly pissed with her for what you dont like and try to force yourself to accept it you also need to learn to take the good with the bad and stand up for yourself clearly when you disagree with her that is when you will know if shes just a forceful person with decent conflict resolution skills or an abusive bully at 3 months you probably also want to have some of the tougher conversations about what life together would look like you want a dog for the rest of your life they are a member of the family as much as a child be clear that that dog wont be rehome for any reason except extremely and immediate safety situations ie the dog starts mauling people youre 39 you should also think of some of the other dealbreakers its time to discuss plainly like plans and values around money or homeownership or faith and family you can mute the chat or leave it and tell them why its just not a positive and healthy space for you right now it may be what they need but its exactly what you need to take some space from they arent doing anything terribly wrong you just need to stand up and leave the frontrow seat of a show youre not enjoying ask them to reach out to you via other channels when they want to get together and thank them for their support and understanding you need to be willing to take care of yourself no one else is gonna read your mind and do it for you i agree we dont need their language or framing we have a lot of healthier genderneutral words this phase of a human relationship where boundaries are tested and we figure out another out storming doubt stage hide and seek stage the power struggle the honeymoon hangover and men do it plenty im dealing with a new hire who cannot string 10 words together with shittesting his coworkers or managers either were going to move through this phrase or were gonna dissolve the relationship this isnt evil women this is a normal social strategy you can observe in a kindergarten classroom the way the puaincel defines shit testing is inherently malicious and immature and only assigned to women but in reality its a normal part of human relationships forming even in the workplace and its can be benign or even helpful hes abusive when someone says you make me be cruel there is no grey zone that is the battle cry of the unrepentant abuser he feels entitled to call you nasty names if he uses the threat of breaking up each time hes not getting his way that is also a common abuse tactic this will not get better and might get worse you explained fine he choose to doubledown on accusing you these kinds of misunderstandings are frequent in relationships its a red flag when a man of 30 cannot handle them without making absolute absurd accusations tell him that is not fair or true if he cannot accept misunderstandings with a bit of grace and respect you shouldnt be wasting your time with him either he is terribly immature or this is a tactic hes using to keep you proving yourself and feeling insecure in the relationship either way you should expect better your bf knows how he treats other women at parties he assumes all men do the same this isnt just the controlling hypocrisy of it its also him telling on himself he knows how he behaves is wrong but feels entitled to it dont dare someone who feels entitled to behave badly you cant fix a person with poly it requires even more open discussion about boundaries and comfort not less someone who busts boundaries and neglects their partners feelings and doesnt communicate openly in a monogamous relationship isnt gonna suddenly start doing those things right in a poly on i think you need to have a serious think about what youre trying to fix in this relationship warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info let it go you didnt go any further than they did tell your husband that being a bit embarrassed or uncomfortable
