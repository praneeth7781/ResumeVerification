probably necessary at this point and can help you address the core issue here figuring out this phone call is not the core issue its the place the drama llama is taking a shit today are you in the process of divorcing or not its unclear you filed months ago but still call him your so if you are i think you need to consider this purely from the position of coparent not spouse as a coparent what contact if any will you have with the kids grandparents and unclesaunts or do you expect all of that contact and information to flow through their father to you if you want to continue to have a relationship with your exinlaws then yes you should absolutely ask after their health but not quiz them in their contact with your ex so im not offended at all advice is about perspective and im a okay that mine isnt of value to you ive honestly wished you good luck and youve kept on assuming the worst of everything i type you think maybe youre a bit needlessly combative sometimes and unable to accept another persons perspective or feelings as valid youre only options here for your partner is that hes an idiot or a liar just not how id want to move through the world and thats truly okay by me its just a advice yes youre 25 this is a thing to discuss openly just remember that opinions and situations can change its not a contract its an ongoing conversation in a relationship you should expect people to try to be honest with you about what they do know about themselves but not to know everything and not to be able to promise you exactly what sex will be like between now and 2065 i didnt say you should break up i said i cannot imagine bringing such a demeaning and combative attitude into an important conversation with the person ive committed too everyone has flaws but i would never frame my partners this way or assume they had nothing of value in their own perspective or choices on a subject doing so would make me miserable good luck and youre not gonna leave him after describing him that way sesh okay i cannot imagine committing to someone in my 30s if we both agreed they were fundamentally objectively childish and just having to work around that i didnt suggest behaving like a teacher but communicating openly as if two adults are involved with some appreciation for differences in knowledge and values but hey if you both know this is what works good luck yeah shitty turn of phrase i can see how that was hurtful im sorry see she how fucking easy that is it was more important to your husband that he got to blame you for ruining the morning than it was for him to 5 seconds of emotional reflection and just say yeah ok i can do better our language is full of phrases and idioms that are hurtful and biased and bigotted no one is gonna avoid them perfectly but dear god its not that hard to take a beat and think thats not so hot really also how much dusting and vacuuming does this asshat do i might hazard a guess yes they can it can be wildly variable people are complicated some people dont experience much sexual arousal at all both men and women can be on the extremes of really higharousal or very low women are often shamed and judged for high and men are usually shamed and judged for low but we all exist on a wide spectrum and a spectrum that can even shift throughout our lives a lot of women especially young women are not encouraged to understand their own sexual arousal or ever express it openly sometimes they simply dont know how because there arent many healthy models for it but it can also be shameful or even unspokenly dangerous for them to try you were both young you dont need to be quizzing women or trying to read your exs mind thats not gonna help you need to be working on putting down the baggage you picked up from an early relationship that didnt work out well for either of you hoping hed figure it out andor expecting a better job at the age of 30 are still you describing situations that might be within his risk tolerance look i agree with you there is a real problem here in your position id be unhappy with my partner too but you need to stop approaching it with this insulting attitude that he is childish or evil he wasnt meeting your unspoken standards for financial security they werent his standards and he didnt have the information or the skills to know what yours were or how to meet them you should ask for what you need clearly but kindly with your ears open to his actual feelings and perspectives especially if there isnt a snowballs chance in hell of ending this relationship over this then put your damn fists down and set the worst of your judgements of his character aside begin from the place of him not being able to know what you dont tell him and you not knowing what his overall risk tolerance is in the longterm thatll be a way more productive conversation then trying to tell him he cannot afford to live like he saw his parents live i have understood that you are not interested in any advice or in adjusting of the thing you can control your own behaviour for the possibility of better outcomes while dating you want to date the majority of women apparently well also blaming all women apparently for a problematic system you are choosing to active reinforce and engage with okay thats fine by me thats how you want to play it then good luck with it is she cleaning up the children and dusting while also touching up her make up and taking 15 minutes to rest all magically before knowing whether or not hell come home late or not you can say pretty whatever you want and experience what you experience but you talked about studies and i think you took the wrong lesson from the data the lesson from the data is that consistently paying for all dates isnt as good or necessary strategy for men as they seem to believe it is to get to date the women who actually want to date them im glad you dont expect me to address your personal attacks so thinly veiled as genuine curiously but you gave my bf a good laugh so thank you the point i was making which could be actually quite useful was not about most women and certainly not most american women it is that if you assume all women are like x you are likely to only engage with women who confirm that belief youve set up a dynamic where you understand one anothers expectations you will be avoided or weeded out by women who are not like x or who very much dont want much of x in their lives if any so if you dont like x stop engaging in the behaviour that attracts and reinforces x fewer dates but better ones compatibility not high scoring you mean the studies that found women who scored higher in all three of the dark triad personality traits of narcissism psychopathy and machiavellianism were much more likely to engage in foodie calls and the women who scores lowest either didnt do it or felt they had done it said rarely and i would argue because of the guilt and social shame of accepting a meal from someone youre in the fence about i mean if were taking about the science men should absolutely stop trying to buy sex with meals perhaps pay for the first invitation they make and then switch to dutch rather quickly its not a particularly good strategy with any group of women anymore to pay for all dates thats what should be known widely based on studies and surveys but rejected by men who view dating more as a gamble as a numbers game instead of a compatibility search sounds like youre holding yourself to the traditional standard and then being annoyed that is resulting in more dates with women who accept those standards and performances youre indicating and initiating if a man in the early dating stage is taking all the initiative and has cast himself as pursuer i assume he wont be comfortable with me stepping up and when i actually like him enough to try to correct this dynamic i often find i was right he couldnt hack with me if i wasnt a passive recipient if you were looking for actual compatibility instead of access youd probably have fewer dates but better ones i think the thing you really need to recognize and except is that he does feel secure with this he probably wasnt lying to you he probably wasnt withholding or keeping secrets this wasnt just technically good for him this is what financial stability looks like to him hes living just barely within his means and will i would agree with you that thats not really what stable is for lots of people its the best they ever hope for youre in your 30s you own a home together while your current financial set up might have been working so far you need to see this as a big sign that you chew skipped over some really important conversations about longterm goals savings and retirement your gf seems to have unrealistic expectations your sister isnt her peer or her bestie she doesnt owe your girlfriend the attention and validation shes seeking does your gf frequently make vague break up threats when she doesnt get exactly what she wants he is being controlling dangerously extremely controlling hes also told you that he cannot control himself at all at parties or around pretty women he doesnt even really think he should have too its their fault if hes aroused by them break up and block him quickly it is unlikely the break up will stop his attacks completely you need to stay safe have zero contact you know he has an army of underpaid support staff predominantly woman who feed and cloth him care for his home and any children or pets and schedule his personal life for him which is why none of his employees can out work him while absolutely working harder every day than this price of shit human can even fathom watch out pearl shes way hotter and we know thats all that really matters you should have gotten rid of him after the rave disappointment is valid but this guy is just an asshole who cannot handle lifes hiccups without assigning blame and being a condescending shithead hopefully hell grow out of it but i wouldnt suggest sticking around and finding out i think being nervous of friendly men at 23 years old is totally normal youve probably met a lot of men who are willing and eager to take any opening they get but its not everyone as you age is a bit fewer people your boyfriend trusts you but you need to build your trust in yourself your own instincts and your own boundaries you got this you dont need to be second guessing yourself all the time you can be a human being and you can extend trust to men to be human beings and you can revoke that trust in individual men as needed i wish theyd just do a better job of securing the provider type so id run into fewer of them its probably better that you not get too involved in the early stages even if it was your dialect youd want
