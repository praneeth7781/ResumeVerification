to save you he doesnt see you as a serious longterm partner and he isnt willing to take the kind of risks or make the kinds of investments an adult often would with a serious longterm partner on top of all of that you dont trust him he lies this man isnt your safety whats worse he made just be a distraction and an obstacle keeping you from making other plans for yourself ugh im so sorry im glad it sounds like you were able to keep yourself safe in the end it happened last summer in ohio her rapist was arrested and she was able to get the medical care she needed in indiana her mother was advised the abortion wouldnt be legal in ohio under their heartbeat law women are also the default care givers for small children so many women needs the legal structure of a divorce to protectcare for any dependants i love these she dumped me for no reason stories one ex said i dumped him for getting a tattoo she didnt like he got that tattoo while wastedhigh at a festival trip after promising me to stay sober and not make me play mommy instead i spent the second day to checking every medical tent and then the local er i eventually found him outta his mind in another er on iv fluids without his passport or our train tickets home but sure it was the ugly tattoo not the 48 hours of terror and trauma followed by the cost of the hotel room and flight while i helped him sort his shit out with the embassy and hoped he wouldnt get arrested i think theres a lot of complex intersectionality going on here and we cant really tell you much about the patterns in your neighborhoods or the ones you walk through their behaviour towards you could reflect biases in policing in the area or their jobfamily businesses or a dozen other things about the communities make up i walk through sort of three distinct neighbourhoods to get to my office each day and each of them presents unique risks and people respond differently to me based on how im dressed in one of them dressing more affluently will make me invisible in another it makes me a target in one wearing my more artsy queer coded clothes makes me everybodys friend in another really dirty looks and sometimes comments i think most street harassment comes down to punishment for being conspicuous for taking up space a reminder from men they own the space and youre just moving through it taking up space is it gonna look different in different neighbourhoods and at different times even if it was true how is she should suffer with me because im suffering a good outcome for anyone if this were true then the women in this situation are doing a beneficial bit of emotional and practical labour for them both by ending it oh fuck yes graduation and entering the workforce is one of the biggest transitions of your life so far dont underestimate the freefloating anxiety totally reasonable uncertainty that kind of moment brings thats stressful for the normies please do consider putting a few of the avoidable battles back on the shelf for the time being live to fight another day i promise you itll pay off in the long run to be strategic about this personal development notice how a shitty relationship where you or your partner is miserable much of the time seems to still be a rather good deal for men its as if there is a great deal they benefit from in a partnership besides being happy and for women there is very little to be gained by being partnered if you are unhappy the idea that women are more likely to leave a bad relationship is not an insult against womens character it just says something very sad about what men consider good enough and workable for themselves especially when they are not the ones doing the work warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info she failed his test the test to see how much shed accept from him that is what triggered his explosion when she said maybe i dont want to accept this much i agree op was also testing used passive aggression and needs to asset herself better but thats because then she wouldnt waste three months with a man who wants to to play bullshit games not because she caused his verbal abuse and transparent attempts to manipulate her exactly this he wasnt confused he was tactical these are strategies that work for him op has plenty of flaws that make her an appealing target for this sort of man and a partner in his toxic dance but that doesnt absolve him ops response was imperfect shes a great target for his style of bullshit but like i said he knew exactly what manipulation he was engaging in at that moment there was no reason to tell her about the text or his response except to test and trigger her he didnt ask her because he cared he asked her as part of the test he was training her not to protest his behaviour and learning how to best manipulate her and when she failed the test by beginning to question and stand up for her own needs and boundaries he went on an overblown attack to threaten and coerce her into silence classic all my exes are crazy behaviour from this man only thing to do is block him and move on any further contact will continue to bring out the worst in op fellow panic disorder here and i completely relate to if i didnt challenge this id do nothing i had to manage panic around things like picking up the phone learning to drive and getting on planes but if nonmonogamy regularly triggered full blown panic i wouldnt do it one of the most valuable tools i have is pick your battles no that is too many battles put some back pick like two battles when i first started to really address my anxiety i thought i had to fight and defeat all my demons i put myself in a lot of unnecessarily triggering situations that actually made it harder to reach equilibrium and practice the skills because i was constantly pressuring myself to perform under intense anxiety when i stated to focus on the battles that were personally worth it to me things really started to click driving was 100 worth it getting on a boat absolutely not worth it i can live a very full and rich life without boats maybe this is a battle you want to pick but please give yourself some grace and make sure youre really picking it because its a worthwhile one for you and if it is consider putting some of the other battles on the back burner for a while dont try to everything all at once manage your energy and give yourself real recovery time time to recover and reflect is where you really firm up your tools and tactics otherwise you risk just burning yourself out major toxic fights in the first three months are a huge red flag he doesnt want to be a boyfriend he wants to appear single at least to his guy friends he doesnt care how that makes you feel hes 34 not 21 hes not confused he knows exactly how he was manipulating you and leaving you feeling insecure and begging for his commitment and transparency stay the fuck away from him block him grieve it out and move on with your life its actually rather cool its a real thing but the stupidest thing about this comment is that it was found largely to be fetal cells like from their sons so yes they checked it was that some studies have shown that up to 60 of women who have given birth to a son retain some of his cells it is naturally assumed they also retain their daughters cells but i havent seen studies for that in my admittedly shallowish reading they have also found some cells of older siblings in the younger ones and obviously twins and blood transfusions its just really not that big of a deal this seems to be a myth that came up in 2017 based on a study of women with male children outta seattle in 2012 but they decided to conflate the findings of male dna in the brain with the idea that the women were promiscuous and the dna was from multiple sex partners instead of what they actually were women who had sons thats worse all of that is worse he treated you at least as badly as her but she had the sense to make the boundaries she needed for herself and cut him loose it also sounds like he used you to try to emotionally manipulate her while he was lying to you this is so much worse her im trying to access a very basic prescription and also maybe not be maliciously imprisoned or murdered by the state any advice him shouts irrational insulting assumptions about her body and sexual pleasure into the void hes not confused hes tactical you were convenient hes not capable of being alone hell make plenty of excuses for himself and most of them will be lies dont gaslight yourself they are what they do not what they say and what he did was making himself available to his ex for your entire relationship not just the first few months 9 months outta 10 that just means he hasnt hit her up super recently he never stopped id walk this is his shit to overcome and he didnt probably wont but im his age and hes dating a woman over a decade younger then him because he assumes he can get away with this shit during her benefit of the doubt era he might last until you hit your knows her worth era a man who is 35 and behaved like he did is not capable of being mentally health alone which means hes not capable of being with anyone else either 4 year olds when they are called kiddo 24 year olds when they are called kiddo me when my friend since kindergarten calls me sis me when my catty sil does its almost like context and intent matter in human communication this guy youre the real racist for not conforming to my sexist and racist stereotypes about you i would consider the friendship done his behaviour was horrible and your response was not productive but it doesnt really matter generally speaking i wouldnt keep a friend around who is clearly expressing a sense of entitlement to my sexualromantic interest and there is really no other rational interpretation here he wasnt defending white men in general they are doing just fine and dating plenty of women are asian decent generally speaking he was attacking you for not being a specifically available option to him and that is someone you need to stay the hell away from regardless of the racism angle it would encourage women to buy toys and cohabitate with one another so as not to become a indentured servant there would be less children but possible a rush in sperm donors because youre making having children via sex even riskier that it already is let spare a moment of shame for the guy who keeps trying to get him on mic best case senecio this random guy is going through some shit put the camera down and walk the fuck away stop encouraging this performance its normal for people to grow apart especially at this stage of young adulthood theres no going back there is not
