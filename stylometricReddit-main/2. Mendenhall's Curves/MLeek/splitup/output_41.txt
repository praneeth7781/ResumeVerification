is should be a fun problem to solve youre not crazy by all means wish the best for him but also stop talking to him take the win enjoy that final pleasant conversation and dont leave the door open to anymore more bullshit because as much as you may wish better for him its pretty damn unlikely hes any better yet if you let him back in even just a catchup occasionally odd are its not gonna keep on feeling that good show kindness to yourself let go of the anger and of all contact youve gotten everything you need from this person already experience of life matters which is why he knows to keep his distance from any woman who has any youre kidding yourself like i understand why i know why youre going to keep trying to negotiate this but you are kidding yourself he is not ignorant he is skilled he may not be selfaware about it but he is skilled he has a set of interpersonal tactics that work for him he has found that you are respective to these tactics when others would have reasonably cut off contact by now in every one of your responses you are describing a person with tactics to make you feel obligated to him and to be constantly extending the benefit of the doubt to him he violates your boundaries and then blames you for hurting his feelings because you didnt appreciate having your boundaries violated he may not be fully conscious about what he is doing but he is fully aware of what works to make young women feel pressured to keep being nice to him when he is not being nice at all you need to crush this guy for your own sake and his he absolutely sees the gift as niceness coins that can he can use to make you feel obligated to give him what he wants or tolerate his other poor behaviours stop assuming he doesnt know what hes doing he knows exactly what hes doing youre dating someone who lies to you and is comfortable being with someone who is cheating on their wife your skill is not the problem here blow jobs are not the problem here this is not a religious hangup your gf is dishonest how many times have you asked about this situation now im sure ive see it six or seen times so is it a dozen twenty times now this is really not a healthy use of rrelationships at this point youre not comfortable with this fwb arrangement if you were comfortable with it you wouldnt be posting repeatedly online looking for some sort of magical insight that is just not coming stop doing something youre not comfortable with or secure in if its fueling these sorts of questions and anxiety just stop take your larger questions about life and relationships to a therapist and maybe stick to a vibrator for a while until youve got a better sense of your own desires and boundaries when it comes to others lets be fair a silent bang maid he can verbally abuse without feedback or consequence micah struck me from the get go as a situational mean girl still nasty as all hell but probably capable of selfcorrection if she made the active choice to break with her toxic friends and end those patterns shes a notverybright follower and people pleaser easily led happy to earn brownie points with the even nastier girls by playing the same game shes got no core not a lot actually going on my youngest sister was like this as well she was a nasty piece of work with her tribe but she woke up the the dynamic when she was in her mid20s and decided to stop acting like a damn hyena got a few new friends and decided to try being basically decent to other people for a while micah is extremely immature for her age and i sure as shit wouldnt want to be her friend but i have some hope for her all the same she may have thought you were joking your reaction was that ridiculous sometimes youre owed a swift kick in the ass dude and not a gentle pat on the head she should never have had to hold your hand through this this is not a bid for connection leave her be yeah i do think you can cultivate real friendships with men but its particularly tough at your age and its rare overall men are so encouraged to shoot their shot and see every woman in their life as a potential girlfriend if they are just persistent enough some never get past that nonsense assumption about the availability of women to their desiresneeds but some do trouble is ya just never know which is which until you know youre being absurd you utterly overreacted to her acting like a decent host demanding an apology from him because she allowed him to use a room in her apartment to take an important call is the worst kind of toxic machismo bullshit youre basically broadcasting to him that you cannot handle his presence in her life and dragging him into your argument with her by taking that stand not okay your sense of possession of her space and the desire to pick a fight with him over this are huge red flags its not our space her space for a damn work call he needed a space apart from the group to take its not like she was giving him a lap dance while it happened or tossing her panties at him he needed a door that closed in most peoples apartments that is only the bedroom if i was your gf id be frustrated with you too and resentful of your inability to manage your own feeling for a hot second and respect a perfectly reasonable decision if hes her friend then he is a friend she behaved like youd expect someone to for a friend you were way off base you didnt need to be further heard you needed to get a grip if youre not okay with her being friends with a past partner say that but if youre going to accept that this person is a friend then she gets to treat him like a friend right there are a lot of not great options because the whole thing is just not great and there are some very bad options stalling until you are vacationing and putting it out there without warning is in my opinion a very bad option exactly and the goal here should be to rip it off before you reach peak misery and you snap and do it a totally thoughtless and likely antagonistic way its never going to be not complicated the goal should just be to make the pain and confusion a little bit more manageable for you both exactly it is stressful its not gonna be less stressful if you do it while in an unknown place where you have no separate corners to go to take a time out and you still have to figure out where the food is and what time you need to get to the airport it may suck to do on a weeknight but being on a trip is not gonna make this more successful unless shes agreed to use the time that way as well you realize your behaviour here is weird right you keep responding with what you dont want but are extremely vague on what you do want in this connection and what you are or are not getting from it you keep coldly reporting his situation and status in a way that sort of sounds like a list of grievances with him but you seem to refuse that framing as well its bizarre if youre not comfortable with the fwb arrangement with him end it youre not his therapist or his support you dont have to be that to him just because you feel he is in need of it if you want to date someone else do so your current list of other potentials is beside the point entirely if this fwb isnt working end it even if you dont have other great options at the moment youll live or maybe you really just need a vibrator for a while i just told you im a rando online that is all i am to you thats all any of us are on reddit to you any other qualifications i might have in other aspects of my life do not apply to this exchange im glad youre talking to your therapist about this and obviously their advice should trump randos online bit i do think that is bat shit crazy your wife is going to feel entrapped and set up and neither of you will be able to retreat if you need too on the receiving end itll seem like you did all this work just to corner her into a really tough conversation personally i just cannot imagine a worse way to approach this than not to tell someone youre only taking them out of their space and routine so you can tell them youre miserable in the marriage at least give her some warning that you want to have some serious conversations and reconnections during this trip let her walk into it with some informed consent i know this is harsh but once a month is a vent session or maybe a way to address a distant issue like parental alienation or largely resolved past trauma this is the marriage youre in every day if youre not going once a week youre not going to see much progress on these sorts of issues there is no right moment you have to make a good enough moment before you snap and the moment becomes to urgent to avoid and it probably goes very badly and the good enough moment is not while travelling do not spring this on her for the first time while travelling that is an truly awful idea that will only further unbalance you both she will feel set up and she wont be wrong if this is part of your motive with all these plans you are setting her up all your work to create a gift or a meaningful time together will be spoiled if you leverage those possible moments of reconnection to instead trigger what you reasonably realize will be some conflect and youre setting yourself up for disappointment and epic failure with that plan travelling will not be the removal of barriers to this conversation it will be the removal of normalcy and safety and disruption of the patterns that actually allow for calm reconnection and thoughtfulness travelling is not the circumstances to have a difficult risky conversation within i cannot say this clearly enough that is a terrible plan please do not do that unless she has consented to some sort of couples retreat where she knows that conversation is a priority for this time do not do that therapy you need to speak to your wife and advocate for your own relationship that isnt rocket science but if your own insecurities and fears are further muddying these waters go talk to someone and get a bit more clarity to help you through these tough conversations looking for validation outside of your marriage is an understandable impulse but you need to quash it and address the issues inside the marriage first and no i dont mean to just keep addressing them through further acts of service for your wife i mean addressing the fact that you are also a person with needs and feelings within the relationship and speaking up about the kind of marriage youd like build together if you want to apologize apologize just apologize what you should not do is demand more
