hit you or call you names he doesnt seem violent himself the bar is beneath the damn floor someones not treating you right if you are concerned they empathize more with the consequences your abuser faced then the experience of being abused thats not just ignorance and it wouldnt be okay even if it was i would simply walk i would trust my instincts if i suspected my new partner felt more for the man who was inconvenienced by the legal ramifications of his abusive actions then he does for his gf the person he actually knows and supposedly cares for who was abused that is a dealbreaker i wouldnt confront i wouldnt explain i would just say no thank you and walk the first joke was careless and could be overlooked as a oneoff poor judgment call but the concern that he thinks believes your abuser was hard done by or just caught a case should not be overlooked i wouldnt confront or even delve into that id just trust my gut and escape that its one thing to not know what to say or make a dumb joke its another entirely to express more empathy for the person who hurt you facing consequences for that behavior than for you having to live with the ramifications of the abuse you shouldnt stay in a relationship where that doubt and fear has even entered your head i wouldnt he might not mean anything by it but i wouldnt roll those dice on someone id only been dating for a few weeks or months edit dumb typo gut not guy its not on her if you cannot treat her with respect youre not actually taking full ownership of the issue here youre not asking for sensitivity youre asking for submission to your bad behaviours and for her to manage your feelings for you youre asking her either meaningful change or hide how she interacts with her classmates because you cannot handle yourself you need to seriously consider if you are capable of being a partner to anyone at the moment without being emotionally abusive or controlling towards them because by your own description youre crossing that line yeah that typo doesnt help any but it seems like most people got it all the same approach this from a shared goals point of view you both have a shared goal of living together there is a proposal where you could do that more quickly if he was willing to provide you with a better interest rate than the irs and cc companies would show him your plan for repaying them and how youve worked that plan over the last few months then show him how much quicker it would go if you were repaying him at a less aggressive interest rate from there id suggest you hit pause let him go away and think about it dont get too into the weeds right about how much interest youd pay him or about trading rent for repayments instead just give him the information about how quickly youd be out of debt and roughly how much more quickly you could live together tell him you know its a bit strange and you dont want to pressure him into something hes not comfortable with you want to build your life with him regardless so if hes not comfortable with this youll just keep on working the current plan youve shown him on the current timeline stop going back to this well its run dry you were rarely if ever friends you can know this because the friendship faltered or fell apart when either of you were in established relationships or actively dating others you were almost always the pseudopartner the whatif in the other persons life you were oneanothers fantasy but never oneanothers reality those are the hardest things to let go of the things that never really existed except as a hope the honeymoon stage never ends if it never even begins its time to let that hope die be grateful for the good feels find them in a healthy way with someone else most people in their 30s arent dating partners 10 years younger than them cause they want relationships based on mutual respect and clear boundaries personally i think this is a silly and immature way for an adult man to engage with social media but not a betrayal however that really doesnt matter what matters is whether or not this is a dealbreaker for you hes been clear hes going to continue you are entitled to your feelings but your feelings dont make the rules he gets to agree or disagree and he disagrees you have to decide if that is the kind of relationship you want to stay in or not okay first off you havent won squat yet some couples try to maintain perfect financial equity but at some point that system tends to break down a real lifetime of teamwork is rarely going to break down 5050 on all fronts if you have a shared goal of homeownership and that could be accelerated or improved by using part of your winnings its a bit silly imo not to be open to other ways to protect your equity besides a perfect 5050 split of the downpayment its not that it would be unfair to her in any way just that it would be kind of silly and bizarre not to factor this change in your financial reality into a holistic plan for your lives together especially if kids are in the cards buying a home or getting married involves some level of financial risk to both parties you can manage that risk but you cannot erase it not if you want a partnership if either of you wins or inherits a large sum of money it makes sense that the shared plan and goals be reevaluated and that plan should include some protection for individual assets i dont think either of you is showing much sense or nuance on this at all break up with her and give her a deadline for leaving your home a week or two at most you could look for legal advice to support you in this but frankly she is undocumented you could hand her some contact numbers for charitiesngo in your area that supports people in her position but shes unlikely to try to push for tenants rights or 90 days notice dont talk about the things tell her plainly the relationship is over it doesnt matter what she does now doesnt matter if she gets a job tomorrow the relationship is still over if you can offer her cash towards a plane ticket but dont give her anything until she takes her things and leaves and never give her anything more than what you agreed too at that moment then change the locks pay if necessary to have them changed its worth it in the meantime depending on how concerned you are with her behavior between the time you tell her to leave and the day she actually does ask friends if you can store anything of value money or sentimental with them and make sure to keep your technology money any passwords out of her reach the issue is youre feeling a lack of intimacy in your relationship currently the issue is not that she had a past enjoyable sexual experience with someone else you probably have things to talk about it this isnt it accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who could make you so this was known bullshit in 1796 and its bullshit now its an excuse men use to justify themselves in preying on women they are assuming are either stupid manipulative or weakwilled there nothing about it that is a good idea sane men shouldnt want partners who test them that way to begin with and there is nearly no evidence of women engaging in that behavior just a lot of rejected men saying they must this theory is just straight misogyny because rejection sucks and lots of men will do anything to negate it you dont have to be friends with anyone you dont want to be friends with for any reason and yes tolerance for casual racism is a rather good reason most people when they find themselves in a crowd of people yelling slurs or say wearing swastikas or hanging nooses at very least leave mike didnt even want to distance himself from eric mike doesnt think the problem is with eric please stop asking reddit you might be finding more validation by creating these variations in the story but the end result is the same break up with her if you do not want to be with her or or seek therapy to manage your emotions in more rational ways her behaviour basically makes sense to me she avoided a past hookup in public who from your previous versions was unkind to her and talked shit about her with his friends and she gave you details about the encounter with him when you kept on probing for more information because you didnt accept her initial brief explanation in your earlier versions you were not the least bit concerned about her safety or only suspicious about the details so now you have more details and you dont like them either your choices and behaviours here make so little sense that i sincerely hope this is fiction id be okay with a return date of 34 months perhaps but 612 months with me using all my vacation to fly to them nah i couldnt sustain a healthy relationship on those terms certainly not one that was only 8 months old i dont think you need to be really clingy to not be okay with this im fiercely independent and have gone a month or two without seeing my partner when worktravel have required it but would i commit to 612 months of an ldr with only maybe a few visits with a man id been dating of ra less than year probably not thats a bad use of my time and energy for a situation that doesnt suit me nothing needy or clingy about that just ignore it but keep your eyes open for ways to move out of his department this man tried to use his position to coerce you into an affair and now hes trying to create plausible deniability continue to document everything he wasnt your friend and you cannot become his he only saw you as a potential affair partner he acted out and retaliated against you when you didnt play along with his fantasy hr may not want to admit what happened but everyone with two brain cells to rub together understands what happened the only thing more you can do to
