someone has sent me a video of you during a party and now im really concerned about your safety with the people you hang out with i need to ask you some questions so i can know youre safe now id say that id have to it seems very obvious to me that whoever sent you this video intended to shame your bf and bully him further the first thing you need to do is be clear it did not work your concern needs to be for his safety and your clear communication needs to be that nothing he does no matter how drunk he gets validates or excuses people treating him this way do not be the tool of his bullies be clear that his safety from abusers is your only concern if he says he is stays the fuck away from those people tell him youre glad and youre proud of him ask if he wants to talk about it any further dont demand the only answer you need is that he is currently safe from danger and abuse if its selfimposed then its not a ruleagreement with your partner its a personal choice you would make for yourself with any partner but to be entirely honest as a bisexual woman id still probably avoid getting too deeply involved even if you swore up and down it was entirely personal and your partner didnt even care because it just reflects that common attitude that sex between women isnt real sex youre entitled to a personal choice other people can have personal feelings about that choice consigned as a bisexual woman this implies to me that any sex and connection im having with the woman is lesser than purely on the basis of my gendergenitals a personal choice is fine and all i have lived much of my adult life with only one penis but it was never a policy it was just who was in the mix at the time and we cannot pretend these sorts of attitudes towards sex that doesnt involve a penis exist in a magic little bubble they exist in a context that id rather not operate in no the mother would likely need to be extremely illmalnourished to begin with in order to end a pregnancy this way with any reliability two weeks of deprivation would be totally insufficient for most reasonably healthy adult women young wolves become way more vocal yipping and growling in ways that dont appear to be very communicative when the rest of the pack is ostracizing them for poor social graces or bullying behaviours but human beings arent wolves either okay that explains the problem more clearly but you still need to stop trying to solve it for him tell him the actual problem for you hes shown you a plan but that plan is not happening you are paying for him but he is not being honest or accountable to you hes loosing your trust and your respect stop trying to tell him how to solve it and trying to fix it for him put it back on him hes damaging the relationship being dishonest with you and being dependant on you financially its not acceptable its going to end the relationship maybe not tomorrow but eventually you will be happier and healthier without him so you choose that any sane person would dont tell him exactly how to fix it remind him youve given him plenty of suggestions and you now expect him to fix this problem not continue to make it yours if that direct talk about consequences and boundaries does not get get him moving on this within a few days start planning to be rid of him if the problem is him and hes choosing to keep those problems and make them yours too then you have to solve your real problem by getting rid of him hes told you he doesnt want help hes shown you his plan you can disagree but if he had a plan and hes working it you need to stop pressuring him to make a better one its his plan and he may be right about what the limits of the charitycouncil powers are and its not your business in the least if he doesnt want to ask his parents for help if hes paying his obligations to the shared home then you need to let him carry his personal burden the way he chooses too and speak for yourself speaking for yourself can look like i dont have the bandwidth the listen to these complaintsstress right now or even i find it hurtful you continue to complain at me but will not entertain any of the suggestions ive given you at all speak for your own feelings stop trying to fix the situation for him its his if hes not paying his agreed on share of your shared home then you need to consider that this isnt a safe person for you to live with because he expects you to carry his burdens without having to listen to you or consider your feelings or perspectives at all this it makes me so mad when kids are taught this was the highest of high art and was inaccessible or highbrow rj literally opens with a bunch of teenage buddies making a rape joke a rape pun but so many teachers just swan on past that i was confused at first too then i remembered women are always bad and always to blame youre probably incompatible this isnt what you want you can and should bring up the idea of separate bedrooms but its concerning that he doesnt seem to recognize that option dude the part that made this really bad sex was the part where you made it her job to take care of your feelings afterwards no hook up wants to be your therapist or your coach the fact you are continuing to think it would appreciate to try and demand more of her time and attention is unhinged go watch some educational videos on performing oral sex and with the next woman ask her what she likes and make sure she orgasms before your penis gets involved leave this woman alone as she has clearly told you too you are not owed any amount of chances she is owed the basic respect of you not contacting her anymore dont be a creepy demanding child if you showed up at my house in this situation id call the cops and let them explain to you that i will not be speaking with your further nothing but me man me use big tool go vroom statistically women are safer drivers by every metric on a average women are just as capable as men of spacial reasoning but they dont overrate their skills by as much take fewer risks and can more accurately assess the risks women ding cars and crack fenders men kill people from a pure probability pov if you want to live let a woman drive if you dont want to be in an open relationship its time to leave this one because that is the best case scenario the best case scenario is that he wants a transparent and ethical open relationship from there it only get worse dont get stressed out just admit you want monogamy just monogamy nothing else if he doesnt agree fully and directly in language you can rely on let it be over your bf just put you in the be my pretty lady not a human being box it would be slightly different if he had simply said hed prefer you not fart around him when it was avoidable and because we are human he knows it is not perfectly avoidable as just a personal preference the fact he connected it to being ladylike is gross and demeaning and very very stupid its funny they think rich men werent hoarding women before you know its just that less of you plebeians die young right most of you were not gonna be landed gentry you were not going to be assigned a buxom teenager you were not likely to be master or meritorious in 1020 or 1620 or 1820 either youre just angry you dont have a woman an assigned woman you can punch down at no matter how low you are i always wonder if they think small children in guatemala are just failing to manifest food and clean drinking water like if systemic issues dont exist then there are entire nations causing famine with all their negative self talk fit of rage is a phrase which should only ever be associated with an ex you dont have to be perfect to deserve not to be absurd that is a lie abusers love to tell to keep you trapped thank you for explaining why this might be a deterrent it seemed like a very easy hoop to jump through to me for someone with malicious intent who wanted to create a false sense of security i am opposed to engaging with people who exhibit a behaviour i have found to be directly connected with negatively resentment and even other controlling behaviours also i am woman who largely but not exclusively dates men in my experience men who start off with this demand quickly have other demands and accusations i have strategies to keep myself safe this is not one of them exactly the opposite i guess my strategy is too avoid men who exhibit a behaviour that doesnt make me feel safe and respected your husband turned you into his private porn star without telling you about it he felt entitled to doing so without your formal consent and is now demanding a formal request they be deleted i doubt your husband is a compete fucking moron he was aware or should have reasonably assumed that you believed the videos were deleted and that is what you wanted he should not have felt entitled to them in this way and trying to make you the bad guy who demands he give up something he never should have taken without explicit permission is revolting you are underreacting it feels like an invasion because it was tell him to delete them tell him he fucked up royally by behaving entitled to these videos without a transparent conversation at very least you should express deep disappointment with his judgment hes 32 hes not confused about pets he doesnt need it explained to him this is who he wants to be the asshole who treats your dog poorly and enjoys its fear he sees you only as a servant to his future baby not as a person balancing her loves and needs and people who are jealous of pet are often jealous of babies as well dont keep such an open mind your brain falls right out this is exactly what it looks like if trust is broken dont date her testing her is just demeaning yourself in a shitty relationship that already isnt working you were manipulative you were toxic you decided to stay in a relationship you shouldnt have and used that as excuse to practice being a bad person i dont understand how this strategy is protecting someone from a trafficker the trafficker is usually real local people arent they it doesnt seem like it would have helped the victim in that article youre mistaking consequences for cant do it you absolutely can break a contract and if it was a legal one there might be consequences for doing so but scientology cannot enforce their a billionyear contract in court and you cannot use the law to force your partner back into the marital home or bed if they dont want to be there yeah im fine with that youd be unmatched not an issue for me what reason a person concocts at that point yeah ask for a
