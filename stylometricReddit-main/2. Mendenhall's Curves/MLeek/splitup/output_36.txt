feelings may not be rational but hes entitled to them and hes not obligated to be your friend or pretend to be your friend if he is not able to be at peace with your choices youre making some bad choices most people are gonna think that after youre caught having sex with a teenager in a public parking lot and its a reasonable thing to think you may not mean to but at 25 you should be aware that 18yearolds are not responsible partners for you even casually it says a concerning thing about your character and your sense that you didnt know that every 40yearold dating an 18yearold says they are pretty mature as well thats not a reasonable argument of course they are its not about them its about what it says about you the fact there are also sexist assumptions about different age gaps when the genders or sexuality is different is also not a reasonable argument for your particular situation youre making poor choices to get involved sexually with an 18 year old your expectations and needs in any sort of relationship even a fwbs one should be pretty damn different from an 18yearolds while you do not owe anyone any answers to their questions about your sex life those people who know youre fucking at 18 year old are not obligated to like it and are allowed to think poorly of you for it this man is trash and hes bringing out the absolute worst in you go make better choices with someone better there is no magic sequences of words that perfectly control how another person feels i gave you the script below do that id feel most comfortable at this stage in our relationship if we both got sti tests whadday think of that you ask because you were worried it would sound accusatory dude if its something important to you that would make you feel more comfortable and secure with your contraceptive plan and sex life with her yes that doesnt mean there is no risk of her reacting poorly the risk does exist but its a reasonable thing to ask and itd be good to know if shes not a reasonable person about it they dont happen randomly you do have to be exposed to them the t means transmitted but many people are asymptomatic and dont know they have any of them your request for an sti test is reasonable it doesnt mean you dont trust her its just a better safe than sorry sort of situation for you both before you continue with barrierfree sex she would have symptoms if she had an std this is literally the worst most wrongheaded medical advice you could have possibly offered your first example chlamydia can be asymptomatic for years thats exactly how you do it id feel most comfortable at this stage in our relationship if we both got sti tests whadday think of that you dont have perfect control over her reactions but you know your request is reasonable and thats the way to say it its not too much but if you want to be clear send him a very very short and very cold message that says something like this contact is unwanted do not send me any more communications in any channel or form if you do the next person who explains to you why this is not acceptable with be a police officer break up you are not bringing the security and respect to this relationship that is absolutely necessary for it to be a healthy one for either of you either speak to a therapist to do the work by yourself because its all your work to make peace with the reality of women as full human beings with inherent value regardless of thier sexual past or break up and find a relationship that doesnt trigger the worst parts of your character in this way there isnt a lot of great advice here man this is a you problem either you fix it or you dont if you dont wont or cant then you end this relationship and relationship where you fail to respect your partners past those absolutely can be emotionally abusive things to say especially if he doesnt take accountability for them makes it your job to resolve his violations and continues the behavior have you considered this man might have a lot more experience masking his really shitty behaviour than you do seeing through this sort of manipulation people dont generally date 10 years younger than them because they are looking for a balanced respectful relationship between equals we forgive people for mistakes we dont forgive people for actively creating and maintaining a relationship where they get to treat us like shit whenever it pleases them to do so seems like shes been pretty clear and consistent if you still have feelings then you need to end or really minimize this contact shes not respecting your boundaries and leaving you confused and hurting that isnt a friendship that is working out for you you can try to be clear again we cannot be friends if you keep joking about having sex with me after ive asked you to stop or you can just take the big step back right now tell him you are beaking up tell him you dont want any further contact its not a conversation or a discussion there is no closure just tell him what is happening and then do it block him on everything start recording any violations of the block so you can have the cops or other adults explain the situation if he continues to try to reach you and bully you refuse delivery on anything he has sent if you cannot dont acknowledge it a breakup isnt a negotiation and hes not being kind hes being a shitty little bully cut him out entirely and dont feel badly about removing someone from your life who doesnt respect you when you speak eh its pretty good so far good luck with it if you can learn try to be kind to yourself and others even when youre disappointed and frustrated youll have a way better and easier time of it too do you actually want to marry this guy cause it sounds like youre looking for reasons to label him not good enough after four years together and saying yes you should know who youre marrying and you should know if he knows you and listens to your needs and expectations well enough you and most people usually keep on trying a bit longer than it makes any sense id say walk away now but you probably arent going too so my advice would be to stop when you find yourself resenting her and making unfairunreasonable judgments about her character just because shes not giving you what you want the best thing to learn is that its okay to just break up with someone a good person who just isnt good for you dont give into the urge to turn them into a bad bad person in your own head before you give yourself permission to walk away from a pretty good person who is just not a pretty good person for you that will save you a lot of drama and stress in life if you learn to stop and walk before you demonize someone who has done nothing really except disappoint you it sounds like youre just not feeling secure and compatible thats not really about texting its a month in you shouldnt be using words like expectations and accommodating with these heavily negative connotations so early on this just isnt working for you stop trying to turn her into a monster in your own head before youre willing to admit this just isnt working for you you need to calm the fuck down not everyone engages with text the same way thats actually not all generational even among the same generation different people have different patterns and priorities its okay to express what you need and want but youve known her long enough now to suspect that her preferred method of communication is inperson that doesnt make her evil or even disinterested it makes her different the fact you are jumping to the assumption shes lying or gameplaying is a red flag on you in the short term ask her if a 2030 minute video call between dates or a phone call would work for her it might help you feel connected your feelings do need to be addressed if this connection is gonna work out but mostly by you not all by her and bring them down like 8 notches and recognize that her norms around texting are also totally valid there is nothing not proper about her choice not to stalk you on social media all the time you want to talk about your shooting then talk to her as a person not a follower or audience member stop it with the nasty assumptions about her character because shes not reading your mind and serving your texting preferences your girlfriend is accurately understanding that 17 is very different from 22 and is kicking herself for an error in judgment she made years ago this is not about the legal age of consent this is about her own standards for herself and her belief she didnt meet them the best thing you can do is be honest with her about feeling empowered and free to choose in the relationship and accept the fact that just because she feel guilt or thinks she made a mistake doesnt mean the relationship was or is broken now stop trying to tell her it wasnt that bad thats not gonna work instead tell her you admire how she has set out to respect you and value you despite the age difference and that you dont want this mistake that you dont necessarily agree was a mistake but can respect she does to damage the great relationship you have now nine years later as equals the only person who can offer any particular helpful explanations is her and shes not doing that shes said no to speaking to a doctor or therapist who could help her do that you dont get to know right now of course pregnancy hormones could be impacting her but if she wont speak to a doctor about her emotional state then there is nothing you can do about that it really sounds like youre looking for ways to make her change back and that isnt going to work you can only address the things shes doing and saying to you and what youre willing to accept in the friendship stop trying to change her admit it when you cannot support her or accept her negativity telling her that isnt leaving her in the dark place not telling her the truth is abandoning her and will leave her more confused and hurt that her longtime friends dont want to talk to her anymore at least give her the respect of telling her why youre withdrawing from these conversations cause she already knows youre not happy with her and youre withdrawing from her i require monogamy sexual exclusivity in a partner put it to him that plainly we all have fantasies and crushes you cannot do everything or everyone in life you want too if you do not want an open relationship of any kind say so clearly and firmly if you never want a threesome or never with this particular woman hes been crushing on for ages say so directly your boyfriend and immature and craves validation its not the sort of guy id want to even have an open relationship with to be honest openness and nonmonogamy requires way more selfawareness consideration and rationality than hes displayed here so far you dont have to be friends with someone you dont
