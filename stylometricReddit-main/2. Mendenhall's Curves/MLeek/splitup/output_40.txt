years with two kids involved probably gonna require a conversation i cant confront her about it because it would reveal that i checked her phone which would be a huge breach of trust that could ruin our relationship op said he risked his marriage he should know piling on her is some self righteous fun times for internet randos but shes not here op is op needs to talk to his damn wife if youre ready to walk away from this relationship then walk trying to force his parents not to invite her to easter was foolish at the very least trying to change his mothers traditions for who she includes at family dinners was out of line and plainly stupid of you you picked a very specific fight with his mother through him which you were not going to win if you were serious about not attending with her then the actual boundary was just to let him know to send you regrets to his mothers and that youd be spending the holiday with your own family not to try to change the invite list thats not a boundary thats just being bratty and pushy with your bf of three months family that so was not a smart move but besides that your bf has been clear about his priorities and the boundaries he wants with her and they dont meet your needs stop fighting a war youve already lost and in the future dont try to pick fights with mothers over the guests they frequently invite into their own homes a half a year of a break is just a breakup a chickenshit slowmoving break up he may not have been trying to fuck with your brain but he certainly didnt give a rats ass if he did at some point there is not much difference between this level of childish stupidity and selfishness and malice block him everywhere hes trash and youre good to be rid of him dude youre almost 30 so yeah wise up love is not enough for a single parent you also need to be compatible with the child and the family life the parent wants for the child your anxiety with the child and with her coparent after nine months of dating was a pretty reasonable dealbreaker for her to have it doesnt matter if the kid loves you the sorts of thoughts you were describing having about the child and the ex were toxic af youre not compatible you should probably avoid dating single parents its okay to not be good at it but its important to know that about yourself warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info this was my thought and i felt a bit bad about it this woman is gorgeous and has beautiful breasts they would probably change drastically if she tried to loose enough weight for a flat tummy look when i have less of a pouch i also have far less tits i like my stomach the most at about 135 lbs but i love my tits at 160 lbs this would be a reaching a dealbreaker for me my ex did this too compared me to toxic and abusive women he knew or had heard of when i expressed totally reasonable boundaries or feelings i sat quietly trying to talk to him about money while he compared me to a woman who had stabbed her husband talked to him about how he had insulted and undermined me in front of others and he compared me to a woman who had driven her husbands car into a tree to punish him i honestly didnt realize until that relationship was over how totally absurd this behavior was it was emotionally abusive and a silencing tactic basically anything i thought or felt that was inconvenient for him was crazy or toxic there was no way for me to say anything he didnt like without being treated like a potentially violent lunatic the issue wasnt how i said it the issue was he never ever want to have to listen to it realistically if youve checked out of the relationship then youre almost certainly going to end up leaving and taking goober thats just the most likely outcome of what youve described here no matter how much you say you cannot do that you do all the animal caretaking this relationship is going to end and youre going to end up taking the dog because youre the one whose life accommodates the dogs daily needs that is almost certainly what is going to happen the faster you and your bf admit to yourselves the better off all three of you will be if you want to be sneaky about it start paying for all the vet care and dog food having the receipts will be a good idea if your bf tries to challenge the reality of this situation when you inevitably break up some people are really bad at making choices or expressing those choices clearly to others for lots of reasons most people are not consciously stringing anyone along they just dont know what they dont know they tell you the best truth theyve got at the time its on you to walk away if a relationship of any kind its not meeting your needs this isnt about women or even really all that much about dating you can have totally similar communication issues and indecision dynamics with coworkers friends or family members this is an advice sub so the advice is dating is hard most connections will not go anywhere women are human dont become bitter and resentful about women just because youre inclined to date human women i cant imagine i would either but nothing about any of this gets addressed here until op talks to his damn wife youve been advised to speak to your wife youve been advised to stop this risky pinning for other womens attention and validation youve been advised to increase your therapy sessions take this over to rventing if you just need to type out your troubles over and over again youve been given all the sensible advice a person can get there is no magical answer that the internet is withholding from you the answer you dont like is the only answer there is no way forward without revealing you checked her phone admitting wrongdoing aand asking her the questions that frighten you and dealing with the consequences you know it could be just friendly i use it with my sisters because we blow kisses all the time you also know it probably isnt just friendly and that at very least its a behaviour youre uncomfortable with sorry but im not buying your minimization here you know this snopping risks your marriage you have done this before and you will do it again this was not a onceoff youre checking up on her by violating her privacy thats the marriage youre in right now this is the marriage youre going to be in until you make different choices play stupid games win stupid prizes your current plan is gradeschoollevel shadethrowing youre a 40yearold guy with two kids do better talk to your wife wildly the cdc puts it at like 4363 for womenmen so 44x more whod have thought the cdc would be fooled him and several other people not just the two of them pretty standard practice for young academics at conferences i snuck six of in once because money is tight and conferences are vital exactly this lob this grenade back into their home and tell them to sort their own shit and leave you out of it youre not the other woman in their shitty little drama shes not the villain but she is treating op like shit because she cannot stand up for herself that is manipulative and childish she probably should feel insecure but that doesnt make it ops job to protect her from the reality of the man shes planning to marry i wouldnt do it quite like this if op further enmeshes themselves and opens up the risk of debatenegotiation with a timeline threat if op is going to show mark the letter better to just do the thing rip the bandaid right off if op has an email for them both cc them both on the same email thank her for her message and say you absolutely understand her feelings and agree with her you absolutely will respect her wishes and not attend the wedding however you also will not lie to mark about the reason you are declining the invite and ask them to kindly not involve you further in any disagreement where did they fuck he kissed her once and op ended contact for months because it wasnt what she wanted at all ill agree op isnt blameless but at this point shes just an inflatable bat these two morons are hitting each other with she didnt cause that mark and his fiance are telling this little drama tale and cast her in this bullshit role it doesnt matter how wellwritten it is what happened here is that this woman put op in an impossible position where no matter what op does she has to be the bad guy either she lies to a friend or she shows up when she knows shes uninvited all because this engaged woman cannot speak transparently and honestly with her fiance its manipulative bullshit being earnest about your manipulation and dishonesty doesnt change the core of the behaviour if it were me id be livid with both of these people for putting me in this situation and send a photo of the letter to them both tell them of course i will not attend and to sort their shit out without involving me further this friendship with mark is probably over because they are both a shitshow you should be opting out of anyways you dont go you tell him youre absolutely 100 not going to go you understand her reasons and you agree with her that its best you dont attend and you show him the letter its not okay for her to keep these secrets or burden you with them your loyalty is not to her its to him dont go to the wedding regardless tell him as much because of course you shouldnt go if the bride doesnt want you there but also dont let her turn you into her own dirty little secret thats not what you are you are his friend so you show him the letter shes not protecting mark shes protecting herself she figured out a power to move to absolve herself and make you the bad guy no matter what you choose so choose friendship give him the truth wish him well stay the hell away from his wedding i get missing that but really that should be resolvable by ya know i miss that every once and a while you damn better get outta bed and come down the hall for fun times again i get being nervous about how this might change your patterns and dynamic but put your big girl pants on this is part of what getting older together looks like sort your shit out and stop talking about divorcing your husband because you might not be able to share a bed every night you must realize that is not the place to start this problem solving effort you really cannot wrap your brain around having spontaneous sex but not in the hour right before you two go to bed its not really that spontaneous if its only happening in the bedroom during the eveningnight is it thats sure not what spontaneous sex means to me youre 44 i get being nervous about this change but give your head a damn shake this
