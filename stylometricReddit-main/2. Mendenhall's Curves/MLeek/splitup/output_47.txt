boil down to dont be in a marriage you dont want to be in if you were actually trying to punish her if you skipped getting medications she thought you would get without telling her then you were engaging in abuse outright deliberate act of abuse of your partner if you genuinely forgot that is something different the lack of sex should have nothing nothing at all to with you communicating clearly whether or not you were able to pick up necessary medications on time these are not related issues you need mental health support this is above the pay grade for rando advice online we cannot tell you if youre relationship is abusive based on what youve shared here you may have reasons for concern but you havent expressed those reasons here what i can tell you is that the story youre telling right now about this event doesnt line up with the reaction and fears youre expressing the two things arent in sync that doesnt mean your reaction isnt normal but it does mean you havent been able to line up your feelings and your words with your reality describing it as cuddling but then checking carefully for bruising just doesnt make rational sense one of those two things is not reflecting reality take those questions to a pro was there a reason you set this boundary in the first place has he tried to choke you previously are there are other behaviors he engages in that you think might be abusive as well do you have some past trauma that can help you understand why you reacted the way you did attempts at choking are absolutely abusive and are the kind of abuse that is likely to escalate it doesnt appear here that either of you believed there was any intent to choke you it seems that you both understand that a boundary was violated accidentally or do you think someone else happened here besides that i think youd benefit from getting some mental health support your reaction doesnt quite make sense in the context youve provided here you could use some more support and a place to talk through the full details of what happened and what you thought about it stick to your no it is sad but your answer was the right one editing services are professional services professionals are trained and they get paid your father is asking your dedicated many hours to someone hes treating as a hobby if he is not willing to pay for those professional services and its not your hobby if it was a profession hed be at least trying to engage and step up to paying a professional editor and it sounds like hes not pleasant for an editor to work with is he youre 22 your focus should be on your own path forward not on the potential family income from the book sales tell him you just cant commit the kind of time hes looking for and dont have the skills he needs to elevate his work let him pout it out rachel renee russell makes very literally millions of dollars a year her daughter minored majored and education and minored in fine arts at the university of michigan she is being compensated for professional services shes not supporting her mothers hobby for shits and giggles and thank yous yes shes an adult you must tell her if shes concerned there has been an error that might be additionally stressful for her tell her what you did so she can plan appropriately hey i didnt want this to confuse or worry you but i wanted to give you this gift at this difficult time and i added 1000 to your account with your case worker they know they know why they are unsafe he at least doesnt care being a safe respectful place for you is not something he values explaining will not make him care it will only make you more vulnerable to his bad behaviour dont do that definitely dont do it yet just tell your mother the hard facts of what is going to happen next you will not be in his company again from here on out you will not speak to him or see him you do not want an apology you want zero contact with him you are cutting him out of your life entirely she is welcome in your life only if she respects that he is not be clear if that includes not talking about him his opinions or any of her issues with him if this means only seeingvisiting her outside of their shared home say so be brutally clear this should really not be neogiatable hes out neither he nor she is to ask about him being let back in if you ever feel ready to tolerate his presence again in any way you can initiate that conversation if they try to pressure you hang up leave walk away its not a conversation you will consent to be a part of if your mother cannot respect those terms go extremely low contact until she realizes its that or nothing you are not a bad person this is clearly a situation where you have to put your own oxygen mask on first you cannot help your mother right now with her relationship no one is only awful to their female partners a person who can betray in that context will betray in others generally speaking if there is a risk of physical unsafety i think you have a responsibility to either tell the other person or to end all contact with the person who is harming them i wouldnt stand by and watch my friend punch his gf i wont stand by and watch him betray her sexually either if you really cannot tell her then the least you can do is draw firm boundaries and let him know he can no longer confide in you how he harming her well then tell jake that you know my bf ryan lives there and well probably see him in the evenings a few times assuming you actually want to go with jake just say no i mean it doesnt sound like you want too anyways there has been a misunderstanding and it might not be malicious you travel frequently to x to see your boyfriend if you go youll be spending a fair bit of time with your bf if jake is welcome then say that but be clear your bf lives there and would be a priority for any visit you made its that simple dont try to read jakes mind or defend any feelings youre assuming he has just tell him plainly what the deal is its always valid for people to invite who they wanna invite and lots of people dont like hanging out with couples but its obviously silly to go to where your bf lives and expect to not include him in at least most activities it sounds like youre making a bigger deal of this than you need too it your partner feels they are missing something of great value in your shared sex life its on them to bring that up openly and respectfully stop twisting yourself into knots to provide something hes not even asking for you dont find pleasure in it makes sense you dont have a prostate if you dont want to do it dont stop assuming its a such a big deal for him when hes not even expressing that your emotions are interfering and that is a thing you can talk about but it does mean the way youre currently engaging in the friendship isnt working for you youre gonna have to think about what you need to do differently to allow this to be just a friendship and to kill the inappropriate expectations you have of him as just a friend that probably means contact needs to be reduced for a while and you need to quit the social media stalking behaviors that are upsetting you hes not your bf youre not in the kind of relationship where its appropriate to ask him to moderate his behavior like that think about the boundaries you need to have for yourself do you need to stop following him in ig for a while do you need to admit youre not actually friends because your feelings run too deep for that you can end a friendship if it leaves you feeling conflicted and unhappy doing this without her consent is disgusting no pass on that youre not a child that is knowable that was not okay what if a coworker or friend saw it thought she was cheating on her husband or that you had an open marriage give your head a shake youre not this stupid but no the fact that realizing her attractiveness to other people made you more attractive to you is rather shallow but perfectly human basically the entire physiological core behind kinks like hotwifing and cuckolding what you need to learn how to do is find your eurake moments without acting like a little shit first i think you need to accept he doesnt want to understand it the problem isnt with your communication there isnt some perfect way you can phrase this to make him get the message his current comfort is dependent on him not getting the message if he got the message he wouldnt get what he wants so he wont he is not confused respect me as an equal and a partner when it comes to money matters and household chore division is not that hard or complicated hes choosing not to listen to you when you say things he doesnt like 100 this is totally me man have reason you lady have feelings me right you wrong i hope op can move pass the gaslighting and misplaced empathy to the boundaries and gtfo stage of this how the hell did you end up living with someone who refuses to communicate with you about money or about division of labour that stonewalling shit is absolutely misogynistic thats not a feels thats a reality of a man who thinks the big calls are his to make and yours to live with you cant make it right you made a choice that choice had consequences you can and should apologize and admit wrong going without any excuse then leave him alone hes made his call his call was clear and reasonable sometimes you just dont get to make it right the wrong stands all you can is be better next time pets dont come into a home without all the adults in that household being fully onboard there is no such thing as a pet that has zero impact on the other person if youre not comfortable being the back up caregiver for a snake no snake full stop i mean its a views and followers economy and apologies are good content why wouldnt they post apologies oh hes just a chicken shit a gameplaying chicken shit telling you would have felt awkward and vulnerable so he didnt talking about your past sex life was way more fun and thats the best case scenario you know exactly what the worst case is reconsider being his friend he wasnt prepared to treat you like one really cause it seems like hes the one still at the teat here im sorry but that was extremely conveniently naive of you hes fine with his mothers behaviour because it means he doesnt have to be accountable to her or to you financially hes comfortable with the trade off of her behaviour for her cash thats not gonna change either live with it or escape it yeah bf sounds like a little shit who is happy to let mommy and gf fight it out passive aggressively because neither of them are willing to point at
