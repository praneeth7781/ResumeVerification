because he wants her to be dont sit around waiting to catch him break up with him because he doesnt value consent and that is dangerous and unworthy of trust fantasizing inside your own brain is entirely different than choosing to curate photos of people you know and wank to them reprosing photos is an action not a just a private thought only shitty little boys who dont care about consent or respect women like to pretend it isnt because the violation of women they know is pat of what they are enjoying if it wasnt theyd happily use all that free porn no problem the violation is the point the lack of consent is the point get rid of him nah that would result in only contestants who had some fundamental relationship skills and were capable of transparency and honesty with those closest to them then there wouldnt be a show seems like his mom just wouldnt sign a waiver it was just awful i had to fast forward a bit because paul was working so hard to ignore how awful they were without insulting them directly i suspect this is not his first encounter with mean girls but how he didnt realize micah was one i dont know queen bee brunette was clearly deeply jealous and tossing shade in each of those compliments to micah knowing that sloshed blondey would do the dirty work for her and lord did she i was just shocked that micah immediately defended her friends totally vague something or other complaint about him he was too articulate not self depreciating enough for her tastes i dunno my 3 year old niece better communicates her upsets than that woman did the nicest thing i can say about kwame right now is that even he doesnt deserve micah your bf used his sister to take the heat for him when his friends sexualized one of their little sisters look your bf isnt treating any woman that well if he only treats them well in private and not when they are being exposed to abuse and ridicule withdraw your ultimatum dont let your bf think its your job or his sisters job to fight his fights for him dont let him make that the womans job too hes quickly becoming the kind of guy who blames the women for making him not be a creep so he doesnt loose too much face with the asshole men expect him to demand his friends treat others with respect if he really cannot hack that dump him dont ride this out for long he will use you and your anger as a shield from real consequences for he behaviour he is part of and is condoning and he will let them mock your rage to keep his friendship if hell do it to his own sister hell do it you all you can do is give good advice ideally kind and compassionate advice objectively the age difference alone and the newness of the relationship are plenty enough to caution against a legal contract but its not clear from your question that either of them are actually rushing into it stop calling her a divorcee and a single mother as if these are insults it makes you sound like youre in your 80s screaming at kids to get off your lawn you will quite rightly loose credibility if you dont accept that single parents and divorcees are not damaged goods shes not in a situation shes living a normal perfectly valid and successful life by all reports here and her career is the couples business not yours if this is a mistake its your sons to make ask him questions be concerned for his happiness give him advice final decisions belong to him insulting her personally isnt going to change that its okay going to make you appear judgmental and unreliable you dont need to understand youre 40 be the adult here and cut him out hes clearly a toxic child who brings nothing of value to your life how is this even a question he played out his milf fantasy and made some money while he did it hopefully you enjoyed youre bizarre barely legal fun times too now he gets to play with you like a toy whenever hes bored no get rid of him block him everywhere seehs youre not crazy and the hard truth is youre going to need to leave to change this dynamic im the eldest daughter of 8 children google eldest daughter syndrome and you will find you are not alone in your frustrations many are subjected to parentification like you have been in many cases like yours the finances of large families make it seem necessary but its still not healthy or kind while trying to speak to your mom is good please recognize that real change is going to come from you if your mom saw this problem clearly shed address it but she seems to be trying to foist it off on your dad instead of tackling it as as a team so the odds are against that happening reinvest in trying to find a job summer camp work can be a great place for your elder sister skills to shine with appropriate compensation and long periods away from home start saving obsessively and secretly plot your pathway out of this home inside this home you will always be the eldest daughter only when you leave can you become an individual just a sister and a daughter like you deserve to be excuse me youre right i need to be inclusive of my insane sisters women arent a monolith we dont share a hive mind were basically sane individuals like men if youre looking to start a family you should absolutely move to a lower cost of living area most women who want children will very very rationally balk at 33k in greater london if parenting is a goal you should probably make some changes to make that more feasible and as quickly as you can thats not about providing a lifestyle thats about being a compatible partner your heart isnt gonna pay for summer camp or piano lessons very few women will feel secure having a family with you because women are basically rational if youre looking simply date your financial health and living within your means is probably more important when it comes to compatibility youre not compatible with women who want a provider so dont pretend you are dating is hard everyone is screwed youre less of an outlier than you realize its just that hard if he wont acknowledge that he owes it to you and to this marriage to work on the issue that exists solely inside of his head and results in completely inappropriate and disrespectful behaviour towards you then there is nothing you can to do fix this he can moderate both his feelings and his responses he does so successfully in many areas of his life he needs to recognize this one area where the skill is lacking and must be developed there is no resolution without that accountability and realization you cannot support him out of this until he is dedicated to walking the path out of it if youre never going to get angry with him for this behaviour and never admit its damaging or endangering then the relationship then its less likely hell ever be motivated to do that work the status quo works for him if you simply walk on eggs shells until hes triggered absorb this behaviour each time and accept apologies without any real commitment to change if you do that it becomes your operating agreement its the relationship youre both choosing bf i need to be allowed to be angry with you sometimes i am angry with you and disappointed in your contributions this isnt surprising or unfair i understand this hurts your feelings im glad it hurts your feelings because that means you give a damn and i need you to give enough of a damn to change it adhd creates struggles not assholes it can require some grace but not a free pass on off all the basics certainly not a free pass on saying shitty things like we need to do better when they do not contribute is an existing issue your bf needs to recognize he needs to be a full participant in problem solving that doesnt mean he needs to be perfect but that means recognizing your frustrations are valid and worthy of a thoughtful response not a temper tantrum its okay if its not worth the risk to you right now if youre consistently finding the conversation is getting to the we should probably meet phase and you just dont want too for whatever reason then take a damn break from the apps dating is risky mostly emotionally this fear of multiple peoples crazy exes seems a bit catastrophizing to me but if that is where youre at stop fighting it while chatting with individuals examine those anxieties on your own for a bit and rethink your goalsboundaries i keep myself safe by picking the place a friend knows where i am and basic info of who im meeting and if i am even the least bit uncomfortable taking a very roundabout way home but most importantly i dont date when im not excited to date if it seems not worth the trouble or stress i pause the apps and go touch grass for a few months
