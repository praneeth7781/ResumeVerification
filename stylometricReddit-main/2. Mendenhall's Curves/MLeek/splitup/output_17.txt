less obese than american counterparts probably a lot of reasons some just around portions sure but also i expect that better access to preventive medical care means we may get the heads up earlier if were at risk that doesnt change your responsbilty to this relationship your responsibility is to end it its not reasonable or kind to sit back and say well he hasnt left me yet so its his own damn fault hes still dating an addict its not all his fault you fully share the blame when you allow a relationship to continue where you know for a fact you are not offering them what they say they need youve already made it clear youre not going to accept this ultimatum which means you must end the relationship nothing else is acceptable yes the relationship should end if you dont want to abandon your lifestyle of using its really not any more complicated than that youre not dedicated to your sobriety he wants a sober partner its time for one of you to end this its not all on him its your job too dont encourage him to leave walk away because you are not offering him what he has told you he needs this is on you stop trying to make it all his job to leave you he should but youre just as responsible for the end as he is extremely skewed this is a relationship your wife has formed its not a mechanic for humans im concerned you continue to gloss over the fact you are eavesdropping that needs to stop completely and forever the only information you are privy to about her therapy is the information she shares with you youre missing mine there is no situation in which is acceptable for you to sit and listen to your wifes therapy like this without both her permission and the therapists you describing hearing way to much and forming far too deep an opinion for it to be accidental and even if you insist this was accident you dont appear to realize it cannot happen again we dont know the therapist sucks right now neither do you we do know you are not holding yourself to an appropriate standard when it comes to your wifes privacy because you have told us you are not this is staggeringly inappropriate and disrespectful why do think this is an okay way for you to behave do you sit beside her at every dental cleaning to hear what the dentist says read all of her emails examine her shit before shes allowed to flush you need to quit this you do not know what is going on with your wife but i dont know what is going on with you but you have some of your own shit to figure out here this is not cool hit the breaks hard and put these assumptions aside and absolutely stop eavesdropping leave the house if you cant help but overhear shit that shouldnt even need to be said you dont know what goes on in that room your envisioning is counterproductive and unhelpful it is extremely unlikely the therapist drastically changed their approach unless your wife askedindicated they do so what is far far more likely is your wife changed what she is listening to and how she is engaging with the therapy instead ask your wife pointed questions about what tools she was recommended for this situation encourage her to ask her therapist for tactics or techniques focus on how that approach was initially helpful to her in the early stages her time was not a waste you saw the things of value she was getting out of it previously finally recognize that a therapist saying yes that is difficult and yes that does suck is perfectly valid and helpful and that your wife was entitled to change how she engaged with therapy you cannot manage your way out of every stressor and difficulty in life sometimes shit just sucks for a while dont assume your wife needs to be further fixed or just has to do better that sounds to me like a bit of toxicity positivity sneaking in what she might actually need from you as well at the moment is just the validation that yes this is hard hard things are hard sometimes there isnt much better to be had or to be done and we just live through the hard bits just decline the future plans if you want to continue to rebuild a relationship with olivia invite her to oneonone things and not double dates i wouldnt inform her unless she asked this is what a responsible civil defence looks like when the accused is definitely guilty of way way worse than the issue at hand they just need the court to put a on this one so they can go home without admitting to something thatll get him more than a fine yeah dont do it just tell her youre really happy for her but you have confirmed to attend an engagement party now and arent able to make it at that time try to book another time to see her in the near future maybe make some nice oneonone time planned with her during your mothers day trip you can also tell her that while she may be ready to forgive her bf youre fed up with him treating your sister like dirt and will be minimizing the time you spend near him this is manipulation while it is true that anyone can and should leave a marriage that isnt working when someone is constantly holding a gun to the head of the relationship threatening to shoot if they dont get everything they want then youre not in a partnership anymore youre in a hostage situation dont tolerate the word divorce being thrown around lightly if he says he wants a divorce tell him he is welcome to one if he wants out you want him to get out but he is not welcome to constantly threaten you with one just to get his way tell him it doesnt matter if its love or lust its unwelcome this is boundarybusting unwelcome behavior if he wants to respect your marriage and respect you as an individual then you expect him to respect you right now when you ask him to quit this permanently if he doesnt immediately correct himself or if he begs or bargains or tries to say youve just misunderstood then he values his idea being in love but not lust with you over his actual friendship with the human being you actually are in which case get rid of him own your own shit i would appreciate it if youd get a checkup i dont want to keep talking about the maybes i care about you and it would make me feel more secure to know he may still say no but at least youll have been honest about what you are actually feeling and not beating around the bush trying to make him feel the same way you do yeah no im sticking with my reasonable assumption that he is making the purchase and they are paying him back the comment above refers to them still needing to pay him back even if they couldnt go because they are not refundable hes the one with the membership so hes making the purchase to get a better rate hes tasked with buying the tickets they are paying him back for their share this op would be very very clear if he was the one paying for all three of them each time hes not gonna let that be unclear if he was gifting his buddies to a trip to the movies once a month probably and if it was him going about his previous plans is the best way to deny her the control and not let this tactic work i mean i wouldnt want to date someone i suspected of that but short of breaking up that is his only option its not like he can force her to go to work it may be petty to force a verbal agreement i actually like usqitten suggestion here way more than mine do that listen to upurveyorofsocks this is not how socks are to be purveyed i dont want to turn this in to a family vacation to serve my own needs okay but consider how that conversation was from her perspective that is exactly what it seemed you were trying to achieve even though some of the boys werent free anyways that would be a very reasonable pov for her to have here she planned x trip with her and one son and friends and you tried to turn it into y whole family trip you said y was important and how you wanted to spend the money then you didnt answer but im assuming here you did nothing else about actually making y happen but remain quietly upset and asked no further questions about her plans for x look shes not here to give advice too id be telling her to validate your feelings and recognize the important of shared meaningful activities but youre the one here and youre fighting the wrong battle and not working for or planning or advocating for the family vacation you told her you valued take it to the counsellor if you need help getting back on track he should be ashamed for leaving cum socks shoved in the couch cushions if he is feeling shame he is responding like a rational person to be caught out being an inconsiderate slob dont let him pretend hes so stupid that he didnt know this wasnt respectful behaviour in shared spaces you already apologized for making jokes and making light of the situation you can repeat that if youd like however his behaviour does need to change you being insensitive doesnt mean he gets to shove x many more socks into the couch you both know that youve got other issues in your relationship that got pulled into this fight acknowledge that say it out loud you know youre both frustrated about other things as well when it comes to sex but for this very specific subject youd like him to agree there will be no more cum socks shoved in the couch cushions and what did she say about the idea of also planning a family vacation with you and the rest of the kids have you taken any steps yourself or put any of your energy into this or suggested any possible future plans on this if you want to plan something as a couple or a family vacation then you should do that and advocate for that with her but you can value that and your time together as a family without going on the attack with other plans she might also value especially if cost isnt a key issue here trying to turn something which someone else invited her and one son on into a family vacation to serve your emotional needs when some of the other kids arent even free to go anyways was not a great move your feelings are valid but that doesnt mean every single way you may handle them is particularly wise i think you reacted from a really emotional place understandable but not entirely fair and her response was predictable if she had wanted you to come she had the opportunity to frame it that way she wanted it to be okay that youre not included you need to back this way up valuing having a family vacation is just dandy only deciding you value that because you felt left out in this case and dont like this plan is hurtful hes a mooch 38yearold men arent this stupid unless its a useful tactic invite him to prioritize himself fully you look for someone who
