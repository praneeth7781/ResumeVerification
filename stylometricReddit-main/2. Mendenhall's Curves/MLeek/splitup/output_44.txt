to be even worse some of the stuff i heard from people who assumed she was my child including from adult woman would make you vomit it was upsetting to the point my mother started to avoid me being left alone in public spaces with my littlest sister solving a problem responsibly and making healthy choices for yourself is an attractive quality in a grown up these are your insecurities thats okay you came by them honestly but dont force them into the mouths of the people who care for you eh reddit skews young and youll get a lot of responses from teenagers and young 20s somethings who are still all up in their own childhood trauma and teenage resentments this is much more of an adult 3040s sort of relationship management question i think it takes a bit more distance to see something like this more clearly however valid annes anger or boundaries are she doesnt get to require you to punish beth for her for the rest of beths life that is not a reasonable expectation of you youre entitled to attempt to form your own adult relationship with beth independent of anne and of your parents my parents have failed both daughters in every possible way this its this this is the problem and you cannot solve it for the rest of them your parents created all of these monsters and continue to support and feed the beasts they will not be slain by you alone the only thing you can do is the thing you have done included beth in your own conception of your own family it might now work out but only by doing the work to create a connection there yourself just between you two will you learn what beth is actually capable of and might want in her connections with family members ignore annes bullying remain polite as you can be as you either accept or decline invitations from anne largely you should decline to speak to anne about beth or beth about anne you may also consider inviting your parents andor beth to your place at any time you know anne is busy with her inlaws or is away on vacation or the link that is a bit underhanded but it will minimize her fits and when she complains about the distance when you next invite her you can remind her how unhappy she seemed to be when you invited your parents while she was busy if your niece is small try to maintain contact with her on holidays by sending a card or small gift even if youre not going to attend its good to maintain that holiday connection with a small child in this situation even as you need to balance other obligations and events end contact religating the break up is petty and counterproductive youre going to have to live with and learn from your own regret of not breaking up with him sooner when you should have because he was mean you cannot control the story he tells himself just stop listening to it by ending all contact with him if there are laws in your country that preventing you from working without your parents consent then youd probably benefit way more from local advice most users on rrelationships are americans or from other very western societies what is it your mother wants you to do in the next few years if she doesnt want you to work do you age out of the law at some point are allowed to work without her permission the fight about who talks longer is a distraction the fight you need to have is the one where you tell him his actions do not reflect respect or that he values what you to say he is expressing frustration that he doesnt know what is up with you but he is also sending you silencing messages when you try to communicate communication doesnt just mean you trying harder to be heard by him or adapting yourself so you can somehow get through to him it must also include him making real effort to listen and understand and yes that does take work work you are naturally putting in when he speaks work he has probably does naturally with nearly everyone else in his life that he values work he also has to put in to listening and understanding you youre never going to prove to him something he doesnt want to believe because it doesnt reflect the story and the role hes assigned to you challenege the story head on the story of my partner doesnt have meaingful things to say or if she just said it the way i wanted to hear it id listen it may be time to state clearly that the story needs to change and the behavior needs to change or the partnership will have to change in response that is pretty extreme i always think its fun to tell them toronto is slightly bigger than chicago which both have about the same population as brooklyn and watch them recalculate i never mind people not knowing that relative size stuff but the electricity and igloos things bug me tho i give your sealioning a solid b transparent and a bit of a slip admitting that you werent asking in good faith to begin with but still a wellexecuted online rhetorical maneuver that will fool some readers why on earth would i talk to you after that closing comment seriously use your head thats not how we express honest curiosity or ask for favours read through the rest of this thread for specific examples of normalized nudity and toplessness or use google i dont service the curiosity of people who speak to me that way it doesnt suggest good faith engagement at all and im not here to address your personal life experience youd be shocked by the number of americans who have asked me about igloos and sled dogs when tell them im canadian and no only a few of them were joking i can see new york state from my house on most days but they act like i live on a different planet closure is bullshit closure is what you find and create for yourself when you let go of what no longer serves you or what is unkowable it rarely if ever comes through conversations with others this isnt about andrew the person anymore this is about andrew the bad mental habit you break this habit with the same sort of strategies youd use to stop picking your nose or biting your nails use unpleasant interruptions to those thoughts and willpower recognize this is really about ego and about the story in your head and about the fact that no person with one life to live can follow all paths not about the man warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info stop acting like its that simple and safe to stand up for yourself in every context women are not magically born knowing how to deal perfectly with these bullies but we learn quickly there can be consequences to ourselves for telling them off in class or in the workplace like murder murder is an actual risk for a woman if she chooses to tell him off pick the wrong guy and you can be shamed at school or work suffer harassment for years or possibly even get killed stop expecting women to roll those dice each time someone is rude to her in a way them in a way that hurts the bfs fee fees its normal if youre not comfortable dont go over on hot days do not try to educate them they are not savages or ignorant youre the one here is who isnt progressive and if you are an american its a good moment to learn that what you think is leftist or progressive is the states is still pretty damn rightleaning in most of the rest of the developed world obamas policies were centreright on a global scale rarely left of centre by most other places standards american politics have been dragged so far to the extreme right that what you think is insanely progressive barely scratches the surface in most places but this doesnt even necessarily exist on a political spectrum for them its simply normal in a lot of places youre the one who has been misinformed by a culture that views womens bodies are inherently sexual and prioritizes performative modesty over womens actual comfort youre 16 youre describing dating youre describing a normal failure rate for dating you go out you mostly dont vibe the vast vast vast majority doesnt get past the talkingfirst date stage thats dating youre also describing a rather normal amount of selfcentredness for most teenagers youve had maybe two years behind you where you were capable of doing anything like actually dating another human being you have like 60 ahead of you relax youre not a narcissist if you were you wouldnt worry about this and youd easily fool people into thinking you were kind and empathetic to get your way the fact you are aware of this and concerned by it probably means youre not quite as bad as you think you are practice active listening and consideration with other people in your life recognize that a huge part of your overtalking is probably your nerves dont get so wound up about dates i like to think of a first date as a predate its a meeting where we both decide if we even want to have an actual date if im really nervous i even think of a few questions i can ask the other person to get them talking about their interests for a bit youre honestly doing just fine the worst thing you can do is get all up in your own head about your own perceived terrible flaws at the age of 16 they become selffulfilling prophecies your experiences sound well within the normal and you should have some learning to do everyone does at 16 let the rest of this bs go this im also a nonamerican who has dated in the us i may be compatible with a uk or canadian moderate because in most other places moderate includes some basic social supports and some degree of abortion access but i wont risk it with an american one american moderates arent moderate at best they just dont give a fuck come on youre 30 give yourself a swift kick you knew it was relevant it was emotionally relevant for both of you you kept context from him that a rational person could have assumed hed like to have you left him feeling played him for a fool so as to avoid feeling embarrassed and vulnerable yourself its easy to say you dont owe anyone the details and thats technically true but if you want to build a serious connection with someone then trust doesnt work on technicalities anymore you dodged a conversation that you should have as a rational adult realized may have been important to a serious partner maybe you didnt want it to me important mahybe you were worried they would put too much or the wrong kind of importance on it but clearly was important enough to you that you were motivated to avoid it and took the risk away by keeping him in the dark that wasnt considerate of his feelings it wasnt very fair to either of you if his response hurt you by all means say so but also recognize your choice to withhold this information however much it was technically your right to do so probably also hurt him thats valid too a reasonable person could have assumed this was information hed rather have than not have as a
