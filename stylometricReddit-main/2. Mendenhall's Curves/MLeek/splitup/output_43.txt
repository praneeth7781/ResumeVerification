you are thoughtful and picky about where you put your energy with straight men you get the doublewhammy of those who are just not interested and those who absolutely cannot handle assertive women and its not like they wear labels a lot of guys think they want to be pursued or propositioned or seduced until it actually happens and they either arent in the individual woman or are just deeply uncomfortable with the dynamic in the end i just had to admit i didnt want to be with a man who couldnt handle me expressing my interest clearly anyway and roll with those punches straight up my sewing machine takes way more technical skill and knowledge to maintain and repair than my gaming laptop id like to see this dude even manage to thread an overlocker sesh whose gonna tell him that the pretty cashier is also only just pretending to give a damn if he had a nice day or not and might even cash out black men and wish them a nice day those lying lawbreakers and she gets to be annoyed with you and doubtful of you you can keep repeating yourself if youd like but im gonna stop now tell yourself whatever story you want about your own motivations your gf is perfectly reasonable to be both annoyed with you and skeptical of you you can dig your heels and get your way probably but her feelings are understandable and valid and it doesnt reflect great on you that you cannot be pleasant to her friend and colleague from work over a drink or two holiday or no thats not selfish that is you be a competent adult date another competent adult drinks with a local friend is usually a great idea while on holiday unless it would take some massive investment of time or money in order to meet up with this friend it sounds like youre being petty and insecure the real question here is are you comfortable with the friends with benefit role youve accepted with this man which includes this level of emotional labour and intimacy friends with benefit arrangements come in lots of shapes and styles we cannot read his mind any better than you can but this questions suggests you have concerns about what youve agreed too with him and what youve being involved in its totally fair to be hurt it probably would be wise to ask her about it asking her does risk more pain but not knowing it likely worse by admitting youre hurt you give her a chance to acknowledge you even if shed have made different choices and at least youll better understand its not a fight theres nothing to fight about she cant make it not hurt you and you cant change her mind its probably gonna suck just try to understand one another great then you know that youre not his clinician and you know to stop rehearsing this fight with an imaginary version of him in your own head or working yourself into a snit with your own assumptions and actually express your own totally valid concerns and needs without the harsh judgments of his character and current choices thats the next step good luck you didnt answer any of my questions leads me to think that no you havent spoken up at all so thats a lot of lecturing directed at a random persons online with a lot of conclusions already drawn about his character and mental health all seemingly without any substantial conversation with him you must see thats rather toxic behaviour on your part to have your mind so made up about him without ever asking or listening to him on the subject check yourself put on your big girl pants be transparent about your needs and expectations but enter this important conversation with a tad more respect for differences than this youre trying to be partner youre not qualified to be his therapist and its not fair to toss these labels at him the first time youre clearly communicating your unhappy with his choices have you been this frank with him have you spelled out your expectations around meals and how much time youre willing to spend with his family also why are you framing this as a dependancy instead of a choice you say his parents arent demanding of this so your fianc is making a clear choice for himself and not even necessarily an unhealthy one just one you would like to see changed you dont have to be perfect to deserve basic respect and civility hes much too old to be treating other people like this dont date a man who cannot spend 20 mins in pleasant conversation with family members you value and be on time for a meal when he is guest always its been weeks thats not always that a significant amount of the time shes known him the forced timeline is doing them both a even bigger disservice than the others accountability cant be rushed like this bliss has totally reasonable feelings and fears that are going to keep cropping up for a while even if she is doing all the work she can to move past them forgiveness is rarely a light switch even when both people genuinely want it to be and forgiveness doesnt mean you magically feel good or the pain is erased and fully healed forgiveness is often given while were still hurting you cant punch someone in the face on tuesday apologize and tell them its in the past at lunch on wednesday while the bruise is still swelling they are going to legitimately say just because i forgive you doesnt mean there isnt still a pain nothing about this changes my advice and it doesnt reflect the respect you say you have youve shared your opinion that is what you get the risks are all hers the choice is hers shes made it you respect it or you gfto its not about you as a guy its about her interpersonal risk management there is a fine line between him being upset that he is missing out which is reasonable and him trying to throw shade or punish you for going the next time he makes a comment that stings say so ouch that hurts it feels like im being punished and thats not fair see if he can be accountable and own his own shit or if he doublesdown on blaming you for his own bad feelings sure its possible doesnt mean youre required to find it acceptable doesnt make him any less shitty doesnt mean youre in a secure and healthy relationship it doesnt make it better him being that stupid and shallow doesnt mean youre required to get over it youre making and allowing a lot of excuses for him bottom line for me would be if he actually is that stupid ignorant and careless with other women while also betraying his gf then i wouldnt date him if all your excuses are true you still shouldnt date him thats too dumb to date your boyfriend has a madonnawhore complex he is not interested in fixing inside himself if your not his perfect wifey madonna then youre trash this is a very distinct issue from not caring for tattoos people can not much like tattoos without comparing women with them to porn stars or saying shame things like wives dont have tattoos you got the ick because he treated some women as for sex and other women as for wifey and naturally many woman enjoy both and those roles are not defined by tattoos dont marry a man who can only see a woman worth on the basis of her body if you do you live with the constant risk of him deciding youre not wifey but trash and nothing you say or do will change his mind also youre likely not to have a very good sex life if he has decided its other kids of woman who are for sex and not you a man who categorizes women that way is not a safe partner you should respect her comfort level and choice on how to manage this shes the one who had to absorb all risks and consequences for any steps she takes next not you and probably not even him so if she says its not worth it then its not worth it to her end of story she handled it appropriately at the time and kept herself safe that is what matters most its bad enough he bullied her this way the whole thing just gets worse if you make it all about your feelings and opinions and try to bully her into a confrontation with him she doesnt want because your ego was bruised that someone did this to your girl back off she says its handled then its handled sleep is a vital part of human health and sanity your fianc needs to moderate his expectations and think of others ways to address any needs he has for intimacy cuddle while you are watching a movie or listening to a podcast or something for a bit before bed kick off the covers and cuddle for a bit in the morning more hugs and touches though out the everyday activities maybe sleeping time is for sleep hes the one ruining your relationship if he doesnt do that work to moderate himself and respect you you cant comprise your sleep itll literally destroy you and eventually your marriage dont marry him until he addresses this behaviour hes too old not to know better this is my thing the timeline pressure here is what is totally unreasonable in this case i mean unreasonable timelines are sorta the name of the game but still it forces them both to rush through the accountability stage straight into the honeymoon while also sorta robbing bliss of that honeymoon mexico time i worry the pressure of the show will leave zack thinking his mistake is just in the past when its totally and very literally still present in the context of the damn show and it will be for a long time even if he and bliss are great together im not in the us either but okay 36 hours is a range in which you need to manage yourself far better than this she may be disinterested and that is frustrating but one good date isnt a contract for ceaseless attention and communication youre aware us a holiday weekend and many people will be with family right on top of normal adult obligations lots of people do ghost after first dates and it sucks but your expectations for contact are excessive its barely been 12 hours get a grip you just met this woman her world doesnt revolve around you suggest a second date for sometime next week if thats what you want to see happen your anxiety is going to be your own worse enemy in this case and any other this isnt a relationship question forcing strangers and customer service reps to participate in your kink in however a small way is unethical figure your shit out and keep private cashiers arent be paid enough for whatever nonsense youre up too if you dont wish to be housewife dont marry this guy he wants a housewife and he is willing to bully and manipulate in order to get it ive had one stubborn dark hair on my chin since puberty and another joined in my mid30s never heard suggested its any sort of problem or concern mostly just trad barbs with my partner over it and his stray nose hairs my grandmother sexist as hell in her own right and shamelessly favouring her boys said maybe this man every single time my youngest sister is 13 years younger than me and let me tell you i really expected the comments
