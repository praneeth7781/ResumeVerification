more time together then simply make that plan fail spend your time as you planned too take a walk or a ride on your own meet up with a friend encourage and agree with her that she needs to manage her mental health the way she thinks is best and largely leave her to it just because youre not at work doesnt mean you are available as a caregiver at all times youre being immature and petty the only difference between these situations is your ego was the one bruised this time and your motivated reasoning to define it as somehow a bigger betrayal but your choices were innocent its total bullshit and you ought to know it if you want to be with her actually with her stop being a chicken shit and do the work stop stringing her along stop allowing yourself to be strung along either be together now both of you stop pressuring others in any way or dont no one else can tell you what choice to make or promise you itll work out but the obvious glaring problem here is that you two keep stalling out on the road to a relationship shit or get off the pot you are 19 it might suck but you need to do better than this even if you were paying her rent youd still owe another human being in the house youre staying in a bit better than what youve expressed here boundaries are good assumptions shes trying to control or manipulate you without any evidence are harmful to everyone involved including yourself frankly your mom comes across here as even more toxic than the new gf i understand being uncomfortable and having boundaries but you also need to realize that you have the power to decide not to feel guilty or obligated you have the ability to accept a gift like a young adult and acknowledge when nothing but basic friendliness is expected in return in the future if you feel this strongly about rent you need to make the agreement about rent before you arrive once youre there if she says youre a guest and you dont need to pay there isnt much you can about it maybe buy the three of you takeout once a week as a way to acknowledge and thank them until and unless this woman actually does try to hold her gifts against you find a damn bit of chill that doesnt mean accepting everything she offers but it does mean acting like an adult house guest and not an angry adolescent who isnt getting their way no store should be telling a total stranger about another customers purchases or habits but sending them photos and asking them to ban her is just silly you may embarass her out of it but did you really think a bookstore is gonna refuse her money this woman might be annoying and you should keep doing the dishes and keep your eyes open for other ways to contribute to the household but you also need to take it down like 9 notches and stop assuming malice just because your mom has her knickers in a bunch this makes me wonder if your bf believes that all familial relationships are basically womans work and that you should just be making this perfect for him without him needing to do anything at all my ex and his family was like this just a few months into dating they found it appalling that i picked up a mothers day card for my own mom but didnt get one for his mom who i had met once basically they were fine with him forgetting birthdays and events when he was single just a man cant be helped but as soon as he had a gf they all assumed it was the gfs job to keep track of these things youre not at all crazy i dont know what the red flags were but assuming you were not telling nasty lies about him then you made a very normal human mistake and most healthy people understand that ventinganxiety in a new relationship isnt the same as the relationship being all bad or toxic your family has given every sign of understanding that so for him now the simple answer is yes yes i am holding you accountable for your current choices to reject my familys invitations and opportunities to build a relationship with them yup i am putting the responsibility for your current choices the ones you are making today on you hes entitled to his feelings it may be awkward or uncomfortable at times but fundamentally what this guy is telling you is that youre not worth it your family and your family events arent worth him putting in the work or really any work to move this situation forward at this point you have to acknowledge he may not want this fixed not really he may just enjoy his blanket excuse to opt out of any adult responsibilities towards your family and nothing short of treating him like king charles will be considered acceptably friendly to meet his standards your bf is being extremely weird and i suspect he doesnt want this fixed on some level hes enjoying lording it over you its not all normal to expect your adults gfs family to text you or call you to chat he is invited that is how your family is welcoming and its appropriate hes invited and hes refusing to go because its not good enough that is childish to say the least youve done what you need to do it your family is inviting him in it is his responsibility to show up and be himself a nice version of himself that is literally all he has to do and hes refusing to do it you made a mistake years ago but everyone involved besides him is being reasonable about it and ready and willing to move past it with just a tiny bit of effort required its becoming another and very real red flag that he is not willing to show up for you and do his part there is no shame in being a bit thirsty but save yourself some drama and dont be shocked when a 20something hookup behaves like a 20something hookup one of the benefits of being in your 30s is supposed to be not getting so hung up on this bullshit anymore if you want to sleep with him tell him so and invite him over ya want to date him tell him so and suggest a date not half as complicated as youre making it eh your mother doesnt have high standards shes bigoted and biased and stigmatizes mental illness and divorce who says broken family is 2023 a family changes often for the better after a separation of unhappy adults id much rather date an adult who sought treatment for mental health issues and is now stable than an adult who never admitted they needed help it can cause issues but most of those issues arise from the refusal to seek treatment and acknowledge the problem if he took the right steps and is stable now i wouldnt be concerned thank your mother for her concern then follow your own judgment you need to walk away either she is too immature and unstable to offer you a healthy relationship or she is actually abusive and using these threats as a tactic to get the behaviour she wants out of you to keep you insecure and chasing her approval frankly it sounds like its the latter she is doing this just to maintain control and keep you too scarred to ever ask for or expect better for yourself but either way its not a relationship you should stay in two things you need to accept 1 this isnt the life you want hes not offering you what you need and you do need a partner who isnt an active addict 2 you dont know hed be a good partner otherwise thats a fantasy and a hope not a knowable thing youre gambling with your life and its a bet that might not pay out even if he does get sober which he is not doing not your circus not your monkeys you said your piece and im sure you meant well at first now its time to stop badgering these adults with your opinions and judgments they are doing just fine you need to handle yourself three months in and hes dismissive and unable to handle conflict this wasnt just about your issues this is about his issues he may not have consciously weaponized your vulnerability but he used it to avoid addressing his own shit or his own inadequacies dont overthink it it was three months a perfectly normal amount of time to really like someone but realize they arent offering what you need in a partner each couple gets to decide but practically speaking if you are legally married then your money is combined in many ways even if you have no insight into it asking for some exact of change on one day seems entirely beside the point and not really all the helpful information unless hes selling today at some sort of major profit its not really information that means much however asking for enough transparency and knowledge so you could take care of both peoples financials if they were in a coma for six months thats my rule of thumb i have never combined finances but we have shared retirement goals we update one another on at least one a year and we make sure the other person knows enough about our accountsinsurancedebtetc to that if one of us was in a coma for six months what needs to get taken care of would get taken care of the fact youre feeling insecure and uncertain about your future is a problem that needs to be addressed if you dont want to date someone whose ex is also a close childhood friend stop dating that person youre giving this guy way too much power hes not an evil mindcontrol wizard if his existence was an issue in the past it was an issue for one or both of you he didnt make the relationship spoiled you two didnt maintain it youve told her with your actions that you cannot be trusted to respond reasonably to her friendship with this person not even in a group setting so now she hides that friendship and her choices because she doesnt enjoy how you treat her when you are met with that reality shes not unhappy with her boundaries shes unhappy with your behaviour if you need her to observe different boundaries you can ask for them clearly trying to shame her into doing what you want by saying shes not respecting herself is gross if that is what you think of her dont date her people who pressure you are asshats i didnt drink from 19 to about 26 having fun with people who are drinking is definitely a skill and a practice i never felt like i was missing out on being wild because it was actually the loss of control i didnt enjoy but i definitely felt less interesting or plain its hard to remember that they are the ones being irrationally confident youre fine to hide among the drinkers id ask for a coke is a short glass and people assumed my drink was a rum and coke its a pricy way to fake it but in groups where i didnt feel like explaining myself it works people who arent asshats arent really thinking about you at all yes it was terrible that partners urgent care and months in hospital costs us less than 2k outta pocket and we are both now back at work as a productive and healthy
