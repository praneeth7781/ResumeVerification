him to find his bearings through instructions before you got too involved i understand being disappointed this isnt something you can share but it also sounds like that wasnt a core goal of what he needs to achieve for his work that is sad but it also makes a lot of sense he also probably isnt aware of the depth of differences and the strong feelings between the two dialects my partner thought id be keen to use my french when we travel he had to see for himself a few times how my french was not always welcomed or understood by french people before he really started to get how different my dialect was from how most of the world speaks no matter how many times i told him he had to feel it before he believed it until then it was all just french to him that is childish and cruel if he has a problem with how your anxiety impacts his life he should discuss it with you like an adult and figure out what boundaries he needs to have or accommodations you need to make he can talk about that and figure it out if he cannot talk about it in that kind of reasonably way he is either too mean to date or too stupid he shouldnt be punishing you the way we do yappy little dogs or how shitty parents manage toddlers why did he do this were the classes easier to access is he choosing a dialect that is more commonly spoken or easier to learn when my partner wanted to learn french i actively steered him away from my dialect because the accent and diction are globally perceived as being cheap or not proper i actively encouraged him to learn metropolitanparsian french because we could still speak to one another just fine but hed get more use out of it in the rest of his life if it didnt stick to the way i spoke i can understand why you might have some feelings but i think youre being a bit unfair if hes choosing something that will be more broadly useful or accessible for him not to mention picking on someones accent or tone in the early learning stages is just decidedly unhelpful in my opinion this is the woman who once said if we took away womens right to vote wed never have to worry about another democrat president its kind of a pipe dream its a personal fantasy of mine i think its a bit foolish to imagine she does anything but run her mouth for attention there is no realizing of any kind going on shes white and wealthy she got hers she doesnt actually give a shit she just figured out a thing to tweet that would get the attention of both echo chambers dude ya do you have a problem with bi women you told us so listen to yourself when you say shit like is the way i feel justifiable by my morals and ethics what you are very clearly saying is you believe there is something inherently unethical or immoral about women who experience sexual attraction to other women as well as men you shouldnt date anyone you dont want to but youre being a naive asshole when you pretend your preferences are not rooted in stereotypes isms or phobias they often are hell a lot of our biases against smokers are i wouldnt date a smoker either but i acknowledge that some of the beliefs and attitudes i have about smokers are unfair and biased and its still not cool to compare sexual orientation to the choice to smoke or being an addict comparing being lgbtq to addiction or choice to smoke would be kinda homophobic you said things above that make it clear yours are rooted in biphobia and nasty assumptions about the character and values of bisexual people you said yourself that you perceived bisexual as less ethical and moral than heterosexuals like yourself we none of us are immune from the cultural messages that judge or demean others you seemed to be capable of recognizing this when it was directed at bisexual men dont pretend to be blind when you are the one directing these biases and judgements at bisexual women dont date bisexuals we cool please dont but also dont be shitty and pretend its just a preference you got some shit to unpack dont put it on other people or let yourself totally off on the hook none of us are perfect and you just said a bunch of shit that is biphobic accept it and youll be able to better avoid it edit sexual orientation not sexual irritation lol you are being irrational its biphobia when people assume girlongirl is just something fun for guys to watch and not real meaningful sex between two people who enjoy and care for one another its biphobia when men are shamed for secretly being gay or treated like they are gross and its also biphobia when you assume a bisexual isnt just as capable of monogamy and loyalty as any random heterosexual you are entitled to this bit of irrationality and shouldnt date anyone you dont want to its not anyone elses job to make you not biphobic youre not a monster but you are wrong and you absolutely need to stay away from bi people as dates its not kind or fair to them to make them address your irrationality or bias you should probably be thoughtful about how you treat any bisexuals or pansexuals you know socially you are experiencing a bias that is not true or kind there are plenty of men who feel as you do i get it a fair bit i appreciate it when they just keep that hateful bullshit to themselves and acknowledge they just are not keen to date a bisexual source a bisexual woman i think its more likely than youre imagining if its no big deal to this woman or her husband they might bring it up when they run into each other oh youre s wife yeah we dated years ago back in such a small world that we both ended up raising our families here no matter how small the risk you think it is it exists i wouldnt roll those dice on my partner youre doing the right thing you may consider asking them to join you on a day trip instead of phrasing it as a gift to them ask them for their company as a gift to you and naturally as it is a thing you are planning and want to share with them you will pay a concert or play a trip to the beach especially something your cousins will enjoy instead of giving them a thing involve them in an experience with you dont try to force cash on them in the end you are barely an adult in their mind be gracious if they want to treat you like a young relative who is not yet expected to contribute money when you leave send them some photos and a long thank you note of your best memories that is clearly what they value from the visit warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info youre 30 youve been in couples counselling for ages she says shes not in love anymore you dont trust her when it comes to money and you cannot communicate about it of course you should find your own apartment youre just coasting downhill with a woman who seems unwilling to actually break up with you set yourself free its a small town gonna be way worse if she finds out in any other way besides you speaking up and thats why you should do it for her sake to spare her any risk of confusion or embarrassment by not knowing something that some else does thats the benefit to her it is also about you feeling better tell her that this is ancient history and i dont plan on seeking out her company but ive been thinking about it and i know if roles were reversed id be hurt by you not telling me so im telling you really just to manage my own feelings about it and my discomfort with keeping it a secret and so that you never get blindsided by someone else mentioning something to you you need to start saying no kindly but firmly thank you but no that isnt enough notice for me to comfortably get ready im sorry but no ive told you i require at least x number of hours notice to host people in my home and x hours before leaving the home id really appreciate you respecting my timlines so i can join you in the future boundaries dont control what they do a boundary is about how you are going to respond if they dont meet your needs or standard and what you are choosing for yourself once you state a boundary you have to choose it enforce it and often enforcing a boundary means you dont get what you most want either the only power you have here is to withdraw your participation if they value your company and presence in their lives they will adapt you can always leave a relationship you dont want to be in for any reason you havent been happy in this relationship for a rather long time it would be silly to continue you need to end contact there is nothing to gain by treating this like its an ongoing conversation its not its over have you been friends for years or have you been waiting for years thinking someday your friendship will earn you a date because its totally reasonable for her to be fearful of the latter dude you have zero interest in understanding why this is a bad take and not how consent or respect work a bunch of people have tried to explain peddle your willful ignorance elsewhere or create your own op for advice on how to human and what does consent mean yes consent is her view mutually enjoyable sex is her view if its not yours well nothing much else to say youre just kinda gross i really wish you were just an ignorant teenager but ive dated enough to know youre probably just a sad adult who cant get outta their own way no man that is the twisted part about of this whole thing the fact she did it before is why she knows she doesnt want too sex is supposed to be mutually enjoyable and consensual not a reward for boys its a not a gift she gave other men but if withholding now that is a pure toxic attitude shes not withholding hugs shes just not consenting to a sex act she knows well enough to know she doesnt want to perform again if a guy wrote mushy love letters before and didnt want to with me than id assume he didnt much enjoy writing them back then either and felt forced to perform break up with her if you need a relationship where oral sex is performed on you she is not offering you that kind of relationship stop talking about what she consented to in the past that part makes you the selfish piece of shit here and that is not justified just because she consented to something in the past doesnt mean she is required to continue consenting today she doesnt want to do it dont be the next in a line of assholes who bully and whine at her until she gives in be the honest guy who admits he really wants that in his relationship and breaks up to go find someone who is offering that kind of relationship i
