move forward with your life as a mother and as a human being im sorry youre not ready for that reality sooner you get there the better off youll be i just dont want to break up with him its a situationship by definition you are not together we have a rocky relationship but we want to do better for our daughter great you need to realize the best you can do probably doesnt include dating one another i wanna start by finding a way to have him go to the baby appts mkre you cannot turn him into either a good partner or a good parent hes gonna be who he wants to be and you need to make your peace with that dude you were absolutely implying that she was incompetent and that you didnt trust her researchjudgment call despite the fact this was an ongoing issue for her and you knew shed taken previous steps you may really think you didnt intend it but intention actually isnt everything what you atually did was shitty and her emotional response to being treated that way was predictable and reasonable it is a damn small thing and you were a selfabsorded ass about it got to be honest with you if i was opening the garage by hand for a single week my partner would have declared that unacceptable and built a plan to correct that situation before i even got around to it you should apologize and do better treat her like the competent adult she is and dont expect her to struggle with a daily task for months just because it doesnt impact you and then throw shade when she says its time to resolve the issue sesh youre 35 this is rather basic courtesy and empathy it is not rocketscience i think you feel like a single mom because you are one stop the situationship just be coparents hes not your partner hes not the partner you want hes just your coparent and you cant force him to be a good parent you can only give him opportunities to be one the longer you imagine you can turn him into either a good partner or a good parent the harder it will be for you to move forward with your life as a mother and as a human being let it go and focus on being coparents she doesnt sound all that more toxic than you to be perfectly honest go be better with someone else and find some grace when it comes to the woman who is the mother of your child your animosity over her sex life is pointless and counterproductive you may not be able to create a home with her and your son but you can create a coparenting relationship where you butt the hell out of exes sex life and focus on just being a parent and not fixating on your role as jilted or resentful ex you probably want to begin by trying to connect with an individual therapist not a couples therapist to get you a place to talk through the particulars and make some thoughtful choices you want to leave the house and in the short term that is probably a good idea but you may want to speak to a lawyer if youre concerned about how that impacts your legal standing staying close by would definitely be wise and maintaining regular contact and support for the children if it doesnt matter where you live then you live near were your children are right now that is the default i dont know where you are living but you should recognize it takes way more than a night in jail to stop you from seeing your children the child have a right to know you and have access to you and no court is throwing that right of the children away over a verbal fight catastrophizing isnt going to help you here what is going to help you is focusing on being a present and available parent that should be the foundation of your decisions but get some distance in the shortterm and some support from an individual therapist and a lawyer he definitely wants to fix it if this has been your whole relationship and hes never spoken to a therapist or sought a sliding scale or a free support group or read a damn selfhelp book from the library then he doesnt really want to fix it he wants to seem like he wants to fix it so youll continue to tolerate it youre both benefiting in some way from this unhealthy dynamic and you both need to admit it to yourself and eachother he needs to realize this has to be fixed if he wants a healthy relationship with anyone ever and certainly if he wants to marry you he may hate this about himself but as long as he tolerates it about himself it has the impact of guilting and silencing his partner you cant remedy this for him he has to do it for himself and for you this was my ex too i tried desperately to point out that hed reply with no as the first word out of his mouth even when i was 99 correct or if had just used a wordterm he deemed less accurate then the one in his head he expected me to make all the effort to make myself understood but not to have to put himself out for a second to try and understand i wouldnt i would text him after i post it conversation can evolve from there or not make sure you know the policy at your company but if there is no risk of a direct reporting issue this is just a question of mutual interest id start by asking if shes changed her mind about porn the deception is a major problem but struggling with a change of opinion on a loaded topic like porn can be very different than a hypocrisy or betrayal unless youre in a race toward divorce your best path forward is an open conversation about porn and frame it as an upsetting and confusing but valid change in her choices and opinions and not a personal attack you saw what you saw youre confused and more than a little hurt try to put aside your assumptions about what she thinks or how she feels or even how often shes engaging with try to approach the conversation as an opportunity to reset the understanding about porn and just porn its possible she might still think its wrong and be disgusted with herself which would also account for her physical withdrawal from you if she struggles to be forthcoming recommend couples counselling urgently to help moderate this important conversation dont spend too much time banging your own head against the wall and fixating on the betrayal go back to therapy and figure out what kind of relationship if any youd like to have with your mother and what steps you need to get there that could absolutely include cutting her off or minimizing contact its totally valid to feel like you do and its really mature and wise of you to be able to recognize that your mother has changed and is making efforts you dont have to feel bad youre clearly trying to be fair to her and the person she is today but that doesnt mean your feelings are totally valid be fair to yourself too and get some more support for this stage tbh i often forget this is criminal in the places where most redditors live a few times ive given advice like thats not something you can reasonably expect from a matchhook up youre looking for a very specific service and you should be hiring someone and tipping well and completely been oblivious to the fact i was suggesting a crime you cannot control how he feels you can tell him youre concerned thats fair but dont get into specifics youre concerned hes stressed out and overworked youre concerned he wont accept advice or listen to doctors on the best way to manage his pain or his diet dont assume you have the answers dont be your mothers little helper speak for yourself and admit youre worried you want better for him than he seems to be choosing for himself and as someone who loves him that makes you sad youre a piggy bank for a man who hid his child from you for four months the fact hes an unreliable dad isnt something you can fix for him being a reliable parent means showing up he cannot do that without the financial support of the new gf he lied to you made the first right decision the second right decision is removing this person from your life but she thinks your lusting after your sister however wonderful you think you ex is that is what she thinks of you she thinks at best you lack boundaries and at worst that you are incestuously obsessed with your sister that really should be insulting and offensive enough to help you get past this your ex has shown you who she really is shes possessive and jealous and willing to make up extremely offensive insults in the attempt to isolate you from your sister and her kids you cannot fix crazy your problem is that youre trying to fix crazy and why would you want to date someone ignorant and stubborn really your exgf has decided to believe something absurd and offensive about you youre never going to reason her out of it you shouldnt be trying to work through it you should be removing someone who thinks such irrational and hateful things about you from your life you need to stop seek therapy it is extremely unlikely this man was going to pick you if youd just agreed to go home with him after the first date thats not realistic its a fantasy story youre telling yourself just to beat up on yourself you keep shifting the details but the core of it remains true he met someone else it is a good idea to be upfront up walking to book a second date with someone youre into but that probably wouldnt have change the outcome here he connected more with someone else its just a rejection its a normal part of dating the way you are behaving here on reddit suggests you are not ready to be dating and handling normal rejection as part of that process stop fixating speak to a therapist stop supporting and start laying down some expectations if hes not a jealous person then the way he is treating you and n is irrational and unkind that drunken attack was not acceptable he doesnt need to be coddled he needs to be told this isnt an acceptable way to deal with whatever hes feeling you have been nothing but open to working with him on this but he continues to make it your problem to live with his shitty attitude and random accusations followed by gaslightingeseque denials its not kind to you its not respectful of you he needs to do better because this is a shitty way to treat your partner who is very very willing to adapt this friendship to address your feelings stop trying to be his therapist and tell him to get his damn ass to an actual one if hes experiencing intense feelings he cannot speak with you honestly about youre incompatible and she basically said she feels she needs too and is entitled too financially punish you in order to stop you from becoming lazy why does she want to marry you if she thinks that you need to be threatened with higher costs in order to perform and set goals yuck but honestly the even bigger longterm issue here is disagreements about parenting like
