is totally understandable just like you were but if you can have a laugh about it surely he can as well if hed like to discuss how you can both observe different boundaries about privacy and sex in the future thats great have that conversation about what is off limits youre not concerned that your bf tried to negotiate a polyeqsue situation with another woman staying in your home without talking to you first because thats a bad start there are reddits specifically for polyamory and nonmonogamy and you might get more advice there but i have had openenm relationships most of my life and frankly the way your bf behaved with you and with a vulnerable woman staying in your home does not sound the least bit ethical i wouldnt offer a person anything if they tried to create a threesome or more without talking to me their partner first it sounds like youre trying to manage a man who you know will cheat on you thats never a good place to come at this from its a fairly common fantasy that fuels a huge percentage of the science fiction and fantasy stories we have can you explain a bit more about what makes you uncomfortable about these conversations does she want to do harm to certain kinds of people does she not listen to feedback or is pushy with her friends about her imagined authority if she is basically expressing impossible wishes for the world to be kinder or safer for other people and doesnt see that happening i think shes probably just at an immature stage of a social justice conscience and i really wouldnt worry about it certainly have a back up plan in place this man is controlling and abusive he may also have a very genuine sensitivity but the way hes addressing it is not acceptable i would suggest you tell the wife you will no longer be cooking its not comfortable or reasonable for you to feel like youre taking a risk each time you feed the children its cannot be your responsibility if this is the behaviour that is going on in the home i wouldnt be willing to stay till september but if you do definitely have a back of plan of a quick safe place to stay this is a pretty toxic situation and you want to be able to leave quickly if needed you should not feel secure here yeah thats how most bigotry works basically good people need to be on guard and thoughtful or they end up reflecting and acting on it intent is nice buts its not everything and its doesnt cure anything kindness is work not a hope not a feeling not an intent a thing you have to actually do so you have no advice you have a shallow pedantic platitude that is vague shaming and silencing of totally legitimate boundaries and criticisms for the others sincerely trying to help the sister did her parents decided her cooking wasnt up to par perfectly reasonable that she stopped trying to contribute in that way if that is the feedback she got if he lost 11 lbs in a month he probably needs to speak to a doctor that is what you should be on him about immediately no one is refusing to feed him hes refusing to eat hes hypercritical of both your mother and your sister and he wont eat there is food he has a car arguably knows where stores are he appears to be competent and can solve problems in his life he has chosen not too you cannot fix this but try to find a doctor wholl give him a talking too and to build that relationship incase there is something else going on here medically or cognitively tell your father hes an adult and is capable of keeping himself basically healthy it is disappointing that he is blaming others for his behaviour and you are concerned for his health if he doesnt change his actions no hes almost certainly not he is almost certainly toying with you because you havent told him youre not a plaything but a colleague the same as any of the men take a huge step back from him avoid hun like the plague when booze is involved this is not your friend hes using his wife to get a green card hes using you to feel good at work this is not safe emotional investment or a wise move for your career youre becoming a subject of office gossip huge huge step back from this personal connection its not a positive conversation he treated op in a way that is unacceptable the only reason its a conversation is because it is out of character if you have advice offer it but i dont believe in holding peoples hands when are being cruel i start with i think this is cruel and i need you to stop it from there we can move forward i mean there is almost certainly some misogyny going on here he tried to demand she make herself ugly so she wouldnt rebound too fast thats not happening in a vacuum and suggests hes got a few concerning ideas about women and men going on here but yes if something isnt a pattern better to start with a firm this is not okay we can talk about what youre going through and what you are feeling but you need to know i am not going to accept being treated this way is dropping by his desk for an actual chat a possibility personally i really dont think its that rude to ignore a nonwork related chat for that long im an avid user of slack but my expectations for responses are entirely different if im asking a work question or if im asking how their cat is doing but you are right it is a struggle to make connections without some text chatting perhaps it would help to give yourself an assignment and carve out a few minutes in your day to catch up with text messages you may never enjoy it but if you treat it as a necessary task that needs to be performed in order to maintain social connections you can probably do it fine meeting people to date is really more like a shitty part time job than a fun hobby i dont think there is anything wrong with admitting that and just doing the work to get you where you want to be i am shocked that suggesting you should trust your wife she speaks was so upsetting to you its strange that youre arguing for nuance and the need for thoughtful consideration of communication while not be able to exercise much of either but its clear that youve been triggered too severely for me to be helpful good luck as is your right with advice but you asked and she confirmed she was serious you still dont want too risk it with your career youre right youre not being a rational actor youre trying to leverage your assumptions about her mental state and emotions assumptions that are the exact opposite of what she clearly said in order to justify the choice you want to make its a reasoning flaw all im advising you to do is make the choice without the part where you treat her like shes the irrational and untrustworthy one you dont need to make assumptions about her feelings to be honest with her about yours by all means marry her but dont try to read her mind to get the outcome you want be transparent with your mind there is nothing childish about that dont marry someone you dont take seriously when they express their needs say no if the choice is no is the risk is too much and you need to stick to the plan say so but own that choice for yourself and stop trying to justify it by demeaning and condescending to her and telling yourself its okay to not believe her when she speaks that will come back to bite you thats a lot of words to say that you have a type you probably should be way more concerned that youre repeating toxic patterns in your own relationships then you should be that people of a similar age in an similar area connected with another as friends open with that then this is extremely out of character and im not cool with how we left it im deeply concerned youd behave this way and im looking for a reasonable explanation for the totally unkind and unreasonable way youre treating me right now the only thing they can do is try to tell the gf which puts them back in the line of fire for their abuser she doesnt have the information she needs in order to protect anyone here except herself so no i dont agree that is likely to achieve anything or that op has a responsibility to set herself on fire over things she cannot prove or protect anyone else from he probably is im sorry but youre right unless thats a crime where you live then there is nothing you can do about it even if it is one there is probably still nothing you can do if hes just showing then to friends and not posting them publicly thats a reality youre going to have to live with it shouldnt be i wish i could stop it for you but i cant the safest thing for you is have absolutely zero contact of any kind with him or anyone close to him tell him this doesnt wait until you maybe get more serious he has an intelligent highenergy breed he needs to be taking proper care of right now and proper care includes training if he doesnt take it seriously now he never really will maybe hell let it be your job and hell resist you every step of the way in your position id be brutally clear i cannot respect people who do not train their young dogs to be safe around people and dogs the fact hes decided to just not bother right now is a real mark against his character there is no crime to report it is extremely unlikely bringing your concerns to his new gf will do anything besides trigger harassment there is nothing productive you can do sometimes bad things are just bad and there is nothing to do about it you need to block both of them everywhere you cannot punish him or save her that is a bizarrely shallow and controlling sentiment hes expressing he wants you to make yourself in his mind unappealing to other men out of respect yuck does he also expect you to be wear a black veil for a year and then purples and greys for at least six more months after that my bf and i were joking about death recently and he told me to use some of his life insurance to buy a really good vibrator if i didnt feel like playing cougar right away i would suggest you not try to make this right he issued an amazingly petty shittest tell him it was both bizarre and unkind for him to try to dictate how you might theoretically grieve like he doesnt trust you to be actually devastated by his death he needs to imagine youll also need to make yourself again he imagines ugly to ensure you dont immediately start dating again that insane break up with him and end all contact he cheated because he wanted to cheat nothing you ever did made him do it you didnt cast a spell hes a person who can choose not to be shit he choose to cheat and hes telling you hes gonna do it again this will all make a lot more sense when
