love her and would like to date her this is why she doesnt trust you to respond reasonably to her dating life she doesnt want your opinion she is aware it is biased she may also be trying not to hurt you with the information she reasonably assumes you dont want to hear about if she doesnt want this subject to be part of her friendship with you then you cannot force it what this means though is that you need to move on and not keep trying to win her over she is probably well aware she could date you if she wanted too she doesnt want too im not on my own today i think weve made the right decision for us both on balance when i said it wasnt a problem i meant i was perfectly comfortable with the decision do you have a different idea of what would be best choice right now because i would hope if you did you would state it just as clearly as i just did and id believe you just like i need you to believe me when i speak the one i frequently use with my partner is if you were holding me back from something i felt strongly about youd absolutely hear about it you cannot fix this for him he needs a therapist to unpack and challenge what is in essence a toxic communication pattern but you should be clear with him that this behaviour is not respectful or kind and that youd like him to do better you know he overreacted but youre also kind of full of shit arent ya cause it isnt just curious when you hunt the smell down say yuck and are visibly disgusted those are actions those are actions that are reasonably insulting to another person this other person might also be an asshole but also you walked into someone elses home and insulted their cooking your behaviour was insulting and you lied about and minimized it when confronted instead of saying dude im sorry im sure its great for lot of people its just not for me lifes easier without a stick up your ass thats a bit of advice that might be useful for you as well as for him but since youre the one asking do a bit better dont be such a bullshitter if you fuck up just say you fucked up and move on be a grown up and express your boundaries you dont want to be friends its not an insult its doesnt mean she did something wrong there are lots of awesome people i dont want to be besties with you have no reason to fear abuse or harassment from her give her the courtesy and kindness of telling that while you think she is a lovely person there is just too much history and you arent comfortable maintaining contact or being her friend then block her without guilt you should explore types of therapy and different approaches its important o have some trust in that relationship digging into root causes is not actually the most effective form of therapy for a lot of struggles i personally prefer cbt which focuses on current behaviour and changing the thought patterns behind them if you want to talk about how your mother treated you when you were a toddler or about the meaning of your dreams you need a different kind of therapy why arent you listening to your therapist they have already explained this perfectly well if she wants a man like xyz she should go find him its okay to break up with her without first labelling her as the hypersensitive bad guy you can just stop the thing that isnt working without demonizing one another ive been wondering if the reveal of 50k fine for not making it to altar explains a bit more about why zackirina couldnt walk away when it clearly wasnt working and if the conversation in the bedroom where they break it off which was one of the few moments i had a tiny bit of respect for irina was only allowed to happen once the producers had agreed to let them off the hook there is a line between addressing your partners biases or limitations and being condescending as all hell you are in real danger of crossing it here it also seems likely that a lot of this is you externalizing your own emotional reactions and anxieties and assigning them to her character as if they were all her negative traits when they really are more about your own bad mental habits and insecurities i think youd be very very wise to first consider how you can adapt your responses before putting it in writing that you think she is childish and unrealistic you seem to be very quick to interpret her passing comments as insults and take them deeply to heart that may not be fair or true to her experience or her meaning you may have a relationship issue as well but you absolutely have a stress management issue your anxiety about communicating your own needs and timelines seems to be the much larger issue here you should be looking for positive and constructive ways to communicate your own timelines needs and concerns about what the future looks like together to advocate for yourself in the relationship not reasons to call her a child or knock her down a few pegs or burst her bubble or make her be realistic but instead communicating openly about what you do want to work towards and when you think you can so youre both talking about reality sometimes and not just vague hopes or fantasies if you really think that of her then you have a much larger reconsideration to do sperate your questions for a bit is there something about your own behaviour youre not happy with feeling isolated from a tradition or norm isnt always a pleasant feeling but unless you are unhappy with your own choices that is a feeling that is entirely yours to manage as an adult as you rightly realized no one should be restricting themselves so you dont feel left out they are in their own home not a kindergarten class feeling out of place is a you problem for you to navigate and manage and you are a bit out of place thats okay our families extend and can contain people who are very different from us sometimes it really is okay i am ludicrously out of place when i visit my family in rome its a bit awkward but a loving sort of awkward the second issue is about what you want to ask others for as a favour out of consideration for you the fact your daughter asked you initially about the pool makes me suspect that if you say hanging out naked over our morning coffee was just a tiny step too far for me would you mind wearing some clothing if were having a longer conversation it doesnt sound like you need boundaries or strict rules just to give your daughter a heads up that while you are fully respecting and supporting her choices in her own home as a guest with very different life experiences youre struggling with some things also didnt like cole at all he was attention seeking and instigating throughout he only got a pass because zanab was so awful hopefully hes grown i want to agree but micha is plenty old enough to see the consequences of the company she keeps and make better choices for herself the reformed mean girls i know had made the break by 26 hopefully the show was the kick in the ass she needed he only has these questions after she said she wasnt feeling it op came here to get the she should have disclosed pile on even though he claimed to be accepting of her choice initially and hes exactly the validation he came looking for and very little advice on how not get into this sort of pointless argument in the future with women who dont wish to date him you debated someone and insulted them when they were just trying to end the connection doesnt matter if you had a point that was a dumb and counterproductive thing to do that was only going to be mean and dramatic like i said before the correct response is thank you and good luck i told you how to improve in the future with anyone not just a trans woman you dont seem that interested that part tho did you just come here to find people to tell you she did a bad bad thing by not disclosing why is it so hard to just not be compatible and leave it at that or to not clap back at someone who is telling you they arent interested no man based on your own story here you were mainly frustration was with being rejected you were willing to accept the situation you thought it had been a good date until she told you she wasnt feeling it the correct response to im not feeling the connection is thank you for letting me know good luck out there you dont ask why especially not if you cant handle the answer without arguing with them no matter what else nonsense they have to say you dont debate them you gtfo and be glad for it that is what you do next time you get told no by anyone you tried to knock her down a peg because you were disappointed and angry with the rejection you didnt think you deserved to be rejected for the reasons she gave but thats not how compatibility works youre not entitled to a certain number of chances or even to being properly understood a trans woman doesnt have to fall in love with you because you dont react with horror that the advice for next time when someone rejects you you say good luck not well actually let me explain to you the shitty things i think you did and why your rejection of me is wrong thats just pointless drama and ego defence that has nothing to do with her being trans thats just a really really stupid way to handle rejection this isnt complicated you werent compatible regardless of her being trans you were already not compatible she told you so given the differences in preferences and feelings about your conversation youd be reasonable to agree with her on that much while i would generally agree people should disclose prior to sexual intimacy for their own safety more than anything it really sounds a lot like you were more frustrated at being rejected than by anything else it really sounds like youre trying to make her the bad guy because she didnt want to see you again put your wounded ego aside stop getting twisted youre not compatible the rest is details take the l end of story relationships arent hostage situations most people understand this just fine block him and dont take his shit for anyone else just tell them he deserves to find someone who really wants to be with him it wouldnt have been right to waste his time and pretend to feel what you didnt or tell them he was manipulating and mean cause that is also true tell him that the healthy and adult way to deal with feelings is to communicate respectfully hes certainly allowed to feel hurt but this behaviour should be beneath him you made a request for your comfort and he seems to be responding with spite if he cannot manage better right now take a break and take yourself out for dinner you should block him this is rude this is unpleasant this is not enriching your life in any way youre allowed to nope outta something even
