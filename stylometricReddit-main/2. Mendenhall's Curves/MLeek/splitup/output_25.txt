take anything home from it this one is pretty cut and dry youre right hes wrong he has misunderstood the situation it is not appropriate to go into a meal train visitevent with any expectation you will leave with anything a host may offer if they have too much or things will spoil too quickly but the expectation is rude and inappropriate the point is to gift them food they asked for your company as well but the pointagreementexpectation is still to gift them food its been six months its time for a checkin ask him how the saving towards buying into your house is going we all know the answer is its not tell him youre not comfortable moving forward with him if he doesnt provide more clarity about his debt situation and repayment plan because you shouldnt be stop tiptoeing around his stress ego and tell him plainly what you need from an adult partner he needs to be stressed and pressured that is what he should be feeling right now hes misled his partner about his finances having stressful conversation full of pressure is how you succeed at a life partnership if he crumbles under this pressure and cannot at least make a focused efforted to keep his word to you about money then you absolutely cannot have children with him you need to stop thinking of yourself as a provider and start thinking of yourself as a partner and a partner doesnt say oh whatever you thinkneedwant im sure itll work out when they are in fact not at all sure of that a partner speaks up clearly about their own needs and limits and concerns a partner isnt such a damn pushover im not surprised you feel like a pawn right now you have accepted that role you are following that script while she may be inconsiderate or poor at budgeting or have any other set of negative qualities shes not here right now youre here asking this questions and reading these answers right now nothing she intiates is going to save you from the selfimposed consequences of your own choice to not speak up clearly about your preferences and needs and feelings you need to be confident enough in yourself and have enough faith in your marriage to say what you actually think in each of the cases above you told her to make her own choice and then resented her for doing so moreover if she is the one taking on the work of planning all of these trips you actually may need to step in with far more concrete plans if there is something you want to be prioritized i could be wrong but the if you can find a free weekend response sounds to me like it might have been a you do the work dont make me plan yet another thing stepping up and taking on a larger share of that mental labour and planning for family or couple trips might be a good way to address both of your feelings of being left out or neglected and to start approaching this subject as a team with a shared plan instead of all trips being primarily her projects its not that strange this is just you being attracted to the people you see as peers and it takes experience to properly identify your peers most teenagers cannot know what they do not know which is the whole reason some laws apply to them the laws are a bit arbitrary but society has to pick a line so the line gets picked and we organize ourselves and societies permissions and expectations of young people around it but seriously dont date a 30yearold its healthy enough for you to see them as a peer but that is a lack of experience on your side still there is something profoundly and deeply wrong with a 30yearold who sees you as a peer no matter how wonderful and mature you are you need legal advice this isnt a relationship issue anymore dont contact him not yourself not personally not ever as i said not a relationship issue you have no relationship whatsoever with this person anymore you are not consenting to any relationship or contact any contact you have no should go through the lawyers or law enforcement or at the most a professional message in your capacity as a professional offering to purchase the domain at a reasonable rate but not offering to sell your friendship or any personal contact whatsoever reach out to a nonprofit that supports abuse or stalking victims access some legal advice or more pointedly dont worry about it too much and build your site with the same kind of accessible variation of your name that most people named john smith need to figure out link it in all your bios correctly and googleseo will quickly figure it out and send people looking for your full name to the site that is actually populated with content so that is the exact problem im advising you to address you need to have a conversation one where you try to understand her perspective and not one where you try to make her perform to your expectations seeing it from her perspective involves listening and understanding her choices you dont seem to have managed that on your own so have that conversation with a professional involved that is the only thing which will tell if youre are still compatible or not shes a person first and you are actually working really hard to not have to see it from perspective there is nothing here in this question that says you have heard or understood her perspective you simply report her actions if you saw it from her perspective youd be willing to talk about her goals and concerns about stopping her education or her work youre treating her goals and values as if they are just bad habits she needs to break taking a class isnt stuck in your ways its not a bad habit being uncomfortable or unwilling to be a sahm is not a bad habit its a huge leap of trust to put in the working partner i feel for you you are working really hard but youre not working smart when it comes to your relationship there are obviously major issues in how the housework and childcare is divided but youve taken such an extreme and closeminded view of it im not shocked you two cannot even communicate about it anymore if you decide she is nothing except the mother of your daughter and that her employment and school work are just bad habits shes stuck in then shes not your human partner any longer your relationship will and should end if that is your attitude towards her and you will be solely coparents look even if he had any reasonable discomfort talking about his partner he actively hid inappropriate conversations with another woman and even looped his parents into the situation gross you know he was full of shit and weaponizing your mental illness against you try not to stew on it there is nothing to learn here except to end things sooner and that is a lesson only experience can teach you i would back way up and get both of your butts into couples counselling and individual counselling for yourself this is not all about what you can do for them you need and deserve support which they are probably not wellequipped to offer at the moment please make sure you get it you need a counsellor who is experienced with queernonbinary patients and respects ethical nonmonogamy but put a big old pause on actually practicing any openness or nonmonogamy coming out one week having a crush and pursuing an open marriage the next is not a healthy timeline for anyone involved here not them not you not anyone else unlucky enough to fall into to either of you in this bumbling sorta openness youre considering the best way to support them is to be healthy yourself and to sort out your own needs and goals some selfishness on your part isnt an attack its an important next step towards a relationship that genuinely serves you both in the way you each need take some space apart if you can get tested and ask for his records gather the information you can but recognize the information you already have is pretty damning your husband decided to be ignorant about this to make his own life less embarrassing even if it meant putting you at risk its a deadly serious breach of trust an sti is not a bodily function its a transmittable illness he chooses to believe untrue things about a transmittable infection he had before they become sexually active and throughout the marriage that could be easily disproven by a google search or transparent conversation with a doctor because the false information he had found was convenient to him he exposed her to increase cancer risk with her knowledge that is nothing like lying and saying it was the dog who farted thats like exposing someone to an increased cancer risk and genital warts without their knowledge for years its been seven years are you gonna spend the rest of your lives together refusing to accept and trust your partner to select his own friends you can always leave someone whose boundaries and morals you dont respect but you choose to stay and have continued with that choice stop pretending to yourself hes gonna turn into someone else hes picking these people and hes gonna go on picking these people make peace or gtfo it seems you two didnt have a solid agreement on child care and finances prior to the baby arriving you made offers to her that you thought were generous and proper but offers are different from mutual agreements youre both very much adults you need to have conversations and make agreements you had very traditional expectationshopes of her and shes clearly noped the hell right outta that you cannot force her to perform the way you want her to she has to agree to it she has to want that or at least accept it and feel secure as an adult who is dependent on you in order to stop working or delay her education goals if she isnt willing to do that you cannot force her you can just choose not to be her partner you might not be compatible as partners but stuck with one another as coparents couples counselling would be wise you two skipped over some important conversations about the division of labour and finances and you need to have them now you dont seem to have any understanding here of what is motivating her to work or to get an education you dont have to agree with her or even like her choices she can be an outright terrible human being for all i know but youre stuck with her so itll help you to understand what she is thinking so you can have a real conversation sounds like you are probably fundamentally incompatible and that there is also a huge lack of trust here once you realize your life would be easier as a single parent thats generally the direction it heads in but even still a couples counsellor can help you navigate the split warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info the point of love languages isnt just to get someone else to speak yours its to pay attention and understand them when they speak my boyfriend doesnt speak words of affirmation very much but he knows they are important to me and he tries what he does do is tidy my kitchen and pick up my grocery list meticulously every time hes over he if youre
