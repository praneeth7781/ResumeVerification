not happy leave the relationship respectfully and honestly but dont forget that love languages are also about listening not just demanding your preferences be met your husband lied to you for six years the first thing you do is go get tested vaccines are almost never 100 percent and gardasil protects against nine of the common human papillomavirus hpv types there are more than 150 types while the odds might be good that he has one of the more common types that the vaccine may cover your husband was wrong and monstrously selfish to assume the type he had was one the vaccine covered he has absolutely no way of knowing what type i very very much doubt he spoke to a doctor who gave him the advice that you were fine and it was aokay to lie to you they almost certainly said your wife needs regular screenings you are utterly justified in requesting any evidence you wish but you might need to have more fundamental think even in the bestcase situation where he didnt cheat had this from the beginning and assumed you were immune is this okay is that really all that much better he chose to keep himself and you ignorant of the reality of the situation and the risk for a decade because he rather protect his ego than your health i sincerely hope no one in your life is ever in need of support regarding abuse this is a truly heartbreakingly horrible take on reactive abuse mutual abuse is rather rare the actual power and control dynamics rarely permit it reactive abuse is almost always present in any abusive relationship this is textbook reactive behaviour from op after facing years of manipulation and blameshifting reactive abuse is pretty basic and can exist in any abusive relationship between people parents and children friends and even employees and bosses you think youve got some special insight because youre being contrary but its just ignorantly sticking to a narrative that is as old as time itself a break is almost always a slowmotion breakup youre already on that path you may care for her on some level but you dont respect her behaviour or decisions or even trust her intentions thats not fair to either of you you shouldnt be trying to force yourself into a relationship with someone you have those feelings about be honest enough to admit to her that you dont want a break you dont want to be in this at all break up youre 36 you owe it to any woman you date seriously to have this shit figured out better than this i expect this kind of dithering from a man a decade younger than you no one here is going to have the exact answer for you except to tell you that yes its high time you put in the work and figure this out speak to a therapist if you need to sort out your own thoughts and come to conclusions you can live with for yourself its no longer reasonable or fair to put this all on finding the perfect partner and a rational person should probably realize that if youre unwilling to sacrifice everything to make it possible then its probably not going to happen because for most people having kids does means sacrificing a hell of a lot ignoring for a moment that having a much older biological father actually does impact the outcomes for the infant in some ways because more importantly unless you are independently wealthy time does run out in a practical sense youll probably want to retire not still be paying for school trips or tuition into your 60s dont engage with this person they are not interested in your safety they are interested in attacking you on the basis of your gender there will be time to reflect on how you can make better choices right now the choice you need to make is to prioritize your safety above all else the moment anyone punches or throws anything the other person is at serious risk of harm so the relationship is over no one has to behave perfectly not women men or children to deserve not to be abused emotional manipulation deserves a breakup not a screaming match not a hole in the wall not the real threat of escalating physical violence what is deeply sexist here is the idea that men are not capable of facing big difficult feelings without resorting to violence they are men are sensible and capable of dealing with big feelings and even break ups without being abusive without screaming bloody murder or making inane accusations and transparent attempts at guilt tripping without punching walls or people most of them pull it off just fine men can be capable of dealing with these moments without violence when they and others expect it of themselves hopefully at some point you will stop thinking there is anything people do that means they deserve to be abused edit and yes men are even capable of leaving emotionally abusive partners without violence its insane to think this is apology territory this is escape plan territory he is not sweet sweet is the mask he wears when he knows a sensible person would leave his abusive ass your bfs emotional and verbal abuse has escalated to the first steps of physical abuse people who will hit objects to scare and intimate you are warming up to hit you it may not happen tomorrow but this man has been telling you over and over again that he is willing to hurt you to keep getting what he wants dont ask for an apology plan the breakup and then execute it quickly the most dangerous moment for a person leaving an abusive partner is when the abuser realizes they are losing control that is why the violence escalated when you told him it wasnt working look up the cycle of abuse and then plan your exit from this dangerous situation did you read my last paragraph dude where i spelled out that you should expect and ask for the same and advocate for yourself cause it sounds like youre retreating into resentment instead of doing the work to communicate your own valid needs if you rather have your martyrdom thats what youll get sure bro and for decades we thought women couldnt have autism at all because they werent disruptive enough its almost like there is just way way more pressure on women to mask and perform whereas men get to indulge in their eccentric genius myth its the main thing going on in her head right now your response wasnt just unsupportive it was cruel a complete no exam talk rule is telling her that she has nothing to contribute at all at the moment and you expect constant performance of good girlfriend and good girlfriends arent allowed to be stressed out instead create exam free zones or times over meals while youre in bed together make space for other another separate from her exams if youre feel silenced about your own stress or exams use the same guidelines learn to ask for what you want as she is now not punishing her for not automatically have given it to you in the past people are gonna pile on you telling you not to take is so personally and while that isnt wrong it doesnt mean his behaviour is kind or considerate you dont have to want to be the one who is constantly ignoring or managing someone elses every passing negative feelings or be doing all the work to redirect your partners inconsiderate bids for attention they need to do the bulk of that work themselves those are their feelings primarily their job its okay to ask for more kindness and consideration in how youre spoken to in those moments hes a grownup he should be able to manage his disappointment better than that at a tiny little totally predictable and justifiable hiccup where he doesnt not immediately receive what he wants it is reasonable for you to be disappointed in him for his lack of that emotional regulation skill and not showing you more consideration youre not controlling his emotions by being disappointed in how he is managing or not managing them youre telling him that there are times like when you are in the middle of work when you expect him to moderate his behaviour and handle his emotions himself not dropping them at your feet like a dead mouse like a cat and getting pissy youre not proud of him for expressing himself you would probably do better not to his feelings on yourself so readily but i dont think the problem here is an equal one or a just a misunderstanding hes not being considerate to respond with anything besides okay hun love ya talk later oh i have so many strategies for beingappearing busy but i hadnt thought of have you seen soandso since they were back from vacay i think they were asking after you a few strategically placed comments like that might stop the be friendlier vibes im getting strange i thought biologically we both basically based on 50 of our genes its almost like a sense of entitlement and refusal to be a full participant in childrearing isnt rooted in genetics well if he is then he apparently knows you well enough to know itll work why is this taking up any space at all in your brain why are you trying to read your exboyfriends mind youre newly married ya really got nothing better to do its a date if he wanted a professional connection he has linked in or could track down your work email you matched on a dating app its a date hes only sure there is nothing she can do about it once the way the baby is there not for a few years once heard a guy at work just straight up admit he say it that way she cant leave me while shes on mat leave anyways and then shell be too busy so im probably good until they are in first grade at least youre overthinking and these assumptions arent gonna help you any ask the dude out yourself i realize this isnt the best advice but youre describing almost exactly what ended my longterm relationship my ex didnt want to make the changes necessary to be a parent himself he assumed id do the work more than what i was already doing he wanted kids like he wanted a steam achievement or a trophy from the local beer pong league he wanted to cuddle them while they peacefully slept not take the day off work when they were ill show up at championship games but not to have to figure out the carpool schedule for the weekly practices he just knew his life wouldnt change much because surely his job paid more so it would be more important he shrugged off the changes he was insisting i make to mine women get shit on for going babycrazy but i know far more of this type of guy to go legacycrazy they dont want to parent they want to check the i passed on my genes box dont be a vessel for his ambitions if he wants to be a parent he needs to be a partner first and address your perfectly reasonable concerns and standards you cannot make her feel something its not about you shes been clear she doesnt like it dont pester stop pretending there is some magic spell you need to recite she doesnt like it frankly i dont send photos either by enjoy receiving them there i just dont feel safe and confident sending anyone any nudes at all ever i appreciate that other people are comfortable with this but im not and im not going to do it it
