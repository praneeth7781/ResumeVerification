emails in your life and that includes even their responses to them you cannot let this harm in if they continue to respond to these chains youre going to need to block them too and theyll need to reach out via text message or phone call if they want to contact you tell them you absolutely respect their choice to engage and fight but this isnt the context in which you are willing to engage with your uncle or his ideas encourage them to take similar steps to protect themselves from harm if and when they deem it necessary direct conflict with this sort of person rarely works be empathetic with your family who is hurting but be clear about your own boundaries on these behaviours if you want these email chains out of your life get them out of your life technically possible but extremely almost absurdly unlikely like baby grand piano falling out of a passing plane overhead and crushing your mailbox unlikely all those things technically exist and so could possibly happen but almost certainly will not dont lose sleep this time please use another method if you dont want to be pregnant this is how you get pregnant its good that youve been able to improve your relationship with your mother but perhaps its time to also manage your expectations and your responses instead of trying to change her choices by all means tell her how her actions have impacted your and your relationship but expecting her to get the oil back is just a further escalation that is a unlikely to happen anyways and a bit unfair to the poor sod she dragged into this and b doesnt actually solve the problem tell her how the behaviour impacted you let her figure out what shes going to do about that likely nothing and allow this experience to inform your choices and boundaries in the future with her perhaps store the rest of the oil in your own space two things the first is that this is just called compatibility compatibility is difficult and rare its good that you are able to see the difference between valuing someone as a friend and wanting to pressure a romanticsexual connection thats a great thing a lot of people dont have figured out the second is to reconsider how much you engage with or centre your fetish in your life a lot of smaller women will not appreciate being fetishized like this in fact your attitudes towards them will make you incompatible with a fair number of them if youve ended up with a bit of a mental deathgrip syndrome where you are only sexually interested in one very particular kind of dynamic or body type then you probably want to try to expand your taste and stop hyperfocusing you have trained your body and mind to only respond to one thing as sexy and thats not necessarily gonna lead you to the most happiness youre 32 youve been sharing a home with this other adult for years you should absolutely expect your husbands support but not his blind service to personal boundaries that you will not even speak up about yourself it is hard i understand that but youre demanding work from your husband when you wont do your share you also owe it to your husband to also put the work in its not fair to make this emotional and interpersonal labour all his job to perform you make you both look foolish when youre not able to simply say bil this shoulder patting just doesnt work for me please dont do it flinching or shrugging is not sufficient communication have you expressed this to your brotherinlaw while i agree your husband should support you he shouldnt have to speak for you youre not mute youre not a confused child or any other sort of incompetence with this you should be able to say bil please dont do that i dont like it it doesnt make me feel the affection youre trying to express it just makes me uncomfortable then your husband should support you its shouldnt be all his job to express your boundaries to someone else anyone else they probably believed they were okay with it too they might still believe that they probably arent trying to lie to you but you have to make your choices based on whether or not what they do works for you as a partner not just what they believe good luck professionals are just people even a pro quarterback making millions a year makes a few truly bad plays you can always be a bit skeptical of a single professionals opinion especially when its on someone who isnt even in the room you are poly and asexual your partner is not really okay with either of those things leaving aside the other behaviours which all sound more immature to me than malicious youre just fundamentally incompatible leaving the relationship would be wise based on what youve said here exceedingly unrealistic if your partner has behaviours or patterns that are making you uncomfortable discuss those with her and im concerned your therapist didnt correct their massive error prior to the end of the session seriously they set you off down a totally unproductive and even damaging path if i were you that is the relationship id be rethinking of course you told your therapist more than this but either your therapist is monstrously irresponsible or they were just a bit careless and didnt realize you were going to take way way more away from their comments than was halfway reasonable to do its reasonable to recognize that her pattern of withdrawing or going into negative moods for a few days might be who she is and not just a trauma response to her past relationship it is not at all reasonable for either of you to be trying to diagnose her as a narcissist that is calling someone an irredeemable abuser and liar the fact you had no concerns prior to the conversation with your therapist and then jumped to labelling them with npd is absurdly paranoid and suggests to me you might struggle with anxiety its worth remembering even a healthy person can sometimes display some narcissistic traits but that is entirely different from having npd or being a narcissist anyone who saw me drunk at my 30th birthday party could have observed a solid few narcissistic traits to date is to risk being lied to either take the risk with open eyes or dont but dont fool yourself into thinking there is any perfect way to avoid manipulation in life there is not perfect system life is risk yeah do that take him seriously and make him explain what is funny about calling you an evil predatory person who wants to hurt sick people no sarcasm no bullshit take him dead seriously ouch thats hurtful im just joking its funny to call me an evil person who wants to hurt others no its not great then quit it if hes your friend hell take note if he wants to be a jealous jerk more than he values your friendship well youll find out your therapist sounds deeply irresponsible dont date someone you feel this insecure about dont date someone if you do not trust them do not date someone if you are not comfortable with how they handle their past experiences or conflict with you dont see a therapist who diagnoses someone who isnt even in the room based on the story you tell in a single session dont you go diagnosing someone via google no one knows if this woman is mentally ill or a narcissist based on what youve shared here if youre giving your gf leeway on behaviours you would rather not accept in a partner address that or end the relationship doesnt suit you you need to block her that is what no contact really means she is going to keep on circling back either out of boredom curiosity or a desire for attentionvalidation it is sad her cousin is in trouble but youre not her support network thats not a thing you can address youre an ex an ex who requested no contact youre not friends stop letting this person pick at your wounds for their own sake i can see youre really trying to come at this from a good and kind place but i think a bit of a reality check this is not just grief this is also a bad manager youre describing some very toxic management behaviours that were almost certainly present prior you were just in the first few months of a honeymoon period of a new gig and you hadnt seen your bosss weaknesses yet all bosses have some youre describing some particularly bad ones open contemptlack of respect focused on blaming not solutions isolating employees to retrain control emotionally manipulative and this is your managers fault and your managers managers fault if they need to take leave because they cannot perform and treating people with respect and managing communication with the team are performance issues for a manager then they need to actually take leave and the daytoday responsibilities need to be addressed by someone else there is not much you can do but recognize this this behaviour is not okay it may have escalated recently due to grief but it is probably not brand new if your company is at all healthy then your managers manager is aware of the performance issues doesnt mean theyll do anything about it but they likely know stop trying to figure out how to address your bosss feelings and start focusing on how to navigate your workplace and responsibilities from the perspective that you have a really shitty boss right now maybe they werent always shitty but id bet they always had these weaknesses and maybe they wont always be this way but right now they are your boss and they are really really bad at it the strategies you need to learn are how to work for a bad boss ditch him i dont fuck men who tell me they are skeptical about my gender identity or sexuality i used to try to be chill with the whole youre probably a lesbian really or i cannot believe youre really bi but no fuck that noise you can believe me when i speak if you dont we dont fuck oh maybe this is just a reading comprehension issue and not a legal theory one apparently not im not a lawyer either but i imagine any actual legal training might even get in the way of said knowledge youre a lawyer its shitty to have sex in your own living room while your roommate is also passed out in said living room but its not banging on a swing set behind the grade school itd be funny to hear the talking to op would get if they actually called 911 because they woke up a few feet from their roommate hooking up she shouldnt be including people in her kink without their consent and if you want a no sex in common area rule then just speak up and say so its a totally reasonable rule ive always explicitly had it with all my roommates no sex in shared areas like living roomsbathrooms if she wont agree to that reasonable rule then youre going to need to move but realize the rule is not really all that enforceable rule if your style as roommate includes getting so drunk that you regularly pass out in common areas she is still in the wrong but i think you should bring your anger down several notches tell her what you need to be comfortable in the shared area of the home and for the sake of the friendship file this under a misunderstanding of one another boundaries leaving your wife of 17
