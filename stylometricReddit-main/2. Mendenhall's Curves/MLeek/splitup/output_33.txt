need to say no more and you need to be more considerate and thoughtful and actually listen when i say no he needs to feel the pain of his stupid inconsiderate behaviour because you are describing an adult man who is either too dumb to bother dating or who is just so blissfully selfish as to not see that going dutch on dinner at restaurants several times a week is not feasible for a fulltime student he should feel guilty about how he has arranged the expectations about money in this relationship he has been selfish and stupid guilt is the proper emotional response to being regularly unkind to you as a partner people like you have arbitrarily decided some labourers dont deserve to eat right she got a salary of 11 million and 39 million in stock awards and other forms of compensation not much of a defence really that the average joe doesnt understand how executive compensation is structured the end result is the same her pay appears not be tied to performance and think of the companys needs but everyone elses is shes not into whatever youre asking for however basic you may feel it may be shes not into it the rest of your relationship works because you have similar values and needs in other aspects of the partnership in this area you dont you need to make a choice about the kind of relationship you can commit too and how much communication on the subject you can invest in the end though if she doesnt want what you want her to want there is no way to communicate past that there isnt much to work on there either you can make someone make an effort sometimes but you cannot make someone sincerely want something for themselves they just dont why wont he have a diploma and a drivers licence unless his parents are abusive or his home life is so unstable hes not able to get those things completed while living at home then i would make both of those a requirement as well as the job if he leaves home without those things its exceedingly unlikely hell get them if you dont want a roommate dont agree to do this hes looking for an easy escape but if hes not already doing the work to complete his diploma and take safe steps forward hes not gonna do that work living with you two either once hes in youre not getting him out until he gets really uncomfortable in your home would be way more turned off by someone who has already declared i will reject them than i would by someone who has lived a damn life by age 46 id be a bit resentful too if i thought i was entering a partnership where my opinion would matter at all and my longterm safety would be a factor to consider and it turned out i was just a tenant whose rent fluctuate based on repairs a bit of resentment is a rational response to a situation where op mistakenly believed she would be a larger part of the longterm planning than she is we dont know that op is extremely disempowered please we can be reasonable adults about this we dont have to keep such an open mind that our brains fall right out op did choose to enter the marriage on these terms she can be held accountable for that but the current situation does leave her deeply disempowered and with far more limited choices than her wife has reserved for herself and that is something they are both responsible for addressing the main gripe here is clearly about security and partnership even if op loved the home and it was in good repair there would still be some concerns here about ops ability to create a secure longterm plan im actually realizing that while i might be married financially im still single while this is frustrating and sad for you i think its an important realization and something to share with her her choices have left your longterm financial security up to you because her plans dont meet your needs or leave you feeling secure and reasonably they shouldnt so youre going to have to make your plans independent of hers and one of the things that require from her right now is that rent is just rent it doesnt change because she needs to make capital improvements or repairs the two of you need to settle on a reasonable market rate and then that is the money she gets from you towards the home if shes not prepared to plan with you then she doesnt get to rely on your additional support for her personal homeownership plans but the market rate rent shouldnt change because the owner needs to make repairs the owner just needs to make the repairs ops wife has set up a system where op is extremely disempowered in all choices from where to live to what repairs to prioritize and even what the rent actually is each month and prone to emotional manipulation to take on more risksresponsibilitiescosts for home ownership without any of the rewards or rights op is totally right to see this situation as insecure and unsafe financially for herself you both need some serious financial advice and ideally from someone who has experiencing working with couples a rental agreement that changes on the basis of necessary repairs isnt a rental agreement right now your wife has the benefit of a secure tenant you without the real obligations to a committed a life partner also you youre not feeling secure because you are not a secure and respected partner in the home youre a tenant who is easily manipulated emotionally by status as wifey whenever it is convenient and then demoted to tenant whenever that is more convenient if your partner isnt willing to change that situation then i think you need to take a step back and think like a renter the current agreement means you are basically single and renting from a financial perspective and you should make your plans based on that if youre renting at 58 and still renting at 67 you need to know what you can afford in rent and be prepared to say no to major repairs and capital improvements to a home you merely rent in you need a tenancy agreement on paper and the rent should only be raised in accordance with local laws or at market rates not based on your partners needs in that way you can plan for your retirement independently from your wifes property plans you sound like you have totally incompatible goals about how to spend money and time if you dont want to fund her travels you need to be honest about that while there is no shame in living at home its perfectly fair for her to say it makes you incompatible with her as a partner if i had been dating someone for three years and they preferred saving money at home to starting a shared life with me id be questioning the relationship as well a lot of women you date at this age will not want to date someone who still lives at home simply because of the restrictions it creates on the relationship youve indenified the right problem he told you not to expect him to moderate his behaviour properly hes making excuses for the next time he behaves badly when he doesnt get his way its important for adults to be able to roll with a bit of inconvenience or disappointment without acting like little shits or worse i would date a guy who said im sorry its something im working on but not a guy who said im sorry but its just who i am so youre going to have to accept it sometimes dont date someone who spends the first few weeks warning you they are going to treat you poorly they will and then they will turn around and blame you for not accepting the shitty treatment dont speak to what he feels or what he knows dont make assumptions or put words in his mouth dont be condescending dont create false hope the idea that you may change your mind or get back together some day are normal fantasies to have but they are almost always fantasies right now its a break up because you want to break up speak for yourself and speak honestly youre happy you dont feel youre compatible you want to break up the first thing you do to get through this is abandon all illusions of control there are no perfect words or magic incantation that make this go perfectly smoothly and gives you everything you want including the vague hope of a future where you reconnect be clear to be kind dont let it be drawn out unnecessarily dont get into a debate dont pursue closure closure is a thing for you each to figure out on your own its not work you do together remember that he doesnt owe you friendship any more than you owe him a relationship you can ask for what you want but in the end if he doesnt also want that or if he wants to set this bridge on fire and piss on the flames there is nothing you can do to change that this is all more than a little silly i have rarely been the only person with my name in any class or workplace your gf could go by that name she is currently choosing not for her own reasons consideration convenience or anything else ifwhen your gf chooses to go primarily by that name she can and will my mother and my partners mother have the exact same name its only very occasionally confusion we know who is who hes probably not the safest or healthiest person for you to seek support from for these big feelings for that reason i wouldnt do it you need and deserve support far more than he has any right to know what was in the end a personal medical event your ex is just not the right place to go looking for that comfort and empathy a week after the breakup tell him to stop bringing it up unprompted its unwelcome this is the opposite of helpful hes only making another barrier for you and making it a bit harder for you to be honest and transparent with him because you dont want to have to manage his feelings about it tell him in no uncertain terms to back the hell off if he means well then he needs to do well and doing well right now means shutting up completely about this for a least a few weeks she a mentally ill addict with ten years on you you dont handle her you handle you and you step away from a connection that is not healthy or productive for you this before the reunion i was willing to cut marshall a lot a slack for being an imperfect human being in a very shitty situation now i just plain old dont like him hes not a monster just a big ole nope jordon peterson retired from uoft he had not taught since 2017 which is a polite way of saying he was no longer welcome or productive in any serious academic environment and hadnt been for a long while hes a grifter he found a more lucrative grift on the radicalization pipeline he did not and will not respect transgendered students he was never threatened with jail for misgendering of his students he was fundamentally mischaracterising the law he was merely sternly reminded by his employer that he was expected to treat individuals on campus with respect after he went in the record saying he may choose not too respect if an individuals
