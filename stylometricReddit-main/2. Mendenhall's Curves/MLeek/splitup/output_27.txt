doesnt feel good its not exciting or fun a guy who behaved like you are and created all the pressure on us both trying to earn my comfort would be extremely annoying and not someone id want to date you could be the most trustworthy human being who ever lived and im still not going to do something i dont want to do she shouldnt either if you dont enjoy leaving your comfort zone for her then stop doing it you only had a foundation of five months this was the likeliest outcome of a sudden separation and she was clear with you she is overwhelmed and needs to focus on her deployment it doesnt mean you did anything wrong it means this situation was not conducive to a stable and healthy connection continuing to grow cry it out eat some sugar or some carbs dont beat yourself up that an objectively tough situation in a very young relationship didnt pull through for you most people not just women want to feel desired its not about being a douchebag or being rude its about being expressive and transparent that youre into her sexually the relationship might be doomed you might be incompatible regardless youre far too old not to realize that very few people men or women enjoy sex with doormats we pretty much all want to feel our partner has got a full rich life they want to share time and energy with us not that they are desperately clinging to us and have nothing going on besides the relationship to which they give all thier time and engery we pretty much all want to feel our partner really wants us and is excited by us and isnt so terrified of rejection or offence that they wont express that this is abusive behaviour consistently baseless accusations of cheating are a tactic to keep you trying to prove yourself and service his needs hes set up a sisyphean task itll take all your energy to defend yourself and you never actually will it may be time to tell him that you refuse to be played like that youre willing to work through his anxieties with him but not for him if he keeps trying to make this your job to solve a problem that exists solely in his head the marriage is going to end maybe not tomorrow but sooner or later you cannot maintain a marriage where you are treated this way ask him to see a doctortherapist on his own its a sudden change and he needs an assessment to make sure these fearsfeelings are rooted in a physical or medical issue do not agree to couples counselling unless he is willing to speak to someone himself first and he is willing to be accountable for his behaviour if he doesnt do those two things is is very likely he will just use what he learns in couples counselling to refine his tactics of abuse and its probably time to have an emergency plan know where your important documents are and know where you are going if you need to leave quickly you need to consider the possibility of real danger they are probably not legally married because he is on record as believing the government ruined marriage with things like nofault divorce unpleasant as she might be its hard not to feel for a young woman having a child with a man who has gone on record as believing she is property and should have no legal right to leave him ever looking through your replies here i had given this guy way to much benefit of the doubt you are being lied and strung along hopefully that certainty makes it a bit easier cause sheesh this isnt even a case of not that into you this is a clear case of shitty person is fucking with you stop letting them i dont think your wife has ever had a 10 dick or toy or a bruised cervix very very very few people actually want 10 inches of insertable length seriously play stupid games win stupid prizes this was a stupid joke that you started get a grip and let it go do we need to insult her appearance she doesnt look 35 and rationally we know shes not and shes not behaving online as if shes much above 17 she can be a deeply unpleasant person or even a bigoted and hateful person and still be in a relationship with a seriously problematic power dynamic with a man who appears to be nearly 10 years older than she is and openly discusses her and now his unborn daughter as property shes already the second wife its part of his origin story his first wife was seven years older than him and apparently started cheating and doing sex work two years into their marriage maybe the first wife was abusive maybe hes full of shit well never know but perhaps recognizing how the age gap impacted his first marriage he goes out and finds himself someone about a decade younger than him to toe the line he doesnt have to be a narcissist to be doing you real harm and no obviously you should not let him come crawling back and its not ghosting if you tell him what is happening so tell him youre gonna sort out the leave then as soon as youre not legally bound to him you will be blocking him and never want to speak to him again call a tenants rights organization in your area and then the leasing office the quicker you move to invalidate the lease the more options youll have tell them this strategic truth your exbf was misleading you and its no longer safe for you to move in with him all of his exes are crazy all his exes will aways be crazy he makes sure to drive them crazy get rid of him for good the baby is still in utero and hes posting about how she wont be allowed to leave the home until she is married or go to college because college is for skankroos first lady of the manosphere one might assume before or after ones eyes roll right out of ones head not having the papers isnt unusual coming up with several different versions of the story for not having them is and a young man spending several days without his phone in a hospital after a fall where he only has a bruise to show for it that does strain credulity dont call his bluff dont play detective this person has barely been in your life a few months and youve found them unreliable dishonest and only reaching out to you when he needs validation or assistance just end it cleanly act like nothing happened because nothing has changed its not like hes gonna tell your mom that hes a serial cheater youre both showing up for the meal because youre young people respecting your mother as host thats it just do that you dont have to be terribly smart to be an effective manipulator toddlers are effective we really just cannot know the legal ramifications in a case like this the parents may not have been legally entitled to visitation or the care team could have advised against it does it look bad from the outside hell yeah am i gonna damn the parents no they struggled for nearly a decade with a seriously ill and complex child needing to surrender a dangerously mentally ill family member to the state is a devastating decision a child even more so whatever they did wrong there is no question they have suffered op needs to make the best choices for his own health but hating these people isnt productive from a bunch of online randos what are you doing to manage your anxiety because while i think your mother is being unkind and silly not to just let you be responsible for your own laundry this is not really a rational riskmanagement strategy and when anxiety crops up in this sort of way its usually pretty damn prevalent in a bunch of other ways too or even just indigestion you ate too many spicy wings and are feeling pretty uncomfortable burpy or gassy or something well lets just put you in a possibly uncomfortable position and ram my body inside of you repeatedly or maybe a lot of bouncing yeah you could do all the bouncing instead what but why not it would be unkind to ask its perfectly acceptable to say no its just not working for you dont worry about if youre enabling them or not just stand up for yourself this constant shortterm loaning is exhausting and uncomfortable you dont want to do it anymore if she wants to let you know what is going on she can confide in your or not but either way youre not a cheap payday loan officer so quit that job are you in a relationship or a hostage situation hes basically holding a gun to the head of the relationship and demanding you fuck him or hell shoot it dead but its already dead tell him he is right youre not compatible youre an adult who is capable of compassion and nonsexual affection as well as sexual affection and hes just not this relationship is over it doesnt matter how right you are if you continue to attempt to punish her with demands of payment the relationship is over and youll never see the money its not about who has the right its about the actual reality so just face it consider 800 an expensive lesson that this is not the person you want to move forward with as an adult partner with more and more serious obligations and expenses continued grievances about the debt are only going to hurt you more not make you any wealthier your ex is an abuser and a manipulator i honestly wouldnt believe a word he says about his dad im sure his dad is hearing all sorts of crazy untrue stories about you the facts we know are that your 30yearold bf went from mooching off his dad to mooching off you to mooching off his dad again maybe as a super cheap babysitter wise up this man is already ruining your life slowly its not gonna get any better youll never appease him he wants to abuse you nothing you send him will ever convince him to stop doing the thing he wants to do it can only get worse keep records and be prepared to get the police involved if needed but end all contact with your abusive ex i think bringing this question into a group session with people who know you a bit better and have at least a bit more similar experiences is a great idea in the end your therapist is right this really is about what you want to do connecting with your family will be hard work in a lot of ways you dont have to do that work at a glance it seems your family recognizes that and is open to having as much or as little interaction as youd like this really is about whether or not you want to have any kind of personal relationship with them most people are gonna suggest that its probably worth the work to try to connect with them at least a bit because even just a very few personal relationships are pretty really important to human happiness however this just isnt a question anyone else can answer for you in the end this decision belongs completely to you and that does make it tough especially if youve spent a long time institutionalized and under care you may not have a lot of experience with big choices that belong entirely to you and this one really does you
