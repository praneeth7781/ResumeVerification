the importance of private schooling if the rest of this doesnt scare you that should terrify you that disagreement is going to harm the children shes told you she is going to be constantly chasing status and making comparisons between your family you and everyone elses family if dont share that keeping up with the jones mentality and want to spend big to keep up public appearances then youre signing up for misery also shes way too old to be this much of a brat dont do this use the letter to sort out your thoughts but then if you really need to express these thoughts to him and have decided to take the risk do it facetoface whatever the outcome youll feel far far more confident and at peace with it if you do it face to face i promise its scarry to do things the right way to get a clear answer but thats the better path and believe it or not if youre gonna get rejected itll hurt less that way if you cannot face this risk in person then you shouldnt be taking the risk at all hes not a faithful man he never has been can you be secure and healthy with someone you cannot reasonably expect to be faithful to you you are being naive these are not challenges this is him making choices major changes in character and in core choices are rare and they have to be internally motivated unless he has explained clearly why he has changed his choices moving forward for himself and the life he wants for himself and not just to appease you there is no reason to believe he will not choose what he feels perfectly entitled to choose which is to engage with sex workers and lie to you about it youre 23 you got a hell of a lot more life left i wouldnt recommend wasting any more of it on this one nothing about that ran out as rhetorical to me if it was an attempt to persuade op of anything else except that you believed her to be held culpable for being emotionally abused and manipulated for years it was not well stated yet here you are claimed it was a joke to brush it off as if not trying to get him mad at you for lying to you thats pretty wild and makes no sense it makes perfect sense for someone in an eightyear partnership who is used to being silenced lied to and made deliberately distressed you stop responding reasonably to the manipulation and abuse because reasonable responses to it never stopped the behaviour in the past you get confused direct communication feels impossible that is the goal of this kind of abuse to make it feel impossible and pointless to respond in the reasonable ways with legitimate anger or clear boundaries that you assume op should it doesnt happen overnight its not all ops fault they cannot fix him by being better their responses to being abused are flawed but very human this is the kind of flaws that ongoing abuse will bring out in most of us this isnt enabling this is the misfiring of survival instincts and toxic coping techiniques after years married to an emotional abuser it doesnt get better for op until op gets out youre supposed to leave the man who is either so conflict adverse he is unwilling to admit when he hasnt done something or so maliciously and gaslighting abusive that he takes pleasure in manipulating you and making you suffer this is a big deal hes acting more like an unhinged prison guard than a partner at some point it stops mattering if he does this because he is weak and fearful and cannot admit when he has failed to do something or if he does this because he takes pleasure in abusing you the end result is the same hes a gameplaying numbnut divorcee who wants to be chased even as hes telling you that he is not available to be caught he wants to feel desired by you and others without actually having to offer anything of himself or do any of the hard work of being more than just nice just end contact there is nothing here for you but drama so all these people like each other more than they like you which sucks for you but isnt a fight you can win there is not letting these adults make their own choices there is only you deciding what relationships you still want to be in its not your flat youre not on the lease these other people the subletter and your girlfriend were invited by the person who does lease the flat you didnt do them an act of kindness it wasnt yours to give to them the core issue here is that your gf doesnt want to move in with you when you return shes not prioritizing living with you thats plenty of reason to decide the relationship cannot or should not continue but this narrative you have about other people taking advantage of you or victimizing you is nonsense they disappointed you is all you had a room in someone elses house and that someone else has invited others instead if you dont want to continue with your gf dont but drop the rest of this bullshit id consider it a rather serious red flag if a man used the word emasculating at me in anger because i had achieved personal success or experienced personal stress both of these are human things hes telling you he thinks his achievements and his stress and carry more meaning than yours because hes a guy and youre a girl this is a serious issue you need to stop building him up about his career and instead tell him plainly that he is not entitled to rip you down because of his own twisted ideas about women and men or his own negative feelings he needs to manage his feelings without explosions of anger or gendered insults those behaviors should be dealbreakers emasculating is not a word he should be using or even thinking when it comes to your career path or achievements yeah i dont get it my parents are rather happily married for 40 years they are both basically good people but they described their vows as sincere workable wishes which is the best way i think you can look at it and something i practice with my partner now its not a prison sentence its a promise to work hard and work first at this shared wish and also to stop working and go on wishing the best for one another if we find no amount of effort means we can stay in the partnership without being miserable yeah so friends speak once and then hold their peace or remove themselves that is how you deal with a serious concern about a friends choice in partner respectfully and ill happily agree for the second time they may be toxic and we cant know i dont think youre being the critical thinker you imagine you are but you do seem to be reflecting a common bias where a body you find undesirable is immediately associated with behaviour or personality you assume is undesirable as well there is nothing here that suggests op is an unreliable narrator while that is certainly possible there usually are tells i dont see any and you havent pointed any out your interpretation took way more assumptions than mine did all mine hinged on was the fiance not speaking up for his own choice to be with op clearly to his friends thats a pretty defensible take whether we completely accept ops reasoning or not fianc should still be standing up for his own choices even if those choices are mistakes you really should consider why your story the one where op must be toxic and the friends nobbling defending him from her is the one you felt compelled to tell and doubled down on because it didnt require critical thinking or skepticism it required a rather fallaciousseeming leap the devil has plenty of advocates already and playing one doesnt actually make you seem interesting or insightful it just makes you sound like a motivated reasoner why do you want to imprison this man with a wife who resents him and doesnt want to be with him its not like thats a great deal for him either if op isnt able to willing to change the shared goals and expectations she has then he deserves to be free of her just as much as she deserves to be free of him and do you think people didnt walk away from their partners constantly in the previous centuries due to poverty or illness cause they did in droves sometimes with a bit of social shaming but far less than you might imagine men more than women which is not a comment so much on mens general character as it is their power and agency to leave a undesirable situations and seek greater comfort and convenience elsewhere its so funny how individualism went awry just the time as when women achieved the most basic human rights and the ability to leave situations they found intolerable no we dont get to dictate how others deal with objects or memories from experiences that were traumatic or abusive op can absolutely bring his feelings and needs forward but she doesnt have to do this because the ex was abusive if anything the fact he was abusive may contribute to her connection to objects that represent the positive aspects of the relationships because all abusers have some positive traits at times that is how they entrap it does to me but also these are very stupid and desperate criminals unlike the magic power to declassify documents by looking at them he retained that until the very last second and then some yes id recommend these things get put away in a drawer and from there you suck it up not because your feelings are irrational but because grief especially grief and processing after long term abuse are super fucking complicated you can ask her to do this work for you and your comfort that fair if its a thing you really need and boundaries you need to revisit but id recommend you not force the issue shes very likely to let go of more in time but two years after seven of abuse is not full processing time for most people shes probably not holding onto him shes preserving the story of her own life you shouldnt stay in a relationship you dont want to be in your husband needs to stop gettingseekingstaying at jobs where he is either not able to succeed or his work ethic doesnt line up with expectations becoming successful is not a reasonable expectation if that is what you need its probably time to walk away go date someone who already is becoming stable reliable and less miserable should be the shared goal and expectation of him if youre going to stay that may include a major change of industry andor changes in expectations about how he will contribute laugh and then hopefully wake up from the strange dream where my partner and my father are not both rational and civil men who can resolve disagreements and do not order me around like a dog we always just have ops pov they are frequently manipulating the internet for validating responses do you jump in on every thread to remind us of that fact or just the ones where you suspect the fatcard look if you think its not very probable that a group of people have deemed someone unworthy primarily due to their weight i do not know what universe youre living in cause it aint the one i inhabit ive happily agreed
