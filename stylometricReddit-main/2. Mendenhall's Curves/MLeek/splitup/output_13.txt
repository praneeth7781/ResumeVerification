really need to accept that its the truth the rest of this is your internal bullshit and baggage and you need to get a grip on this i said about sleeping with him that night was unlikely to change the situation he still probably would have continued on with someone else you just would have been hurting more when he did i also dont sleep with people on the first date as a matter of principle i want to take the time to reflect on my experience with them and think about the vibe check before i climb into bed if someone rejects me for this reason that is fine because im confident with my choice nevertheless why are you fixating on sex this was not about sex thats your anxiety and insecurities but it has little to do with this you had one good date that fizzled out thats all thats very very normal seriously this isnt a healthy perspective on dating at all go talk to a therapist and work on owning your own power to choose people and express your interest stop talking to your mother if her advice is straight out of 1940 you did nothing wrong he was actively he met someone else he may have liked you very much he liked someone else more sleeping with him that night was unlikely to change the situation only make it hurt more its also possible he felt he was purchasing sex with his dinner in which case you dodged a bullet either way this was a nice date and appropraite ending to a connection you didnt have sex you didnt want to have nothing is wrong here thems the breaks this relationship is over the quicker you get yourself the support you need and get an enforceable legal agreement in place the better off your kids will be all the studies suggest that separation when your children are under 4 is way less damaging than doing it later get this work done now use couples counselling to negotiate the end speak to a lawyer get an individual therapist involved for yourself and the support you need apparently there is no other way for women to support one another and build a vibrant community and family except to surrender to this mans and his gods version of servitude to men what this really tells you sadly is this man has no idea how to maintain healthy relationships or lead a fulfilling life as part of a community except to coerce a woman into doing that work for him make a pillow wall or get a bigger bed but also he has to wake you up he just has to nothing else is going to work except to make you uncomfortable whining about you being not nice while youre unconscious is not an excuse you can and should make some suggestions to address this but he has also gotta be willing to advocate for his own sleep if he stopped moving pushed back or woke you up when you disturbed him your habits while unconscious would be far more likely to adjust if he always accommodates these behaviours while youre asleep youll keep doing them while youre asleep because the asleep version of you doesnt have a problem he has to give the sleeping version some consequences for bad behaviour end all contact with her and get therapy immediately youre hitting yourself that is either a serious mental illness or an attempt to manipulate her this isnt about all women this is about you your inability to make healthy choices for yourself right now including the choice to stop dating her so stop dating her and please get help for the selfharming behaviours they are not her fault they are something you need to address for yourself there is nothing to do except say to your gf i think hes flirting with you do you think hes flirting with you youre entitled to share your opinion and to listen respectfully to hers that is the end of your power and then let her deal with it trust her judgement or dont date her its her classmate they are her boundaries to enforce when she deems it necessary and in the way she feels is appropriate and right for her dont expect your young gf to go around put other men on blast just because youre having a bad feels get a grip manage your own shit and expect your gf to do what she deems necessary and appropriate do you think youre friends if so id recommend you stop considering this a job and instead call it a favour or hobby for which you might be compensated decide in your own head how much youre willing to do without being paid be at peace with that and then once you hit that either say no or ask for payment either that or tell him youre not available for this work any longer as you need to focus on other lines of income but value his friendship its totally fine to turn down work because the terms just dont feel right to you yeah she knows and if she stopped when she was caught then youve called out the behaviour as much as productively possible dont get hung up on battles you cannot win if youre gonna stay in this relationship save your strength the fights that matter if she stopped this one is as resolved as its every going to be exactly an apology in this case is just a pointless attempt at a power play an apology that everyone involves knows is a lie changes nothing its just score keeping if op is gonna stay in this relationship shes gonna need to learn to pick her battles asap what is the line you think can be drawn here you have to force your mother to pretend to apologize for harassing me or you have to be willing to end all contact and probably your childrens contact with your mother if she wont apologize to me the first one is pointless theatre and the second one is a pretty excessive demand for bf and his children to go no contact with his mother even though bf has never actually chosen to introduce op to his mother if that is what op really needs for this woman to not be in her life at all she is probably headed for a breakup because while that is a totally valid need its not likely to be one her partner is going to immediately agree to this toxic unhinged woman is present in his life and hes can demand she treat op with respect when he includes op but he cannot perfectly control his mother if shes inclined to this degree of nonsense absolutely do not reach out to her yourself ever this is not your battle to fight this is 100 between him and his mother however he doesnt control her he can create boundaries he can say if you dont apologize i wont talk to you anymore but frankly that is a waste of a boundary the boundary hes actually going to need is if you cannot be respectful of my new gf when i am ready to introduce you to her then you will see less of me and of the grandchildren until youre willing to behave with respect towards important people in our lives of course she should apologize but shes not gonna and she wouldnt mean it anyways you cant fix other people you dont get to communicate through idiocy and insanity there is nothing to be worked through here youre not gonna move past this this doesnt get resolved with an apology youre gonna live with a toxic and sorta crazy person in your life unless he chooses to cut all contact with her hes fundamentally correct he cannot and should not be having this fight until he needs to have this fight you either need to trust him to step up when it becomes necessary or you need to leave this relationship you know this is a you problem and that you need to work on it if you want happy and healthy relationships in your life with her or anyone if that isnt enough for you how can anything we say fix this speak to a therapist if youre unable to address these feelings and intrusive thoughts yourself go low contact there is nothing to gain from these relationships you only show up for them out of obligation learn to manage those feelings of duty in healthier ways dont fight who they are just minimize the damage they are able to do to you as an adult nah you were right to cut him off he was either inconsiderate or not that into you or both invest your time elsewhere the issue is you dont like her boundaries you keep pushing against them which is why she is further clarifying what behaviour she is willing to accept from you at this time either you do x or im walking away is a boundary a firm one what you are saying here is that she really should walk away from you which means you are also just as responsible for walking away from her at this point stop having a conversation this doesnt require a compromise your accusations are totally out of whack with reality she doesnt have a problem you do if you think shes doing these nasty things to you then there is truly nothing else to talk about you solve your problem by ending the connection that doesnt suit your needs that doesnt seem fair im not selling an ebook or a program or any crypto at all while she might not be perfect youre being really really immature and resentful about this you need to end this its not on her you have to end it because you are not okay with it it makes perfect sense that she may be looking forward to meeting you and possibly seeing if there is something there in a few months when youre in the uk but unwilling to commit to you at this point at this point she is offering you friendship it is valid if she decides that friendship doesnt include details about her dating life some friendships dont she has told you that you are not exclusive and that she is single which is what she needs to be clear about if she not telling you about other dates she may be on that is because she has judged probably correctly that you are overinvested in this connection and will not handle that information well this is all on you man you dont have to like her choices but her choices sound reasonable and yours dont youre judging her extremely harshly for not being willing to commit to an ldr with a person shes never met for many months thats not hostagetaking or manipulative thats sanity you havent been friendzoned you have been person i met online only and will not meet in person for many months zoned because that is what you are right now she sounds pretty clear about what she is offering you right now which is not exclusivity because of course she isnt you live an ocean away and have for months and will for several months more you majorly overinvested in an ldr and youre blaming her for not taking responsibility for your feelings and making it her job to end this connection to protect you from your own poor choices thats not fair its your job to end this if it doesnt work for you her boundaries with you right now make a lot sense you are not committed to one another youve never even met in person compatibility is still a big question mark no matter how much you enjoy speaking to one
