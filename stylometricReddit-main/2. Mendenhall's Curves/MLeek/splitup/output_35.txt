issue of money then maybe you want to contribute to the hotel bill honestly though this shouldve been sorted out when the invitation was made it shouldnt have been held off until a few weeks before they arrive it shouldve been part of the structure of the invitation so all parties knew exactly what they were getting into in the future you need to make this a core part of the planning from the

more heinlein than they have and you have some notes she says in the op she is in therapy and that all the miscarriages were in the last year it strains credulity to imagine he was unaware of all of

definitely arent going to help he only noticed this because of his asian fetish if you watch any busy sidewalk for 10 mins youll see the vast majority of young women yield to men of all ages unless there is a walker or stroller involved most women yield and most men claim their space in public you can find lots of anecdotal stories out there from women who decided to stop yielding and moving out

dont think men should have feelings or normal human vulnerabilities or sentimentalities best to just ignore their trolling id bet youre right she was likely taught this in therapy standins or proxies like this are a tool therapists will sometimes suggest to help people and not just children communicate or signal they are ready to communicate about difficult things while i wouldnt enjoy it its not necessarily unhealthy i wouldnt be overly concerned about it but you should be able to ask her questions about this tool and how it works for her and express discomfort if you have any in an ideal world she would have discussed this technique with your prior to implementing it in your relationship but its possible that its so natural and normal to her she didnt realize it would be strange for someone else to be on the receiving end of it for the first time yeah and i believe arnolds son with maria shriver did choose to work out moredifferently and change his look later on in life there is no bodyshaming here guy on the right just looks like a normal human being and not someone who is necessarily pursuing a career as an action movie star which is what is happening in the image above the child he had with the housekeeper and hid is the one on the left the data was already wrong and they held the charts upside down they didnt arnold had a child with the housekeeper and hid it from the rest of his family for over a decade and he held the charts upside down biology and his own ignorance about the impact of miscarriages and grief have isolated him you didnt do it to him hes a full participant in this dynamic and he is not putting in the work to address it try to open up to him about your fears and stress explain to him that while his optimism and happiness is lovely for him it can be exhausting work for you to both manage your complex feelings and your body and also be made responsible for addressing his feelings in the way he enjoys most you would benefit from being more open with him but he also needs be a much safer and more empathetic person to be open with your feelings are valid and you will not always have the bandwidth to take care of his too he needs to do better and recognize the actual valid emotional complexity of this situation for you he cannot just steamroll you with me me meing and it wasnt like at all what happened but the one who was raised by the mother is the buff one in the left arnold didnt acknowledge him until he was publicly shamed into it when the kid was like 14 it was the dude on the right who was raised by arnold for fucks sake maria shriver is standing right behind him and also fuck that noise hes not a movie star so he doesnt to do the work to look like one me neither howd you get ask her how shes feeling from constant texting and asking if im going to leave him hes a bully being insecure or confused doesnt make you not also a bully have you talked about it it doesnt seem completely unreasonable as neither of you appears to have planned sex into the equation i think its actually an important stage in a couples relationship when you can spend time together without having sex but given the whole context of this ldr this is a thing you need to talk about and you need to do it before you leave its not fair to either of you to carry this anxiety and not attempt to resolve it and understand one another while youre together if you want to date paul your friendship with jay is probably over you dont always get everything you want outta life jays
