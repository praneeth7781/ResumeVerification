need to ask him and make it clear you have not agreed to covering all the finances for an indeterminate length of time he needs a plan to meet his obligations he needs to communicate that plan to you stop trying to fix the job search issue for him start expecting him to address your very reasonable fears and boundaries like a reasonable person its not your job to find him a job its his his to explain to you how he is going to meet his responsibilities once this contract ends its not totally crazy to be looking forward to job searching after his contact ends but if that is his plan he needs to tell you he has enough cushion to make it happen you are not his safety net you just moved in together that is not a kind or reasonable expectation of you i didnt want a better life for the women just tell him the truth its not working for you this daily texting is awkward and confusing you dont want to continue it you cant build a serious connection like this its hard to even build a friendship tell him you want to stop wish him well block him when he doesnt reply with grace its not fair its obviously abusive behaviour youre not in an ethically nonmonogamous relationships youre in an emotionally abusive one i honestly dont know how women have sex with men in some states these days at all i love sex but it seems unnecessarily risky but at least now you know he wasnt getting better he just has a little while where he had fewer reasons to be utter shit now he has a new reason to be a selfish abusive peace of shit and hes going all in on it you dont need a perfect excuse but his transparent attempts to bully manipulate and shame you into silencing your own feelings and needs are pretty damn perfect as valid reasons to dump a person goes hes gonna call you selfish and stubborn if you were paying his rent and donating a kidney he just wants to get his way it has nothing to do with reality one of my few boundaries in my open relationship is that neither of us sleep with who is not prochoice even though protection is always used as well i may stay in the relationship with someone else being pregnant but i wouldnt try to force a polycule or triad because she got pregnant the two of them may have a relationship as coparents and that would remain separate from my relationship as partner or friend with either of them but you really shouldnt stay in this relationship he is manipulative and emotionally abusive and if he actually uttered the words small inconvenience to refer to his own child i might take a baseball bat to his bits before i go there is nothing here but to live and learn people are more than just toys or experiences they are people first and foremost dont think because youre less experience its okay to treat someone who isnt openly transparently consenting like a toy or a fun ride its still really important to talk about what you want dont make assumptions about what they want or feel even if you had watched the movie he may still have ended up connecting with and choosing someone else so dont follow that road in your head to silly places its totally normal and healthy to have fantasies but stop fixating on this guy just keep dating use your experience to inform your future choices this is just not a person to engage with the rest is unknowable you can know you were right to get away from her there is nothing to learn here except that you were right eventually good for you but the term youre looking for is serial monogamist or even cowardly little shit sociopath is a stretch based on what youve given here and monkey brancher is from incelpua land with their notoriously terrible understanding of evolutionary psychology if you dont want to be associated with misogyny dont use their buzzwords you can be plenty angry with one shitty person who happens to be a woman without buying into the resentful bullshit that will damage your relationships with all women file this under shitty person is shitty and move on closure happens when you stop caring why shitty is shitty and just be glad to be staying away from it youre incompatible also pair bonding is just a profound misunderstanding misogynists have about birds that they have used as an excuse to shame women if anything human beings can actually get better at forming intimate relationships with more healthy practice at it but that doesnt matter here youre not compatible with her and thats okay you dont trust her dont date someone you dont trust also dont be a controlling twat but that is a seperate issue it just has nothing to do with her cognitive or neurochemical ability to create and maintain partnerships in her own life a yellow flag but not a red one at three months you should be a little bit skeptical of anyones report of their crazyabuse ex but reactive abuse is a very real thing the key word is react people are not at thier best when facing frequent abuse they snap they lash out they do crazy toxic things in reaction to being abused mutual abuse is rare reactive abuse is common and lots of abusers try to push their victims to react so they can blameshift and gaslight the victim into thinking its their fault keep your eyes and ears open but no not an immediate red flag improve first then communicate to him the exact steps you are taking telling him before youve even started the work will feel like youre making an excuse like youre asking him to tolerate it or worse solve it for you and even worse still that might actually be on some level what youre trying to do get his acceptance and validation make excuses not changes so change first do the soul searching pick some strategies identify a few small steps you need to take and maybe one or two big ones maybe book a session or two with a counsellor then share with him what you are doing to solve your problem no the two things arent related in that way the national pp federation is restructuring to support statelevel decision making better and to developing more telehealth the former ceo was there for 12 years new one has been in place for about 3 i dont think anyone who understands ngo life cycle would find this all that shocking sad for the individuals involved absolutely also totally sane leadership wont lie to you that was all pretty damn bad the point now is to get your head on straight so you dont make similar mistakes when youre hurting or in pain in the future thats the best way to make amends and to rebuild your trust in yourself get back to the hustle and get your financial independence back and dont be so hard on yourself you entered into an arrangement with someone you knew was paying you for sex like a lot of young people you came to realize just what that all meant it would have been rational to assume she was paying others as well looking back you can probably identify some places where you should have said no thank you or suggested she work with another trainer but she was probably far more skilled at pushing past boundaries than you were at expressing them get yourself out safely and rebuild and maybe an sti check crash on a friends couch for a bit if you need too there is nothing wrong with you its a learning experience about setting boundaries listening to your own instincts and avoiding manipulators its one a frightening number of women of all races go through and youll make it through it too i keep on validating disapointment and saddness you keep saying you get it but then immediately insisting on more angry assumptions and accusations of wrongdoing against her so you dont seem to be getting the discretion good luck youre becoming absurd in an attempt to hold on to your anger with her and find wrongdoing you met her in midmarch its now almost the end of may thats a very normal range of time for people to connect sincerely but for ones to realize its not going to work out yes that was unkind but shes entitled to her belief and if she doesnt believe he can handle it then shes right to end it regardless of what he thinks of his own capacity i do not trust youre capable of meeting my needs would be more accurate but its the same thing and valid its suboptimal phrasing but she appears to have owned her choices no problem but seriously his behaviour here is reminding me why 29 is my absolute floor im inclined to agree with her assessment most people experience validation from relationships of all kinds youre looking for a reason to make her the bad guy because she disappointed you but you dont have a good one she just disappointed you because she didnt want what you wanted the assumption she didnt tell you just about as soon as she figured it out herself is the bitter and entitled bullshit i mean those are the kinds of negative thoughts you need to stop indulging in while i think its inappropriate he didnt tell you if he never replied its not that weird that he kept it to himself a lot of people especially men do not like to admit they are being harassed and it is harassment it may be lowkey but it is that i dont block the man who sends me these sorts of texts because a i worry if he realizes hes blocked he may escalate and b i want to have a record of the behaviour in case he ever does escalate its not a comfortable thing to tell a new partner about but i always do yeah but youre letting these thoughts fester we all have passing thoughts after a break up that are are negative and irrational you have to let them go not ponder them further they wont support you being happy or kind in the future so drop that bullshit be disappointed not irrationally bitter and entitled you werent lied too you were given the best truth as she had it to give you as she realized what she wanted more clearly she told you the fact you are trying to round up an incompatibility her own needs in a more serious relationship and her very open and direct communication with you into a lie and a betrayal is a huge part of why youre not emotionally mature enough to be dating older women this is how healthy older people date its fun for a bit if youre basically compatible but it will likely end quickly once they decide its not longterm so you meet a grownass woman who is totally clear with you shes not ready for anything serious you date for a few months and she decides its not gonna work for her longterm then she tells you so plainly and directly and you still accuse her of using you or gameplaying she just told you what she wanted and you werent it thats sad but not a betrayal that was successful communication you had a good time for a while you had some basic compatibility but once she knew it wasnt for her she told you maybe the problem isnt your income or the age range maybe the problem is you need to learn to handle rejection
