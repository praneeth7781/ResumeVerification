also dislike like hyperconnectivity i can go a day or with low or no contact with my so no problem and i dont want to date someone who couldnt however one or two texts during a week especially in the context of a young relationship is not hyperconnectivity it the basic maintenance of a human connection i agree that a healthy secure relationship should be able to manage a week of no contact however that wasnt what this was on either side she was absolutely not healthy or secure and ops inability to fire off a sentence or a damn emoji one or twice over seven days from the toilet also doesnt speak well of him he wasnt deployed or studying the ice in the arctic he made a choice not to give his new relationship 30 seconds of maintenance and consideration even once during this time my father travelled and trained like this all the time he usually called once for less than 15 mins and spent 10 minutes on some break sending a postcard the bar doesnt need to be that high and 20 years ago was only 2003 we all had email many of us had flip phones and we still had pay phones and post cards it was not that unusual to make brief contact with your closest people during holidays which again this was not yeah we also had different standards for dental hygiene too the mind boggles if youve got legal protections you can seek you could report him but if you dont keep your head down and survive find someplace else to go and thrive where bigots are not given so much power over you break up are usually a healthy kind of selfish like i said a relationship shouldnt be a hostage situation if you want out then you should be out even if your reasons are irrational if you want to break up you still should its normal to feel bad we never enjoy hurting someone else a breakup isnt a negotiation youre not stuck with her just because she doesnt feel like moving back home and a relationship shouldnt just be a convenient social arrangement or a hostage situation break up are really hard and disruptive but if you dont want to be in the relationship anymore it is the hard work you need to do no one here can tell you for sure what it is you want but the reasons youve raised here for staying together itll suck at parties she doesnt want to move home are really shitty reasons to keep working at something you seriously do not want any longer all you need to learn from this is that school and workplace computers are for school work and professional work and that personal questions and research should be done on your own time you know there was plenty of bigotry and bias at play here we all know that we all know that gay men are people and they can fall in love and choose to be couples that isnt porn thats dating or romance or being human there is no reason to try and read other peoples minds and try to poll how many people online are gonna get offended stupid people exist bigoted people exist we cannot pretend they dont and its just beside the point the point is people are assholes and school computers need to be used for school work anytime you are on a device or network owned by your school or employer assume you are being watched by someone and that someone doesnt care about your intent and might be an asshole you need to speak to a therapist youre carrying a lot of resentment towards your wife but it boils down to a broken dynamic and your own struggles advocating for yourself a lot of this is about the expectations youre placing on yourself youre also clearly just burnt out on parenting you really are describing being a fully involved father which is great but yeah thats like the time a baby takes the labour division might need to be changed up but that is the work i am not saying shes perfect just that you need to do some work to approach these important conversations from a more balanced place for your own sake it sucks that the person with the bigger problem and the larger amount of work often has to be the person who adds a bit more work to their own plate first to start the ball rolling but i think that is where you are at you got a big ball of stress burdens resentments and twisted dynamics to unravel a lot of it is based in your expectations of yourself some of which seem pretty excessive to me and the partnership dynamic you have contributed to with your wife when you really lock yourself into a provider role instead of a partnership role you should speak to a therapist about priorities and how to start which conversations with your wife dude you need to find a new story all of this my dad was poors the girl of my dreams was stolen from me is a story a myth from the outsiders perspective there is basically no truth in it all its just you trying to project and assign your insecurities and jealousy to these other people without any rational basis you need to stop clinging to a story that says youre life is over because you missed your chance in your early 20s thats toxic its not what happened ya just experienced a bit of standard rejection imagining shed have fallen in love with you instead if you just had a guest room is really absurd its time to actually accept this rejection without writing a starring role for yourself in an epic tragedy for the ages if you cannot manage and reject these thoughts yourself bring them to a therapist and let them challenge this bullshit doesnt change that it would be a really big ask for a lot of people even healthy and secure ones but all you can do is be glad you found out quickly this woman was not healthy or secure try to put it out of your mind as well as you can there is nothing you can or need to do until after your exam this is creepy lots of people like to leave their desks at lunch do you really think shes have a 20 minute fuck in a busy parking lot every afternoon you need to get a grip and talk to your wife there is nothing here to discuss escalating baseless accusations of cheating should be an absolute dealbreaker even if the rest of this was not however i will say that with someone who behaves better than this a full week of radio silence is probably not good enough to support many relationships certainly not a new one a few texts throughout the week would be a reasonable ask from a healthy partner but this woman wasnt that anyways so just keep her on mute and deal with the break up when you return good luck with the exam youre replying as if i called bf the best ever who can do no wrong when what i actually said is this obviously sucks and i have no idea why shed want to keep dating him with all this drama and distrust after only one month when someone brings out the worst in you in terms of insecurities paranoia and controlling tendencies you just get the hell away from that person who brings that out in you no matter how much i appreciate she is genuinely and legitimately hurt i also think this is a terrible version of her and there is probably a better version who is more secure and mature who is dating someone else so we dont need to demonize him when he does something pretty damn reasonable you just get away before the bad dynamic messes you up even more i would refuse to date someone who expected id be constantly available to them via text i dont check my phone with im having a meal with other friends or when im at a concert or a play im out with people and those people or that art will get my full attention if i dont go the bathroom or need to call an uber im not really looking at my phone and its on silent i will sometimes have workdays where i dont respond to any personal texts that arent absolutely vital for a full 12 hours my job is not the kind where you carry a phone on your person at all times i dont know your relationship but i think he did the correct thing in setting the expectation you are being distrustful and a bit controlling and looking for every detail of his night you might also be being misled after a month of this sort of drama i dont know why youd bother continuing with someone you feel this way about it shouldnt be this hard for either of you you have some insecurities to work on if youre going to date like a busy adult with full lives but he also might be a shitty bf its impossible to say and it doesnt even matter this much drama and distrust after only a month this clearly not working for either of you this was utterly juvenile bullshit i wouldnt want to be friends with either of you and im not sure why you want to go on being friends with her after she spun this shit on you you realize shes using to you testbaitpunish her boyfriend right youre not really her friend she clearly doesnt actually value you in her life that much if she takes dumb risks like this and then cuts you out when they play out poorly youre a tool shes using to treat someone else like shit you cannot do anything except ifwhen this comes up again admit you were wholly and completely wrong and childish af no excuses no explanations just a straightup i shouldnt have done that was shitty i am sorry i dont know why i was so fucking stupid as to imagine it was at all funny cause you were extremely stupid unkind and you have no defence here walk away trust doesnt work on technicalities he chose a very convenient lack of transparency and hes shopping around which may be technically fine in your agreement but you should leave him to it he doesnt need to cheat to be sorta shitty multidating is common but isnt usually a stage that lasts into the five or six months range unless youre nonmonogamousopen so this isnt cultural or about multidating really this is just a lowkey not great human being who is comfortable enough with you and enjoys the benefits of being your sorta boyfriend but is not willing to commit or move forward together after five months of casual but frequent dating its time to move on he doesnt communicate to the standard you should insist on and hes either just not that into you or hes a real shithead either way times up you could ask him for a greater level of commitment and involvement in one anothers lives if youd like but i wouldnt a nearly 50yearold man who chooses the easy white lies for himself where he technically isnt betraying anyone else is just not what im looking for youre never gonna know the best thing to do is not waste any brain power on it thats not cute or clever its awkward if i did like a guy a joke about other men and multiple personalities would turn me right off just tell her what you actually want and then youll find out it is rude to expect to
