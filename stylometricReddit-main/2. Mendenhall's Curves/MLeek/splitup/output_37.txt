want to be friends with i agree you need to support your spouse through grief but i think you need to stop assuming you have perfect insight into their marriage if you cant support her in this just admit that and opt out besides the incident with the xanax the rest of this sounds like she is rather legitimately angry with an inconsiderate husband and boundarybusting inlaws you should admit that her concerns and the intensity of her feelings are way beyond what you can help her with as a friends and encourage her to speak to a therapist or counsellor you cannot give her the support shes looking for stop trying to calm her down tell her shes right that sucks and you dont know how to help if shes thinking of divorce and feeling that angry that often she should talk to a mental health professional she needs and deserves that support youre not equiped to be in a longterm committed relationship do not have a fling be an adult and break up if youre not interested in the same sort of committed relationship agreement that your gf is talk to your husband you need to let him in on this struggle youre having hell probably tell you exactly what im going to tell you if he hasnt already this man is not your friend hes never been your friend that was never his intention hes your hostagetaker he doesnt value your friendship he values the illusion of intimacy including some lowkey sexual intimacy that he is manipulating and obligating you to perform for him regardless of what your husband says i would tell your friend that your husband has seen his comments about divorce and his compliments and your husband is insisting this is inappropriate and that you need to end the friendship then you can block him you can apologize but say you need to focus on your marriage its not totally untrue and you can ignore any future contact unless you need to call 911 to go make sure hes no dead men have a very bad habit of respecting other mens property rights over their wives and girlfriend more than they respect those actual women when they speak when a man is treating me poorly i will happily use this misogyny against him to make him stop abusing my kindness while i agree her behaviour is imperfect there is something to be said for being more aggressive in group settings if the norm in the group includes dominant or fastpaced talkers like your gf your gf should be willing to moderate her behaviour however shes not solely responsible for your feelings of alienation its also on you to come up with your own strategies for handling that it might mean turning and starting another oneonone conversation i do this a lot in groups where one person tends to dominate i see if i can start a second quieter conversation with one other person its not a play you can see if someone else will engage with you while the louder person is lecturing the group it also might mean asking other people questions about things your gf does not know details about it might mean introducing a topic of conversation where you have more to say than your gf does your gf is in the wrong but this is also part of her nature that probably is never going to be completely resolved to your personal preferences and shes not the only one who needs to be a part of the solution here talking to her about the steps youre taking to feel more included in group conversations might even help give her some small things she can do to support you instead of making it all her job to make you feel included if the problem persists then you might be fundementally incompatible but id address this first as something you need to change your approachtactics on not something she has to gift you youre willfully ignorant of your own behaviours and feelings and of how those behaviours will be reasonably experienced by others and probably struggle to say simple things like im concerned or im feeling confused about the boundaries with this dude communication is gonna be rough good luck with it where in the post did i say it was the third or fourth time ive said this i didnt say it was i said especially if was this the first time you brought it up think again was it really the first time you expressed negative feelings towards her coworker and this friendship do you really think she wasnt picking up on your feelings toward him earlier than this possible not likely asking how close she is with someone isnt an insult at all dude this shit just doesnt work you cannot be willfully ignorant of the subtext and think its gonna work out well give yourself a smack up the head and be honest about your own shit she reasonably felt attacked because you did attack her behaviours instead of owning and acknowledging your own feelings of discomfort or concerns feelings which were valid and you could have expressed without the but im just asking questions bullshit games it was an accusation not a question you knew it she knew it what you meant to say was im uncomfortable and instead you said im too much of a chicken shit to talk about my valid concerns and feelings so im going to imply youre doing something bad and try to force your to justify and defend yourself instead of having an open conversation about your feelings too you probably dont mean to be gaslighting but is what youre getting at youre trying to obligate her to pretend youre being nice when you both know youre accusing her of wrongdoing what you need to do can do and should do is acknowledge youre not comfortable with this friendship that is valid that doesnt mean shes done any monstrously wrong it just means youre not comfortable and that can and should be addressed baseless shady accusations dressed up like their innocent questions yeah that shit pisses people off this is already a breakup stop prolonging your suffering stick the break up and end all contact 16 male and 19 female subjects that is not meaningful support for the idea they women can detect facial symmetry in body odour this is not how girls work not on the basis of this study oddly enough the thing that seems to be brushed right past here is that the strongest correlation in this 25yearold very small study was actually the men smelling the pretty ladies the smell of the women was rated by men as sexier the more attractive their faces these few men could sniff out a pretty face apparently the womens responses to the scent of the men were way more nuanced and less clear this would also require op actually talking about his actual feelings im concernedim feeling insecurei have questions about boundaries and not opening up with thinly veiled insults like so how close are you you need to trust me to select my own friends isnt a totally fair response to i feel insecure but its a totally valid response to baseless accusations especially if its the third or fourth time youve heard em you came to her with your concerns and she told you whats up keeping on coming at her with this over and over again is telling her that you think shes a liar and cannot be trusted to select her own friends or maintain boundaries with them if thats what you think of her dont date her if you want to talk about your feelings and have them acknowledged then go ahead and talk about your feelings a conversation about your feelings doesnt open with obvious judgement and accusatory language like how much do you two still talk and just how close are you two it starts with im feeling insecure about the level of contact im seeing can we talk about boundaries with this new friend and make sure were on the same page i need some reassurance if youre feeling vulnerable or concerned or would like different boundaries to be matinained say so talk about that but dont expect her to play conveniently stupid for you when she knows shes being directly insulted and judged not being asked to have a conversation about how youre feeling spoken like a person who has never once been at risk of being labelled that upright b who just cannot take a joke in the office there are reasons to let shit slide you dont have to agree with her choices but it can be extremely hard and risky for young women in workplaces to draw those boundaries we cannot afford to go around picking those fights needlessly with the rude men around us because there are real fights that are real risks that might need all our capital to address preferring to laugh it off is a perfectly normal response 16 male and 19 female subjects haha yeah no it really only supports what we already know women who are ovulating are more sensitive to body odour then women who are not a lot of women could have told you this themselves if youd bothered asking i think this is far too fast but that doesnt really matter very much whats the plan for the talk how do you imagine that conversation going with her are you trying to ask her if this is working for her are there things youre worried about for yourself youre not getting in this arrangement this probably wasnt about your erection it is exceedingly unlikely she thought about it a tenth as much as you are right now i know you dont want to believe that because youre feeling wounded and insecure but the worst thing you can do for your longterm happiness is let this anxiety fester youre never going to know for sure but it probably wasnt about that it was three weeks of a willtheywontthey between two longtime friends and she tapped out that was actually the most likely outcome regardless of what happened with your penis most of those connections fizzle out most of the time one or both people decide nope actually there is a reason were friends and not more youre never going to know for sure you probably wont believe her if she tells you but the facts are 1 sometimes the body and brain arent in alignment and its rarely as big a deal for women as men assume it is its normal it happens it doesnt matter much the most annoying part about it for most women is that the guy gets really emotionally worked up about it 2 very often the person we have romantic feelings for doesnt share them these two facts rarely have anything to do with one another you need to learn to say no fullsentence no excuses just no your mother can stand outside the door until your siblings let her in its important that you make your mother suffer under their bad behavior as well as she is the one with more power to actually correct it you also need to speak to your mother about some transparency into the household finances you are an adult and its not safe or responsible if she is the only one who knows how the lights get kept on what if something happens to her its way past time for her to share the budget and basic details with you if she expects you to keep contributing and living in this home as a 30 year old she might not be deliberately mistreating you but shes also not setting her adult children up for success by keeping them totally ignorant not your circus not your monkeys block him
