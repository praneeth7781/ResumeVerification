at least inconsiderate if not downright cruel nothing you do is gonna magically change him youve been clear hes been consistent this tactic works for him hes sticking to it date the man he has shown you very clearly he intends to continue to be or dont date him at all tell him the truth you dont want to date him you dont think youre compataible you have very different approaches to dating and building romantic connections dating is always a risk if you dont think this guy is a risk worth taking for you personally be honest and upfront about that it might seem mean but really its the kindest thing you can do is be clear and honest even if you do decide to date your favourite restaurant on your birthday is a lot of pressure to put on yourself go get a damn coffee on a tuesday and keep expectations and pacing managed keep your distance if they ask give them a clear no thank you dont make excuses dont be overly grateful or flattered dont compliment them or try to build them back up dont explain why dont say you dont date coworkers unless you are serious about never dating a coworker ever dont try to protect their feelings too much because that will only make you unclear and leave them with confusion or false hope be clear to be kind if they pull vague shit on you like maybe we could be clear that sounds like a bit like a date and i dont want to go on a date it feels rude it feels mean only because women are trained to be terrified of rejecting men and to never bruise their egos buts not rude or mean its the kindest thing you can do to cut through the awkwardness as quickly as possible i wouldnt want to stay in a relationship with someone who spoke to me like that i also wouldnt want to stay in a relationship with someone who was always planning for the worstcase scenario was chronically overthinking or made me feel unsafe neither of you comes off smelling like roses here both of you probably have work to do you need to figure out if its work youre gonna do together or not reality check fathers who ask for custody is court get it almost always they basically have to be drugaddicted and homeless before the court will take away all access and even then some sort of visitation would be likely custody is unbalanced because men dont seek it because so many couples default to the idea that the woman has primary or sole custody and so many men are unwilling to make the adjustments to their lives to have actual physical custody on a regular basis by your description your husband will have little trouble getting shared custody it will just take time to work through the system in the meantime you need to regulate your emotions a bit better get some support and spend some time with your family or friends get some space from this ongoing crisis its slowmoving by design and that sucks but thats the reality find some peace on the path stick with the cbt hes not gone for ever that is a nightmare youre cooking up in your head that is exactly the kind of irrational thinking your cbt should be helping you to manage masturbation is healthy communication about sex is healthy there is no issue here if youre uncomfortable hearing about it ask him to keep this subject private that is all feel however you feel but recognize he is doing nothing wrong and this has nothing to do with you you could be having vaginal intercourse every day of the week and he still might masturbate sometimes its perfectly healthy i think she is rather strong and secure she is totally right the closure is largely myth and that kwame keeping circling back to micah is completely bullshit the trouble with chelsea is that she is putting all her energy into someone who doesnt want what she wants right now thats gonna make anyone look needy and demanding she thinks if they work hard enough they can make it work its not the worst approach but its also not true not a red flag just a bad choice nothing about this seems at all unusual noncreepy men exist there is nothing to process they had a friendly lunch it sounds like youre just not compatible and its time to end this connection youll meet lots of people you vibe with and can have fun dates with but who just dont fit as serious partners dont get angry about it just accept it and let go of what doesnt work it seems unlikely that your parents are truly worse than your boyfriend they at least realized you need a job if you ever have a hope of escaping this predator call a domestic abuse hotline and ask for help youre in danger you may not want to go home but you cannot stay where you are i feel like this is saying a lot more about the comparative funding of public transit ugh that does make it way harder id still stick with the friendly lies my friend had similar hair to yours and she went crazy for this stuff dads gonna grab some for you to try make sure you really work it in there with your nails and tell me how it goes but ya really gotta keep your goals small offer everything is an offer you have to not get invested in whether or not she takes you up on them discipline and hygiene are the parents job regardless of whether or not your dad feels comfortable with it big sisters just offer with open hands fair point op grace is old enough to visit you without the rest of the family can you make that work go slow pick your battles based on how receptive your think shell be id start here i think i can help you get your hair looking cleaner would you like that leave your dad out of it as much as you can dont let your sister know youve been talking about her behind her back if she says yes you pick the products and you sit her back over a sink like they do at the salon if you can get over that hurtle then you tell a little lie ya know when i was a teen and my body changed i had a hard time with body odour too can i tell ya how i learned to deal with it sadly none of this should be done unless she says yes if this becomes a discipline issue it will just have to be your dads job your role is only as an advisor and advise requires her being consenting and open youre not the boss of her youre a person with just a bit more information than her who may have some good ideas to offer youre a good sister go slow really really slow small steps tackle the easiest stuff first leave things like nails and skin care to end if every since those will feel the most like youre trying to change who she is focus on growing up healthy not appearance play stupid games win stupid prizes if you pull that stunt expect it to be the beginning of the end youll be in race to be the bottom to see who can be less interested look its been 14 dates if you want something other than what you have with this man ask for it talk about timelines and expectations openly right now you both sound be assuming the other person is also dating other people if you want something other than that its time to say so if she doesnt say that then she isnt singlaing she wants more frequent contact if she does say that she might simply want more time with her friends after her breakup many people do like i said sooner rather than later youre gonna have to take the risk and communicate clearly and it may not go well for you thats life what do you need i have a few hours on x day no pressure but is there anything i can do for you or would you like to just hang out for a bit im just thinking of you today and sending comforting vibes no worries if you dont respond i know youre busy im just offering anything i can it is repetitive memes can be good for breaking up messages of supportaffection reiterate that you dont need a response dont get bent outta shape if you dont get one let them off the hook explicitly if she suggests concretely doing something in the near future would be the most clear sign not a vague we should do this again but a concrete i want to do x with you lets pick a time no perfect clues obviously at some point youll have to risk rejection but that would be clearest sign she isnt just looking to catch up and then talk again in a few months okayyou dont like her choices youre just not compatible listing your grievances real or imagined isnt going to change my advice youre not compatible and your insecurities may make you toxic as all hell if you dont get a grip on them there is a very real risk with this attitude that no one will ever be pure enough for you you seem to be looking for reasons to think less of them and to minimize the connection you have if you have a pattern of losing respect and affection for women because they are relatively normal human beings with full lives and dont commit to you with their hearts before they commit to you with their actual words then you need to reexamine yourself but that doesnt make you and her compatible youre simply not so stop now you do nothing more than text occasionally like an actual friend for two weeks this is in a conversation you will best judge in person see how the catch up goes dont develop an agenda beyond being her friend and being willing to be transparent about your feelings of she appears open that conversation dont try to jump the queue women are not vending machines we dont just take the next guy in line the moment were single thats kinda my point if youre communicating that unclearly in the heat of frustration even while taking the time to type and post to a bunch of random people online who can barely follow your story and understand the real issues in the hopes of giving you advice one might suspect you are also not communicating very clearly with your wife when the feelings are really intense and you actually give a damn about what she thinks this isnt rventing this is for advice for advice to work we have to be able to understand one another couples counselling i dont know if this marriage can or should survive but i know if this is how you communicate under stress nothing is gonna get better youre trickling out information very randomly you said i skipped a chore due to lack of sex but then you totally didnt cause its her chore 90 of the time these two things arent really related they arent the problem here if your communication with your wife is half as bad as it is here and you have any hope of continuing this marriage go see a couples counsellor and get some tips and tactics cause shesh whatever her struggles maybe youre not painting a picture of yourself as someone who is easy to understand and place confidence in your replies here are very strange this might
