and your mind is going to boggle keep on loving him if you want but dont be an idiot keep your financial and home life completely separate he cant be trusted partner when it comes to money or a place to live dude you got rejected by someone you chatted with for a few days whose intentions were right there in her profile this isnt a pattern this is not a friendzoning and you are far too old to use that word this is a person who was always offering you friendship and you were disappointed by that given your feelings you should probably decline her offer of friendship you cannot fix this for her she needs to acknowledge it is unhealthy and do better for her own sake as well as the relationships and that is really unlikely to happen youre being played hes in debt deep which means you are too you need to stop the bleeding you flirted with an ex you did cheat anyone sane would consider that a violation of the relationship agreement stop being a dipshit admit what you did recognize that getting dumped for it is perfectly fair reasonable its strange that you wouldnt begin with husband i want to work towards a mortgage and to do that i need to have a better idea of our financial position and that includes the business lets book some time to sit down and go over the financial situation together with the accountant the fact hes being vague is what needs to change deal with that reality dont tip toe around it and work behind his back thats isnt going to fix the problems here the finances are only half the equation youre in an abusive relationship hes escalating because your dependency is escalating he doesnt have to work so hard to mask his behaviours any more now that he has you trapped this will continue to escalate if you relocate hes not looking for a way out hes just stockpiling ammunition for the exactly the sort of combative and abusive relationship he wants to have with you deleting the texts was dishonest when you have an open phone policy thats a mistake she could have reasonably understood hed want to know she was in contact with this person and she choose to hide it she violated the spirit of the agreement even if not the the letter its not great what she did if she was here id be telling her not to date someone she needs to manage like that but his reactions is the real red flag here she doesnt have to be perfect for his reactions to be deeply concerning i actually agree with this 100 that is what everyone should want and need but you seem to refuse to realize how your behaviour is not communicating that or making much space for that your behaviour if its anything like its been in this thread is communicating that you need to be managed and pacified because you cannot control yourself very well we read what you wrote man were listening and discovering your girlfriend was right to be concerned you wouldnt respond reasonably to messages you dont like the only smart thing you did throughout this was take a huge step back when you realize you werent behaving yourself and you needed to go cool down i suggest you do that again because this isnt a problem with explaining to your girlfriend why youre mad that makes perfect sense we all understand why youre mad the place the miscommunication is happening here is your refusal to recognize that she made a reasonable choice to withhold information that you apparently cannot handle what she did was wrong but her judgement was correct about your ability to take the information in calmly it was the wrong choice but it was a totally logical one and you are refusing to acknowledge that which will stall transparent communication in the future the problem does not appear to be her understanding what she did wrong the problem is you realizing that she was totally rational to be fearful of having this conversation with you and you reassuring her and showing her that you can accept upsetting information without acting like an enraged toddler if you cant turn to her and say i understand why you made this mistake and i can promise you that while i may be mad at times in the future i will behave rationally and in a way that will not make you feel unsafe if you need to share information with me that i dont like as long as you can promise me to not repeat this mistake and lie to me to keep me from being angry edit again that is if you believe her if you believe her about what the texts were then also believe her when she said she assumed youd be mad extremely and irrationally so if you need her to end contact with this person ask for that if you dont believe her break up yeah cannot imagine why a 20 year old might be fearful of giving him a message he dislikes s can you really not see that you are coming across here as totally unhinged and irrationally angry i wouldnt want to talk to you face to face when youre bringing this energy no one would if you suspect cheating break up if you dont grow up this makes perfect sense to anyone who isnt used to using their anger as a tactic to control others get a grip stop throwing a temper tantrum at randos online you asked for advice and the obvious advice is even when youre right and shes wrong you cannot bring this kind of rage at her and expect transparent communication in the future thats not how people work i dont even know you and based on your words here id be worried enough by your lack of empathy nd emotional regulation to not want too while she made a mistake i can see why she doesnt trust you to behave reasonably with this information youll never know what really happened here but if you believe her that it was nothing then you need to work on being someone its safe to communicate with as well she was wrong to do what she did but it was a tactic to manage your anger and anxiety for you and this experience will have only confirmed for her that you couldnt be trusted not to explode at her had she told you first while nothing you do will stop someone who really wants to lie to you or manipulate you remember that most of the time you have some ability to teach people how to treat you be careful about teaching her that you are irrationally angry and have to protected from bad news at all costs they grew up together the sister and the h were likely in the same grade sister saw him as a brother figure it wasnt unreasonable for her to assume her little sister saw in the same way she was just incorrect it wasnt ops problem before and its also not now op said there is no pattern of malicious behaviour from her sister there is just a perspective and it was good that op got a moment to address it not everything one person doesnt like or agree with is some sort of monstrous violation just let it go its her opinion its not an insane one she asked you answered shes not being cruel to either of you there isnt really a problem here it can be okay for someone to love you both and have those sorts of questions your plan requires a relationship being a housewife generally requires a breadwinning partner there isnt a problem here unless your family is not respectful of your relationship and how you and your partner choose to organize your lives youre 25 if you have a goal for your own life work towards it you dont need your parents to cosign on it or pat you on the head itd be nice but you need to learn to cope without it they are entitled to their own opinions and perspectives and you are entitled to ignore them if i didnt work so hard she would be very disappointed in the situation it would lead to i think youre projecting your own concerns about your role as a provider and you both are going to keep to accept things in your lives need to be compromised its not just her if you are hiding from her the real costs of your choices as a couple financially and emotionally then she isnt making her own choices and compromises with the full picture so yeah based on the limited information and understanding she has she might be disappointed but unless you think she is a fundamentally really selfish and ignorant human being then that is a matter of understanding one another better and being partners getting on the same team its not a matter of you failing her it might help you to consider this how would your wife survive if you were in a comma for six months does she have enough understanding of the financial situation to be able to keep things together would she know where to find the passwords or who to call if she had questions about the accounts because for both of your sakes she should if you have taken on so much of the burden of understanding and doing the providing role that she wouldnt be capable for six months then you havent set her up for success that is a failure for you both youre all in danger if that is the dynamic that exists right now acknowledge that yes you are prioritizing the game and no you dont want to go for drinks you want to stick to your plan and relax on your own it may involve playing a lot of star wars and it may not either way you like your plan and youre sticking to it sometimes the easiest way to deal with a fight is not to fight acknowledge shes correct you are prioritizing that game over going on a date she has accurately understood and that is okay he has told you plainly he doesnt care about your needs and will not even be discussing them with you as if you are an equal or a person that he values how you communicate isnt the problem here youre not his priority there are no magical phrases you can use to convince him hes decided already he has decided he doesnt have to listen to you anything you say will be labelled wrong or disrespectful or mean you will never ever win he has already decided youve lost everything he is saying now is just designed to keep you afraid and shut you up about it so you accept the situation he prefers wanting to see your partner weekly is reasonable he is not offering that kind of relationship thats the reality you need to stop thinking hes just independent hes an asshole this is probably the core of it he suspected he couldnt give her an inch without her demanding a mile when it came to any communication during this time instead of recognizing that as the huge red flag it really was he tried to enforce this maximalist boundary drawing to a head the fact they are not compatible and she is not someone really anyone should be dating op got to the right outcome but he could have probably wised up a bit sooner and gotten there by a smoother path if he just thought hey i should probably date someone who you can respect and understand when i can only have a very brief contact during this week i
