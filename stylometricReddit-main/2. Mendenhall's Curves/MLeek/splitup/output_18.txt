treats you like a partner not a nicer place to crash for free than mommies no kiddo it isnt gay people are plenty capable of being sexist racsit andor homophobic assholes and while no one can stop you people are gonna call you an asshole thats the consequence of being an asshole on the amazingly slim chance youre not just a troll its good your friend knew you well enough not to bother having this pointless argument with your selfabsord ass this might point to a more basic inability to communicate like ive said its not work you can do alone its a job you have to be a fully committed part of but if she cannot do her part as well it doesnt resolve and then youre just both get stuck in a place where youre just not compatible good luck with it right the joke is that you think other gay men lack selfrespect and that they choices they make for themselves are rude selfabsorbed and just stereotypes and you think that is totally funny and not at all judgemental or homophobic like we cannot stop you from thinking that but its boneheaded and wrong and if i hung out with you id be saying yuck that that pile of bullshit so whats the joke exactly is the joke that other gay men are too feminine to hang with the boys that they are too flirty too sexually aggressive too woke too annoying what makes the other gay men one of the bad ones and you not one of those cause i think when you try to explain that you might realize when its not really all that funny id never describe myself as one of the good bisexuals because most bisexuals are fantastic and assholes can be assholes because they are assholes not because they are bi does he where theyre nonrefundable paul and mike said they wouldnt mind paying their share anyway but i bet they wouldnt like it if it actually happened the anyways in there certainly implies they regularly pay him back for the tickets he books for the group youre in the wrong for believing this person is a good partner for you even if he started out with this kind of pigheadedness its been a year and a half and hes developed zero respect or appreciation for what you study and do thats an even bigger issue in my opinion than the compatibility one that doesnt really address more than a few words of what i actually said there were emotions at play here that you steamrolled over and left your gf feeling less connected and valued you dont need to buy her takeaway to be nice but sheesh could you really not figure out how to be any nicer than this you both kinda suck today she should have respected the first no but you sound like youre nickelanddiming her when she feels unwell and im not surprised she felt hurt by that likewise im not sure why she wouldnt have offered to order for you both you do need to be open to joining your partner in small things that bring that joy sometimes maybe this wasnt the time but there do need to be times or even the most budgetconscious of partners may end up feeling pushed away and unloved im not going to pretend i respond as well as i should to criticism but i would rather be told whats up rather than be blissfully ignorant of her pain i dont try to make it so she cant tell me things and i dont understand why she feels that way you see the contradiction there right you know you could do better but dont want to understand why she might feel like you should do better im not trying to call you a monster i think this is an important lesson about dealing with conflict with someone you love the change is you have to be actively trying to make it easier for her to come to you with negative messages you both need that from each other and that is hard work for you both it seems to be a trust that is missing here you cannot fix this alone shell have to put the work in too but you absolutely can ruin it on your own and you can damage that trust super quick with just a few careless words or assumptions i think the important thing to recognize is when said things were going well she was probably not actually lying she was telling you the best truth she had available to her at the moment or she might have been rounding it up and focusing on the emotional connection and intimacy instead of her orgasm those arent malicious lies those are choices she was making to try and emphazies the important elements that were totally present for her and not to focus too much on the ones that werent most people dont try to lie to the ones they care about most people tell the truth they have at the moment they have it and on reflection realize there are also other important truths they need to express your first step may be as simple as saying i realize my responses might not be making you feel safe to bring these things to me and that isnt what i want for us im going to work on that because i really need you to come to me with these things you take a huge step back and instead of calling her a liar and blaming her for all the totally valid reasons she was ashamed or afraid of speaking up earlier you make a safe space and show you are someone she can talk to by saying ok im listening now in order for this to work you have to be able to trust me even if im not into something we can talk about it i understand youre hurting but so is she and she probably has been for a while youre not going to make this better by centring your bruised ego and accusing her of malice when she was genuinely trying to do the right thing by protecting that ego and placing your sexual pleasure above her own she made a mistake an understandable human mistake the two of you are now fighting a lifetime of sexual shame and conditioning and possibly even ignorance youre not going to win that fight with more shame and blame and accusations all that response tells her is that she was right that should have kept on protecting your ego or youll get mad with her you gotta be the bigger person here or nothing good happens equally valuable yes equally accessible not always recognize that some of your wifes hobby also checks required labour boxes like some basic home maintenance and child enrichment activities so while your desired activity is checking only one box relaxationrecharge she is multitasking its not unusual for some productive hobbies to get a larger share of time just because they achieve other goals simultaneously ie someone who loves to cook or bake might spend more time at the activity but there was still a baseline of time required to that activity to begin with other hobbies can be prohibitively expensive or require getting a group together for extended periods and for that reason get far fewer hours really dedicated to them equally valuable and worthy of respect is not necessarily the same getting equal hours in the week dedicated to them if you need more downtime ask for it clearly and carve it out but i think tying to fight for if you spend x hours in your garden then i get x hours to veg out is really missing the point entirely and setting up a false comparison where you are going to come out looking petty and foolish even if you are expressing totally valid need for more relaxing time that need should be respected equally but it doesnt necessarily mean the same number of hours should be booked off it sounds like a core incompataiblity if by recent you mean a few weeks then perhaps allow a bit more time for her to sit with the idea and consider it but if by recent you mean a few months of dating then shes not responding from a place of surprise or having never considered this at all shes just telling you straight up she values being closer to her family and youre not compatible you need to date closer to home people with established lives are unlikely to move just for a relationship for most people there need to be other motivators as well bringing them to your area to make this successful youre telling these guys they arent worth a 20 nonrefundable risk once per month they are gonna find that hurtful and your refusal to commit earlier for better seats as disrespectful and thats valid they are your plan b youre making that totally clear maintaining healthy relationships involves some cost and some compromise if youre not willing to eat this cost or manage this compromise then youre probably gonna damage these friendships and you might not maintain this connection its not complicated its something you have to decide and you have to address there is no magic spell that makes them 100 okay with what you want what you want is hurtful and not respectful of what they value if you cannot find a compromise or accept a risk then you need to optout and join in a separate seatorder once youre ready to buy thats the nonasshole approach dude suggest someone else manage the purchase if your priorities and planning dont fit with the groups preferences and needs be gracious be a grownup its not disrespectful to have your own system it is disrespectful not to be open to change when they say its not working for them address the feelings and the issue in the obvious way youre not the right one of the three of you to be buying the tickets maybe someone else should do it the judgment youre heaping on them for just being different people with different preferences and priorities than you is just really petty and meanspirited the point of the thing is to not be an asshole with people in your life you want to keep in your life you are treating them like plan b and thats fine but stop getting your knickers in a knot because they have the audacity to know that youre treating them like plan b hand over the responsibility of booking the tickets and maybe the transfer of the account itself if youre a real mensch to someone else and accept that if you get a better offer some friday and cancel on them you might be the one out the cost of your movie ticket if you hold steady on this youre torching your friendship and disrespecting something they really value over the possible cost of a few movie tickets a year on your end i mean i think its a bit embarrassing when 40yearolds use ig as a public record of their spank bank to be perfectly honest but the insecurities issues are your own speak to your therapist about those if youre not going to request different boundaries on socials from your partner which you could certainly do and they could say yes or no then dont go looking for things you know will only make you unhappy exercise some selfcontrol and keep working with your therapist you dont want to spend time with her this week you didnt plan to you dont want to it doesnt just seem that way it is that way and that needs to be okay stop accusing her of malice if on some level she did do this to get
