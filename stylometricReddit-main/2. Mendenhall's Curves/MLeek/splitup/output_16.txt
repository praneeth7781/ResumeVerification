here this is shady and i wouldnt like it but his answer is plausible and im not surprised he tried to manage you this way this whole exchange was deeply immature on both sides talk to her as everyone is saying try some more actually relaxing games lots of gamers men and women think the golden rules change when they are gaming and that angry outbursts and namecalling are part of the culture you need to be able to say clearly that its not i love to game but ive had to have a few tough conversations with friends that if being able to yell or call people nasty names or throw things in anger is an important part of thier gaming experience then they dont to game with me im an adult who likes to game if you are a gamer because you want to behave like a toddler sometimes please play with the other oversized toddlers it sounds like he feels he has done nothing wrong and broken no agreements with you he deleted the texts for six months he knew damn well he was violating the spirit of his exclusive relationship agreement with op even if he tries to claim he wasnt technically doing anything wrong trust doesnt work on technicalities trust was broken here why do you need to be the bigger person youre not holding on to the past youre addressing an ongoing issue with his choices he continues to bask in the attention of this woman who behaved inappropriately for months and who he only stopped enjoying the attention from when he got caught he knew he violating boundaries with these conversations you know he knew because he was deleting the messages and telling her they were a problem but not telling her to stop it if a person who has a long history of ignoring my boundaries and flirting with me in direct disrespect of the relationship they know damn well im in climbs onto the treadmill beside mine i wrap up my workout and leave that person is not my friend it is reasonable to assume from this conversation hes at least quite aware of it and has seen some what you need to ask is if he engages with it regularly and thinks its acceptable porn consumption because you dont think its acceptable and you dont want to date someone who ever engages with it good luck with it and with the therapy i think your boundaries are the right ones but your fears are a bit extreme and they are making this harder for your to deal with than it needs to be youre getting overworked and spun out and drawn to extreme cases you need to reign that in and realize your boundaries are important and valid even if watching this porn doesnt necessarily mean your bf is ever going to even look at an actual human child in that way once in his life its still not okay you dont have to be okay with it if you watch porn that features childrens bodies even if they are illustrated i cannot date you i feel too strongly that that is completely wrong to do i expect you to answer honestly is this porn you engage with and think is acceptable first you get into therapy you work on better managing your anxiety the odds of there being immediate risk or danger to anyone on this topic are rather low ethics in porn creation and consumption is important to me as well i would also draw the line with my partners if they were engaging with illustrated porn of prepubescent bodies its not acceptable to me even as fantasy even as an illustration to contextualize a childs body as a sexual object its a hard red line for me i wont date that person but like your cnc kink i would not assume that porn consumption meant pedophilic criminal behaviour was terribly likely just that i dont want to date someone who doesnt hold themselves to a higher standard when it comes to consuming pornography and framing their own sexual identity through what they consume youre going to need to revisit this conversation with him but i think you need some tactics to deal with anxiety before youre going to make it a productive one if hes testing you hes validationseeking and validation seeking is knowing how to communicate to get what you want its just a toxic way to go about it in the end you have to decide what you want in a relationship but if i was feeling i was having arguments multiple times a week after only two months i wouldnt be keen to continue either you need to be able to reframe these conversations and bring the temperature down or youre in for a hell of a lot of needless drama in my opinion if hes seeking attention and validation by picking petty fights with you thats pretty much the worst possible dynamic for someone who has a history of feeling smothered in relationships even if the other fights get resolved easily enough that would be a real concern to me i dont keep people around who use negative behaviours to try to get my attention if youre now in ldr after the move i absolutely wouldnt hold out much hope for it getting better this is two months this is you both on your best behaviour its not great i often joke that no one who lives in toronto drives in toronto we drive only to get out of toronto i owed a car for years and walked 45 mins to work on most days could i have driven it to it 10 mins on most days absolutely would it have been worth it absolutely not hah it really isnt but i do think were under a lot more construction downtown than ottawa is thats a lot of the dust in the downtown i have that experience every time i visit new york and the new yorkers are all like how do you like the big city and i think i know for a fact you can keep cities olders and wetter than this one cleaner than this one but its great youre unlikely to acquire the gf object to service your emotional needs like its a rare drop or legendary weapon or a partyplanner or a substitute mommy the older you get the more women are going to be turned off by this attitude towards them likewise your inability to form friendships with women you dont find sexually appealing always a bit of concern it means you are not able to value a woman as a person unless there is a chance they will be servicing your gf object requirements youve had a relatively normal amount of dating experience for an 18 year old thats not the problem the attitude is you need to fill your life better with or without a gf this dissatisfaction and any childhood drama is your job to address not the gf objects job build a life another person would actually want to share and be interested in and build relationships that arent based solely on getting your needs met but on equal exchange and mutual enjoyment play stupid games win stupid prizes some things are only fun as fantasies its okay to learn that also stop thinking about these potential thirds as if they arent real people with their own agency just because shes in an open relationship doesnt mean she had wanted to fuck the two of you keep the conversation shelved full stop it doesnt need to be more complicated than that just because someone seems convenient doesnt mean you should fuck them you put your foot down and if youre ready for a divorce go ahead with that and get a lawyer involved this is now crossed the line from him feeling whatever hes feeling to him acting in a way that is emotionally abusive the constant accusations of cheating without him willing to do anything to address his negative thoughts or behaviours or bad feelings is unacceptable it is abuse he needs to take some damn responsibility for himself and stop adding this issue entirely to your workload youre already doing plenty if he actually wants his feelings and concerns addressed he has to be part of the work to resolve this and not the abuser you cannot prove a negative you are know youre not cheating you know you dont the time in the day to cheat you cannot fix this for him you can recommend couples counselling but go in very cautiously because there is a real risk here that he wants to abuse you that that is the point and not the accidental outcome here dont consent to cameras or to the invasion of your privacy until hes 100 committed to doing the work to get past his own bullshit if you do he will very very likely use this access to escalate his abuse not resolve it you seriously need to be considering your safety first and his feelings second the sad reality is very few 40 years old are choosing partners in their early 20s because they want an emotionally healthy relationship built on mutual respect possible but not likely and the stereotype is also sadly true he probably knows you dont have 10 mins in the day to cheat the most likely thing here is that he is projecting and is either cheating himself or wishing he was most relationships dont last forever but you dont stand a chance of noticing a good relationship when youve got one if you dont change these bad habits take a deep breath and see this for what it is this relationship isnt perfect this relationship might not last however if you want to give it the best shot to last or even to end on good terms you need to change your habits and find ways to manage your anxiety that should be the bulk of the work youre doing to maintain this thats nice hes naive dont take on his education consider this a learning experience you need to laugh at what you cannot and should not do anything about youre taking this too onto yourself sure but cities that dont prioritize walkability bike lanes and green spaces dont see those same benefits and then there is the increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases from dense urban living which increases the risk of stroke heart disease lung cancer and asthma there is a lot of evidence that living in cities especially welldesigned and governed ones is a net win for individual human health but there is no reason to pretend there we are not making some trades offs and that really we need to make larger changes so people are able to be healthier regardless of the community they are living in you absolutely can tell her i wouldnt id go and enjoy her company consider it a gift youre giving her and id tell her later in a few days that im played out on tea and want to make a different tradition offer one or two other suggestions for a new event or activity you can do together on special days its not untrue its just framing the message in the least hurtful way sending her scrambling the day before is not terribly kind this is the answer dense urban environments dont have many health benefits but this is the one they do generally less time spent commuting and commuteserrands where walking is economical toronto is also exceptionally diverse even in comparison to other major cities on the planet so youre looking at a totally cornucopia of different eating habits and cultures around food if you drove out north to the small towns in ontario youd see a difference although broadly speaking canadians are slightly
