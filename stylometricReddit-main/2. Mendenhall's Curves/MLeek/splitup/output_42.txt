her attention and emotional service to hear you out or patch things up if you want to apologize and admit wrongdoing then do just that and nothing else youre not entitled to trying to fix it you dont get to control her story about her own life all you can offer her fairly without her asking for more is a hundred words or so admitting you were wrong and that you understand that you hurt her and that you are sorry if its more than about 100 words youre doing apologies wrong so no bullshit about your growth and maturity or anger issues treatment thats not her job to address or validate just i was wrong i hurt you i am sorry if you want to try and rebuild a connection id strongly encourage you to speak to a therapist before you take any steps towards that if you want to apologize then just apologize without demands or expectations or excuses im not able to say much because youre saying a whole lot of nothing what is your actual question youre just spinning yarns over and over again what is the choice youre trying to make right now then what the hell are you saying what is this all about what is the question here what are you not getting that you want you can date other people if you want to date other people right what are you looking to hear by posting over and over again on reddit i understand being concerned but he told you unequivocally to back off so you back off you keep asking about this situation but you never mention what you want or what youre comfortable with why are you working so hard to comfort this man and get all wound up about his choices why trying to read his mind why talking to her why stay in something that is so messy and hard if you dont want to be his fwb just say so youre not his therapist its okay to not want to give the kind of emotional support hes looking for but you need to be honest about it stop beating around the bush you dont need advice you need to get your own head on straight and set some boundaries or end a connection that isnt working for you youre not his therapist and as his exgirlfriend you are very limited in your role as friend as well he hasnt changed this about his own situation for a long time its not likely hell change it now its more likely that his comment was an attempt to get you to change back and to frighten you back into the role of supporting him the relationship as it was was working for him you cant save him from his own choices or his depression and trying to do so will so will probably just keep you locked in the dynamic you need to let it be a break up absolutely if theyre getting pressure from other people to include children when they dont want to those are the people who are burdening them youre just seeking and clarity on a decision theyve already made as long as when you talk to them youre clear that your first plan is to follow the only information you have directly from them which is not to bring the children then youre golden they can either politely confirm that or they can say that no they really did mean to make an exception and id like to have you all there in your position id ask my husband to call a couple and tell them that hell be attending and that you will be sending your very best and staying at home with the small children asked if that sounds good with them and if it does problem solved the answer to anyone after that is just we spoke to the bride and groom and we will come to a plan that works well if a couple says they absolutely want you there and are happy to have the small children there for a little while then you kind of hooped and rejecting the invite outright would be rude this isnt fatherinlaws call to make and anyone who wants to show off the grandbabies can do that on their own time not hijacking someone elses wedding what do the couple want what is their preference i dont think youre totally out of line but weddings are the kind of thing sort of thing you do need to suck it up for all this is sorta the point if the couple themselves would like you there as well as your husband and that the children are welcome for a short time yes you should probably put in the work to make that happen if its your husband and his parents puttering around and making plans behind the couples back then your husband should call a couple and ask them exactly what theyd prefer and clarify the invite youll probably get better advice from other trans women but your approach seems needlessly dangerous to me and im not sure why this is on your mind if youre in a relationship thats been exclusive for two years now whats up with that he drunk texts you so no you might be just looking for platonic friends but a guy who mostly texts you drunk is a shady one not friend material sounds like the two of you skipped some really important conversations and have been playing it by ear when it comes to money you need to quit that even if you make more than her the mental load of finical planning shouldnt lie entirely with you you two need to sit down and deal with the reality of what you actually have to meet all of your commitments and long term goals your boyfriend doesnt trust you select your own friends and is passing judgment on you based on feeling someone else had about you when you were like 17 if hes going to behave like that you cannot fix it for him and you probably shouldnt date someone who refuses to believe you when you speak expect to be believed and trusted when you say a onesided high school crush wasnt a major event in your life and you dont appreciate your bf trying to turn it into one now how old are you i only had one true male friend in my 20s and he was also the husband of a close friend i think men generally take a longer time to learn how to be just friends what they actually want in a partner as opposed to a good friend and stop seeing every woman they know as a potential its not entirely their fault they get told a lot more stories about winning a woman over with persistence than they do about just really valuing a womans friendship i now have a few dear male friends but they really didnt appear until my mid to late 30s he has clearly got other issues with this friend and his gfs choices that hes masking its hard to give much advice if he wont admit there is way more going on inside his head than some sort of personal rule about vacations ah lucky you so its not that if we accept that the fundamental job of being an adolescentteen is to achieve autonomy from your parents pivot to peers and enhance your own emotional skills and selfregulation and that there is a kind of progress through somewhat standard developmental stages while they do that then interruption just means what it means ya got interrupted at times by calamity or neglect or accidents and thats not you being broken or even mentally ill necessarily thats how human children respond to those situations they cannot learn certain ageappropriate lessons in that situation so you probably have some catch up to do in some areas that lots of other people progressed through at younger ages thatd be my take anyways just from my own experience in therapy id also say i think its pretty normal for your first few sessions to feel like everything is broken and youre a hopeless mess and to be exhausted and overwhelmed ive got in and out of therapy a few times in my life and i always have to brace myself for those first few weeks no matter how happy i am with the match of therapist its a slog by no means trying to minimize your experiences or effortless glowup but did it suddenly get warmer where you live i dont get approached all that much but i would say 50 of what i get takes place in the first 2 really sunny weeks where we put the parkas away everyone is just cheerful and looking to connect just a theory once more dont work yourself up into a snit because other people arent following your script and dont come to advice sub if all you want is validation for your own interpretation of a personal experience advice is a thing you can take or leave very similar in that way to the feedback you receive when being rejected dude find some grace as another soul blessed earlier than most with a secure attachment style and some selfknowledge get the hell out of your own skull and realize not everyone is fucking with you mostly they are just figuring their own shit out andor not that into you find some of the chill you claim to have and let people be people messy complicated confused people youll have your days too and youll be happier if you assume confusion and disinterest and misunderstanding not malice dont work yourself up into a snit cause other people arent following your scripts bisexuals have a harder time dating lesbians than lesbians do this is a pretty well understood phenomenon and a lot of lesbians wont date bisexual woman at all its certainly easier to get a date with a straight man but that is a numbers game more than a reflection on men or women there are just way more single dudes looking to date and who will date a bisexual woman then there are bisexual womanlesbians looking to or open to date bisexual woman even just demographically speaking its totally bit of mythology that ted bundy seduced his victims the first people he seduced were all the professional white dudes in psychiatry and policing and journalism who though he looked just like one of them bundy hunted constantly he broke into homes and killed women while they slept he pretended to be disabled and in need of help they women he killed didnt fall for him or date him or love him he fooled other men and became a celebrity target for some mentally ill women when incarcerated but he didnt seduce women he viewed them as objects to possess and was remorseless seduction was never his game with his victims his charm was reserved for the men who saw themselves in him exactly i have a few men in my life who are criers and its lovely and connecting im so grateful for them sharing vulnerability is a beautiful thing but the last time i had a guy wail at me about respecting his tears he was trauma dumping and trying to turn the conversation about his bad feelings when i really needed to address his bad actions he was shocked and claimed sexism when i said i am glad you feel poorly about your behaviour i think you should im not able to comfort you right now i am legitimately very angry with you and am going to take some distance this exactly im a bisexual woman and to be the pursuer is to be rejected 19 times out of 20 or better thats the situation even if
