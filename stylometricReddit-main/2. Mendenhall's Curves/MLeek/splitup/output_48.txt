him and say you youre being a shit if parenting is important to you consider now what your options are for doing it alone you may not have any but the women i know who started thinking that way at 30 basically designed their lives around it were well equipped for single motherhood before 40 and are blissfully happy so if parenthood is a goal consider what that goals looks like without a partner as for the dating dont sweat it dating it hard in someways its harder when youre older but thats only because you have less time for bullshit and a richer fuller life there are plenty of men who will want you in your 30s plus a good chunk of 22 year old guys too seriously that part is a bit weird your husband is getting rightly railed for basically wanting you to be lesser than again and to centre himself in the marriage however here are a few slightly valid points that might be buried beneath his ego the home space become a work space is disruptive and blurs the line between working time and together time you are subsidizing your work with your shared home thats a real thing that is happening and has to be acknowledged openly it is more volatile you could start loosing money and quickly and have to be difficult to admit it to yourself its very easy for a personal business to turn into a loosing bet you cannot let go of however both of these issues can and should be addressed through open communication and balance not by putting his foot down like a stubborn toddler as if hes actually has control like that id recommend marriage counselling the answer right now from you should be along the lines of i hear youre seriously unhappy but i will not be ordered around like a child this conversation will be ongoing and for now i will continue as i am because its providing well for us all and its the best use i see for my time come to counselling with me and we can discuss what the future looks like in a respectful way honestly not much imo i dont know many people who had kids in their 20s on purpose excepting those who choose lifetime secure careers with powerful unions and good pensions its almost like economic security really helps the risks exists for both men and women but for people in their 30s they remain pretty negligible its all just the same shit weve been doing for decades shaming women for making choices that make them feel secure and empowered treating parenting as part hobby part biological obligation or even a punishment instead of a serious and very important bit of work that people who want to sign up for should be empowered and supported its okay to be hurt and disappointed but confrontation doesnt seem helpful to anyone here least of all yourself plan a visit to see to them and bring a premade meal or some such choreeasing gift some moms are up and active two months in many are still healing and not on anything like a schedule yet every single bit of this is a bf problem not a mother problem your 32yearold boyfriend has not prioritized or apparently shared his plan with you for paying down his education debt your bf has watched as your savings dwindled throughout this relationship without comment or concern it seeems your bf has not spoken with you to create a realistic and responsible plan for the future your bf accepted money first towards his downpayment then told his mom she couldnt live there the mother isnt a problem really shes not she might not like you much she may be toxic or abusive in other ways but that isnt the issue here on the loan the issue is your bf is not transparent with you about money and doesnt have an acceptable plan he can articulate to you about his debt i doubt he really plans to pay it all back to be honest id bet hes just accepted this holding pattern of lowkey abuse until she dies or becomes incapacitated nah marshall needs to be the fixer and chelsea needs to be the decider but chelsea doesnt really need to be fixed and marshall communicates his own choices for himself so clearly and rationally that hed frustrate her if they both got their own shit a bit better under control maybe but right this moment no they dont offer the other enough fuel 100 brunette was clearly queen bee and knew it and was running circles round both shelby and micah micah is a gretchen wieners in constant search of her regina george literally the nicest thing i can say about her both of her friends were clearly jealous if not of the engagement then of the reality tv gig at least the thing they have is just standard toxic enmeshment shelby is getting the headlines for her drunken mess but i really felt she was just the meat shield micayla was the queen bee and she knew exactly what she was up to spinning shit up and giving all those compliments to micah that were not really compliments and all had at the end of them micayla knew how to bring the drama but keep her hands clean anyone with two brain cells to rub together could crush shelby which is why even paul managed that micayla is the dangerous one it almost made me sorry for micah because those dynamics can be hard to escape if you think that is what friendship is supposed to feel like almost until she immediately joined the pack and turned on paul like a hyena i have never had difficulty enforcing expectations and boundaries on my friends and my partner without suggesting they are competing with one another for my time or attention creating balance and boundaries doesnt require competition and conflict thats not naive thats just declining to live your life doing battle with needy children in grownup bodies getting rid of partners or friends who have that framing has only gotten easier and easier no suggest she speak to a doctor now about her intention to try to get pregnant in the next year or two its a bit early for a preconception checkup but there is no reason not to ask for one if you dont have a family doctor its time for her to try seriously to find one let them tell her if her weight is a significant issue because you dont actually know bmi is not a medically relevant scale and google isnt med school 75 of pregnant women are overweight its not the bestcase scenario but treating it like a crime isnt accurate either dont pretend to be an authority ask her to speak to an actual authority on what steps can be taken now or in the coming year to be in the best position possible when youre ready stop googling about womens health before you fall down a real rabbit hole of truly inane bullshit the next step in her taking this seriously is speaking to someone who is serious and informed youre not out of bounds to want the best odds but youre way out of your area of expertise and that is not where you start you start by encouraging her to get support so she knows her timelines has some goals and is building relationships with her possible care team the median number of past sexual partners for an american woman age 2549 is 43 and nearly 25 of people age 2529 are virgins youre a minority sure but youre not a myth and ya clearly have some baggage and bias associated with your perceptive status if youre only meeting women with a history of gangbangs something youre doing is the problem not women in general first step watch less porn thats not women thats a reflection of your personal choices not lining up with what you claim to want in a partnership second step seek therapy for your warped perspective on your own sexuality and the sexuality of others yeah even more than mental health support i think where lib fails these people is by not providing them with a financial plannerpremarital counselling on legal money matters like just an hour and list of questions sesh i agree from what we saw i thought tiffany did a totally mature sort of um but youre not racking up debt for this cool shit right vibe check and she and brett had some mostly healthy and mutual sounding joshing about being bougie i suspect some of that was also tiffany checking in on her own insecurities about not bringing the same funds into the marriage that brett clearly had if i were tiffany thatd be a concern for me too hopefully they had a more serious conversation about money offcamera but if i was dating a guy who dressed like brett did i would 100 want to make sure this was a luxury spend he had under control before i took steps forward with him when i moved in with my current bf he had a very expensive hobby and i absolutely asked him pointed questions about how he balanced that with other spending priorities and that was just moving in and splitting things 5050 not marriage yeah i didnt really catch the judgment in him either at that moment it was more like chealse was overquick to defend herself when it really wasnt that pink it was a single ladys apartment big shrug there are lots of shitty conversations between these two but that one was rather sweet my bf likes pink more than i do our compromise was deep raspberry pink accent i had to draw a really hard line against hot pink baby pink and pastel if you truly cannot control yourself go talk to a good therapist who can give you a swift verbal kick the next time you get weak and help you approach new relationships without all the anxiety and trauma this shitty one has left you with no one else can solve this problem for you youre gonna waste the rest of your 20s on this mans bullshit and have nothing to show for it if you dont wise up im sorry to be so harsh but it really is that simple stop performing that same drama with this guy that you two started with when you were like 17 its not getting better its not likely to get better better exists for you someplace else with someone else youre not friends any longer you dont bring anything positive into one another lives youre not getting back together you really shouldnt not even after therapy the best help you can give both of you is accepting that six years of on and off plus this toxicity and his untreated mental health issues is to finally call it end it for good grow with someone else someone who doesnt need you to play a perfectly calm therapist in order for them to meet the bare minimum standards of communication and be able to cope go be less insecure with someone who actually offers you security and someone who can handle the fact that anger happens sometimes in a longterm relationship break up with him you cannot stop him he feels entitled to use the images and bodies of women he knows as his own personal porn stars he doesnt care that they are not consenting or that isnt why those images exist or that would reasonably be upset by this behavior or that you are upset by this behaviour he thinks he has the right to do this he thinks he has the right to tell declare that his ex his coworker his buddys sister is a porn star now
