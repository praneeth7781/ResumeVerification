if they arent actively harassing you why the only thing i could see changing my opinion here is why did he expect to be fired if he did something to risk his employment and kept that from you that may be a serious problem or present a major judgmentcharacter issue otherwise i wouldnt get my knickers in a knot about a day people dont always make good choices when they are panicking you had even less power than he did for those 48 hours all his choice did was rob him of your support during a tough day it is a bit weird but its also a reasonable series of events given the recent relationship events let the sister make nice and go to the reception as a guest not as a member of the wedding party id be less worried about controlling and more worried that hes masking his own serious doubts and real wants under well you cant really want this do you that way he doesnt have to take accountability or feel like the bad guy for leaving a relationship that doesnt meet his needs honestly dont beg someone to be with you ge needs to manage these feelings better himself it shouldnt be your parttime job in the relationship to build him up occasional insecurities are things we all feel but if this is a common tune in your relationship he needs to be told its not respectful or kind and that if he keeps on saying hes not good enough one of these days youre gonna have to assume what he really means is that he doesnt want to continue with you its good you have some time together planned but in the meantime id put a foot down kindly but firmly youre an adult who is capable of her own choices and those choices deserve respect feeling insecure is one thing constantly questioning you is a different thing he needs to work on this i understand you dont think youre actively trying to claim power but if youre trying to say yay were a team lets solve this together partner when she fundamentally doesnt want to play then just youre deluding yourself and inviting more disappointment and frustration into your relationship and your own life youre lying to yourself about the situation because the situation is emotionally unpleasant for you support is great when someone wants it and is open to it when someone is not its just painful and insulting for both parties you cannot support her out of a thing she is comfortable choosing for herself support is not the issue there you dont need to turn your feelings off but there does come a point where you need to manage yourself and make choices for yourself not her you cannot make choices for her advocating for her against her will is not okay and will not work if she genuinely doesnt want to quit and that does seem likely to be the outcome of any difficult conversations ahead then this is a you problem its a you problem about what kind of relationship youre willing to be in is he insecure or he is telling you that he believes youre not compatible do really believe youre compatible what are the steps youre planning to explore that or test living togeather or are these constant rounds of reassurance preventing you from having the serious adult think about that you need to have dont beg an adult to be with you hes plenty old enough to know himself and own his own shit if he believes youre not compatible in your lifestyles or careers he needs to own that not make it your problem to emotionally handle for him she doesnt want to quit shes not being open and honest with you about that because she knows damn well you dont want to hear that message you want to talk about what you can do together and she doesnt there isnt a together problem here there is a you problem its the one reality you dodge over and over age shes not trying because she doesnt particularly want to certainly doesnt want to enough you keep coming back around and around about trying to support her but youre actually not on her team if shes not playing that game it doesnt matter how valid your concerns are or how supportive you want to be if shes just not motivated to change you do need to talk about this but its time to have the real talk where start trying to take ownership of the problems you cannot solve and stop claiming power over the ones you cannot the problems you can solve are you can stop kidding yourself you can stop approaching this as a team effort when its and never has been you can be honest about what kind of partnership youre willing to be in you just listed a bunch of reasons to absolutely not date her again but instead you remain fixated on the possibility she was recently in a relationship andor having sex with a woman and has chosen not to be transparent with you about that past relationship there is nothing here to accuse her of there is just someone to not date if that is how you feel about the possibility of a relationship with a woman in the recent past this is not about my hangups nothing you have said has changed my read on your behaviour the worst thing i can about her is that you allow her to bring out some ugly shit in you you need to wise up shes not hurting you right now shes not denying you anything youre entitled too youre hurting yourself with assumptions entitlements and baseless expectations youre noticing you dont actually want to date her the person she actually is and need to stop fucking around as if you might stop trying to make that into a story where shes a bad person own your own bullshit this is clearly not the woman for you it was on the list of a thousand reasons and just because shes not closeted doesnt mean she wants to deal with your weird fixation and invasive bullshit if i suspected you of the kind of assumptions and spinning out that youre engaging in with this question i 100 wouldnt give you any information about my previous relationships especially if they werent heteropassing you do not appear able to handle it well stop spending so much time trying to read her mind and speak up for your damn self if there is something you want or need from this reconnection that you are not getting youre really not being much better than she is if youre choosing to keep the fact you believe they were in a romantic relationship from her your real problem here the one you could actually control yourself is the fact youre not being transparent about what you think you know or about what you want from this renewed connection all you have here is a bunch of assumptions and attempts to read her mind you dont know how they defined their relationship you dont even seem to know exactly how youre defining your connection with this woman right now stop accusing her of deceit when youre not being any more transparent and forthright than she is there are a thousand reasons she may be framing it the way she is including not wanting to out herself with you or face any of the typical random male judgement many bisexual women have to regularly face because this shit is often just so damn important to men who have no business with it anyways someone else cheated on him so youre not allowed to select your friends or your health care providers big nope cheating is devastating handling it respectfully doesnt mean becoming a controlling asshat with every other partner in your life let it go youre only hurting yourself by letting this bitterness fester get rid of it all quickly its not useful to you youre not wrong your bf is old enough to know better and it was reasonable not to want to discuss it over text and as much as you may not like t personally i suspect your bf is also a bit delusional i wouldnt date a guy so willfully out of touch with reality either about t or about my own legitimate anger with his shitty drunken behaviour dont keep such an open mind that your brain falls out its reasonable to want to date a man who is wearing clean underwear each day his insulting manipulative and flat out verbally abusive responses to this situation are serious red flags and raise big questions about his character a much larger issue than his hygiene nah he doesnt get off quite that easily his forgetfulness about her limits is still a real problem he has been dodging the real conversations and considerations he needs to bring to this subject and is benefiting from her reasonable desire for equity and using that to manipulate her into spending way beyond her means op isnt perfect but the fact op would like to keep some equity in the relationship when it comes to meals out doesnt mean he isnt also a willfully stupid and selfish asshat he certainly could lots of people would but if he doesnt want to or even if op does not want that dynamic then he lives with her within her limits and stops constantly pressuring her with his forgetfulness and emotional manipulation in the context of him constantly forgetting that shes a fulltime student on a budget that wasnt a genuine offer just manipulation a genuine offer would have sounded like of course not could you bake a cakeplan a movie date thatd be lovely hes not as dumb as hes pretending to be hes as dumb as is convenient for him to be op does need to do better but when she does this relationship will likely come to an end because of course she doesnt want to have to be constantly reminding him of things a reasonable person could retain without difficult and op cannot properly communicate her way out of his kind of bullshit what makes perfect sense about it general labour is an absurd term almost meaningless to take them as a group some general labour makes 7 an hour other general labour makes 100k a year the difference is industry unions and tradition not skill or even capital generation if we have social programs to subsidize some kinds of labour that you imagine dont generate enough capital to pay a living wage then were not protecting individuals in society at all were only protecting illusionary profits for the executives and owners do you think your boyfriend is a complete fucking moron because you shouldnt date complete fucking morons and either he is too dumb to date or he is playing stupid to avoid the real compromises and conversations that are required in a relationship where there is a financial imbalance its not rocket science that you have no income youre not making him feel guilty you are trying to live within your means he should feel embarrassed by his willful ignorance and the ongoing issues of his inconsiderate behaviours when it comes to the expectations he places on you to spend this man needs to hurt he should be hurting if he says hes feeling guilty and hurting right now say good you need to feel this pain as well because you keep putting financial expectations on me that are not reasonable and any halfway intelligent person would know they arent reasonable for a fulltime student with no income its not fair that i have to constantly carry the pain of trying to keep up with you and communicate this to you over and over again i
