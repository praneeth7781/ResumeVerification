do nothing you continue to come when invited and be friendly and civil your gf handles her mother and establishes the expectations with her for how you are treated you dont get to make someone like you your gf gets to tell her mother what the consequences will be for their relationship if her mother isnt civil to you you did something childish and stupid but why would you even want to date someone who sincerely believes they need to protect their family from you thats clearly not a situation either of you should continue in at all you need to just stop every sort of interaction with this person except his legal form obligations to you and the child as a coparent you and your mom should talk to a family lawyer and do not allow him into any medical appointments unless his presence makes you feel safer and more secure childbirth even at it easiest and smoothest is terrifying regardless of any mistake you ever made do not allow anyone in the room when youre giving birth unless that person adds to your happiness and feeling of safety please please know you can be 1000 selfish at that moment you do not owe him that that moment unless he can be trusted to behave himself and right now he cannot he is not behaving like a coparent or someone who respects you as a the mother of his child you made mistakes when you were a teenager in a relationship you were also preyed on by an abuser who greatly benefited from your inexperience and immaturity to get what he wanted nothing you did means hes off the hook for his cruelty or any abuse he commited dont rob your child because you feel guilty about being a shitty 18yearold girlfriend forget about being a girlfriend never be his girlfriend again focus on being a parent yourself and giving your child the best start you can that means clarifying his rights and responsibilities under the law to protect your child and provide what you can for them technically true and patently ridiculous are not mutually exclusive lets not keep such an open mind that our brains fall right out ive always thought anyone who wants to control and abuse will use the narratives available to them to do so those people who are seeking to control can twist leftleaning narratives and language even more deceptively than fundamental faith based ones a lot of us catch wise to those one faster these day in my 30s i actually stepped back from some guys i was friends with because i realized they were using me to virtue signal their progressiveness to dates and gfs while actually behaving in ways that were extremely conservative heteronormative andor straight up toxic in their private lives my feelings have always been these sorts are going to get what they want and the politics are always a mask no matte what the politics are but the most truly feminist men ive dated are probably the ones who talk the least about it listen the most and just focus on living their own lives aware of bias and attempting to treat women equitably you can say no and it sounds like you should you dont actually trust him to behave reasonably or respectfully and even if you did i dont want too is a totally good enough reason to say no i just dont want that i am comfortable with the current level of contact and not ready to be friends no contact after a break up really should mean several months not two weeks unless there are things like leases and pets to sort out youre not responsible for managing his insecurities for him or keeping him from feeling any pain its normal and natural for you to be happier now thats why you broke up its okay for him to be hurt by that but its not your job to lie to him its his job to accept reality closure is a myth its not something you have in your purse and need to hand over to him its a thing he needs to sort out on his own its april i assume the semester is over soon tell him at least that you do not want more contact until after exams its not your job to address his shit right now focus on the important things you need to achieve right now she needs to plan to do this alone you cannot do it on her timeline you need a job there and she needs to accept that if her income cannot support you both at least for several months and moving with blow through your savings then this doesnt happen yet do not move cross our try with her on credit card debt and no job lined up that is insane shes not a sensible adult partner if she thinks that is the right path for either of you thats not some sacrifices thats madness imagine something totally different took place or that this woman behaved in a way i imagine she did but is in no way reflect here for the reasons i imagine she has oh also women who date online are desperate and sad and only doing it to further victimize the poor mens nah hard pass have a good one i think i have a chance with you so you get to be not like other girls until you disappoint me is that better or even much different is i think youre a hot girl and i think hot girls are insert negative generalization meaningful different than not like other girls i really dont think it is hes the one looking down on others in that moment specifically other girls he thinks are hot hes not talking about attractive men or egotistical people generally lets say youre absolutely right about his life experience this is still not a compliment and she doesnt have to be okay with this sort of awkwardness in the snippet we have here she does a great job of saying shes not cool with it without shaming or attacking him is there anyway she can say please dont shit on my gender in general that you would deem acceptable he might have never met a black person with a phd but if he said youre not like other black people wed all know that aint a compliment and it aint okay yes how dare i choose not to continue in the company of a person who has a negative set of opinions about a group i belong too why would i possibly assume that someone who openly exposes negative biases and opinions about other girls might not actually think all that highly of me or may swiftly change their mind why dont i take a chance on someone who expresses generalized dislike for people of my gender its probably just them being clumsy with words no way they could possibly have realized or intended to be joining in the relentless stream of lowkey misogyny of daily life i see now that my standards are absurdly high how dare i hold the people around me to the standard of not expressing casual contempt for people like me s its not a compliment just because it makes the person saying it feel good about themselves thats actually usually a pretty good sign that its not a kind thing to say it all not only are you entitled to talk about sex and the situation regarding sex in this relationship you have too if it is triggering for them and they cannot speak with you then respectfully acknowledge that isnt the kind of relationship you want to be in its not fair to either of you and there is nothing wrong with you being clear that you want a relationship that includes mutual sexual desire andor open communication about sex it makes sense to be stewing over it right now days after the break up but it doesnt change my advice this is over let it be over dont give in to his halfasses promises of change accept the unknowable the reality is you will probably never know for sure and the sooner you make peace with that the sooner youll be able to move past it the odds of him actually going to a single therapy appointment are slim you know that he was just saying what he needed to try and renegotiate the break up dont get back with a guy youve always had concerns about and who behaved this way just let it be over lots of women have internalized misogyny its best not to take it too personally you know he was taking a dig at you it doesnt mean hes unbalanced but it does mean hes a condescending little shit your initial instinct was correct be less sorry to be rejected by this sort recognize your mothers limitations as a source of advice as well on what behaviour to accept from men deliberately getting black out drunk as a goal is a problem regardless of the circumstances you should be far more concerned about her ability to stay safe from randos or uber drives then about her past hookup if she is set out to purposely incapacitate herself in public i liked to club to relieve stress when i was her age but never purposefully got so drunk i couldnt remember or blacked out that was never the goal of the evening and personally i never found it that hard to not fuck around on my partner when i was in a relationship its just not that hard to not cheat im a combination of the all girls ive seen and admired in some way is a rather lovely way to put it id hope we all are a combination of what we admire in others regardless of gender although i know took me till i was a bit older to realize what i had modelled after the positive men in my life as well youre rolling those dice no matter who you have a child with you could both be phd astrophysicists and end up with a child who is bored by or struggles in school what is far more important is that you two have some agreement about the importance of education and how you will support your children if they do struggle the ability to be successful in school is a nice to have a partner who is actually your loving supportive and respectful partner is a must have nah that was a solid reply and refusal to continue down that path with her id recommend you block her everywhere if she wants her buttons pushed shell do that all on her own no matter what you say so you if dont want further contact enforce it to the best of your ability why wont women work in jobs where they are particularly unwelcome and subject to above average abuse and contempt when they can even get hired to begin with i boggles the mind wha i dont want people assaulted at trump rallies either is this nutter talking about ashley babbitt cause that is just a extra plus bad terrible take its almost like the predators dont wear little warning bells around their necks youre not like other girls has become a straight up warning alarm for me it tells me you cannot maintain basic social ties or have friendly conversation with women you dont want to have sex with it its not a compliment its a concerning reflection on your character dude sounds like its actually the preference eh sounds like thats the actual problem here if you distrust him this much figuring out whenif his dad called him about the accident is rather besides the point isnt it i hope youre working with a counsellor theyll
