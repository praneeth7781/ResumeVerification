you stop talking to this manipulative piece of shit person i think its silly not to accept what is basically market rate from your gf if you stick to your plan and shes truly not comfortable with it then shell simply end up paying more elsewhere anyways you might also consider connecting with any schoolscolleges in the area and trying to find a short term lodger 36 months i did this a little while to supplement my income but so as not to commit to anyone long term where i live they also pay a bit more and if there is a serious problem you can let their school know its just compatibility telling the truth did exactly what it is supposed too it was better to find out now than later that you were youre going to be incompatible with lots of people for one reason or another if you were incompatible in this way its absurdly unlikely that you were magically perfect for another in all others these things tend to spill over ah thank you you too although in all honesty mine is so far behind me now i really dont look back at it with anything a sense of humour and gratitude that i stayed basically safe part of current awesomeness my little brother made the mistake of pulling this women wouldnt fight in ww3 bullshit on us last week he has type 2 diabetes asthma and is nearsighted he will have a desk job every single one of his sisters is way way more likely to see combat than he is i dont know who the imagine that housework is being done for like just for ourselves would be grand but not economically viable the exact opposite happened last time industry ramped up the women went to work im sorry you went through this it does suck but it really wasnt about you it was all about him being able to keep the mask up until anything was expected of him besides easy words am i right to assume his divorce was really resent and hes still very bitter and inexperienced at living alone cause women his own age probably wouldnt touch him with a ten foot pole if he was acting this way they would definitely bail the moment he accused them of being emotionally abusive like his ex now you know as well what to listen for take the lesson but dont take it personally its not about you its about him still performing his old toxic patterns hes not trying to avoid them in you he was trying to enforce them on you can see why this man is a divorcee who picked an ldr with a woman a decade younger than him dont take it too personally be proud of yourself for confronting him on his shitty inconsiderate behaviour that took some stones its not a cultural thing it a selfish person thing tell him its over and then block him dont bother trying to explain anymore im sure his exwife told him over and over again until she lost her voice no shaming of sex workers or sustained celebrators intended i remember my hook up years when my standards were rock bottom and i was chasing self worth through dating and casual sex and 3 new men a week who could string a sentence together and brush their damn their teeth while also working 50 hours and being an adult impossible absolutely not happening not one week ever not if i spent every waking moment swiping and chatting i know a few sex workers and i dont think even their average week includes three new clients our bodies dont exist except as products on a shelf thats gross i really hope that is an esl issue because this is not a respectful way for him to speaking about these women and it sounds like both have some difficulties with respecting the women in this sport if you sincerely believe your partner is targeting women in his sport to perform violence on them when hes angry with you then you should not date him we cannot read his mind any better than you can if that is what you think of him and his temper act accordingly no you cannot find out you have trust and respect or not if you sincerely believe your partner is targeting women in his sport to perform violence on them when hes angry with you then you should not date him because that appears to be what you are saying and you must see that is an insane thing to think about a person and then stay with them except you dont not when you assume hes letting them win or they are fundamentally of less value to him as a competitors than a man would be respect isnt a claim its a practice do you want to be an athlete and wrestle with men if not then yes that is a possible hypocrisy but its also picking a fight about something you dont even want for yourself anyways you need to get a grip if you trust him trust him when he tells you what is normal in the sport he practices you are misunderstanding a culture which should be rooted mutual respect and sportsmanship and often is you are underestimating how much skills can matter and you are severely underestimating these pro woman no one is letting them win women participate in the sport with men and his explanation is plausible with nothing else to go on these women deserve your respect as athletes the issue here is not the sport if you otherwise trust him and your conflict resolution remains healthy and productive i would advise you to let go of this entirely love it even if we assumed every single woman on of was an active creator of sexual content and was an american woman between 18 and 35 ya still get 19 of roughly the 55 million american woman between 18 and 35 with an of account and they arent all american or all selling sex and only an even smaller minority are active so even with the most generous take on this its less than 2 roughly the same percentage of women who leave their christmastree up till february strange way to tell us that the algorithm knows youre not interested in content from women unless they have an of all in all youre dating a person who doesnt have much bandwidth or skills to deal with a normal disappointments and daily struggles in his own life and judges and mischaracterizes your struggles because of his own limits and lack of awareness he may not be consciously projecting but it doesnt really matter end result is the same even if hes not malicious about it he has been consistent about telling you what support he can offer and consistent in his refusal to seek treatment hes not being consistently kind youre not compatible as a 25 year old who has embraced treatment and learned the skills she needs to find success in her own terms you probably actually have less in common when him than you do many neurotypicals you apologize you acknowledge youre both angry and that being angry with him for not waking you wasnt entirely fair you admit that while its not his job you probably should be asking him for the favour of the occasional wake up because you have a medical condition you cannot perfectly control thats not making it his job that is asking for his support with something that isnt his job and you probably have to do some listening to some frustration and unhappiness he has as well hes probably pissed too and hes got about the same rights to it as you do and then you probably talk to your doctor about some sleep aids if youve already done everything you can on your own to manage your sleep hygiene yeah youre the asshole here if he had agreed that on this one day he would wake you by x time so you two could stick to your shared plans then youre be justified in being angry with him for not doing so but thats not what happened what actually happened in the vague plans kept on shifting and he didnt really know what was to do when you fell back asleep he likely felt rationally that he was gonna piss you off regardless of what he did he didnt have information to act on feelings are not instructions or directions to be woken or left to sleep right now youre pissed with him for not doing something he didnt agree to do which you didnt ask him to do and both agree he fundamentally shouldnt be expected to do being disappointed in the situation is totally fair being angry with him was not youre both frustrated with something medical right now that neither of you can perfectly solve you need to ask for what you need clearly i would suggest in the short term being clear with him that if youre sleeping through commitments with him you would appreciate him waking you up so you can keep those plans he cannot be your human alarm clock everyday but he can and should be able to come and get ya when you two have agreement thats not totally fair men also use it against men when its convenient to them to argue that all men are biologically programmed to be unfaithful or sexually violent the loss part of this is what is wildest any halfway sane woman hearing that would be calling a lawyer and opening accounts without his name on them people loose their jobs all the time someone who raided the family saving account to immediately pay off their employer is not just getting laid off this guy seems to thinks loving him means turning off your rational brain and walking joyfully in to the jail cell beside him i have this theory that women arent bullying one another enough anymore to create enough insecure women willing to date me so i have to get way better at lying to women to work around the amount of mutual respect they have for one another and now expect from men i tell extravagant lies like i respect you and acknowledge your value as a person instead of ugly truths like you actually have no value as a human being if i dont find you personally fuckable and available i fucked up at my job so badly i was fired and i was financially liable and paid it from our savings cause ya know were married its probably not just mine but no lets not discuss it further and im gonna just chill at home for the next two weeks while you panic and hah not psych lol you should have seen your face wait why are your bags packed without knowing what the thing is its impossible to form much of an opinion on the risk to the relationship and if your anxiety is something you simply need to manage yourself your boyfriend is nearly 30 doesnt have his life together in the least has a history of cheating and instability in general and is 100 going to sleep with this woman after moving in with her get yourself sorted find an affordable for place for yourself and a job if youre going to school you might find they have resources to help you find a room or a job that fits with your schedule most schools want you to keep paying tuition so they may have some advice for you definitely call them and try to find someone to speak to before you move back to a parent who isnt supportive when youre 29 youre gonna look back at this guy at his choices and his emotional manipulation
