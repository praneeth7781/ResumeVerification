they may be toxic and we cant know but you seem to need more than that you should ask yourself why friends speak once and then hold their peace or remove themselves they dont speak about another persons body or level of perceived hotness as being a huge mistake while its possible these two are poorly matched or toxic there is nothing here to suggest it and fianc should still be standing up for his own choices even if those choices are mistakes does it matter most of the time he kept talking about his friendsfamilycoworkers and exes and only asked about 3 questions about me the entire time and i was like no i dont kiss on the first date and we kept talking about it untill he leaned in and kissed me this man is a boundarybusting selfabsorbed asshat who is not relationship material unless youre just looking to get laid move on frankly even if you are probably want to be moving on a man that selfabsorbed and indirect in his communication is a coin flip odds are not great hes a fun lay anyways a guy who asks you nothing about yourself is rather unlikely to get you off dont so be desperate to be picked by somebody that you chase after selfish little shits who basically ignore you as a person realize you get to do the picking too and then put this one back on the pile unless the earring is worth a small fortune let it go along with this guy i think the real issue here is your fiance is refusing to stand up for himself with the people he calls friends which is sad for him and it limits your life together basically he needs better friends or to tell these friends they are expected to be better or to gtfo no you probably shouldnt you should be speaking to a therapist about how to best move forward in your own life you still havent sorted out the difference between her doing something wrong and her doing something that disappointed you youre not expressing all that much love for her as a person but for the role you have cast her in and are frustrated she is no longer consenting to perform youre not owed a certain number of chances and your family as you previously envisioned it doesnt need to be back together that is your preference not a fact of the universe she doesnt have to agree she doesnt agree these attitudes all make it extremely unlikely that youve done the work you need to be an independent and reliable adult and even if you had done that work she might still not want to reconcile because youre not owed a certain number of chances she can just choose not to be in a marriage she doesnt want to be in and she has take these thoughts and feelings to a therapist they do need to be addressed but not by your exwife your mother is dating an asshole and what is worse she knows it and she appears to have quietly approved of his behaviour she warned you when she should have said if you are verbally abusive to my son in yourhis workplace i will dump your childish ass dont talk to him hes not relevant to you and if youre in a union situation you should seriously consider reporting him for threatening your workdayincome because hes pissed off you didnt buy him a meal tell your mother kindly but firmly that your invites do not include him unless you explicitly include him you need to avoid these misunderstandings in the future by being clear if he is coming or not even if he isnt cheating on you this isnt okay if hes not cheating on you then hes trying to punish you for forgetting to pay your bill during your time of crisis and grief you dont need proof hes cheating to get the fuck rid of him over this a person who tells you they are sooooooo nice and sooooooo loyal and no one else will treat you as well as they will is a completely trash person do not make peace with this do not marry this man this is a major warning sign he will abuse you then he will tell you its your own fault while declaring all other men are worse abusers than he is which is a lie he tells so he gets what he wants he wants to abuse you why not just block him thats perfectly acceptable and very clear response and if not that then you tell him to stop dude that sounds flirty i dont like it cut it out if he denies it or pretends its not or its no big deal dont argue with him just say good im glad thats not what you meant cut it out anyways i dont like it thanks its a bad idea to date someone in their 20s the age gap should bother you more than it bothers her and it should motivate you to make a responsible respectful choice based on your life experience to answer your questions generally i think dealbreakers prior the first date should be short and sweet and cover the really big things guns religion sex before marriage and abortion vegan diets if that is a big one for you those sorts of biggies the conversation about what could a relationship look like how much time will we spend together and where how do you see a relationship with your children developing is a conversation you have after 23 pleasant dates and you both agree you want to continue to see one another i mean it sounds like the guy is a sexist asshat you should reduce your time with its okay to decide not to invest in friendships with people if you dont like how they treat you or others stop being a bystander its gross if youre not going to call him out at least step away from him youre not you are not 5yearolds call dibs on the best ball as the bell rings you treated her like a human being hes treating you like a competitor in a sport where she is the favourite big red ball and he cant figure out how to dibs her keep her friendship reconsider his she wasnt that into you you were into her and kept hopingimagining she felt the same maybe she kinda liked you at some point but then she didnt there is no problem here just a normal disappointment the only thing youre doing wrong is refusing to accept this as a totally normal bit of normal human disappointment most of the people you like arent gonna like you back youre both being absurd and kinda gross this woman has told you shes not available for new connections at the moment he doesnt give a fuck he thinks this is a game to be won not a bunch of human people with feelings and free choices and youre acting like he bought her by driving you around and being your friend that is also pretty gross opt out of this bullshit when he makes passiveaggressive comments tell him hes being kinda unfriendly over this shit and to cut it out be a bro not a whiny brat you value his friendship but if hes gonna act like a 5th grader who called dibs on a girl who told him she isnt single anyways its gonna damage respect between you two as adult human beings if you dont want to keep speaking her then dont but this isnt about who falls in love more this is about not surrounding yourself with men who treat women as trophies and you as the competition its toxic af its not friendly when i see no drama my brain immediately translates it to i am the drama i bring the only permissible drama no drama is the poor cousin of all my exes are crazy i wouldnt say is guarantees gaslighting that term is getting super inflated but it does mean they seek out and create toxic dynamics and at very best lack selfawareness yeah and you wont die cause you cant afford insulin or chemo or got in a car crash and your family wont loose the house andor all their savings trying to keep you alive everyone on the planet who gets this deal would fucking go to war against the us if they tried to export your the idea of a tiny bit less taxes but everything else is way fucking worse and only the millionaires benefit i literally do not know how so many americans wake up each day knowing they are one er visit away from total financial ruin tell me youre an adult man who wants a mommy without te nm fuck it you are loved and awesome he was telling a story telling a lie because his ego couldnt accept the rejection he couldnt handle the consequences for his bad behaviour he needed to tell a story where you unworthy of him so he didnt have ti address the fact he was clearly objectively unworthy of you its been years since i broke up with my ex and some of his nasty stories about me still slip into my life telling me im unworthy or im greedy or im dumb im shocked how many years later im fighting his narratives even though they were lies then and they are definitely lies now your brain it trying to make sense of someone you cared for and were vulnerable with telling you such terrible lies you end all contact you keep reminding yourself these were selfserving lies that had everything to do with his weakness and hatefulness and nothing to do with you as a person honestly the best thing to do is leave these conversations i tell them to google motivated reasoning and then go touch grass its not a data argument to begin with no data scientist would take these with anything short of a 10lb bag of street salt thats not even what average means this was a dataasmarketing for paid dating apps a decade ago apps that are selling a product to predominately straight men by convincing them they require a paid advantage marketing departments make graphs all the time that i roll my eyes at and say well that is technically not a lie thats all that is happening here are we talking oh that 18 year old has great emotional regulation expresses boundaries clearly while also being empathetic to those around her or do we mean shes a free baby sitter and chauffeur for younger siblings and isnt thats a great perk for her parents there are definitely ways to praise young women for being mature or wise that reflect their individual strengths and not their usefulnesssubmission to others irrelevant this would be a bit funny from a 21 one year old but its embarrassingly stupid from a man his age who wants to be a parent if ubi does happen ha and ai takes over significant parts of our world school will change a lot but children will still need to be educated in order to be people we want to share the world with and maybe even live fulfilling lives its pretty obvious this man just wanted you to shame her into handing the child over to you and then you would be responsible for the care of him and the child glad you escaped id suggest you be very very skeptical of anything he ever told you about her whatever her struggles are now clearly when they were together she had two babies to take care of and one of them was a resentful and manipulative shit of a 450months old i would not date a man who thought it was
