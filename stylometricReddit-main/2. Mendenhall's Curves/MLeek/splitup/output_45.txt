person who cares for you and want to build a mutually enjoyable and honest romantic and sexual relationship with you i think all manipulatorsabusers have something they can point to and say see all i do for you which often completely divorced from your actual desires or needs for my ex is was picking up the cheque at restaurants regardless of whether or not i have liked to stay in to eat me paying would have been emasculating of course but as the relationship began to end i was magically transformed into the bitch who never paid and i dont have savings because of your expectations im sorry youre going through this i know there often isnt much to do except ride it out and not provide any feedback at all to these screams for your attention cause thats all the insults are he knows hes been cut just wants whatever validation he can squeeze out of you by compelling a reaction ignore and document all you can at this stage really do you have some close friends you can talk to about it its helpful to have someone to workshop all those clever responses you can never send i think like how gross it is he wanted to fuck someone with the intellect of a small child dont date such a lousy mental health counsellor or at least dont be reliant on someone who is not on time for your ride to work communication comes in a lot of forms your bf does need to extend you some trust when you decide not to make an issue of a feeling youre experiencing and nonverbal cues are not bad lots of nonverbal communication is positive and helps to maintain connections between people nonverbal communication is harmful when its misinterpreted or when there is too much or too little of it what is definitely bad for relationships is defensiveness and blameshifting after three years together why are you suddenly concerned that someone might harass you age gaps have risks and struggles less so as you enter your 30s but still its been three years why is this question on your brain and coming out to a bunch of randoms online now this is probably not a great example of the problematic dynamic you are experiencing with your mother you were joking and she joked reasonably back ya dont get to pick your baby you might want to talk to a therapist if you find yourself dissatisfied with your relationship with your mother or frequently seeking validation where there is none to be had and there never really has been i would have a hard boundary on being spoken to this way as well i also wouldnt want to stay with someone who snapped at me while i was driving or pressured me to drive more aggressively than i was comfortable with that would also be a super firm boundary for me like i might have pulled the car over if you had done that to me i do not like that i would not tolerate that in a relationship sometimes we run late in life we handle our anxiety about being late better than that you did need to be told to stop that he didnt express his frustration well but neither did you and he had damn good reason to be frustrated with you by the end of this and then you jerked him around at the end again with the ill walkno i need you next youd be wise to book an uber your own boundary was completely valid your own behaviour was not she is not holding a gun to your head shes crying let her cry let her pout let everyone else treat her like the damn fool she is and ignore anyone who doesnt have that much sense shes not forcing you youve just decided you rather be her prisoner and give up what you want on your day than see her sad pick another dayevent to wear her dress and tell her if she cannot truly behave herself at your damn wedding she can sit at home and you wont wear it at all it is baffling to me how many of them can simultaneously argue men are violent brainless sex monsters and also inherently more logical and designed for leadership tell me you think that 26 salad buys you sex without telling me you think that 26 salad buys you sex you can stop this youre just not youre clinging to the story of a relationship that didnt even work out when you were 17 years old it when life is the simplest its easy to romanticize the past and to keep revisiting it in your mind whenever life gets scarry or sad its harder to face the reality of a future that doesnt include the dreams you dreamt at 15 tell him if he really wants to work on this to take his commitmentphobic ass to therapy and do that damn work himself if he doesnt do at least that you should look into what it will cost to breaktransfer this lease there is nothing you can do to fix this for him its not about how pretty you look or how nice your nails are frankly its probably a lot about him avoiding the work of being in a relationship and pushing all the work onto you by creating emotional threats in the relationship that you feel you must respond too if he doesnt want to break up he needs to go do the work to fix this for himself and for the relationship if he wont be rid of him this is going to hurt his feelings if the positions were reversed it would hurts yours this just a hurtful reality its no ones fault but it is painful its not overstepping to express to him that there are things youd really like to do together walking going to shows that his weight is making more difficult its not overstepping to tell him youd really be happy if he would participate in the weight loss with you focus on the activities you want to share dont mention appearance dont mention other people he probably will because that is where the shame hits hardest stay focused on the quality of the time you two can share together this is grief its okay grieving is exactly what is happening right now block andy everywhere the only thing you need to consider in the near future is how youre going to address your parents part in this because this issue actually wasnt ever between you and andy it was between you and your parents and andy and your parents but your parents foisted it onto you they should never had said to talk to you about the value of the honda they should have said the honda was giving to her outright so its not ours anymore she doesnt owe you half of it and that is exactly what you should have said as well when andy asked they gave it us outright its not theirs anymore so its not half yours if you feel mom and dad owe you something or have agreed to help you get a car talk to them your parents chickened out and left you holding the bag for their choices with their unstable son and you all failed to be totally clear with him because you were fearful of him responding irrationally you can see where that got you all in the end show them what was postedtexted to you explain you are currently going no contact with andy and that is nonnegotiable let them do with that information what they will hopefully they will recognize they made mistakes that contributed to andys confusion and angry irrational as it may be dont expect them to stay nocontact with him for long they probably give right in to whatever his demands are you stay out of it thats unfortuante but again i have been abundantly clear with you unless my partner told me very clearly that the package needed to be signed for or handed to an actual person for the delivery to be competedly which is functionally the same thing here i would not open that door i would assume the package would be left and we could grab it in a minute youve asked a question you clearly dont like my answer and thats fine you probably should try to form the question about your relationship which is the actual issue here im done repeating myself good luck with it yes i would not open the door for a package that was going to be set down and left i would wait a few minutes and then stand up and get it i would not open my door to a stranger not even one i may reasonably assume was a delivery person i would not let an unexpected knocking person even know i was home if i could help it whats the actual issue here cause its clearly not the package dude i was super clear unless my partner had very specifically said it need to be signed for if it was just a package id assume it would be set down and wed grab it in a min without me opening the door for unknown person you got relationship issues communication issues consideration and respect issues ask about those actual issues you asked about opening the door and i answered with plenty of particulars and caveats there is a logic to not answering the door that might or might not apply here i wouldnt have answered the door in that situation unless my partner had very very specifically told me a package needed to be signed for otherwise id expect theyd set it down and wed grab it in a few mins doesnt matter what uniform they are wearing unless i know youre coming and why i dont open the door for you this means i also dont stand up and look through the peep hold alerting you to the fact im home period its not an unreasonable boundary for a person to have in life depending on where they live or have lived in the past most women i know operate in some sort of similar way she may have been inconsiderate in this particular situation but in general her behaviour is within the range of normal there isnt much to do it feels insufficient because you cannot actually control her all you can do is starve her of all attention and dram to the best of your ability you block her everywhere neither of you ever respond again you keep records of her behaviour in case you need to get the police involved you can both also consider warning your workplace or boss that you have an ex harassing you personally i think its good to get out in front of this in the workplace and ask people to be cautious giving out your information or location you need to trust your friends and network to not support this harassment talk to one or two of your closest friends about the harassment and dont skimp on the word harassment and let them know you are asking all your friends to keep information about your relationship and your wedding private so as not to expose you to further abuse anyone who doesnt completely agree with that should be uninvited but you dont have to deal with that right away right now you just have to lay down the law absolutely zero reply or contact with your ex from you and your fiance records for the police requests to friends to not share any information that could empower the abuser you cannot communicate yourself out of someone elses choice you cry yourself to sleep on the regular because he chooses to behave in ways that are
