facetime first and okay but ask me to buy todays newspaper or make some weird hand signs often within the first day of matching just gtfo i used to do it without fail these people were all bitter resentful and a bit controlling he knows how you feel he doesnt care he feels entitled to placing this pressure on you he thinks you should preform this way for him youre incompatible and hes a bully dont stay with him but since youre going to anyways say this comments about my femininity skirts and makeup need to stop youve cross the line from expressing a preference to being really hurtful if you care about not hurting me you will stop if you care more about what i wear then how i feel we will break up maybe not tomorrow maybe not right away but itll happen if you dont stop hurting me this it has to be really extreme before i assume they were actively trying to be deceptive im bad at reading photos im far more annoyed by men who lie outrageously about their height ive happily dated men who are shorter than me and secure about it dont want to date a person who isnt comfortable in the height difference i dont know if youre joking but when someone does this to me i immediately unmatch my photos are current and authentic and i use to comply but i have never had a positive interaction when i did a person who comes at me from this kind of place of bitterness and control is not someone i will continue to speak with dating is risky and often disappointing but if all youre bringing into is distrust and anger i want none of it then be honest with your own needs and walk away i didnt mean to imply he needs to regret or feel ashamed only that people who have enjoyed casual sex in the past are still capable of choosing monogamy and being faithful in my experience they are often better at it because of the lack of fomo youre not compatible he could be just as capable of commitment and monogamy as any man who ever lived but it doesnt matter if you cannot believe that if youve lost trust this is over you should date the person in front of you not their every past choice or the person youd hope they could become you need to be able to believe what they say about their current choices and values if you cannot be happy with that person today be honest and bow out because freedom the republicans are right and royally fucked they have cultivated a delusional base that is not capable of selecting a candidate who can win a general running to trumps right is the smart way to get the nom and then to in loose the popular vote again and probably the election you just know this man watches nothing but hard core anal porn and pimple popping videos and is in deep denial about his desire to be pegged because its not about attraction like rape the power is the point the violation is what they want they are just exerting power in a public place all public spaces belong to men in this persons mind women just walk through them women in mens spaces get what they deserve ive a had few men try to genuinely compliment me you can tell the difference and no its not that they are chads they have said shit like cool hat awesome vibe or wish i was going to whatever party youre headed too its really not that hard to compliment a stranger stand still do not move into their space compliment a choice not a innate thing about their body allow the interaction to end right then easy i disagree with your premise the divorce rate doesnt speak to people who want to end it over the smallest thing most people i know who divorced worked damn hard sincerely to avoid it the people i know whove been married 10 years went through periods where they had to do that work too assuming every divorce is a personal failure is a lingering stigma not a reality and how can we say the divorce rate is high when were comparing it to a time when it was practically financially and often legally impossible to divorce not to mention the stigma do we really think marriages were twice as healthy and happy in 1950 as they were in 1990 or that they were 3x more blissful that people were really freely consenting to stay married more often even if your own family history was happy enough most of us can ask our grandmothers about the women she knew and be quickly disabused of that notion and why in earth do you think people who dont want to marry not marrying is a problem of course he did my ex and his family were appalled that months after he dumped me with a bit of bonus cruelty i did not come to care for him during his unexpected surgery as i had during the first eight of them you see he had thought he was healthy now so he no longer needed me he had blamed me for stalling his life but once he was in need again i was a monster for not actually putting my life on pause again to care for him the mind boggles in other words people who are less likely to want commitment and compromise at that stage of their lives are less likely to work towards commitment and compromise at that stage of their lives and im disagreeing it seems very obvious to me that is not many people that is a minority the majority are inclined to stay longer than they really should and keep working more importantly its the right outcome thats the would i want to live in if someone has one foot out the door give em a shove problem solved hah id say they dont actually understand consent they just glom on to buzzwords to try and make their positions sound modern and palatable its like when they talk about the loneliness epidemic and mens mental health stigma and youre nodding along because yes real issues but then you realize they are actually suggesting the government gift these men sex slaves to solve the problem i agree the only reasons i can see to get married today is if you believe its a religious sacrament terrifying to me but ok or if being married provides better protection for the children and their rights where you live otherwise dont get it very expensive party and pointless peice of paper for me i cannot comprehend this attitude towards people its so objectively and observably false most people the vast majority keep working at preserving a relationship for months or years after it becomes objectively clear it should probably end and both parties would be happier and healthier we all know these people we have mostly been these people i looked back in my life and know where i should have had a zero tolerance policy lying about money throwing things in anger being mean to waiters healthier conflict resolution skills often contribute to relationships coming to an end because healthy approaches to adversity and conflict include fundamentally changing the terms of the relationship agreement or even ending it i work very hard to look like im ignoring everyone who is hollering for my attention in public i always listen very closely for a few seconds before deciding if im going to engage and usually i will not if youre asking for directions or warning about construction sure if its unclear in those few seconds what youre up too i assume its no good and keep walking thats nice legally speaking if there is going to be marriage there must be divorce without any outside authority judging whether or not the reasons are good enough anything else in unjust to everyone no fault is a term of art for the kind of separation youre talking about where no one but one or both of the two people in the marriage gets to decide its over the term exists because there was a and time and place recently and currently where they wasis not the case it doesnt mean everyone is a blameless little angel hes certainly expressed the willingness to blame the woman when he rapes her if he sees the opportunity this seems to be connected to new movement in the manosphere against no fault divorce she consented to be mine and she is not entitled to withdraw that consent for any reason which means its not actually consent at all so the law is wrong when it gives her the ability to leave the marriage the problem with the divorce rate in their minds is the same problem as the false accusation rape hysteria they dont want women to be able to withdraw anything they interpreted as consent to their supremacy they want to trap one and not have to worry again about being worthy or of a partnership this guy knows with 100 certainty that no woman has ever enjoyed herself with him and never will motherhood is the best thing when it serves them personally or their political goals the like motherhood as an ideal not as an occupation that might not directly benefit them the fact that an actual person they have to interact with may be doing the work of being a parent while female is inherently distasteful i think it should be a goal daily on a personal level ignore them live your life but beyond the personal sphere we cannot afford to ignore them not only do the extreme members try to kill us with guns and with legislation but the shepherds are leading more and more young men to the slaughter on a societal and political level they cannot be ignored they want women subjugated and their strategy relies are making more and more men desperate entitled ill or angry enough to support that cause on the false promise that access to an unhappy subjugated women will make them happy and that they will all of course be found deserving and meritorious by the new patriarchy its a bad habit and she needs to stop could it mean shes not over him sure but a bit more likely is that shes picking at the scab rerunning conversations in her head and basically letting this wound fester she cant build a new healthy relationship unless she recognizes this behaviour is selfdestructive just cause lots of people do it especially just every once in a while and not weekly doesnt mean it okay in the end id be more concerned that its been two years and they havent formalized the divorce you need to go see what you can swing with work look that kind of response is unkind its not crazy for your partner to ask you to commit to spending some vacation time with them or to ask you to confirm those plans in june for july you may not mean to be jerking her around or telling her shes not a priority or embarrassing her in front of her friends but the result of that kind of response can rationally be all those things if you cannot take vacation then figure out when you can and calendarize it now youre working too much regardless of what else is going on here in this relationship your work life balance sounds like complete shit right now and a reasonable partner will become frustrated by that ask him what his plan is for his agreed on portion of the bills are if he is out of working for a month or 3 months or more thats the question you
