minimize the harm this man can do to you is look for a positive move out of his department before he manufactors a negative one im sensing there might be some downsides to spending a few millennia telling men that god made females for them yeah this is the bullshit that works in the movie dont do that you should bring your own timeline to the meeting though and let her know that you two do choose to reconcile you would plan on purposing in x to x number of months months not years ultimatums get shit on because they dont feel very good to receive but when they are honest they are important she was 100 honest about what she needed in this relationship and she walked when you couldnt meet that that wasnt controlling that is clear honest communication she cannot put a timeline on your healing but she is 100 entitled to place a timeline on her own needs in order for the relationship to move forward just be transparent about what changed your mind dont actually make it all about how wonderful she is focus on what you have recognized about yourself and need to change to in order to build the life you want with her be clear that while you want her the person youre changing for is you because that how change lasts you may not be able to eat your cake and have it too all you can do is be just as transparent and clear as you are here and then youll likely need to step back and give her some time to process this information her initial reaction is likely to be anxious and angry and to feel abandoned youre going to have to let her move through those feelings and figure out what she needs to express to you because those feelings are gonna be valid youre only eight months in and youre suggesting going into and ldr basically for at least that long again its a huge ask of a young relationship most people would break up it would be totally reasonable for her to decide not to remain in a committed relationship with someone making the choice you want to make it may just not work for her your gf doesnt believe her friend will cheat she cares for her friend and the friend is wasted you may be right but youre probably not going to convince your gf to think badly of someone she clearly cares for and youre really having the wrong fight here instead of getting worked up about a bunch of women trying to keep their dumbass drunk friend safe just tell your gf plainly that you wouldnt find her friends behaviour acceptable in your own relationship you wouldnt do it and youd like your gf not to do that either thats the agreement you actually need between the two of you about the boundaries when dancingout at the club in your shoes id be far more concerned about your gfs comfort around drinking to excess and her willingness to take on caretaking roles for her friends in dangerous moments having a frank conversation about what i find acceptable is an easy problem to address trying to talk to your gf about the fact her friend has a substance andor impulse control issue is way harder if one of my friends behaved this way more than once i would decline to go out with her until she got her shit together not because of the risk of cheating but because its not any fun to cockblocking for a drunken moron on the regular i would be more inclined to agree if i thought for a second he was actually concerned with the cost of and access to healthy food and not with just punishing those he deems unworthy this would seem to me to point to large issues in how you deal with finances some couples can nickelanddime like this but personally i think its toxic and counterproductive once you live together if the book is important to you then it doesnt matter what he thinks get the book then end contact if you want to end contact his ego is not relevant to this at all you cannot control what he thinks or feels so why waste any of your time on it but shit if you take your book collections that seriously have a loaner copy i never loan out my copy of my favourite book i have a second copy for the purpose of loaning out its dorian gray you could have grabbed a copy for him for less than 5 dont give people the copies you are attached too in the future is this some sort of first edition a rare find of a book with a dedication inside from your dead relatives or something cause unless this book is irreplaceable youre the one playing games dont pretend to be friends just dont be friends if you think hes keeping you around for a ego trip you drew a boundary about a kind of joking you didnt find funny and didnt feel was healthy for either of you thats not throwing the past in her face thats asking her to not to continue to make jokes that you do not enjoy its reasonable to acknowledge her feelings she was hurt by your comments and thats not insane to feel hurt but the message wasnt and shouldnt be intended as an attack its just not funny for you you want to move past it not joke about it all of this i feel for the guy shit as he may be that would be an awful experience and im glad he made it home safely however if any woman had stopped to help a nakedass man in the woods and been attacked or worse by said men all the same people bemoaning this guys plight would be blaming her for not using her common sense to avoid the obvious danger of the crazy naked man men know other men are dangerous they act on that knowledge ever fucking day they just dont like it when that reality is reflected in womans choices in ways that inconvenience them personally do you that think men and queer folks up and down the binary dont ghost then dont be friends with her mutations are normal variations within a species individuals dont really undergo speciation groups do its a longterm process not a mutation in a single individual you are free to call yourself a nonhuman and free to not choose to be friends with people who do not honour that thats all ya got no the only problem isnt her communication and the other problems might not be worth solving better to call it off entirely but op can and still get past this bullshit i cant actually say what i want he should just know when i say i feel in a good relationship that will often happen but even if the best relationships actual conversations about actual disagreements are required at times and in a really shit relationship doing so will help you waste less time hey im all for op breaking up with him but if youre not able to express what you would like your partner to do and have a conversation about that then youre setting yourself up to be immature and gameplaying and disappointed thats childrens games adults express reasonable boundaries and expectations and walk away if they are not met being willing to walk away when someone isnt going to offer the kind of relationship you want to be in is the opposite of controlling what is controlling is not telling them and trying to manipulate them into giving you what you want getting more and more worked up angry and resentful when they do the thing you dont dare to actually ask them to do someone can give a fuck about your feelings and still disagree and make a choice for themselves it happens constantly if you cannot manage disagreement as a couple with clear communication then you shouldnt be a couple you have to be able to actually tell your partner what kind of relationship you want to be in and are willing to be in with them thats not controlling thats having needs wishes and boundaries like a full human being who knows themselves well enough and is mature enough to express what she wants and needs what youre doing instead right now ends up being gameplaying and manipulative you get into bullshit arguments about my feelings are valid which of course they are but thats beside the point here and not the problem what you really need to discuss is okay you and i disagree about what is appropriate here with this new female friend lets talk about boundaries we can both live with and help me feel secure and respected in this relationship if you think hes shady dont date him but either way learn to speak up for yourself its not controlling to tell your partner what you want in a relationship and to try to find an agreement with them that suits both of your needs that is literally what healthy conflict resolution looks like he disagrees he understands that you are uncomfortable he disagrees that he needs to do anything differently because youre having that feeling and you dont seem to have actually asked him to do anything differently being understood is not the same as getting what you want expressing your feelings is not the same as actually asking for someone to change their choice or do something differently next time to communicate in healthy respectful ways you have to actually have to ask for what you wantneed not just repeat your feelings at people if you need a boundary you have to ask for it clearly and he might disagree then you have to actually talk about it explicitly and try find an agreement if you didnt ask for a clear boundary then it wasnt totally insane for him to think that you were just expressing your feelings about the situation and that he did not need to change his actions he disagrees that his actions were a problem and you didnt ask him to change them so he didnt you two have to come to an agreement agreements are what change behaviors not just telling him your feelings and hoping hell figure out what you want and do that instead he made a new friend i can understand why that concerned you a little bit but do you really want to be in a relationship where you see every single new femalehuman in his life as a potential threat i prefer a relationship where i trust my partner to make new friends and observe good boundaries with them there is nothing you can do to control another person you have to be kind and clear and trust that your professor is reasonable thank them for their offer acknowledge youve accepted another and express regret at not working on their team at this time do it asap the quicker you tell them the kinder it is to them if she burns the bridge nothing you can do about that youll have done your best again like i said that is possible but if that is the case then good bullet dodged you dont want to be picked by someone who is using that as their picking criteria if that was how he made his decision then you two were not compatible however more likely he is just telling you hes entering or moving towards an exclusive relationship with someone else so he is ending contact with you and no longer available to date casually sleeping with him that night was unlikely to change the situation he still probably would have continued on with someone else you
