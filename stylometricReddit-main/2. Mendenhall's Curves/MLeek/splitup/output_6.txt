much chance of fixing it if youre this confused about what it even is after this much silence and blocking drama allow it to end grieve it out and move on your daughter is currently being abused your ex is trying to estrange her from you with lies about her own criminal violent potentially fatal actions that us lying likely some gaslighting and its generally emotional abuse designed to isolate your daughter from you your daughter is currently the victim of emotional abuse do not forget that or gloss over it that is what is happening here while you do not have the legal power to stop it at this time that is what is taking place your ex is actively abusing her just keep persuing the parental ordercustody agreement speak to a lawyer about your choice not to pursue criminal charges you should not have made that call without legal advice about how it would impact the custody situation if you dont already have one a lawyer will probably recommend a evaluation where a mental health professional will issue an opinion on whether or not you had a mental breakdown andor false memory document all acts of estrangement tell your ex youre only going to discuss parenting right now over email follow up with any inperson conversations with an email that says as we discussed in person today let her reply in writing that she didnt intend to say she asked you to lie and say you stabbed yourself youre not going to be able to repair your relationship with your daughter much further at this time she is not going to be able to read and comprehend the police reports medical reports or protection orders for many years your daughter is 11 years old and all her basic survival needs are met by her mother shes gonna side with her mother its just a basic human thing that is where her safety and her food comes from youre gonna be coasting for a few years you need to seriously reconsider your legal options in regards to the stabbing youre not protecting your daughter if you are making it more difficult for her in the future to discern the truth about what happened youre also not protecting your daughter or anyone else around your ex from further acts of violence you dont youve already explained plenty he had actively chosen not to understand and ignore your boundaries you thought maybe you could be friends but his further treatment of you proved that you could not he wasnt friendly he continued to be boundarybusting and manipulative youre not a therapist or a rehab centre for sad boys expect him to continue to overreact and be ready to reenforce the boundaries that youre happy enough to hang out with him in a group but you asked for the texts to stop when they didnt you stopped them leave him blocked youve communicated clearly you can divorce someone for any reason youd like but i do think you need to calm down if this is a hard boundary for you discuss it with him ask for his agreement to stop express to him you are willing to consider divorce if he will not but for my own sake i find this behaviour immature not a betrayal its just kinda ugly like a grown man having swimsuit illustrated posters on his bedroom wall it is strange to me because pumpkin spice is a mix that humans have loved since the late 18th century when we finally became globally connected enough to concoct it there is even a bit of evidence of this spice mix as far as 3500 years ago good things taste good most of us loved this before it was branded psl in hand not pinned to the back of your head like 90s barrette your boyfriend suggested something if it will make you feel less insecure you need to work on your insecurities in therapy what he said was careless not an insult he fell into your baggage you need to pick some of this shit up off the floor its a tripping hazard and dont bleach your vulva its unhealthy you cannot fix the situation but saying i know this sucks and its a thing you need to get through that sucks will probably be validating shitty things be shitty sometimes the best help you can give someone when they are really in the dark part of it is is just agree this is shitty you feel shitty because it is shitty tell me how i can help you get through the shitty part first ask her what support she wantsneeds second recognize she is having a totally valid emotional reaction to something that is 100 true the arts field is deeply unfair that is hard to get a job and almost nothing pays well there is a whole bunch of earning your shot and being a team player and paying your dues that you can basically only afford to do if you come from money and she was burnt out and dissatisfied in her last job she feels lost because she is that is a totally reasonable place for a person to be at 27 shes not broken shes 100 normal i know a hundred people who continued to work in the arts after this sort of period in their lives and i know a hundred who left both choices are valid but the choice will need to be made in time some shortterm depression is not a completely unreadable response to the situation shes experiencing especially when you stick a damn pandemic on top of it do not say she knew what she signed up for of course she did she doesnt need you treating her like a child with that kind of comment but she didnt know how it would feel she didnt know what the limits or stressors would be longterm she didnt know she wouldnt like it and it wouldnt be worth it she felt reasonably at one point in her life that she was making the best choices for herself it is possible you could have found yourself having the same crisis of faith about your choices in it so dont be a condensing shit about it just because art was her previous choice it wasnt a bad one it just isnt working out keep encouraging therapy because she deserves the support dont encourage professional networking until she has a more concrete purposegoal in mind to be able to hurt her back for no damn reason while her legs cramp and fall asleep and wear mocha fraps in her hair all while dreaming of doing battle with a poorly photoshopped northamerican kaiju also i am deeply disappointed that they just greyscaled the image of a rooter instead of at least picking a photo of a black one like they come in black roosters come in black google black rooster dammit lazy shitposters from the little window we have here it does seem like he is incapable of offering her anything but negativity and harsh judgement she may have told the group in an effort to pressure him to perform as if he was supportive and happy for her for at least a damn second oh to have the ego of a mediocre man who doesnt even think the posting rules apply to him what i could have achieved in life with this oblivious and inflated sense of selfworth i think she is in the wrong objectively but youre not coming at this objectively youre coming at this emotionally and trying to use a money agreement in the relationship to solve your unhappiness and money issues with a situation she is not in control of your employment i can understand why she would be upset when you frame this as financially punishing her because you hate your job that it isnt what it is but its sure what you make it sound like you need to stop making assumptions about her savings and you need to stop attacking this emotionally objectively if that space is her office especially if she intends to get personal tax benefits or write offs for it then its not part of your shared home thats not about your budget or your job that is her being honest with herself with you and the irs about what her business costs to run and what resources it requires it requires a room just like it requires certain software or licenses its a business expense not a relationship one it belongs to business not to you or to her personally the business needs to be renting that room the business owner needs to pay that isnt about the boyfriendgirlfriend agreement thats about the business owing money its not paying and you need to be seriously looking for other work she may be unfair and maybe you should break up but generally speaking its also not fair to be constantly at your partner because youre miserable and not doing anything to fix that for yourself i wouldnt want to be married to either of you yelling is unacceptable to me however so are constant accusations especially public drunken ones what you are doing isnt being insecure were all a bit insecure you sound like you have long ago crossed the line into emotionally abusing your husband most people will not accept emotional abuse forever without snapping snapping might look like yelling but it can also look like withdrawing running away or sobbing hysterically people break under that kind of treatment longterm they just do its called reactive abuse if he we were here asking for him id be telling him he probably needs to leave you before you bring out the worst in him and his behaviour gets worse because you are unlikely to seriously change yours stick with the therapy and discuss this incident there in the context of your behavior towards him if you need to discuss how costs are split in you relationship you have to do that before you agree to go and pay for the ticket youre not wrong but you made a mistake not discussing the impact of this wedding trip on your budget before you agreed to go if you do speak to him about this start there i made a mistake i should have told you before we booked that this was more than i could comfortably spend i wish i hadnt bothered tho this guys posting history is a nightmare before it was complaining his wife wasnt communicative enough with only the most weakass arguments shed done anything at all wrong and right here were seeing exactly why his wife has learned not to speak to him even when the information is totally banal he takes the opportunity to shit on her instead of supporting her so he doesnt believe in being accountable to other human beings and honest about his commitments youre 25 and pregnant you need to wake the hell up youre trying to make it complicated because you dont like the simple truth everyone else gets it just fine he definitely gets it youre the one who doesnt want too hes doing exactly what he wants if he wanted to be at those appointments he would be if he wanted to be dating you he would be he doesnt and he probably never will stop trying to fix it and start learning to live with him as a coparent agreeing not to fuck other people is not the same as being a partner same answer hes not your partner its not stable with him hes not offering you that he is doing exactly what he wants and he doesnt want to be your support in this the longer you imagine you can turn him into either a good partner or a good parent the harder it will be for you to
