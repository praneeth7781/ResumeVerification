everywhere and move on with your life id just find it so immature that my adult partner was spending so much time pornscrolling on socials its not about trust or control its about wanting to to be dating an adult who doesnt sink hours of their day into mindlessly thirsting by all means enjoy consensually and ethically created porn but obsessively using ig that way is just so what a 12yearold in 2013 would do yuck hah my ex was the same way he ended it but clearly believed hed be able to bully me and watch me suffer because he made 23x more than me told me to my face that i had stalled his life and couldnt afford to live without him we were both a bit shocked to discover that i had significantly more money in savings his refusal to be transparent about finances was a huge part of the breakdown he liked to be the man who decided and who paid for everything and then hold it over my head that i wasnt contributing to the plans hed made alone immediately he decided i must have taken advantage of him after years of refusing to talk about money with me as if i was an adult and a partner instead of recognizing he had terrible habits he was hiding from me and i didnt benefit from in the least then im not sure why you asked if hes a potential rapist kinda six of one half a dozen of the other at that point isnt it not a question of is he violent just which kind of violence to classify it as in court yes you just had a man tell you hes a violent criminal in search of an excuse if he hasnt actually behaved like a violent criminal yet its only because he doesnt feel hes found a good enough excuse but hes definitely on the look out for one i made a similar choice my ex made it clear he didnt want an agreement he wanted to fight over every penny in court and there just werent enough pennys involved to bother extending his presence in my life even that much oddly the person who was most angry with my choice was my own father hes not a woke guy by any means but my dad was the one who felt most strongly that my ex has stolen my labour and dodged his responsibilities after 10 years together everyone says women go for every penny but i never met the woman who went to the mat for anything except the children in her care and even then i know a few who said it wasnt worth the drama its absolutely a thing people believe it doesnt matter how often you point out to them that divorce almost always leaves a woman less financially secure than marriage does especially if they have children the vast majority of women who choose divorce are choosing to be seriously poorer than they were before some of them know damn well theyre choosing poverty far too many men just cannot accept that poverty is better than living with them or but raising children is extremely expensive and yes it actually is still your job even when the mom stops fucking you if you dont like that take it up with capitalism not the custodial parent the simple argument is that the cats are going thats the plan any disruption to their patterns right now just means its more likely the cats wont be successfully trapped relocated shes not getting rid of the cats by messing with the current situation shes making it more likely theyll stick around after youre gone but she wont listen to reason more realistically you should just speak to your landlord and neighbours about someone else taking on the feeding you have other more pressing responsibilities to your own safety at the moment and eliza is far less likely to target the cats if they arent seen as yours if have a neighbour network and resources of support for these cats use it dont be a lonely saint let the village do what a village does and focus on what you need to do to get yourself a safe living environment let him know that youre not interested in datingseeing anyone else youre enjoying this connection and focused on it it is going to be a bit early for some people but you should always ask for what you need in any sort of relationship at any stage and its never too early to be honest about what choices youre making for yourself and to ask them what they thnk about that hes told you who he is youve told him you wont live with that person you are stuck until you decide your own future is more important than coasting and being comfortable with him right now a guy you cant ever live with if calling you slurs and keeping you feeling insecure in the relationship is a vital freedom he requires to express his true character then hes not the funny guy hes the guy who has learned how to mask his malice and contempt behind humour the one that is always stayed with me is from a long time ago i was about 19 i was riding public transit and there was a man who wouldnt stop talking to me and was trying to physically box me in i had moved seats twice and i was at the stage i was just trying to ignore him and was too scared hed follow me if i got off the bus which would be even worse than being on the bus where at least there were witnesses even if they were pretending not to notice i was seriously starting to panic when these two much much older ladies started shouting at me annie is that you come here and sit with us annie and demanded i take the seat between them they spent the next two or three stops winking at me and talking so loudly between the two of them about annie and how lovely it was to run into annie and how annie absolutely had to get off at their stop and have a cup of tea with them so i did and he slunk off and didnt follow us i think you have the right idea to focus on life stages thats the big gap between them and it wont disappear for nearly a decade you may also do what my mother did and remind her its the fact she wonderful and mature that will make her an object of interest to men older than her including those are using her positive characteristics to mask their negative ones my mother was addressing a much larger and more obviously predatory age gap when she said that but it always stuck with me that she explained id be selected by this sort of older men because i was defensibly mature presenting not because i was naive because i was smart and wonderful not because i was a pushover because i was inexperienced not i was dumb in broad terms yes we could get more specific but youve basically got it we cannot always control what were attracted too but we can control and challenge the false stories and stereotypes we believe about the kinds of individuals we find sexually appealing to get along with people you must remember theres a difference between a story or a fantasy or role that we might enjoy sexually and an actual unique individual person who may have a feature or characteristic we associate with that story in our heads dating involves a lot of rejection it just does but if you cant deal with the individual person in front of you and separate them from the sexual object fantasy in your head about petite women youre gonna get rejected a lot more yes basically honestly thats pretty impressive youve understood what people are telling you and its not a terrible problem a lot of us have stories about what we see attracted too that are flawed or fetishizing to some degree but it is an error and its not going to be fair to every individual woman and since you only date individual women you need to be aware of your biases and your stories and your illogical beliefs about women and keep them under control when you speak to individual women otherwise many of them wont like you or trust you if people feel that youre forcing them into a particular sexual role or dynamic just because you like their kind of body and associate it with your fetishizing a lot of people wont like that a preference for blond hair is different from preferring blonde hair because you thinks blondes are more carefree and fun the first is fine the second is a false story many blonde women will not enjoy having forced on them nope you got that backwards and its gonna get you into trouble youre fetishizing small women because youre attracted to a story about weakness and softness they arent inherently more feminine and therefor you are attracted to them you are attracted to them so you call them feminine a little more self awareness will help you with actual woman and not just chasing a fantasy fulfilment none of the women i know who youd call feminine would want anything to do with you if you cannot tell the difference between the story in your head about pretty little princess and the real full human being they actually are even when they wear pretty dresses id worry a bit less about being polite and focus a bit more on being clear being clear doesnt mean being mean the clear honest communication is that you reasonably believe she gave it to your brother because she decided she didnt like your choice and is now purposefully lying to you about that which only deepens the violation and hurt dont ask her to do anything just say i know you did x i reasonably believe you did y and are lying about it now i am hurt and angry you dont have to not be angry or bitter this is a legitimate thing to be pissed about it does feel like crap nothing is going to make this better even getting the oil back from your brother is probably gonna feel like a rather empty victory you probably shouldnt go back to the good relationship that you felt you had right after you got back that was temporary and not fully true hell the fact it was good for a while may be why she felt she could get away with this violation relationships arent static but you should try to stop telling yourself the kind of stories that are going to make you angry for longer the fact you have some awesome travel stories is more valuable in the long term than the oil dont let your mother take even more away from you than the oil or poison other parts of your life and memories you offered to do this if you were anxious about the exchange you need to at least express that to him hes not wrong or evil to accept your offer of a favour at face value if you leave your partner thinking youre happy enough to do something for them your partner might just assume youre happy enough to do it if youre upset by a pattern of being inconsiderate or taking your assistance for granted then that is a thing to discuss with him but as youve written it here this is a bad example of anything besides him definitely not being a mindreader you cannot fix this for other people you can tell them kindly but firmly that youre drawing a boundary on these
