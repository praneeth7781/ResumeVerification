and reset as individuals but just continue to be respectful and supportive of each other and youll be good i love this so so much oh my goodness im so very sorry you went through that especially so many times its a heartbreak i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy and yes we do need much better resources for helping people cope and less stigma around talking about it because its so common but so rarely discussed i mean yes of course thats a bizarre and disturbing thing to do but people dealing with extreme traumatragedy dont always react in logical or appropriate ways i had a miscarriage at 12 weeks and the grief of that alone made me kinda crazy for a while not to mention after childbirth theres a massive hormonal change and a bunch of other stuff thats challenging even when you have a healthy baby idk i just think its way too simplistic to write it off as simply wanting attention or caring about getting likes too much or whatever and i feel bad for her to go through all that and then be dragged down further bc she coped in a really weird way oh i love these the meat one is so gross but so relatable lol something about being slightly high gets me super in touch with my intuition sometimes i end up doing what seems like completely random shit but then i end up understanding the reason why i felt compelled to do it after the fact nothing as crazy as that though usually just stuff like feeling the need to reach out to a friend and it turns out they just got bad news or something whoa thats pretty cool did it seem unusually big to you at the time or only in retrospect after that nap like did it go from normal to big and then back to normal or just normal and then way smaller i dont know if that makes sense but i tried id love to hear some of your experiences if you feel like sharing i wish i had for some reason i had the feeling like i shouldnt go in there im not sure if it was actually a bad idea or just a fear of the unknown but i couldnt bring myself to crawl in and then it was gone this is my favorite one and i totally believe you i think kids have an ability to peer into dimensions that for whatever reason get harder to see as adults my story isnt as cool as yours but when i was a kid i looked into a pile of pillows that were kind of stacked together in a tunnel shape but somehow the tunnel went on and on like hundreds of times longer than the pillows themselves i walked away and walked back to look again and it was just back to being a normal stack of pillows yes or like we want to be their new bff when actually were just being genuinely friendly but not like we want to be like friend friends thats the only downside of the placement imo accidentally leading people on just curious do you feel like that in real life trying to figure out the best direction to take and keep ending up in the wrong places i would say that the guilt and shame of killing the dog probably factored into the situation a lot but regardless please do not think that all women are like this i have spent the last 3 years trying to help my boyfriend open up cry rage whatever he needs to process his feelings every bit of progress hes made has been so incredibly rewarding and brought us closer together the only way id weed him out as a mate is if he stopped working on expressing his feelings and started trying to be all stoic again as a partner its exhausting and isolating always having to wonder what your mate is really feeling if you end up with another person who cant handle seeing you cry weed her out and dont look back you do not deserve that sexist bullshit im sure theres a lot of additional factors like that but from what i understand the tradition stems from the days where talking about womens problems like periods menopause etc were taboo and so miscarriage was supposed to be kept quiet but if someone wants to tell their friends and family early on its easy enough to say that its still early and they should wait a few months before making any purchases i actually wish the whole dont tell anyone too early notion would go away too losing your pregnancy even if you have only been pregnant for a few weeks can be so incredibly sad and if you havent told anyone then youre either alone in that pain or having to tell people that you need support from that you were pregnant and now youre not of course some people would rather be alone in that process regardless and if thats how they feel theres nothing wrong at all with keeping it quiet i just wish there wasnt a stigma around announcing too early it kind of creates a social isolation around anyone grieving before that 12 week mark it makes me glad to see someone else talking about the just world fallacy i used to post about it online like a reverse evangelist all the time bc i think its so important for people to understand that this way of thinking is prevalent and insidious even nonreligious people do it without realizing it either to avoid having to empathize or to make themselves feel like if they just do everything right theyll be safe im curious about the microdose my life has been changed in other ways due to a standard amount of it on separate 3 occasions over 2 years was it a one time thing and did you go into it with the intention of facing your addictions edit also congrats on your accomplishment really encouraging to hear your progress i have a theory that the rest of your chart plays into what kind of connections youll enjoy which is a little too complicated for an app to take into consideration for example my venus is in aries so i kinda like it when things are exciting aka complicated lol so for me a delicate or complex bond is stimulating and fun but an extraordinary or powerful bond can be boring like its too easy what did the tire look like ahh same here i guess its been about 2 or 3 weeks for me that ive obsessing over my jaw muscles bc something just felt off i kept trying different massage techniques to make it feel normal again this is really interesting did you feel it when our ribs changed you sound like a really good person your mama is lucky to have you thats beautiful it seems like most souls tend to reincarnate within the same family i bet hes been really looking forward to seeing you guys again first of all im very sorry for your loss thats really cool about the dream and i firmly believe that the women in a family line are super tuned in to the energy of new babies when i was pregnant with my kids i didnt want to know the gender until they were born but me my mom and my grandmother were completely positive i was having a girl and i was same thing with my next baby we knew it was a boy and he was pluto heres a pic of my chart feel free to ask any questions i have those two in my second house i tend to have a lot of money or none lol how did it work out if you dont mind sharing this hurt my heart to read i love people who dress however makes them happy and i hate to think of her being made to feel bad about her awesome quirky self thank you so much 3 im okay im thankful that my dogs life was so full and happy and that she had such a peaceful ending and there are positives to being single and not having an elderly dog to tend to any more such as being more free and independent traveling etc so its really hard to cope with all at once but im trying to think of it as a new chapter with gratitude in my 9th house on the night of the lunar eclipse i told my boyfriend for the billionth time that we needed to start doing some very things differently because i just wasnt happy in our relationship and he said hed work on it but he didnt so on june 8th i broke things off then later that night my sweet little dogs health took a serious turn for the worse and i had to put her down on the morning of the eclipse ive had her with me for 14 years she was a gemini sun and sagittarius moon im heartbroken warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info its amazing you were able to recognize the pain you were causing and turn it around especially after everything you went through yourself just commenting to say im proud of you and dont give up on your brother closest in age it may take time but if hes able to heal on his own he may come around to the idea of a closer relationship with you happy birthday thats a good life skill to have did you get to play with them so it was entrapment what a bastard aww thats a good one my little boy is 4 years old now and i always wonder what random stuff hell remember lol and of all the beverages you could have chosen to spit out you went with the one most likely to stain the carpet aww those early childhood accomplishments are the best how did that turn out i have a vivid memory of standing in my cousins yard staring at a tree im not a christian but uanotherreaderofstuff is right the bible does say that although its in matthew not revelation start on verse 34 of jesus sermon in matthew 25 hes saying that if you didnt take care of the poor imprisoned etc while you were on earth you dont get a spot in heaven wow thats really cool would you mind sharing what sort of meaningless thoughts and views you saw yourself having as a teen i feel like i waste a lot of energy on meaningless thoughts now as an adult but im trying to improve thanks for sharing i hope the despair goes away completely soon and that you find more and more warmth and happiness in your life yeah its a different song but its a similar vibe to the beach boys so im thinking op might have just misremembered slightly are you thinking of this one thats a real gift i have it too with some close friends for example once i started spontaneously crying while i was in the shower and i had no idea why i wasnt even sad but my friends name came to mind immediately after so i texted him and sure enough hed just had a heartbreaking thing happen to him i think its possible our brains are silently communicating with each other in ways we cant observe with current technology and some may just have stronger communication links than others whatever it is im glad you guys found each other thank you you should give it a go theres some great ones on youtube you could try people seem to have a lot of success with this
