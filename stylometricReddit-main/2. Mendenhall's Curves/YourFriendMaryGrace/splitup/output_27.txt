the energy to them know that you are safe and loved im always here anytime you want to chat forgive yourself love yourself and be patient we all have painful experiences that can leave us stuck in negative thought cycles you arent thinking bad thoughts because youre bad at this youre thinking that because youve been hurt so getting mad at yourself is just doubling down on the hurt youre already feeling does that make sense try this whenever these ughhhh thoughts come up respond to yourself with positive affirmations like im doing a great job or im a beautiful person inside and out or im thankful for how i look its okay if you dont necessarily feel like theyre true just yet by replacing the negative thoughts with positive ones youll begin a healing process and raise your vibrations to

youre not crazy and theres nothing to worry about think of it like a little wink from the universe letting you know youre on the right track theres no real reason for it to be ominous all kinds of amazing things could happen to you this comment reminded me of this song that i love to listen to when i feel low because it lets me express my sadness and loss before celebrating all that i have i got my arms got my hands got my fingers got my legs got my feet got my toes got my liver got my blood ive got life ive got my freedom ive got life dont worry about the rockstar example i should have worded my suggestion better the method is just to gain confidence by pretending youre already confident imagine yourself as youd like to be perceived by others and then imagine that youre already being perceived that way as you go about your day we all put out energy to others all the time anyway be it anxious shy agitated whatever this is just the act of consciously altering your energy as you get used to the idea of projecting confidence or any characteristic really real confidence begins to grow underneath think of it like exercise first you decide you want to be able to run 5 miles and eventually you will but it starts with jogging around the block i think its just the way you go about it you can be confident and also be warm and inclusive hey there just checking in after a little reddit hiatus im so glad my response was helpful fwiw the free of charge bit in my title was a joke i never charge so please feel free to comment or pm me your dreams any time i relate to some of your experiences and would be happy to help however i can love it walk into the room pretending to be super famous and that everyone wants to talk to you you dont have to 100 believe it just keep mentally projecting the confidence of a rockstar and see what happens its pretty crazy how heads start to turn try it and see okay thank you for the solid advice kind stranger my children are quite little ages 1 and 4 so they are far more into stuff like swimming roblox dinosaurs and impromptu dance parties than anything i could possibly say on this subreddit but i feel ya i was raised in a very religious household and when i grew up and felt differently about religion than my parents it was really tough and i didnt know how to tell them so i hope very much that my children never feel like im pushing my personal beliefs onto them i dont feel as though i need them to be interested in or even aware of what i think about the universe i just want them to feel as safe happy and loved as i can ps what are your thoughts on this if i may ask i dont like to argue on the internet but i am always up for a friendly discussion i hope you have a good day ha because i let them watch willy wonka or because their mom enjoys pondering theoretical and practical applications of physical science either way i love you i really do thanks so much for sharing and congrats on the lucidity ive only had a lucid dream once and i decided to fly right away haha that was just a few months ago so im hoping it happens again soon im eager to hear the message of this dream if you dont mind sharing im glad you asked this is a pretty common one so dont feel bad a quick way to figure this one out might be to ask yourself what do i feel guilty about the accidentally cheated dreams can come from the feeling that youre spending too much time on work video games thinking about other people and so on in other words the dreams may not be about actually cheating with a girl at all but rather some other form of letting her down or simply a fear of letting her down does that help how strange they say that we often dream of stores as a snapshot of how were considering presenting ourselves in society in that light this might be a dream about feelings of society being past its prime holding nothing new for you and yet creepily keeping tabs on you just the same however childrens dreams are a bit no more difficult to translate because childrens associations can be so different from adults so a good way to figure this one out might be to try and think of your life at the age you had these dreams and what your associations with stores might have been if not place i go to get stuff i need to function in society maybe place my parents take me or place i might get lost then think about the imagery and feelings you had against that backdrop let me know what you think hey thats not a bad thing my husband is the same way i have vivid and memorable dreams almost nightly and his memorable dreams are few and far between maybe one or two a year i have a theory about this totally unproven hes a really extroverted feeler like hes able to process his emotions very well and speak to what hes feeling in the moment whereas i tend to try and avoid thinking about my feelings and sometimes i keep em suppressed and unprocessed until they come out in the form of dreams so ive wondered if those who dont remember their dreams tend to be able to process and express their emotions on the fly what say you first of all and hope this is okay to say but id love to see this as a scene in a movie as with any dream you should trust your instincts on this one your spiritual journey is your own beautifully unique thing so ill leave the spiritual interpretations up to you disregard anything that isnt resonant but heres what i see in the emotional intelligence of the dream the setting of the girls house may be uniquely significant if she was a real girl you know if it was a random girl then the setting seems to me to be conveying that this dream is illustrating in part how you feel about yourself in societyin relation to others the thing that sticks out to me the most is that the painful feeling manifests immediately after being shushed by your mom you were just sharing your thoughts hurting no one and she made you feel as though you were doing something wrong your confidence was undermined and you werent able to truly stand up for yourself the punched in the gut feeling is one of painful shame and sadness and personally i often feel it when ive done nothing wrong i onlyfear that i have does that sound like what you expedience its a sickening feeling for me and one im only just starting to realize that i dont deserve to feel that so much of the time many many of us get traumatized by feeling shame in front of others at a young age or any age and then long after the critical condescending or angry voices that made us feel that way are no longer around we still feel the affects of them and for some it feels like what we call social anxiety and depression its exactly the kind of stuck emotions that are the subconscious 1 job to make better but it all needs to be consciously processed before the healing can begin so vivid dreams are born from that subconscious effort to help you know what you are feeling tldr perhaps you have difficulty speaking your feelings and beliefs due to some negative conditioning ps what are the six orbs of energy and whats your interpretation of the parable dont want to intrude upon your own way of looking at the dream because as always you are the best interpreter of your dreams its most likely to be a culmination of the things youre experiencing and feeling so above all else trust your instincts this is a good one its fascinating that you were in the backyard because in dreamland backyards often represent childhood and the past experiences now behind us its as if this dream was meant to be brought with you into adulthood which certainly warrants a closer look to interpret a childs dream it helps to think like you did as a child bees can represent transformation as in the honeymaking process community collaboration hard work etc but to a child the association may be as simple as thing that might hurt me hands are usually symbolic of the work that we do whether its a child building block towers and cutting paper shapes or an adult doing the dishes and having a job we use our hands but they can also symbolize our lifes work our true calling and the fact that this dream has stayed with you leads me to think this is the case to be bitten in a dream typically indicates feeling attacked vulnerable leeched off of or some other form of threat but whats interesting is that you feel no pain almost as if your hands were prepared for this to be perfectly honest i dont know what this dream is saying but if i were to guess the message id say its something like nothing can stop you from doing what you came here to do wow imo this was your inner self coming through with a powerfully important message thanks so much for sharing its my pleasure and thanks for being willing to share some of your dreams my first instinct is that the house at least in the first dream speaks to some feelings about growing up with your mom but its just as likely to be about your family as a whole and yourself in relation to them
