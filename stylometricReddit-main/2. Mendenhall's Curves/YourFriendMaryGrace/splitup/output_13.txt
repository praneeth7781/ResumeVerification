up for hours at a time in a hot kitchen keeping track of multiple orders at a time busting ass to collect bag each order in well under 5 minutes interacting with customers many of whom are unpleasant working with computer systemscash registers and making correct change you should get that dog a tv show ill never understand why people think working at mcdonalds is easy i get tired just watching them because the white car ended up on top of the red truck that tried to pull it out of the water i think im no expert but i think thats more of a synastry question specifically where you have placements in each others 5th house maybe 4th house too go to astro seek or horoscope yourself websites and make a birth chart using that info lol my 5 year old has been a demanding lil punk all morning i was just telling her that she should try being positive and encouraging more often if she wants people to care enough to cooperate with her this video couldnt have come at a better time the night i met my boyfriend he had an astounding number of conjunctions happening with his natal venus and his north node was parallel his sun sign which is kinda cool because his north node is my sun sign mars in aries 7th house i think just about everybody does that in one way or another driving in a dream usually symbolizes the way your life is going so the fact that youre the one driving and nothing scary happens is a great sign probably indicates that you feel in control of your life people who are stressed about life circumstances often dream theyre driving a car with no brakes for example it being your dads car probably symbolizes having to do some things your dads way or with his permission which makes sense given your age just my perspective take it with a grain of salt oh thats interesting sometimes i think i might be projecting and its actually me that keeps us from talking about stuff lol i feel self conscious because my circumstances at present are keeping us from being able to progress at any rate its nice to hear that sag moons are capable of getting excited about commitment the stereotype is so bleak when it comes to sags and commitment my boyfriend has the same placements and this describes him to a t im curious though how do you feel about talking about the future with regards to relationships hes a sag moonasc so maybe that plays into it but hell talk my ear off about nearly everything but the relationship even though all the other things he says and does point to him being as committed if not more so than me hahaha thats a perfect nickname im a pisces sun so we probably have a lot of the same tendencies i have dreams where im leading a goth girl army whose weapon of choice is literal fireflies flies that zoom into buildings and burst into flames then another part of me dressed in white swoops in and saves the people i like so clearly theres a subconscious conflict within me between wanting to help everyone and wanting to watch it all burn to the ground lol im a libra rising with pluto in scorpio in the 1st house i make a very cheerful feminine first impression and then people seem surprised when im very comfortable with the darksexualtaboo sides of life i also have very dark brown eyes its 6 people standing with their arms in the air look at the black space between the womens legs as tall skinny women in a dress and the vulva is a neckhead once you see them youll see two men in between them and men on the far left and right sides i have costar and use it as a quick reference point sometimes but astroseek is a lot more detailed and will give you more information such as your north and south nodes which imo are some of the most helpful things to know about yourself but i definitely recommend supplementing your knowledge by googling stuff no app or website really covers everything time passages is another great app btw google venus in aries and read some articles then google venus in the 5th house and read some more the combination of what you read will give you a fuller picture edit astroseek gives birth charts that include interpretation of both house and sign but its usually a very brief description from what i can tell it can cause people to be extremely cautious about entering a relationship or even having sex i was in my 20s before i had sex and in my 30s before i had sex with someone else from what i understand thats not uncommon with venus retrograde people i really like sex id just rather be celibate than be intimate with someone i dont feel a strong connection with this thread might be helpful science is not a belief system it does not rely on hopes and dreams i completely agree with you which is why im sharing scientific research with you instead of my hopes and dreams i have no idea whether or not pluto or the apparent retrograde of planets etc affects us neither do you but thanks to decades of research we can say with mathematical certainty that the cycles of the moon as well as some of the inner planets do in fact affect us i dont think you were expecting that so youre pretending like im linking you to pictures of voodoo dolls burning in sage piles rather than engaging with what ive actually written i also agree with you that clinging to beliefs is antiscience which is why its disappointing to see you clinging to your belief that planets have no effect on us despite being shown hard data indicating that some of them do i linked you to properly scientifically conducted research on the topic of planetary effects on humans hoping to have a cordial sciencebased discussion it seems youre more interested in being insulting im not insulted but it feels like you want me to be and arguing against a meme that im in no way trying to defend so i dont really know how to engage with you now arguing on the internet just isnt my thing but lemme know if you ever feel like discussing research and the implications of the results btw i checked out your music and youre very talented i also work in film and i used to live in ocean beach if you believe in science and i suspect that you do then approach this scientifically and see if the evidence supports your hypothesis you stated earlier that the planets moon etc do not affect personality life experiences etc conveniently this is by definition a null hypothesis which means that nearly all the research found here applies to your hypothesis statistically significant meaning that mathematically speaking the correlations cannot be attributed to random chance evidence rejects this null hypothesis which as scientific research usually does brings up a whole slew of new questions youve already listed some really great ones in the comment im replying to now which is why its a bummer to see you close by restating your belief that its all silly and nonsensical rather than examining the evidence and seeking the answers to your own questions asking questions and examining the evidence is the best approach we humans have for learning about our universe the idea that the earth revolves around the sun was once considered silly and nonsensical too but naturally the scientists of the time kept asking questions and examining the evidence and found it to be true and fwiw i do understand where youre coming from im 34 years old and up until may of this year i believed that astrology was a bunch of make believe woowoo nonsense and to be fair the socalled astrology seen in memes and pop culture very often is made up written by people who arent even using astrological methods to back their claims but when i ran across an article citing scientifically conducted studies showing that ancient astrological methods can be used to predict certain human behaviors and experiences to a statistically significant degree i had to accept that i might be wrong of course you are fully entitled to your beliefs and fully entitled to disregard any evidence contradictory to your beliefs but theres a lot to be said for keeping an open curious mind without open curious minds there would be no scientists dreams are often metaphorical but this one might be a little more straightforward perhaps youve been thinking even just hypothetically about having sex and what the ramifications would be in a worst case scenario or maybe youre trying to separate your true feelings about sex from how your parents raised you to think about it just my perspective may or may not be true for you fwiw i grew up in the same kind of household and it took me a while to let go of the guiltshamefears i had about sex but ultimately these types of dreams are helpful and probably a good sign that youre letting go of some obstacles to being yourself well now youre just being obtuse lol my second link has a long list of statistically significant data on the effects of not just the moon but many of the other planets everything is cited and you can even read many of the studies yourself and see the data if you just feel like arguing knock yourself out but calling research done by phds using blind studies and scientific methods of measurement voodoo makes no sense in no way does it effect humans emotions or personalities or life experiences theres an awful lot of statistically significant data suggesting otherwise heres a very small collection of examples and more here but theres lots more out there if youre interested thank you for saying that i hope it helps someone im very glad youre still here this made me sad im sorry your parents reacted like that when what you needed was empathy and support i hope you feel better soon this is so cool i cant wait to try it thank you for sharing it could be a reflection of how you feel youre currently progressing through life for example when people are feeling good where theyre going in life they might dream of driving a nice car down a beautiful road or flying in an airplane lately ive been dreaming of being in a car thats out of control with no brakes so youre not alone lol warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info can you think of anything in your life lately that youve killed it could be a relationship an idea you decided not to pursue a part of yourself that youve suppressed or even someone whos feelings you hurt the fact that you did it without thinking but felt bad afterwards is probably a helpful clue im so sorry to hear that same here and i dont relate to the typical venus in aries description very much im extremely choosy about who i have sex with and rather than lose interest quickly as venus in aries supposedly do ill stick around way longer than is healthy for me in answer to your question op i think i interact fairly normally but under the surface im a bundle of insecurities for the beginning of the relationship and even once im settled in i have an underlying fear im not good enough ive come a long way but i still need fairly regular reassurance from my partner thats actually
