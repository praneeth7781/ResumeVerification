world are still up and running interestingly that no longer appears to be the case list of solar observatories going offline very curious i take it as a sign im on the right track i think we live in the midst of infinite timelines and repeating signs that feel positive are basically a function of the more optimal timelines happy cake day friend thanks for sharing this great picture of your handsome pops and uncle you are an amazing artist this is beautiful the most effective tip ive found is setting the intention as youve already done by jumping and carrying on as if its already done think about it like placing an online order you trust that it will come to you but you dont expect it to show up instantly or order it again and again you just place the order and know it will be delivered it also greatly helps to put it out of your mind as much as possible and when you do think of it practice feeling grateful for the thing youve asked for in other words think im so thankful that i get to have rather than why havent i gotten my yet ahh fair enough well i wish you the best of luck and if i can help you with your experimentation lemme know i think your belief in it working is pretty helpful so going into it expecting it wont work may manifest exactly that not working i wouldnt advise you plan on trying again for the same thing rather do your best to expect the jump you already did will work that being said i typically wait at least a week between jumps more gradual methods can be found at rlawofattraction or rnevillegoddard ive had success with both but mostly prefer these over the jumping methods loving and forgiving people brings you much greater joy and peace of mind than holding onto your frustrations and pain easier said than done i know but worth the effort every time narwals are not a fictional creature i used to coordinate weddings brides and grooms were 10x easier to deal with than the parents of the couple tended to be moms of the bride and groom ime are very nervous about everything going well and end up being a huge nuisance trying to control everything and worrying about stuff for no reason thats cool who knows you may find that you have more in common with your sister than you thought and you could encourage each othermanifest together my most successful two cups jump ever was for more creative ideas maybe try jumping for business ideas i was in high school learning about the french and indian war little did i know my future husband was in college also learning about the french and indian war pretty weird but we have a lot of these synchronicities from before we even met and many more since then i just remember feeling really sad and wondering if it would have a bigger impact on american history than the french and indian war i was walking through my apartment complex on a rainy night there were lots of snails on the sidewalks and i stepped on one this caused me to scream and become frozen in fear of crunching another one it took my husband a while to convince me to start walking again and almost as soon as i did i stepped on another snail rather than get stuck again or ya know watch where i was walking i decided to make a run for it crunching snails and screaming all the way home st johns wort its otc and remarkably effective also just taking good care of myself even or especially when i dont feel like it specifically i try to have at least one green smoothie every day so im sure i get at least 45 daily fruits and vegetables getting out in the sunshine exercising several days a week limiting my internetscreen time and making time to do creative stuff this is not medical advice by any means but personally i took antidepressants for years and they werent nearly as helpful as all of the above also finding friends who arent judgmental and will listen to my problems and empathize ive been fortunate to find a few online and irl friends like this and its lifechanging the smell of chlorine and sunscreen public libraries american girl stuff i often feel nostalgic around 4pm because it was my favorite time of day as a child i would get to eat snacks and watch pbs thats so damn cool my spiritual journey was kickstarted in a single evening early 2013 and its hard to explain just how radically lifechanging a moment like that can be when talking to someone who hasnt experienced it how awesome that yours was during an ellipse and yes please do pm me i love to chat about this stuff i like to meditate and beforehand i set the intention of receiving any kind of help that comes from a source of love and light however i dont think theres anything you have to do other than be willing if youve ever woken up in the morning with a new insight or just been walking along and suddenly had a revelation or clarity about a problem thats what i would consider a download for me days with big energy shifts or upgrades often make me feel super restless like i need to run sprints or something and in the days following i often find myself having enormously helpful dreams about my emotional life sometimes i make unplanned changes for example on 8818 which is sometimes called lions gate i suddenly lost all interest in eating meat others found that their habits and addictions were suddenly much easier to kick now that youre aware that these things often come in waves youll be able to make note of your own personal symptoms its different for everyone yet theres a lot of common experiences id love to hear about your achievements if youre comfortable sharing i think its really cool you live in ireland i spent the summer in dublin one year and loved it my kids are only 4 and 2yo but i hope they grow up to travel and have different experiences as for always being the one to reach out first i feel ya try not to take it too personally people are busy and caught up in the day to day world and just dont take the time to reach out sometimes it doesnt make you any less valuable or important in this world i love you and im proud of you please feel free to pm me anytime you want to chat yeah the subconscious mind is pretty cool were all different yet we dream in a lot of the same or very similar metaphors and symbols when im feeling vulnerable or exposed in some way i usually dream that im in the shower and people are just walking right in the bathroom to talk to me this is so awesome what program do you use the best way to make them stop is to figure out what theyre trying to tell you even stressful dreams nightmares etc are your brains way of sorting through the emotions and situations youre faced with starting school back can definitely be stressful but it could be something from your past or even worries about the future that are surfacing if you feel like sharing your dreams or even just some of the recurring themes id be happy to help out front yards usually represent the way you present yourself to others or how you feel like youre perceived toilets are typically used in private so having to use one on the lawn would seem to be a metaphor for you feeling like your privacy and personal business are exposed think about what in your life has madeis making you feel vulnerable and it might help you hone in on what your subconscious is trying to help you with we really are my friend i love how the internet enables us to find our kinds of people i couldnt agree more about the monetary system i really believe well evolve out of it or it will simply collapse at some point in our lifetimes in the meantime im sending you abundance vibes with all my heart were gonna make so many people happy with our random tips gifts and donations edit another thought i had that seemed to come from somewhere greater than me if i really want to peacefully disrupt the system and i do what better way to do so than to open myself up to greater abundance and redistribute it myself it seems obvious now but it was a revelation when it came to mind yesterday you got me thinking with your post so thank you as well its funny you mention the financial stability ive been having this realization over the past 24 hours that i dont need to be broke to be a good person not that theres anything wrong with being poor in fact i think guys like jesus and ghandi are in part why i have been afraid to accumulate money but for now i see that getting to the point where im not worried about the bills and actually have enough to take care of myself and others would better enable me to give freely and use my gifts of service its a wildly different perspective but it seems like im getting the message that being financially strapped is actually keeping me in a place where i have to think about my needs more than i would without financial stress i think too that i need to learn to trust myself im terrified to turn into a selfinterested rich person who is negligent in the needs of those less fortunate so i keep myself in a situation where im always busy trying to make ends meet which isnt really helping the less fortunate either the silver triangle i havent had the chance to watch your video yet but your title is a little synchronicity for me as ive had the phrase you cant pour from an empty cup running through my mind lately i have two children 4 and 2yo a husband a dog a cat two parttime jobs friends and family who have their own emotional and practical needs i try to fill the list goes on and i can do a lot but i tend to be selfsacrificing to the point where i simply dont take the time to nourish myself or get enough sleep i used to consider taking care of myself as service to self but i no longer see it that way i see that getting adequate nourishment and rest putting on clothes that make me feel confident instead of schlepping around in whatever i pull from the drawer first exercising getting out in the sunshine and putting on makeup or earrings or whatever else feels fun that day these things allow me to open my arms wider and work harder for others to me the only real difference is intention im refilling my cup so i have more to pour out not so i can keep it full and set it aside just for me as for the darkworkers thing i actually never heard that term until this week but it perfectly describes my pastlife memories on a spaceship and essentially what i do best in this life i seem to have a knack for walking right up to the bad guys and diffusing situations breaking up fights etc which is kind of funny because im tiny but when i first ground myself in love and light i am somehow able to gently talk down angry men who could chuck me across the street if they wanted
