they hurt my older brother all the way back when i was in high school i hadnt consciously thought of them often but it was a feeling of newly deepened physical relaxation as i forgave them one by one which reminds me of the other thing that i wanted to ask you about have you looked into the physical side of trauma at all im still learning but its fascinating how trauma is stored not just in memory but in the nervous system and body as well i thought of it because you mentioned trauma of course but also psychedelics mdma therapy is doing miracles for people with trauma of all kinds just something to consider its not going to be legally available until hopefully 2020 but some therapists will do it off the record or you could even possibly be a part of the trials or just read the method and take a diy approach im just throwing out ideas i have also read of people physically releasing trauma through acupuncture sensory derivation chambers somatic therapy and of course meditation im so sorry its been a really rough 15 years and i hope you are at the precipice of a whole new world of beautiful experiences im thankful for your kind words and inspired by your spirit i hope im not out of line but i was also born into privilege and i relate to much of what youve shared about 5 years ago i rejected the life of pursuing wealth and image and i gave away my belongings and moved to the desert everyone thought id lost my mind and were checking in on me with great concern but its probably the most sane thing ive ever done and i just wanted to tell you what i wish id done differently i wish id known the power of forgiveness love and unconditional acceptance i went through an awakening that led to this desert adventure so cognitively i knew these things were of utmost importance but i was still in a very bitter and judgmental mindset with regards to my parents my upbringing anyone who had a healthy savings account and all the powerful people of the world who dont care about the powerless in my mind i was doing something very wise and awakened and they were all so very wrong and lost it held me back i was meditating and learning but i was also stuck replaying the mental tapes from my childhood pinpointing the endless ways that i was wronged thinking of all the things that other people needed to understand imagining myself telling them and i never found the bottom of the barrel of reasons to rehash it all it was a giant toxic waste of time and energy i thought i was figuring stuff out and understanding things that needed to be understood but in hindsight none of the revelations were even useful whats been useful is realizing that people hurt others because they themselves are hurting and that the trauma i received will not go away because of time spent dwelling on the past mistakes of others but rather forgiving them and believing that im not better than them its counterintuitive but believing that im no better than anyone else has been enormously beneficial in learning to love myself im now a firm believer that everyones path is different and perfect for them so my evaluation of where another person should be in their own path is effectively meaningless its helped me stop looking at my parents and everyone else and seeing people who dont get it or people who fucked up and instead simply see them as souls having an experience just like me and thats opened the door for a whole world of spiritual growth that i couldnt imagine before i actually wrote a post about one of my meditation experiences that you may find resonates im totally rambling and none of the above may even be useful to you so more than anything just know that youre not alone and im here for you anytime this is called deja vu its a very strange feeling what made you remember it as ww3 specifically like they were calling it that on the news as soon as it started i have died in a dream before too theres all kinds of things people say supposedly cant happen in a dream like die read use a computer etc etc i think its a little silly because anything can happen in dreamland its probably more accurate to say that certain things rarely happen in a dream anyway i tend to look at dreams metaphorically and imagine what real life experiences and emotions might be symbolized in yours i was thinking about your friend as a lost part of yourself maybe something youve suppressed as you try and play the game of life social pressure etc the house thats out of place and didnt belong in the park made you want to run out of there maybe thats symbolic of the same idea in that you lost part of yourself for fear of not fitting in and dying that seems to me like you cant truly live without this part of yourself im just telling you my impressions though i think its very very important to take interpretations with a grain of salt because you have the mind that dreamt it so your own feelings about what it means are most important an interesting detail of your dream is that you fell to the west looking north the four directions carry an energy and meaning that incredibly is found in disparate cultures and beliefs all over the world and across time the west often symbolizes a journey to grow and fulfill a purpose think of the tribal cultures where a young man reaches a certain age and is sent on a solo journey to become a man the west is kind of like that symbolically speaking its not a journey for someone who knows nothing its a journey to grow and put to use all the things you have already learned the north is often used to represent death wisdom old age and completion so its very cool and interesting to me that in your dying moments of the dream you were facing north the beautiful thing about dying symbolically speaking is that you will be reborn into a better version of yourself so to tie all this together it would be a pretty exciting message about the next phase of life that your subconscious has planned for you id love to read more of this series of dreams and if you do feel like sharing remember that sometimes the best and most potent messages from a dream are in the details that seem unimportant at the time im also very open to the idea of dreams as portals alternate dimensions you name it so do share your theory if and when you feel like it it seems like a dream about the competitive nature of our society check out the sub rprecognition and youll find youre not alone its called deja rv hey im not the person you were asking but i can tell you my experience it seems to me like synchronicities especially when they have a theme are like little messages from the universe theres something about jesus or religion that you are supposed to do or understand and it will help you once you get the message your syncs will probably switch to a different theme edit just a thought i dont want to influence your perception of the message so this is just something that was true for me personally but a huge part of my spiritual awakening came with the realization that jesus words love your neighbor as yourself would completely change the world if everyone did it im not a christian or a follower of a particular religion but that one night of realizing the profundity of that message opened my eyes to a whole world of spiritual growth i just mention it as an example of the message being a doorway rather than the end of the messages water bottles and cats seem to be tied for the glitchiest things in the universe had either of you seen or thought of something that was oh no material sometimes my husband hears me calling for him when i havent said anything and its usually when i was just thinking about asking him something so ive wondered if the energy or intention or frequency of our thoughts sometimes manifest in a way that another person might perceive as audible i cant advise you in terms of medication but what youre describing is no way to live your greatest mission is to love and be loved and whether its real or not anything infiltrating your thoughts and frightening this you this way does not have your best interests at heart my husband and i have noticed the facequirks and mannerisms thing too we even have categories of peoples faces that we reference nowm ndndndd rifle and jekekekk djejejjjrj and are doing it nxnsnd f ppl khamenei vbb van rd heuejr yuri xi w uf and on oki dorr sorry my 3 year old borrowed my phone and wanted to contribute to the discussion and i didnt have the heart to delete anyway ive been thinking about physics lately and how it might explain some things that we see on this sub like how when particles collide they influence and affect each other for life regardless of how far apart they end up if this applies on a human being scale it might explain things like friends and partners reading each others minds or randomly messaging each other at the same time especially in the case of separated twins since it doesnt get much more particle collisiony than sharing a womb some men would but not all of them there are men who feel the same way due to personal or religious reasons deja vu is when you suddenly feel like whats happening in that moment has happened to you before but sometimes the feeling occurs when you are doing something youve never done its hard to explain but i think most people have experienced it at least once ive never had deja rv but i get deja vu thats awesome you have a gift check out rluciddreaming they have all kinds of tips for taking control of your dreams im very sorry that happened to you your theory is fascinating to me as ive been studying the way trauma is stored in the nervous system and ive never seen this particular symptom suggested in 2020 we may have mdma therapeutically available and i think its going to be amazing how many lifelong conditions subside as people are able to process and release the awful things that have happened to them i have a friend who did it and hes a palpably happier and healthier person now anyway thanks for sharing and i really wish you all the best i dont think theres going to be a big event i think its more likely to be many many events that unfold over time and are already unfolding and many of them may only be perceptible to some so one persons great day may be another persons crappy day and the next time theyll have the opposite experience so while im not a believer in terms of the event i love reading the messages and feelings people are getting because to me they hold weight even if the day comes and goes without any big headlines or energy shifts that effect me i feel bad for you op because this is not exactly a winwin situation but if i may be so bold as to make a suggestion id say let the group think it over and see what we come up
