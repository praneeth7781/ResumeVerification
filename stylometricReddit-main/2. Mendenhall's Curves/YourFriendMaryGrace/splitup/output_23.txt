your sister would be a moment in which a timeline where that did happen folded itself into this timeline ive experienced this as well and i know what you mean by the memory feeling just out of reach i think its because its more like a memory of a memory your brain is trying to reach into a void where that timeline and all its events were once held but theres nothing to latch onto which creates a weird cognitive dissonance along the same lines ive had sooo many glitchy things happen to me which at the time were completely shocking yet ive noticed that unless i write them down immediately within a few days i cant even remember what happened at any rate welcome to this timeline i brought you a cookie wow this is exactly what i needed to hear its remarkable how well it fits thank you so much youre very gifted im indeed at the end of an era in my life and i think my blind spot has been thinking i need to check in with everyone else before trusting what i already know my heart is telling me thanks for the empowerment unless youre in desperate need of the money id say cut your losses and definitely cut contact he may be withholding the money precisely because it keeps you in contact with him if you really need the money pursue it through a third party if at all possible at any rate im glad youre safe and sound considering that you explicitly stated you didnt want him to replicate the story i understand you being upset i can also understand not being totally over it and ready to celebrate as if you have nothing to be upset about however as someone who has been married almost 11 years i highly recommend taking a minute alone to scream cry kick a pillow whatever you need to do to release your frustration and then try to move on and enjoy your evening hes apologized hes trying to make it up to you and a good marriage is one of forgiveness youll be the one apologizing for something sooner or later so extend the grace to him that youd like to receive also plan your next anniversary birthday etc together its a lot of pressure on your spouse to have to come up with an evening youll both enjoy and placing the responsibility on both your shoulders will prevent a lot of potentially disappointing celebrations ps congrats on your one year milestone hey there thank you for sharing your perspective abraham hicks is fully entitled to his opinion as are you personally i dont disagree with the possibility you speak of but i also think theres not a singular correct way to look at dreams our minds are too big too varied and theres no way to say with absolute certainty that a persons dreams are always made for one specific purpose i have found that after i set a new intention i tend to have vivid dreams set in my past for a few days and lots of emotional conflicts that bubble up i think its because as i adjust to the new reality im creating i have to address and release some old fears and feelings that would otherwise keep me tied to the old reality anyway thats just my two cents and if it didnt resonate with you thats okay i certainly did not mean to be offensive or frustrating to you and if i was i sincerely apologize i help people interpret their dreams and i lovingly disagree about nightmares predicting the future they certainly can be prophetic but far more often theyre a reflection things that youve already been through and feelings that your subconscious is still trying to process if you or anyone for that matter would like to pm me a dream id be happy to help you hone in on what your subconscious is trying to bring to your attention so cool i had something similar happen where i was meditating and a strange phrase popped into my head i googled it and it turned out to be a lucid dreaming technique id never heard of it never tried to lucid dream i have no idea where that phrase came from at all and soon after i had my first lucid dream its like my subconscious mind was trying to get me to try before i ever consciously considered trying anyway i dont know how these things work i just know that youre not alone and sometimes we somehow know things before we know them when we first looked at our rental house it was late at night wed just found it on a rental site and wanted to see it in person before calling the property management company the next day our soontobeneighbor was freaked out by our late night appearance and walked over to yell at us being super rude and confrontational i remained calm acting as though i perceived her actions and words to be friendly i wished her merry christmas told her it was nice meeting her smiled etc the way i would have if she really were coming over to make friends the next time we saw her she was every bit as friendly as i was pretending she was the first time we became friends for real and she ended up being the person who petsit for our animals when we traveled shed bring gifts for my toddlers birthday and baby gifts when my son was born we love her and she and her wife love us tldr acting as if is a powerful tool ive been successful in transforming peoples anger into kindness many many times this is just one example thanks for the offer any insight into my blind spots things i may benefit from paying attention to etc would be lovely i cant shake the feeling that im missing something what did he call the other leg love this idea i got two very positive workrelated emails this week one letting me know id be paid a day early which was sent at 333pm and another offering me an ongoing gig which was sent at 1222pm i got a concussion a few years ago and when the paramedic asked me if i remembered who the president of the united states was i had a flashback to the scene in this movie where he says its jimmy carter and then they know somethings wrong warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info i have this too theres multiple realities i visit at night and the main thing they have in common is that im married to my same husband but we have no kids which is interesting because we spent the first 6 years of our marriage not planning on having kids but changed our minds and now we have two the one i visit the most is like a cross between hunger games and the amazing race were racing alongside others through forests and rivers but it doesnt feel fun or even remotely safe it feels like were just trying to survive but with all the alternate realities its like you describe theyre continued storylines and being there always feels normal complete with a memory bank for that particular reality i have a halfbaked theory that our souls or consciousness travel to these places at night and learn lessons like an extra credit or night school program for the things were meant to learn in our daytoday reality dimetapp was delicious i have news for you thats called an episiotomy and its very real and very common let us know next time ill bring drinks oh its real the cia has declassified multiple documents containing extensive research and experimentation on the phenomena concluding that its not only real but a valuable tool heres just one of many such documents you can find on their site this one is far more in depth but absolutely fascinating i hope you enjoy the chance to expand your mind once upon a time i thought this stuff was hogwash too im glad i was able to accept that i didnt know everything about how the universe works because its pretty fucking magical and i was really missing out on some cool experiences hugs im so sorry that happened to you i love you general guidance would be greatly appreciated as im at something of a crossroads in my lifethank you so much for sharing your gifts my 4 year old watched a video about continents recently and asked me which one we were in when i told her we were in north america she thought it was amazing and jumped off the couch and said look at me im standing in north america you gotta try this so i stood up and yelled im standing in north america too its actually really fun and i would recommend it to anyone in any continent hey look at you go youve manifested a reply so you can find this later yes love has my back i am gonna make that my affirmation today thank you i think youre exactly right weve been feeling like we should move and reach for some new thingsgoals for a while now but kept on maintaining the status quo i love your perspective and i hope this is just the end before a much better beginning i took your advice and sent a message to the coworker i was concerned about and she was perfectly understanding about my mistake i suggested to my boss a way of avoiding the confusion next time and he thought it was a great idea by the time i left they were both praising my work so i couldnt have asked for a better resolution next time ill do it before i leave to avoid a restless night thanks so much for your wise and very kind words thank you so much for the vibes i was able to check my phone periodically throughout the work day and felt like i was receiving a warm hug all day long thank you so much and thank you for creating the loveliest lightest place on the internet i love you too so dang much gosh this brought tears to my eyes s such solid wisdom and advice thank you so much it is so helpful and appreciated beautiful i cant thank you enough for your focus and energy on my behalf love you brother gosh i cant imagine how tough that must be youve both got all the wishes and good vibes i can muster and ill keep em coming your way im always here if you want to pm and just vent or have a virtual shoulder to cry on big hugs im so sorry for what youre going through it may not be much but fwiw a random internet stranger is thinking about you and your mom today id suggest asking your subconscious that very question today and just before going to sleep ask yourself who is this man and how can i make peace with him intend to have a followup dream about this and give it a few days keep in mind that the followup dream may consist of entirely new storylines and symbols so feel free to check in and share any dreams you may have and ill be happy to help awesome im so glad to hear it was helpful is the buying of gambling chips in any way notable it dawned on me we didnt actually gamble we just kept buying chips yes its almost certainly symbolic of a recurring behavior mentality or something along those lines dreams arent big on filler content ha its probably worthwhile to try a little free association
