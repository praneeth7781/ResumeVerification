of insecurity and most of the time they are being bullied themselves often at home its not a disservice to the children who are being bullied for a grownup to let the bully know he or she is loved its the surest way to help them see that they dont need to hurt others to feel good about themselves none of the above has be in place of consequences or in place of explaining to them what they did wrong its just a whole lot more likely that theyll actually listen and want to change if they first feel that they are worthy of love 101 dalmatians the animated one hmm if your so is willing it might help to join forces on this and speak your instruction out loud remember to instruct not request some people recommend burning white sage around the house as well also check out the spiritual lessons in the sidebarcommunity info as theres some specifically for protection if it persists let us know sending you all the good vibes the sense im getting is that the energy is less than positive dont be afraid of it or angry towards it just ground yourself in love and light and issue a firm instruction to leave your presence think of it like a neighborhood kid whos out late and needs to go home youre the adult here and you have the power to send it away beautiful eyes whats the thought process behind that myth its very confusing typically yeah but some womens bodies are just like lets do this and labors can escalate very quickly with my first baby i was just chilling breathing through spacious contractions like a champ got in the tub to clean up before heading to the hospital and suddenly my contractions were less than two minutes apart my second baby came so fast that i was still gathering up my phone charger and toiletries when i felt him move down and the urge to push was so strong i couldnt walk to the car we had to call for an ambulance and within minutes there were five firefighters surrounding my bed strategizing how to get a stretcher down our narrow hallway lol if we have a third i might have to either camp out at the hospital for the last couple months or deliver it myself please tell your grandmother i said thank you for sharing this lovely little glimpse of her life with us im gonna have to take a pass on the fusion but thanks just the same and ill keep a steady stream of love and light headed your way and im glad it was helpful is there anyone irl you could reach out to maybe go for a coffee or something i dont know what your social life is like but for me staying inside with my own thoughts and energy can get overwhelming and confusing its important to keep a steady footing in the human world and it might help to get out of the house and do some normal stuff every day just a humble suggestion hey buddy things seem to be a bit muddled and confusing in your communication lately are you okay i know youve been struggling with the job search and as someone in the same boat i just wanna say that youre not alone and youre worth so much more than a job could ever encompass im sending you lots of love and light and i want you to know that im thankful for the encouragement youve given me here so many times please dont forget who you truly are you have a gift for offering clarity and support to those who feel lost just remember to reach out when you are in need of the same you dont have to have all the answers none of us do and thats why were here im always here for you k love you brother i care about you awesome please do report back i wrote creatively unfulfilled on one and creatively fulfilled on the other i recommend doing it at night i think it helps to go to sleep with the expectation so your subconscious can adjust without the distractions of daily life have fun doughnut shaped out of the thousands and thousands of people ive interacted with online ive become close friends with three of them two of the three turned out to be infjs lol i do think its a subconscious thing on some level because i was drawn to one of them long before she said anything particularly infjlike but it also makes sense that wed be drawn to people with similar values if it makes you feel any better participation wasnt exactly voluntary its really up to you but the original method recommended using as few words as possible and waiting about a week between jumps btw my very first jump was for new creative ideas and i went from a two year streak of no creative inspiration at all to keeping a notebook with me all the time because the ideas just kept coming be grateful that you were able to help someone who needed it and trust that the universe will repay you with or without that persons help if you focus your attention on that specific person repaying you you shut out the infinite possibilities of the money coming back to you some other way resonates as this days energy has been reminding me again and again that i came here to help others i get so lost in the concerns about how to pay the bills how to explain myself to others that i forget how simple my mission ultimately is im feeling all sorts of shaken up about some conflicts with my parents some financial issues and what feels like a setback in my life and dreams its hard to know where to put my focus and i keep internalizing a lot of guilt and shame but i dont know what to ask exactly general guidance thank you so much for offering how did you feel about what you were doing i had a dream where i was trying to distance myself from some girl who was shooting up and for me it was about trying to distance myself from some bad habits i have not heroin lol my habits are legal but still damaging i think we all use it all the time because its basically just the energy we send out coming back to us eventually but i focused on the belief that the job i really wanted was mine and even though i didnt hear back from them for weeks i got the job another time i was running late for a flight and the line for security was so long there was no way i was gonna make it but i focused on the belief that i would make it and suddenly a tsa agent walked out of a side door and opened up a new line making me have to rush to get my shoes off because i was suddenly second in line ive also manifested money creative ideas and more feelingsbased things like confidence the thirty minutes or so before and after my babies were born helping a woman get away from her boyfriend after i saw him throw her up against his car felt pretty good too im tiny but for some reason he backed down when i told him to trying to get somewhere in life like whats your favorite number what is one of your happy childhood memories what do you miss the most about having both legs also and i know this isnt a question but i love you and im glad youre here give the homeless man more than 3 and some chicken nuggets because hes gonna start telling you that youre a blessing and a light that youre gonna be okay and hes gonna make you feel like you are worthy of being happy so much that as you drive away youll start crying with gratitude and have to pull over just to compose yourself its worth every penny you have on you just to experience the wholesome encouragement of someone who has been through much worse than you yet found peace and joy in just being alive thank you for sharing this ive been having to look at my financial situation and face the fact that ive been irresponsible and impulsive its painful and i have a lot of shameguilt about money that keeps me repeating the same patterns its really nice to see that im not the only one having to look at myself and my actions and take stock of the changes to be made i have a tendency to think that everyone else has it all figured out and im the only one screwing up i also see that the blame ive been placing on others is actually disempowering me making me feel like it cant be helped and that by owning my mistakes i give myself the agency to do better tough stuff to go through but my hope is that by doing so im preparing for the brighter days ahead i love you both this is good advice it also helps me to remember that i can never know the full story behind someones motivations i tend to take things personally that might have nothing to do with me using your example maybe people at your sisters church make her feel guilty when she doesnt go maybe shed actually rather help you but shes afraid of being made to feel bad at church maybe she needs the unconditional love you give her more than youll ever know so your being kind about her saying no could be really healing for her and help her stop caring so much what the church people think of her obviously i dont know your sister or her situation so this is a hypothetical but youre right and thank you for sharing trading its something we can start doing on our own and allows just about everyone an equal chance to use their skills and work with what they have i dont know how we can upend the money system in a big speedy way but i think looking for every opportunity to simply stop using it is a great start i once coordinated a wedding for a massage therapist who gave me treatments after each planning session and totally fixed my jacked up shoulders we both felt like we got a great deal that is a common and enduring myth im not saying you should hate on them just that theres really no such thing as a job anyone can get they only hired 62 of applicants in 2011 and now theyre rolling out automated cashiers so theyll need even fewer human employees holy yes batman this is huge i was told anger is just justifiable selfrespect that wasnt allowed to express itself in time and i have found it to be true i tended to bottle things up until i exploded often hurting people who werent even the cause of my real pain they were just triggering the same feelings i had tried to suppress for far too long if this sounds like it could be the case for you as well i really recommend the book selftherapy by jay earley just reading the free introduction sample on kindle was kinda lifechanging for me and others whom ive shared it with i dont claim to know anything but my feeling is that the event is an ongoing process of our collective human consciousness expanding and our steady gaining of awareness about the true nature of ourselves and the universe for a great many of us it started soon after the end of 2012 and i think it will continue to gain speed throughout our lives and beyond so
