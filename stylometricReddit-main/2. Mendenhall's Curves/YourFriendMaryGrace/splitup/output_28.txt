the age of yourself in the dream indicates that this is about lingering effects of the younger yous experiences the woman selling the house may represent parts of your moms psyche the subconscious tends to add an additional character for each part of someones personality that it wants to illustrate bathrooms are where we tend to our most private and sometimes unpleasant business and in dreams they usually represent much the same thing the things we dont want anyone to know or see and arent a part of our public persona so its possible that theres some family drama that was kept under wraps or aspects of your familys life that were kept from you or some other form of private pain that you havent properly processed and healed from it might be pain that you experienced as a child and felt like you shouldnt tell anyone looking out a window typically symbolizes your view of the world or in this case the way you looked at world in the time of your life that this dream is meant to illustrate the broken down amusement park seems to say joy is gone the colorful abandoned houses may be colorful parts of yourself that you lost when you were younger or colorful parts of your family life that were ruined somehow the fact that your family is happy with the view unaware of your feelings of dread makes me think that you are the one who died in private murdered by the stranger who might still be in the house the fact that he might still be in the house suggests that your pain felt inescapable and maybe still does the attic represents your highest thoughts which often means spirituality forgotten or undiscovered parts of a house is a very common dream metaphor and it means that theres a part of yourself that youve lost touch with the childhood friend and her family are probably parts of yourself that you lost when you were a child and stopped spending time in this part of your spiritual life as a result its very powerful imagery and its more hopeful than it probably feels within the dream there are hidden rooms within all of us just waiting to be enjoyed again theyve just been boarded up with pain we arent ready to face again please dont feel discouraged by the darkness of these dreams its not indicative of anything youre doing wrong or not doing well enough i keep recommending this book for precisely this reason its helped me to understand that each and every bad self within us isnt even bad its just a defensive bodyguard self that is protecting a wounded little child self children need to be able to express their feelings and receive unconditional love and support but when that inevitably fails to happen a little piece of that child remains stuck in those bad feelings and a defensive self develops to try and stop you from reliving that pain as with any dream interpretation this one is subject to my own projections and experiences so i want to stress that you are the best interpreter of your dreams if any of that resonates awesome and the things that dont quite feel right are your subconscious telling you thats not it keep thinking i find that by pondering the interpretations that do feel right and then thinking about them in relation to the parts that are still confusing me things start to click into place and make sense overall please dont hesitate to follow up with questions other dreams etc im truly happy to help however i can thats beautiful its a lot like what people who participate in the therapeutic mdma trials say that they got to know themselves underneath all the barriers theyve built up and that in itself is a catalyst for continued healing im glad my comment was helpful i was hesitant about posting it because the last thing i want to do is derail your positive experience by projecting my own beliefs onto it its really cool that it resonates with what you felt thanks again for sharing it was helpful for me your ankles are lovely just my personal opinion but i think the concept of a higher self that is somehow removed or above the self is a misunderstanding ive been reading about the therapeutic mdma trials and one thing that seems to come out for everyone is a healing self within that is benevolent and somehow unaffected by the trauma of our lives it knows who we are and who we might be without the trauma weighing us down i call it the inner self or highest self because to me thinking of it as a separate entity leaves me feeling like i have to appeal to it or beckon it somehow i think its the same self that creates the dreams which bring us clarity about our emotional lives to be clear i do believe we have angels guides whatever you want to call them i just think the higher self is within and not in any way better than us because it is us anyway thanks for sharing your session its a gift to be able to read others experiences gosh this made me sad its late at night and im up holding my baby boy who is sick and started thinking of him wanting to see me not being able to talk to me idk where im even going with this except to say im sorry and i hope she gets out soon virtual mom hug ps i believe you dreams like this usually happen to people who are thinking aboutpreparing to give birth to an idea a new venture of some kind etc isnt it amazing how much we can intuitively realize seemingly out of nowhere im starting to think there was a recent know thyself upgrade in this universe ha i keep bumping into people online and irl who are also finding peace through sudden clarity into their psyche and thank you same to you this is something ive been thinking about too ive been reading this book about the internal family systems method of therapy and its so encouraging the idea is basically that our even our bad and self destructive parts are just pieces of self doing the best they can for us because however misguided their efforts may be they are just trying to protect a wounded part of self i used to feel bad about how frustrated and panicked id get when my husband was telling me about something complex i knew cognitively that he was just trying to share some interesting thing he learned but i couldnt stop the amygdala reactions eventually i realized that i was reacting this way because of my experiences as an adhd child and teen not being able to pay attention and feeling the intense embarrassment of not getting it like the other kids so my feelings of anger and fear about these conversations werent bad they were just screaming get out to try and protect me from feeling embarrassed again realizing that has helped me stop guilting myself for the feelings and instead i think to myself thank you frustration and anxiety for trying to keep me from reliving embarrassing situations but im okay im safe it only feels unsafe thats just one example of many i could share as i am something of a walking ball of triggers lol its been hugely helpful for me in my healing edit ive also realized that by soothing these dark reactions im able to stay in the moment and let my wounded selves experience safety now when my husband wants to tell me something complex i find that i can listen and learn just fine which is healing in itself im sorry you experienced that dream it sounds pretty terrifying im of the belief that dreams can come in many different forms precognitive intuitive and metaphorical to name a few and sometimes as appears to be the case here theyre a combination of metaphors based on past and future events the kind i work with are the metaphorical which can tell us about whats going on in your head that you may not be consciously processing the most important thing to know is that these are my impressions of the dream and since i dont have the brain that dreamt this i cant tell you for sure what it means for you the best way to receive a dream interpretation is to ponder it disregard anything that didnt resonate and think about how the imagery and emotions correlate to your real life missiles are a direct and targeted attack you may want to consider ifhow you might have been feeling attacked or afraid of being attacked at the time you had this dream it could also be a dream about an attack from years ago which your subconscious is still trying to make sense of our friends often show up in a dream as standins for ourselves specifically the part of oneself that is reflected in the personality of the friend for example my friend g often shows up in my dreams and through context and introspection i realized that i dream of him as a standin for the part of myself that gets distant and aloof from insecurity which is one of the traits i noticed early on in g you have a few old friends with you and its quite possible that they all represent a part of yourself its also possible that your subconscious placed them there because the dream is reflecting an attack that occurred during the time of your life that was spent with these friends it could be both the one that dies i suspect is a part of yourself that youve lost as a result of some unexpected trauma or difficulty ie missile in your life having to tell his family seems like a significant plot point but its hard to say what it means a few possibilities when some part of your persona dies friends and family are typically the first to notice that something is off maybe this part of the dream reflects having to interact with your family without this lost part of yourself another possibility the family could be other parts of yourself that you have to interact with differently now with regards to feeling stuck my guess would be that you are ready to reintegrate this lost piece of self back into the whole but theres still some inner work to be done it could be as simple as identifying the part of yourself thats missing and intending for it to redevelop if any of that resonates awesome but if not thats completely okay dont try to make it fit dreams are individual creations and you are the best interpreter of your own edit oops i left out an important possible explanation toconsider for the friend in your dream which is that of course he may be playing the part of himself its especially likely if you went through hard times with this friend or have lost contact with him a good way to test this is to observe the very first thoughts and emotions you have when you think about this friend if you feel something unpleasant such as guilt sadness etc thats an emotional response that your subconscious would probably like to resolve which it often does in the form of nightmares about how you ended up feeling this way about your friend if you feel loving and neutral when you think about the friend then he probably represents a part of yourself if you have any recent dreams you dont mind sharing id be happy to let you know what i see i dont disagree with you on the deceptive intentions but i still pay attention to the dates and claims because
