this that were intensely vivid they felt more like memories than dreams i never saw what i looked like but all my friends looked like the guy i saw in my living room we lived on a spaceship that was small but expandable like additional rooms could just kind of materialize at the push of a button the feeling i had with them was total love and support we were workers who spread love and light everywhere we went we zipped around and took meetings with aliens who worked for the dark side so to speak we never fought with them though we just used a kind of telepathy to determine if they were willing to work with us and maybe even become less dark if they were i or one of my buddies would teleport to their ship and negotiate eventually i got bored and wanted to try something harder so i heard that the planet earth was in trouble and needed volunteers to come and spread the light by being loving and forgiving i was told that id need to be careful not to hurt anyone i thought huh why would i ever do that its hard to explain but the dimension or atmosphere of this place i was in made it really easy to be loving all the time i was really naive like i couldnt possibly understand how much id be hurt in this life and how much id hurt others as well they tried to tell me but i just couldnt comprehend it and i was too excited about the adventure of it all the idea was that theyd basically upload my consciousness into a baby and my next memory is being in the womb already able to sense how painful and difficult it is to be here thinking oh no i dont want to do this anymore but it was too late the dreams came to a screeching halt after that but i dont mind because if and i realize thats a big if this is at all true my focus needs to be on this life i chose and work i signed up for edit interesting side note my whole life ive had a recurring thought that i wish i hadnt been born id have this thought a lot even in the happy times but ever since i saw my old friend and had all these dreams ive found myself thinking that im glad i was born honestly this all feels very real to me but either way its been a blessing long answer pregnant women dont lactate unless theyre already nursing another baby milk doesnt come in until a few days after the baby is born before that what comes out is a sticky clearish substance called colostrum which is easier for the newborn to digest and contains the nutrients it needs most short answer shes most likely got a breastfed baby at home under the umbrella tree my four year old and i were painting a picture together and i had to briefly stop when her baby brother woke up from his nap i told her id be back in a few minutes and that she could play on the ipad in my absence she typically jumps at the chance to play on the ipad so i thought nothing of leaving the paint out as i hurried off to the kids room big mistake angered by the sudden motherdaughterpaintytime interruption she proceeded to paint all over herself the floor two cabinets and my grandparents antique pie safe yeah great minds think alike i cant speak for your mom but i really just want my kids to be happy if getting marriedbeing in a relationship wouldnt make them happy i sure wouldnt want them to fake it on my account she might just be talking about it under the assumption thats what you want you know at any rate youre perfect just as you are im so sorry i hope things get better for the both of you soon thinking about it metaphorically do you feel like youre unable to get control over some kind of situation in your life maybe you cant say what youre really thinking to a boss or family member food often represents nurture maybe you lack nurturing environment in your life and have to take what you can get in terms of feeling loved and cared for im not sure to be honest but thats what comes to mind at first glance im so sorry and im glad youre here i am so very sorry for what youre going through it may encourage you to know that theres thousands and thousands of accounts of loved ones reaching out in this way letting their families know theyre okay i experienced it myself after my grandfather died science tells us that our brains operate in 11 dimensions only 4 of which are we currently able to observe and measure so theres an awful lot to our consciousness that we dont yet understand but that doesnt mean its not happening once upon a time there was no credible evidence for radio waves or electromagnetic fields i think our consciousness is eternal and just like the internet doesnt cease to exist because your laptop dies we go on long after this particular body were inhabiting here is done im always here for you anytime please feel free to pm me sending lots of love to you and your family that was a dick move on their parts for sure but fwiw the way you turned him down so politely tells me youre a really good person i hope you findfound someone who deserves you hey there lots to unpack here but ill do my best to help the first thing that jumps out at me is a recurring theme of overindulgence too many chocolate covered strawberries public masturbation taking things too far with the girl you werent engaged too etc the subconscious tends to use metaphors to illustrate things so it helps to think about what reallife situations and feelings might be symbolized here obviously theres a lot more going on in these dreams but that seems like a good place to start does that help i actually laughed out loud thanks for this one i like to google angel number x with x being the number i saw and see what if anything resonates but off the top of my head 4545 is interesting from a numerology perspective because in numerology you add single digits together and then if you end up with a double digit number you reduce it to a single digit number by adding the individual digits together so 45 9 and 4545 18 and 189 basically any way you slice it youve got a pretty potent 9 there in numerology 9 is associated with the end of a cycle and old things falling away to make room for the new given all youve been through this year that seems pretty apt i dont know if thats helpful but if nothing else maybe itll give you a fun rabbit hole to fall down ps im so sorry for all your troubles hang in there theres brighter days ahead you dont pee on the whole stick lol just the cottony part that sticks out of the very end which is then covered by a plastic cap you can request that some of your birthday or christmas presents be donations to a cause you care about especially if you tend to get gifts you dont particularly enjoy but you shouldnt feel guilty be thankful you were born into abundance and thankful that you have opportunities to pay it forward i think its lovely that you recognize your good fortune and want to help others this is really lovely thanks 1889 man for inspiring me to be a better friend i can understand you being disappointed but i can also understand wanting my kids to have as normal of a childhood as possible and be able to just focus on family time when taking them places it would suck as the kid to feel like your parents career is always going to be a priority this makes me happy i love kith and especially scott yes waited on them in this context means they served them a meal or drinks at a restaurant i can see how it would be confusing since waited on them could also mean it took time for them to arrive sometimes i listen to binaural beats or a meditation track on youtube but most of the time i just lie still and focus on relaxing my body from the feet up then i mentally repeat loving phrases starting with i love myself this is a tricky one for me because i tend to dwell on my mistakes and i dont usually feel like i actually love myself at first but i keep repeating it until it feels good then i focus on my love for my family and friends much easier and finally everyone in the world and the universe after that i try to let my thoughts drift off unless some other affirmations come to mind by then im usually sinking into the deep waves and thats when the tingling and vibrating begins sometimes it causes me to come back up to a fully conscious state because i get kind of excited lol and i have to remind myself that its normal and i can let go i often experience this in meditation and light sleep cycles to me its like im subconsciously conversing with my angels and its a normal occurrence in that state but of course once i wake up im often left wondering what we were even talking about and the vibration thing often accompanies the chats i especially feel it in my neck and face sometimes ill remember key points or suggestions that are really helpful and encouraging other times ill only remember something random and seemingly nonsensical but it will make sense later this morning i could only remember them telling me something about tiny bears lol so im excited to discover whatever the heck that was about all of the above being said its a good idea to meditate on love and light a bit before going to sleep or meditating as i have also had the strange experience of some less benevolentfeeling interactions as well tldr i have no definitive answers but i know what you mean aww your mama sounds like my kind of person my best friends mom always said were making a memory in the same contexts i think its a nice way to look at things im so happy youre okay i was quite sad to see you not yourself you get infinite love and forgiveness from me always everyone here does please take good care of yourself i had sleep paralysis once and it was a demonic cat trying to suffocate me it sucked i felt that it had this intense hatred for me i really dont know if these sleep creatures are actual demonic entities or what but its certainly not fun to experience the dream itself feels more metaphorical to me as dreams often are can you think of any reallife parallels the coworker may represent an aspect of yourself maybe something you do as way to escape something you cant otherwise avoid for example if you dont like your job but you cant quit the job itself could be represented by the person chasing you the fainting coworker could represent calling in sick does that help i think god is everything and nothing can exist outside of it because it is existence itself to be anything is to be god the source of everything i think the idea of god having personality and individuality is a manmade concept devised for various reasons heres a post i wrote here quite
