various elements of the dream and see what first comes to mind for me gambling immediately calls to mind the word risk but in this case the real risk is in not gambling youve already bought the chips so youre better off playing and possibly winning than just continuing to stockpile chips perhaps the chips represent some leverage or asset youre not using to your advantage in the dating game or at work perhaps you are comparing yourself to others and feeling like your metaphorical pile of chips are inadequate thereby making you feel unworthy of the relationship or career you desire just a few things to consider in the dream world your house represents yourself as a whole person taking a shower is symbolic of an emotional cleansing forgiveness spiritual renewal etc its significant that you saw this man before you got in the shower as it would seem to indicate that he represents something or someone who is keeping you from undergoing the emotional and spiritual cleanse that you need its entirely possible that this man is an internal part of yourself its also interesting that he is doing his own thing he isnt actually hurting you but youre afraid that he will i dont think this is about your potential relationship exactly it seems more like your subconscious trying to draw your attention to some fears or perceived threats that are holding you back if that doesnt resonate let me know and im happy to help you examine some other possibilities i have experience helping people interpret their dreams and would be happy to help you with this one can you provide all the details you can recall including the setting characters colors emotions you felt and so on buying the chips because the other women were suggests that youre caught in an undesirable feedback loop or that you arent being true to yourself in some way the subconscious mind likes to cast an additional character for each part of yourself that it wants to illustrate so its likely that all three women represent parts of yourself since your subconscious chose single friends specifically it may be a feedback loop within yourself that is keeping you single the business cards are interesting because you left them in two stacks two is often used to represent the idea of a relationship you put out cards that dont direct people towards yourself but rather your uncle by way of a job he doesnt even like this seems to be indicating that youre either not putting yourself out there at all or youre putting yourself out there in a way that is ultimately directing people away from you dream interpretation works best as a collaborative process so do let me know what does and doesnt resonate with you and im happy to help you hone in on what your subconscious is trying to process wowwwww dude i cant even tell you how much this applies to me right now theres two loved ones in particular who deserve my love and support right now but ive been withdrawn and i dont know why thank you so much also i got your message at 1111am and theres 33 comments in your post time for me to pay attention general guidance please thank you so much for your kind offer thanks for taking me seriously i felt pretty selfconscious posting this i dont remember what the deals were exactly but i had a series of past life dreams after this experience that were intensely vivid they felt more like memories than dreams i never saw what i looked like but all my friends looked like the guy i saw in my living room we lived on a spaceship that was small but expandable like additional rooms could just kind of materialize at the push of a button the feeling i had with them was total love and support we were workers who spread love and light everywhere we went we zipped around and took meetings with aliens who worked for the dark side so to speak we never fought with them though we just used a kind of telepathy to determine if they were willing to work with us and maybe even become less dark if they were i or one of my buddies would teleport to their ship and negotiate eventually i got bored and wanted to try something harder so i heard that the planet earth was in trouble and needed volunteers to come and spread the light by being loving and forgiving i was told that id need to be careful not to hurt anyone i thought huh why would i ever do that its hard to explain but the dimension or atmosphere of this place i was in made it really easy to be loving all the time i was really naive like i couldnt possibly understand how much id be hurt in this life and how much id hurt others as well they tried to tell me but i just couldnt comprehend it and i was too excited about the adventure of it all the idea was that theyd basically upload my consciousness into a baby and my next memory is being in the womb already able to sense how painful and difficult it is to be here thinking oh no i dont want to do this anymore but it was too late the dreams came to a screeching halt after that but i dont mind because if and i realize thats a big if this is at all true my focus needs to be on this life i chose and work i signed up for edit interesting side note my whole life ive had a recurring thought that i wish i hadnt been born id have this thought a lot even in the happy times but ever since i saw my old friend and had all these dreams ive found myself thinking that im glad i was born honestly this all feels very real to me but either way its been a blessing gosh im gonna sound completely insane but fck it not an abduction but i saw an alien in my living room about a month ago he was blue with an enormous mushroom shaped noggin i didnt feel afraid though as he looked strangely familiar like an old friend i thought to myself why am i seeing this guy and the answer was telepathic saying you made some deals before you came here i understood this to mean that i knew him in a past life and had done him some favors so he was going to help me out in this life in some way then he disappeared it was bizarre obviously but somehow really comforting i actually got emotional thinking about it the next day winona ryder it has no effect on my life except for randomly being told i look like winona ryder from time to time marygrace ps i like your style beautiful thank you for sharing my brother has autism and i am a better person for having grown up with him he got a job bussing tables and my dad had to teach him about paying bills because he just wanted to give all his money away im so glad you and kyle found each other ueateroflife283 remotely viewed you order food last week you picked your side and it was mashed potatoes youre welcome and its not a dumb question at all its normal to second guess things especially when feelings are involved i hope you have a good time on your date i sort of naturally believed in the loa as a child for example my mom took me to see the play annie when i was about five years old and i became obsessed i pretended to be starring in annie all the time and would practice as if id already been cast when i turned 10 just the right age for the part i saw an ad for annie auditions in my hometown newspaper and i got the part rediscovering the loa as an adult i found it harder to act as if but i basically use the same techniques of imagining myself in the scenario i intend to manifest so far so good youre welcome im only able to offer this advice because i struggle with the same things and becoming aware of it has been helping me a lot you got this when my daughter was three she used to tell us all kinds of stories about when daddy was a little boy always from the perspective of an adult i tried to ask her about when mommy was a little girl and she said she didnt know she also said that her baby brother was her brother before but he was a girl youd probably enjoy checking out rpastlives if you havent already theres some cool stories there i believe you mac have you read about the mandela effect you and op should check out rprecognition youre definitely not alone and i just read this comment at 1133 i manifested a very positive conversation with my boss i really like him but he was a jerk recently and it was pretty upsetting i focused on projecting love and forgiveness towards him until the next time we worked together and the whole drive to work that morning i tried to feel grateful for the best possible outcome of the situation truthfully i wanted to tell him he was wrong but something in my mind told me that i should ask what i could be doing better instead so i did and he immediately responded with an apology for the way hed acted said that it wasnt my fault and that hes very happy with my work i cant even tell you how unlikely it seemed that hed ever acknowledge he was a jerk much less apologize im so thankful and surprised it was also a learning experience for me to keep an open mind about people and to stay humble and be willing to be part of the solution rather than assume theyll never change i really like all of rgarbagedolly advice heres a few things that jumped out to me in your post and responses unnecessary limitations theres a lot of ways to make money besides being a massage therapist or a server so starting your own business doesnt have to be an allornothing situation unless you make it one try and open yourself up to many possibilities for earning a living and see what comes up because the possibilities are endless i have a part time job a small business and a hobby that sometimes pays and i love this combo because its never monotonous and i dont have to strictly rely on any one thing in order to have income ive also found that even though the jobs are in fairly different fields i still get clientscontacts through one job that end up being business for another negative motivations its hard to get excited about something if theres shame attached and theres definitely some shame in the motivation to finally get out of your parents house it has the implication that youve been there too long you should have reached full independence by now etc which are making you feel bad every time you think about this goal thats supposed to bring you joy youre doing great and theres no real shame whatsoever in living with family at your age so try to focus on moving out for the most fun and uplifting reasons externallyplaced identity i get the impression that you feel like you need money success a home etc to feel like youre enough but you were worthy of existing on the day you were born and you didnt bring a single one of those things with you the same is true for you now it just doesnt
