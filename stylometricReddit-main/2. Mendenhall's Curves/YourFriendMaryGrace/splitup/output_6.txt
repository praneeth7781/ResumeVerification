you feel pretty strongly the computer keyboard might mean that this is a dream about anger youre feeling specifically in regards your communications with the outside world or perhaps while working from home the sloppy food might mean youre feeling disgust too im just spitballing but you get the idea hope its ok that i said all that i just get excited about dreams lol love your style i help people interpret their dreams as a hobby and i might be able to shed a little light quite often the people we see in our dreams arent playing the part of themselves they often represent a different side of yourself that you identify in them for example i have a very spiritual side but i also have a very logical reasoning side i have a friend darion who is pretty dismissive of anything spiritual metaphysical etc when ive had moments of feeling conflicted about these two sides of myself theyre often followed by dreams of me and darion being on bad terms even though were getting along fine so i see it as darion representing my logical side and my subconscious mind trying to tell a story that calls attention to this disconnected person within me just something to consider in case its helpful warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info i have the same placement i think it is playing out for me like this the scorpio south node means that my past lives and my past in this life tends to be filled with drama power struggles abuse of some kind and money problems i feel my mission is to find peace stability and prosperity in this life and basically stop expectingcocreating chaos i think this tumultuous time period were in with the virus and worldwide political issues is such a good opportunity to be a port in the storm so to speak the inspiring thing about this placement is that if you believe in past lives you can bet that you have already been through just about everything a person can go through and youre still here youre stronger for it and you can handle anything its okay to just relax and enjoy life and lean into those lovely taurean traits like gardening enjoying good food and indulging all your senses absolutely my bffexhusband and i have had a lot of lives together i think it sounds so cheesy but the first night we spent together we didnt even fool around just stared into each others eyes and felt completely at home i didnt even believe in past lives at the time yet i felt like id finally found him now 15 years later hes still the only person i can just look into their eyes forever and never feel uncomfortable were divorced but we are still as close as ever weve both done past life regressions and seen lives weve had together usually as a couple or just dear friends i have another friend that i feel for some reason was my son in a past life ive also had the experience of simply locking eyes with a stranger and thinking i know them like an instant love and familiarity and it always makes me wonder if its a loved one from another lifetime you need to be able to heal and process and release trauma before those experiences become helpful imo ive dealt with everything from sexual abuse to homelessness and for a long time it did weaken me but years and a lot of psychedelics therapy yoga etc later i feel pretty damn powerful i think that what doesnt kill you saying does a disservice in the same way that calling cancer patients fighters does it gives the impression that if you dont possess a superhuman ability to immediately bounce back to better than before youre somehow deficient the focus should be on healing and transmuting and being supported until you start to feel stronger im here for you if you ever want to chat my cap moon is in the 4th house and cleaning my home makes 95 of my bad feelings feel better for a little while i have a pisces sun but a cap moon and 4 aries placements i still come across as gentle to most people at first theres a lot of interpretations but generally i just take it as a sign im on the right path i would look into numerology if youre interested in learning more about the particular energy numbers carry you can even generate a free reading online based on your name and birthdate it really does thank you shes amazing and i love the way her clever little mind works and i just want to support her the best i can that sounds just like my 6 year old gemini sunmoon daughter any parenting advice for me especially when it comes to the tantrums to be fair a lot of things have happened this year that we wouldnt have thought would happen in a million years its kind of the theme thats what i hope for at this point those are great placements imo having your moon and ascendant in the same sign helps because peoples first impression of you is better aligned with your inner self descendant signs can often represent your shadow side parts of yourself that are underdeveloped but having it the same sign as your sun means those traits are much more inherent in you amazing i have the same placement of chiron and related to all of this i started unintentionally having spiritualmetaphysical experiences at a very young age that didnt jive with the religion of my family and community it was difficult enough just to process those experiences alone and trying to explain them was impossible and socially risky so i kept quiet im still figuring out how to share my thoughts and feelings about things without sounding crazy lol i feel the same way about my pisces suncap moon thankful to have both bc i can see myself being extremely lazy or a workaholic with just one or the other lol if the relationship is no longer healthy and the parents cant get along they already have an unstable family unit plenty of people grow up to wish their parents had just divorced rather than stay together arguing and being passive aggressive all the time the 29th degree sun year is said to be a time of preparation for the changes to come when your progressed sun changes signs mine changes from aries to taurus next year and i am kind of feeling that energy like im getting ready for something if he knew anything about true astrology hed know that summing someone up based on their sun sign is ridiculous unfortunately there will always be people who have a prejudice against certain signs but thats life you geminis are awesome and he sounds like a terrible friend lol i feel like its safe to say they hardly ever use it that way this is their time to plot and scheme amongst themselves safe from the peoples expectations and opinions getting in the way really rough but ultimately it was all necessary for me to transform into a much more authentic version of myself yes i hear what youre saying and i cosign your petition for everyone to stop with the gun waving right im referring to ops comment about his real life interactions the ones that know were not racist were there last night and people with open minds were willing to hear us out and have conversations with us and saying that i dont think its fair to dismiss what hes saying about his real life experience and intentions just because it sounds like something trolls say its crazy and honestly it scares me im reminded of that noam chomsky quote all the time lately the smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion but allow very lively debate within that spectrum im sorry but thats a stretch billions of people converse every day lol you cant attribute everything that is said and done in the real world to divisive online lingo personally i prefer to engage in good faith and if it doesnt work out i move on why are we really at the point where wanting to have a conversation is suspicious if so then were completely screwed because exchanging ideas and perspectives is crucial for peace woah thats crazy my first name in this life is similar to a name ive had before but dying in an alley and being reborn as ali is wild i hope remembering how tough you had it before has helped you release any guilt about having it good in this life you deserve all the best ali yes ive done it many times probably at least a dozen times lol but its only worked twice in total ive seen 4 of my past lives one through regular meditation one through a guided meditation like this one was in a dream i had after a psychedelic trip and the most vivid and recent one ive been remembering since i was a little girl thats funny i almost asked you if you have any fears related to big cities or alleyways honestly its really great to hear that youve had a good life this time your story was very sad and it sounds like youshe more than deserved a break this go round do you have any experiences or feelings in this life that might be influenced by hers im always interested in the parallels like ive had a lifelong determination to only have sex with people who truly appreciate me as a person and then in one of my past life regressions i saw myself as a woman who had really low selfesteem and let herself be used by a bazillion different guys bc she thought being sexy was her only valuable quality magician and i relate to the description very cool thanks for sharing thats really heartbreaking im sorry 3 well im 35 years old and im embodying my libra rising more than ever so dont hold your breath wow this is my boyfriends placement if you dont mind me asking were you bullied or just generally made to feel small by a parent weird i didnt sleep at all last night and my 3yo was awake until like 3am my 6yo woke up about 4am and never went back to sleep no problem im still fairly new myself browsing this sub plus reading birth and synastry charts of people i know then looking up the placements and aspects that interest me have been my best learning tools its giving you the option of which astrological method youd like to use placidius and whole sign are probably the most commonly used ones around here personally i prefer whole sign you can search those terms in this sub for a lot more info did you guys get more than a one time relief payment of 1200 months ago damn im so sorry youre going through all this another fireball checking in i have mars mercury and venus in aries also lilith do you mean that mars is in your third house in your natal chart or transit natal placements tell you how those energies will most clearly manifest in your life as a whole transit charts ie where mars is in your chart right now will tell you how youre currently being affected is it in your 6th house in your birth chart or do you mean thats your current mars transit my natal mars is aries in the 7th house but right now its
