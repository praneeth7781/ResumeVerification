its beautiful and essential that you do you are one of the greats embrace it life is long and sometimes its really hard but if you can learn to appreciate the hard times as a trial by fire a chance to burn off the things that are no longer serving your highest potential so that you can grow into something much greater youll soon come out on the other side like a phoenix born from ashes you mentioned getting your whole self to cooperate and i truly get what you mean i highly recommend this book even if you only read the free sample youll get a lot of helpful realizations the idea is that as we go through life experiences of trauma sadness etc parts of our truest selves go into hiding while other parts of ourselves spring up to put up defences and barriers to try and stop the wounded selves from getting hurt again these bodyguard parts of self only have good intentions for you they want to protect you but sometimes theyre misguided or no longer needed for example you have a bodyguard part of yourself thats telling you youre tired and its safer to stay in bed if you view that part of self like hes bad it only doubles down on the hurt and fear hes already feeling you have to be thankful for his efforts love him assure him that you are safe and gently tell him that he can move along now tldr love forgive and appreciate every single part of yourself even or especially the parts that you dont want to be anymore and they will dissipate and reintegrate back into the whole making you into a new and improved version of yourself you got this hugs youre never alone i see a lot of selfdefeating assumptions in your post such as the assumption that your brain is wired to be negative you have a beautiful brain its just in need of a little makeover you can change anything you want and changing your way of thinking is one of the easier things to change if you dont meditate its time to start my brain is very active always going and going so i really understand what its like to feel stuck in a negative thought loop meditation trains your brain to slow down and starting with just a few minutes a day can make a noticeable difference in less than a week so start there next write down some positive affirmations and try and think of them every single time you catch yourself having a negative thought you dont have to believe the statements are true just start thinking about them and they will start to become your reality heres a few of my favorite affirmations the worst is behind me im doing a great job im safe and loved everything is going well for me i have a lot to look forward to i love myself i love everyone i have an abundance of money i have an abundance of energy i have an abundance of love im really blessed i also recommend thinking thank you and i love you as much as possible you can direct your love and gratitude to yourself random strangers the universe whatever you want just practice feeling love and gratitude especially on the tough days i love you and im here for you anytime plaaahstaahk lol my brother and i loved this movie and loved to imitate his weird pronunciations your associations make perfect sense to me in case its helpful heres my thoughts on few of them mario kart maybe about how you are navigating through life or the games you play socially at work etc to get ahead toilets could represent your thoughts feelings about what youre producing with your current life or something you andor others are trying to keep hidden belly of the serpent makes me think of the wolf in sheeps clothing but its a man in snakes clothing and it feels like a trap does that parallel to a feeling you have sometimes like you have no choice but to appear threatening shark in the water water often represents emotions the shark could be an angry part of yourself or an emotional threat of some kind shopping centers often represents how you are presenting yourself or how you see yourself in relation to society do you have any more recurring characters thinking of your immediate associations with the people in your dreams or the recalling type of person you were back when you spent the most time with them might be helpful for identifying which parts of yourself the dream is trying to resolve for example you mentioned the exgirlfriend dreams perhaps theres a part of yourself thats still stuck in those days waiting to be reintegrated so for instance if you felt like you were selfish back then forgiving yourself and your mistakes would probably soothe those particular dreams away well i for one dont think youre crazy imo its entirely possible that scientists there and elsewhere are doing all kinds of crazy stuff that isnt disclosed to the general public but regardless of whether or not our universe is being tampered with i think the most important part of your comment is this he believed it was absolutely crucial that people need to hold true and not lose themselves i believe that too and i think people are doing it all on their own its amazing how many people myself included are actually living better and happier lives since experiencing these alternate dimension type dreams glitches etc and even though the recent batch of shared dreams were apocalyptic the underlying theme was that the dreamers felt calm and knew there was no reason to be afraid thats beautiful and worth taking to heart all of this to say dont worry be happy personally i believe theres an awakening force of love and light rolling in and its unstoppable i dont think it sounds stupid at all and i think your mom is blessed to have you in her life my advice is to lead by example try new things and pass along the things that you find helpful heres my goto daily list for improving my mind and body complete with an acronym swem supplement getting all the vitamins and nutrients i need either through food alone or food supplements water staying hydrated exercise hitting the gym doing thirty minutes of yoga or even just dancing around the living room is great for my overall energy and mood meditate i try and do at least ten minutes a day these are just a few ideas but the point is to take care of good yourself and talk to your mom about the benefits youre experiencing wishing you both all the best thats amazing im in a private subreddit and the same thing happened huge influx of powerful dreams reported friday morning seeing the little ordinary daily life things in places like this fill me with existential dread someone washed that coffee mug set it on the wire rack to dry and then what where did they go are you serious im so glad you shared this i cant wait to read more he said he doesnt remember any colors in particular do you i like the shared dream idea i hadnt thought of that sometimes i wonder if our consciousness have experiences in alternate dimensions while our body is sleeping its as if some really crappy universes were destroyed and yall were all there for the end of those particular times somehow knowing that it wasnt the end of you first of all im sorry youre feeling this way it sounds like youre under a lot of stress and some old wounds are feeling raw its understandable that youd be upset but keep breathing and know that everything is going to be okay the idea behind those dimensional jumping methods is that we can shape our reality if thats true then its not really possible for you to jump into the wrong dimension unless you decide that it is and if you did decide that you jumped into the wrong dimension you could simply jump into a better one are you familiar with the law of attraction its the same general idea but instead of trying to jump straight from one version of your life to another you set the intention to have certain changes come into your life ive had success with both approaches and i think its really just about deciding what you want for yourself and then moving forward with the assumption that your desires are already manifesting if you want to speed up the process then expect the best practice feeling love towards yourself and others and be grateful for everything good in your life no matter how small its pretty mindblowing how many wonderful things you can attract beautiful the number 27 has been my favorite since i was a child it wasnt until i turned 27 that i learned its my grandmothers favorite number as well its a very special number truthfully i dont know what it is i dont really have a belief system about this i just observe correlations and look for patterns and sometimes i notice that the people around me and everywhere i look online seem to be experiencing some very specific things within a 36 hour or so block of time this time around it was people who dont normally remember their dreams having vivid dreams people unexpectedly reconnecting with someone they lost touch with and random good things happening to people if you dont mind sharing what was your dream about im so very sorry about your friend its a sad irony that depression can make us hide away from the very people who love us and are willing to help im sure you meant more to scott than youll ever know do you remember what it was about youre never alone anytime you wanna get stuff off your chest please dont hesitate to pm me i dont judge and id be honored to provide listening ear what the what my husband had that exact same dream heres another one and another mazel tov gay jesus whoa wouldnt it be cool if that plays out in reality its like we got some kind of system upgrade that improved relationships and circumstances did the logo appear yesterday by chance it seems like a whole bunch of people myself included shifted to a better timelineuniverse sometime thursday night this has happened to me before i saw my face morph into the faces of dozens of old women and their faces reflected the emotion i was feeling in that exact moment for example i started to feel anxious and my face became the face of a woman who was anxious her whole life when i calmed down and felt happy i saw the face of a woman who was at peace her whole life i believe its a function of the third eye ancient cultures throughout time were well aware of the abilities of the third eye but in modern times its less common for people to hear about it so when it activates we dont know whats going on the brain is a fascinating and complex machine capable of all kinds of amazing things stay positive and start meditating if you havent already done so youre in for some beautiful experiences im so sorry youre dealing with this my friend it

is calm and happy tell them that you dont understand what changed and that the constant fighting is breaking your spirit be honest and express your feelings with
