personally i dont anticipate a single day in which everything dramatically changes i think thats perhaps a 3d expectationmisunderstanding that crept into the general public because people correctly sense that things are changing and correctly sense that somethings coming but our limited human understanding of time leads us to get excited about it happening all at once but when i think about it in all the billions and billions of years of eternity a few hundred years or so of awakening on a single planet might as well be all at once does that make sense just my perspective and i may very well be wrong as far as the burnout goes i dont think theres anything at all wrong with focusing on the down to earth stuff as long as you are tending to your own well being in fact i think getting too swept away by the spiritual chatter can be a frustration and distraction sometimes because everyones experience and purpose here is different its ultimately about discovering and utilizing your inner voice your light and your mission here and that right there is best done in my experience by drowning out everyone else and just letting your truth arise in its own time i hope that helps and if not thats okay too just know that youre loved and cared for by me and many others and youre doing great one possible interpretation is 54 so the number nine its the number of endings making way for new beginnings i love this and i love you look up the shadow man or the hat man dude is seen all over the world hahaha im glad im not the only one looking around at my life like hang in there i bet well see each other on the other side of this and be like man we had nothing to worry about oh thank you for offering ill gladly take you up on that am i making the right decision moving to tn for a while edit actually just any reading will do i have so many questions about my life that it might be better to leave it openended and see what comes up are you talking about the op or the video i linked your explanation could work for the op but not sure how it would apply to all the footage in my video heres another sky anomaly which to me is even more bizarre really cool whatever it is it is a manmade hypothesis with which he explains away things he does not understand preach i feel the same way about the phrase just a coincidence man its been bananas for me too i havent done a tarot for myself lately but my angel card readings have been pinpoint accurate and yesterday umajorarcanamonk did a reading for me that was super helpful and even echoed some of what my angel cards and dreams have been telling me to a very attentiongrabbing degree ive started documenting the batterytime number synchronicities on my phone for example ill have 33 battery at 1022pm and theyve been off the charts on wednesday i had nine of these syncs and today im already up to four ive also been having really intense dreams mostly about emotional baggage related to money family and other crap im ready to let go of now its not exactly pleasurable but i know its a good thing in the long run the biggest thing im noticing today is a very strong urge to nourish myself i have struggled with disordered eating in the past and even though ive come a long way i still tend to skip meals or just eat a bit of something on the go but today ive been happily going after fruit fruit juice and all the water its nice cant bring me down by awreeoh is one of my favorite jams sample lyrics life is surrounded by signs if youre connected you know happy birthday wow your second paragraph is extremely similar to this remote viewing of mars circa 1 million years bc which was conducted by the cia in the 80s soooo fascinating i dont have any answers for you but i know somewhat how youre feeling i just keep trying to be a light in my day to day life and meditating hoping to be the change i wanna see and all that i have so many questions its hard to choose so either general guidance or why am i feeling unmotivated or is there something i can do to speed up my manifestations dealers choice ha and thank you as always for sharing your gifts here holy cow dude congrats this is all kinds of inspiring thank you so much for sharing your story lord yes a big one i feel like everything is on the line and i dont know what to expect next im gonna be checking in on this thread and sending my comrades at the crossroads lots of abundance vibes with love and light hey same here i first noticed it following me around when i was a kid and similarly adopted it as my favorite number i hope this full moon is transformative for the both of us in all the best possible ways heres 27 stars for you god i hope so i feel like ive been in the throes of labor all summer this gives me hope thank you your weapon against light huh ha this is timely because i just did it before checking in here i woke up before dawn due to a really upsetting nightmare about my current situation i walked into the living room and sat down with my phone opened the music app and asked if i made a mistake if the choices ive made that lead to this situation were a mistake i got three little birds by bob marley woke up this morning smiled with the rising sun three little birds by my doorstep singing sweet songs of melodies pure and true singing this is my message to you dont worry about a thing cause every little thing is gonna be alright i let it play all the way through and the next song on the shuffle was rhapsody in blue which has long been synonymous with adventure to me and i even used to listen to it in the early morning hours the last time i felt like my life was falling apart id kinda forgotten about it fwiw ive had encouraging and helpful messages from music for a long time and personally i dont attribute it to this sam but rather my own angelsguides if you try again it might be worthwhile to ask for communication with only those who come in love and light remindme 6 months i dont want other people to know either but what amazes me is that when i do open up i find that im sooo not alone nearly everybody save for a few very lucky people maybe have needed help from time to time and even wealthy people worry about money because they have loans that are overdue or stocks that crash or because their pal has a bigger summer house lol for me my fears about money are tied up in worrying that i wont spend it wisely once i have it or that ill get cocky and stop caring about people who are struggling or that ill only make enough to get on my feet but i wont be able to sustain it etc basically a lack of trust in the universe that im gonna be okay today and in the far future but im gonna be okay and you are too im gonna set a reminder and well check in with each other in six months i bet well have all kinds of amazing new things to share im in the same boat as you and an affirmation kinda popped in my head a few days ago thats really been helping me money is a tool some need it some dont either way is fine i dont know if that helps but its allowing me to shed some layers of shame and to be okay with needing some support right now and i think that shame and fear is the thing thats been holding me back from going for things i prank called my dad using one of those soundboard sites i was shocked by how completely unimpressed he was like uh huh yeah thats tom hanks voice got it made me see my dad in a different light i guess id never realized hed lived a whole life complete with pranks and shenanigans enough to be bored by my feeble attempt thats adorable i like to keep an open mind so i dont have firm beliefs about this but the one that i been contemplating a lot lately is infinite timelines basically at any given moment were living in one of an infinite number of timelines and shifting into different ones constantly without realizing theoretically then mandela effect glitches maybe even ghost sightings would happen when we shift a little further than usual creating discrepancies in our experience of reality forgiveness takes a lot of strength but its so damn powerful for me it helps to remember that believing that others deserve forgiveness creates a universe in which im worthy of forgiveness too and goodness knows i need it sometimes it also helps me to remember that everyone has their own unique path and its not going to look like mine and thats more than okay once upon a time i mocked people who meditated and now its a huge part of my life i thought everyone else was an asshole for years before realizing that i was just as much of an asshole point is people are going to let us down but it doesnt mean theyll never change and actually being truly kind to them can be the very thing that sets them on the path towards change probably more than youll ever know just my perspective keep what resonates with you and disregard the rest you got it i hope you enjoy your new job same here i remember when it was so tiny and the love and light of it was so unique and still is that it felt really renegade but full of joy like little kids running around playing without adult supervision gosh i love this place me too also the way my 4 year old uses the ipad is so wholesome it hurts she would facetime her friends every day if she could but since other people are sometimes busy she also loves to play roblox with me and her dad learn how to do magic tricks color by numbers and fire up some tunes for impromptu dance parties i dont know why people think its an eitheror situation she loves being outside reading books painting going places technology is just an extension of the things she enjoys its not at all a replacement some say horizontal stripes are unflattering but i think he looks very handsome one time my husband and i took our two little ones on the train to downtown we got off the train one of us holding the 3 year old and the other pushing the baby stroller and walked past a guy who said look at that dad of the year right here i just had to laugh thats so thoughtful of you i dont know what teens are into these days but i think anything you do will be appreciated maybe a gift card to the neighborhood pizza place or a little themed gift basket like for for a family moviegame night i think we exist in a stream of infinite timelines and for whatever reason they are merging and collapsing at an increasing rate so theoretically the moment you remembered playing that game with
