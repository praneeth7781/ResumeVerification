opinion that our brains are naturally wired to do all kinds of cool things were mostly unaware of im so sorry youve been going through some hard times please dont hesitate to pm me anytime you want to talk i know how sometimes it can be easier to open up to a random stranger than a loved one and im here for ya anytime and the same goes for anyone else who happens to read this i relate to your post ive had two life changing experiences the first coming from a place of despair crying out for a reason to live and suddenly knowing that love is the answer to life the second was like yours in that i saw the source it was pure love and i recognized that i was a part of it and so was everything else so for me these are the things i know im open to a lot of ideas and i enjoy the search for the truth but im not in any hurry to believe much else i figure that if something is true it will eventually hit me like a ton of bricks the way those other realizations did another floor sleeper here hmm i wonder if this is a common tendency for people like us my sleep last night was normal but saturday night was bananas i went to bed like normal but i seemed to linger in a meditative state for hours i kept experiencing lucid moments of processing things id just been shown by my subconscious i guess like id be semiasleep and fall into a negative thought pattern of thinking defensively then whatever was talking to me would draw my attention to the way it was pulling me into a lower vibe and exactly where on my body it was creating tension i realized that i fall into these defensive thinking patterns all the time for no real reason thats just a sample of the things i realized that night its never happened to me before but it was very helpful even if i was tired yesterday has anyone else experienced this good to see you again yes exactly i had this experience on an airplane recently i was walking down the aisle holding my baby boy and i locked eyes with a guy who i instantly recognized though im sure ive never met him in this life it was bizarre we couldnt stop staring at each other then the man in front of him hit his head on the overhead compartment i winced my buddy laughed and i walked on by to find my seat i did a past life regression recently in which i saw myself as a little girl running around and playing chase with my soulmate who is my husband in this life and then he was just gone i guess he moved away i dont know but i never saw him after we were about seven years old i went on to live a very sad life i sought casual sex and trying to look like jayne mansfield to feel good about myself and married an older man for financial security i was miserable and never came close to any kind of spiritual awakening then i died and i was a little ball of light hovering around my body for a time until i finally realized i was free and i took off zipping all over the world seeing sights like the eiffel tower then i saw myself in front of the source and i was playing chase with another little ball of light that i knew was my husband in this life we were so happy to be reunited its sad that i was alone in that life but i see how many lessons i learned that prepared me to meet him and be with him in this life i was born with the innate sense that being able to marry my soulmate would bring me more happiness than i could ever have by living in a big house or having designer clothes even though i wasnt exactly taught that when i met my husband i was drawn to him immediately the first night we ever spent together was the night of hurricane katrina and he had called to make sure i was okay i was alone and worried about my family who were right in the path of the storm so he invited me over we fell asleep on his living room floor just staring into each others eyes i didnt believe in past lives at the time but the feeling that wed known each other for a long time was overpowering i dont know why i felt compelled to write you all that but there it is lol my grandparents had this exact one printed and framed in their house when i was a kid thanks for the warm fuzzy throwback feels that was weird i havent checked the schumann in several days then suddenly felt the urge to check it a few minutes ago i guess my subconscious recognizes the feeling now dont let your looks stop you if you feel its something youd like to do babies love being snuggled up in big arms source have had two babies both seem to prefer being held by our guy friends and the bigger the better agreed of course but i think op took a cab it would be interesting to know if it seemed like a normal trip to the driver try to be detailed as possible and include any emotions you felt to get a good interpretation the subconscious is strange in that it will put important parts of the dream in what seem like unimportant details if you want to go into detail about one of the ones that was really vivid and memorable let me know and im happy to help you figure it out edit btw i dont need to know private details like names or anything just any other things you can remember awesome its so very helpful for unlocking your emotional conflicts the subconscious mind is so interactive its incredible sometimes ill help someone with their dream symbols and the following night my dream will borrow a symbol from their dream to illustrate how i feel about something in my own life and once you begin to consciously process your dreams its like the subconscious starts working overtime to help you grow its so creative too this morning i woke up with a little poem running through my mind on repeat you shall know thyself and thine inner self this is my gift to you you shall know thyself and thine inner self and then know others too you got it and for anyone else interested pm me anytime and rest assured that i dont judge i enjoy helping people interpret their dreams if you feel like sharing do you feel like youve been forced into something lately or like someone is trying to make be you more like them rape dreams are often about feeling a loss of control it may or may not be about your dad but its almost definitely not about sex sorry this happened to you obviously quick question though why dont you just give them the message yourself where is this whole forced reincarnation belief coming from im open to the idea of reincarnation but this particular flavor just tastes really off to me like a disinformation campaign or something anyway it goes against the entire nature of higher beings to force anyone to do anything i have some experiences and have read the experiences of countless other people and theres no reason to be afraid the event isnt postponed its ongoing and has been for several years its the thinning of the veil that has kept us from being able to see the true and beautiful nature of our universe and ourselves which is why so many people have been experiencing glitches and the overwhelming feeling like something bigger is going on again theres no reason to be afraid and discord headquarters should consider integrating meditation practice into their lives this is awesome youve brought up some things ive thought about as well as some things ive never considered im not a lucid dreamer so what got me thinking about this possibility was when my dreams suddenly started to fall into two very distinct categories the first is what i call metaphorical dreams and theyre not linear or anything close to real life the settings and circumstances are wildly different every night and they make no sense as a storyline theyre super useful though because they help me unpack the emotional conflicts i have but the second category started happening just a few years ago and theyre completely different ive only seen three realities but i have been to them countless times at this point to where now i know what universe im in as soon as i arrive im still married to my husband in all of them but we have no children irl we have two which i dont think we would want to have children in these realities because theyre dangerous and shitty places its like the same universe as this one and our personalities are the same but everything feels much more hopeless and frightening almost postapocalyptic like one time my husband was almost killed for his crappy bike and it felt scary but also like it happened all the time thats just about the only significant event thats happened though because most of the time were just walking to the car or sitting in the house or talking to friends its like things are so bad that no one has jobs or anything to look forward to and thats the other thing that makes it hard to believe these are just dreams my metaphorical dreams are like alice in wonderland levels of nonsense but these are just so real i experience them in real time and the way wethey feel is so vivid and raw and depressing that its a huge relief to wake up back in this universe i like where youre going with the idea of what our experience of being overtaken might feel like i hadnt thought of that i wonder if it might explain why we feel deja vu as well like maybe we already experienced the moment vicariously in another reality but it wasnt vivid enough to remember when we woke up this theory might also explain deja rvprecognitive dreams like maybe when a universe is very similar to ours random events that happen ahead of time in one show up in the dreams of another one thing thats often noted on rprecognition is that theres usually a detail or two in the dream thats off and if these are closely related alternate universes it makes sense that some of the specifics would be different when i was little i vividly dreamed that both my pet rabbits were attacked and killed by dogs which had never even occurred to me as a possibility before about a week later they were attacked by dogs but only one of them died its one of my earliest memories of knowing the universe is more than it seems thanks for the response i love this stuff cant wait to hear more of your thoughts i got chills reading your post you really get it and yes i think we share many overlaps in experience and tendencies the way you describe the justification for our mental revenge is so apt haha its an ongoing process for me ive made it a long way but i still search my heart sometimes and find various people who i havent yet come to believe are worthy of full understanding forgiveness in meditation a few weeks ago i realized that there were 4 people i was still holding a bitter grudge against because
