mc what about you and yes im definitely used to making changes in my life some of the things ive been through just in the past year i never anticipated happening to me like a divorce sometimes i think that might be part of my growth process learning how to be stable and consistent and enjoy life despite seemingly never being able to be sure whatll happen next yay how do you feel about your sunmoon combo i like it because i think the cap moon helps me stay grounded in reality and keeps the stereotypical pisces laziness under control but sometimes it feels like my feelings are overly filtered out because i wanna analyze them to death before i share them well i definitely relate to my scorpio south node im oddly comfortable with crisis darkness and the idea of just burning it all down about 7 years ago i gave away almost everything i owned and drove out to the desert with no plan except to start over this was before i discovered astrology ha ha and it was right before my saturn return but i can see how it reflected both nodes kind of a south node reaction with north node intentions my mc is in cancer so that combined with my nn signhouse im wondering if my calling is at least in part to be a source of comfort and stability in other peoples time of crisis what about you i have nn in taurus in the 8th house which honestly feels kind of contradictory i can imagine that im meant to focus on taurean qualities like stability comfort followthrough and generally just enjoying life but the 8th house would seem to be the opposite of a lot of that im a pisces sun capricorn moon and libra rising we should be friends did you also feel a libra risingesque fear of displeasing other people by admitting that youre told that youre pretty because i did and still do libra rising and i think i am pretty in a very conventional sort of way none of my facial features stand out as exceptionally good or bad i just have good symmetry i guess im clumsy but that always surprises people once they notice because im told i seem like id be very graceful lol im 54 and weigh about 115lbs so fairly petite i think most of this is aligned with the standard libra rising description except for my height as ive read they tend to be taller than average okay im not arguing with your data as ive yet to see it myself im just saying that your phrasing gives the impression that being gay is unfortunate and even if you dont care about hurting peoples feelings i think youll get a more productive discussion out of this post if you share what youve been researching in a more neutral less negative light saturn just entered my 5th house like 2 weeks ago so my experience is very limited but i feel the sudden urge to buckle down and complete a short film i startedabandoned two years ago whereas new creative ideas arent really coming to me ive also been doing a lot of reflecting about what i really need in a romantic relationship and what im really willing to contribute another thing i think its interesting timing that im stuck with my children almost 247 right now because its made me more aware of what they individually need from me as their mom and a lot of it seems to involve me being more structured planning ahead better etc hopefully you get some more responses im very interested in reading about this from people who have been through it can you give some examples might want to change your wording too lol i think i get what you mean but saying risk of sounds like being gay is a disease or something i assume she means venus in aries maybe venus in scorpio too if going by traditional rulerships depends on what you need us to be whats your rising sign im a libra rising venus in aries and my style is similar what country do you live in check out rprecognition this is a lot more common than you might expect happy birthday same here and i was terrified to grow up i cried a lot when i was getting ready to turn 13 because i felt like i was gonna be a teen and not a kid anymore now im 35 and i guess ive accepted it but if i could be someones kid forever i would lol listen to take a walk on the wild side first then listen to can i kick it and you cant possibly miss it and a tiger saw a man thats funny i had the same recurring dream as a newlywed i think sometimes our brains just run through alternate path scenarios via dreams and your emotions in the dream help you feel what making different choices might have felt like you cant be serious lmao these are babies when i was this age i told my babysitter i was gonna cut off her head i wasnt a future murderer just a little kid copying what i heard disney villains say if you wanna predict adult personalities based on tiny childrens behavior youd have to come to the conclusion that theyre all gonna be psychopaths thatd be great thank you trying to avoid unnecessary trips the grocery store plus having way more time than usual to spend in my back yard definitely has me veggie gardening wish theyd reverse it turning churches into homes even temporarily would do a lot more to help the sick and the poor you know the people jesus said to look after no im kind of the opposite of that if they seem uninterested i lose interest too capricorn moon in the 4th house im cleaning and organizing the shit out of my home and putting together a homeschool plan for my kindergarten and preschool age children hold on by alabama shakes mine also happy birthday birthday twins edit omg a slice of pi award and our bdays are on pi day this is the best ever thank you upoky23 i love you the article is wrong it was actually a single dad banana hes still married but separated while he and his wife try and work out their differences congrats on your new baby boy im sorry you wont have visitors extra sets of hands really help with those newborns but i hope you two enjoy lots of happy healthy snuggle time im here if you wanna talk i dont know if youve ever been miserably sick with the flu before but posting on reddit was probably the last thing on everyones mind and regardless of whether or not the commenters here had covid19 maybe we did maybe we didnt its not at all surprising statistically that out of over a million subscribers half a dozen or so people would have had their worst flu ever in the past few months statistically it probably happened to way more than half a dozen doesnt make us liars just unlucky yeah just lifting a cup of water felt like a physical feat at the time warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info i was too out of it to post anything i honestly for the first time understood how otherwise healthy people could die from the flu but i think i wrote some texts about how at one point my fever reached 104 and i was sleeping so hard i wouldnt have even woken up to take medication if my ex hadnt stayed over to keep watch on me and our kids and checked my forehead in the middle of the night edit oh and i have texts that i sent to my dad a doctor about how to watch for pneumonia bc my kiddos breathing was sounding wheezy interesting i definitely had the worst flu of my life in december and my children caught it and both had some difficulty breathing for a few days maybe a dumb question but would that give us immunity now if it was indeed the same thing alright well i hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend lola asking about specific placements isnt allowed here for some reason its okay on rastrologymemes and raskatrologers though if you wanna repost this i think you might find this post and comments really helpful ahhh yeah that makes sense i think pisces can be a very childlike placement if its not balanced out with some strong earth or fire signs i have a lot of aries which helps and without it id probably be looking for guidance all the time in an effort to feel grounded thats interesting i have mars and venus in aries both in the 7th house which makes me a little relationshipcrazy lol ive had to teach myself to be picky about who i date because if im not careful ill stick with people who arent actually good for me he has a lot of first house placements which do make him a little selffocused but hes definitely a relationship person his venus is in 7th as well and its actually been good for me to be with someone who has his own stuff going on because my pisces tendency to get lost in people is kind of kept at bay im more able to rememberfocus on my goals and personal activities as opposed to other relationships where i got so wrapped up in someone that i lost touch with myself all that to say pisces relationships might work better for you if shes able to accept your individuality and let it encourage her to focus on her own as well id say trust your gut feeling pretty much regardless of placements im so sorry for your loss youre a good sibling you have a lot of signs and often times the sun sign is less relevant to the personality than others for example im a pisces but i have a shit ton of aries in my chart and it shows lol so a lot of the classic pisces descriptions lazy reserved a pushover dont describe me at all put your info in a birth chart calculator and youll get a lot more insight into yourself yes i have a bowl shaped chart and its said that people with this shape often feel incomplete as though the missing half of the chart is felt but not entirely accessible i only started studying astrology last year but looking back at the charts of people ive dated i see now that i have definitely been drawn to guys with heavy taurus gemini leo and virgo placements maybe in part because theyre bringing some of those energies to the table that i dont have a lot of on my own definitely this has been going on for quite a few years think how many apps you have and how many of them could easily be listening with your permission per the terms and conditions i love the 8th house its nothing to be scared of honestly yes it deals with death but also rebirth transformation contracts secrets sex etc if it makes you feel any better my 50 year old boyfriend has some of these placements and hes one of the most welladjusted and lucky mfers i know lol he does have quite a fascination with horror movies though my saturn return was god awful although in hindsight of course i can see how myself and my life is much better because of those trials im at the end of my sade sati and its been really rough and just as lifechanging but not nearly as heartbreaking as the
