so afraid of not being believed so my heart really really goes out to you knowing how much not being believed just adds to the trauma of it all i believe you and im so sorry that happened to you please dont think that because you didnt force her off that you are to blame in any way response to trauma is automatic and we dont really get to consciously choose between fight flight and freeze i froze when i was coerced into sexual abuse as a teen and for a long time i felt shame about it but i shouldnt and neither should you could be a past life memory i have a few questions that would help with interpretation whos house is it are you in the same house every time or does it change what about the locations are you in the living room basement etc are there any patterns in which part of the house the attackers come through where is your glowworm now seems like theres quite a few of us i hope its symbolic like of an era in a spiritual sense also funny sync that you responded to me just now bc i was literally just thinking about you you wrote me some very kind encouraging words during a rough patch a few years ago and im forever thankful weird my boyfriend and i both had vivid dreams last night in his dream he lost his job and his house burned down in my dream my house was being torn apart an apocalyptic storm and my son was terribly injured theyre in the very late degrees of capricorn right now and by the 21st of this month theyll be in aquarius what are you listening to same here i miss being able to look at the houses im sorry when you say everybody else who do you mean hey congrats i got off mine about 3 years ago and im so glad i did i learned that the meds were putting a damper on my positive feels too not just the negative ones so while i might have some moments once in a while of feeling much sadder than i would on meds i also get to experience a lot more excitement love happiness etc every day btw i highly recommend taking st johns wort herbal supplements if you can theyre cheap otc nonaddictive and as effective as some ssris at curbing depression anyway whats a song youve listened to lately whats the weirdest food order youve ever gotten well the fact you skate tells me that you arent too lazy to move your body you know how to get back up when you fall and you like to learn new things keep it up you can apply the same energy to other things now and in the future well maybe you just havent found out what makes you feel alive yet school is great but its not everything and failing definitely doesnt make you a loser what do you do when youre not being productive what makes you think youre a loser i see i dont know if it will require a harness or not then but maybe is that something that youre worried about gah thats messed up i wonder if theres any kind of loans for stuff like this that would have lower payments im uninsured right now and thankfully my health is good but yeah its scary how fast medical debt can pile up here in the states and youre welcome im always here if you want to chat or vent or just need some encouragement youll see the other side of this someday and in the meantime be kind to yourself im so sorry for everything youre going through thats a lot why do you have to come up with the money in just two days im sorry this happened to you thats awful you deserve better people in your life and i hope you find them im not sure theres different types of buses but usually they dont have harnesses i relate to this i was raised in an uberconservative environment i literally only knew of two people in my hometown who were openly liberal lol and it wasnt until my midtwenties that i felt safe expressing just how different my views are now if i can offer some advice when you do start talking about it be as calm and as humble as you can im amazed how open minded people can be when they dont feel like they have to defend themselves using phrases like i was surprised to learn or something ive been thinking about lately really helps i think it will also help a lot that you are interested in doing things differently and what you would like to see in a new political party the whole democrats vs republicans thing is so toxic and it gets people all worked up but by approaching it from a neutral perspective and making it about new ideas you can really help people open their mind even if they dont admit it to you are you trying to decide whether you want to try it lol i get that what part of history are you learning about rn i hope you enjoy the new program im sure it will be a cool and safe experience do the people around you know that you no longer agree with those views or are you keeping it quiet for now if they know how did they respond whats one thing youd change about your life right now if you could im afraid have massively different perspectives on this my friend i can see how you feel im being obtuse because you seem obtuse from my perspective but were not were just on very different pages and thats okay you are fully entitled to your perspective and i wish you well they could share that wealth to an enormously powerful beneficial extent if they chose to but they choose not to if youre a part of my company supply chain whatever and you help me earn 20 dollars and then i keep 1999 for myself and gift you with a penny i have generated wealth for you doesnt mean i am a great person doing great things for you im a selfish dick capitalizing off your work and reaping the benefits they are not generating immense wealth for anybody but themselves and their shareholders instead of murdering a dozen or so people serial killer style they are in possession of millions of wage slaves who must grind away for decades just to hopefully have food shelter and healthcare that is not productive use in my book not at all of course and btw i think the story of your friend giving you the crystal is so cool those spiritually intuitive kinda friends are a blessing i dont think its idiotic at all i think its really cool that theyll share those placements and i bet they will have a lot of understanding for each other as they grow up i was curious too so i found this tldr he said he wanted to save the government money by hiring his own security team as others have already mentioned thats not a good astrology app but in addition i think they have some kind of listening capability builtin because their do and dont keywords have been way too accurate for me more than once when i was redecorating my front porch i got front porch as a do for the day another time i was asking my boyfriend if we had any parchment paper and parchment was one of my dos the next day thats not astrology thats spying lol i have the same theory the whole jesus as messiah storyline is remarkably similar to much older mythological origin stories including the virgin birth and coming back from the dead and its paul who flipped all the stuff jesus said about helping the poor on its head and said instead if a man doesnt work he shouldnt eat actually paul flipped just about everything jesus said around and christians believe what paul says jesus uh meant to say far more than they believe what jesus actually said christianity is 100 a religion of paul jesus the man would have wanted nothing to do with it taxpayers are already footing the bill for their being arrested sentenced jailed on probation etc treating it as an addiction rather than a crime might very well end up being cheaper and actually help people but we will see agree withu2muckingfuch that this will serve as a good test run either way i like you youre smart i think the democratic party has utterly failed to address the most important issues facing americans and frankly im not convinced those at the top level care one bit except for bernie of course theyd rather go hog wild combatting fringe issues and demonizing anybody who supports trump than look at themselves critically in 2016 i wrote a mildly critical comment about hillary on a liberal site and got nasty hateful messages for weeks and i even said in my comment that i do not at all support trump theres this selfrighteous fuck everybody who disagrees attitude among democrats that is gonna be the death of them if they dont change im like you still figuring out my politics but socialism seems to be the best way forward for us imo but like uapi is saying we have to start by putting up a candidate who will earnestly address the very legitimate concerns of the american heartland and stop being so damn unwelcoming to anyone who isnt already on our side at the end of the day humans just want to feel like theyre safe and cared for trump obviously makes people feel that way and while i dont understand why i do understand how the left makes them feel unsafe and unwelcome definitely look into wing chun according to legend it was created by a woman which is pretty cool im a small person as well and i dont like violence so the approach of training primarily to disableescape from attackers appealed to me i wish more people understood this i really hope youre right my friend conservatives say its all soros liberals say its all koch bros andor putin i think the truth is probably all of the above and much more were merely puppets on the string of the super wealthy being manipulated into turning on each other so we dont look up and realize were all being swindled by the same forces anybody who thinks the billionaires on their side are actually on their side are painfully naive its an illusion if we united as a people wed be too powerful for their absolute greed to continue going unchecked as it has been for decades and thats their worst nightmare i really truly think that this civil war narrative is being pushed into the conversations of both sides by an outside source theres major world powers that would have a lot to gain by americans being so divided against each other i have dear loved ones on both sides and nobody i know irl wants bloodshed online though i see it brought up more and more by both sides equally and both sides seem convinced that they have no choice because the other side is already planning on it i dunno maybe im paranoid but it all just feels very orchestrated for sure then again it could just as well be about anger youre actually feeling towards him but its just being illustrated in a satirical and overthetop kinda way dreamland is a very symbolic and metaphorical place and the details matter for example the computer keyboard the sloppy food they both mean something specific about something in your life that is or has made
