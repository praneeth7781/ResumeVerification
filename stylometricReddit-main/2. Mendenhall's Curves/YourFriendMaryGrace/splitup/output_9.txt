stuff i went through with saturn return the flight attendant said i want this lady off my flight and then the woman started apologizing saying she was really stressed out etc no worries i was actually responding to unettlepunk about his capricorn date but re your post im dating a leo guy and id say your best bet is just hype him up with genuine compliments often and carry on like it never happened next time something embarrassing happens to you maybe tell him about it for laughs so he remembers embarrassing things happen to everyone im a pisces and i listened to under the bridge obsessively in high school so i could feel all the feels i really want to know what happened now i love this decoding my toddlers mystery phrases is one of my favorite things about having a toddler lol i felt like a genius when i finally figured out boocoos was blues clues lykeen was lightening mcqueen etc he looks unwell but someone showed methis clip of him dancing with little kids and its pretty damn cute so im pulling for him i can definitely understand taking issue with him as a psychiatrist proposing that conclusion but he is far from the only one the cia did some fascinating research on the topic of consciousness that particular link is a rather dense read but its really fun to ponder all the potential implications if youre into that kinda thing first of all thanks for engaging in convo with me respectfully secondly im not looking to convince you or anyone to believe one way or the other i do want to say though that a lot of the children remembered random people who the parents couldnt have known about and in some cases they recalled correct details that were not publicly available information also for his consciousness theories he rely on theories of quantum physics quantum mechanics theories which is not the same as pseudoscience but i acknowledge that the birthmarks could be coincidence some kids remembered incorrect details etc again believe what feels right to you and be as skeptical as feels right to you im open to the idea of reincarnation but mostly in the camp of who the fuck can ever really know how this crazy universe works thats a depressing yet empowering thought lol on the one hand i dont wanna be a bug but on the other hand now i feel like a badass for making it to the mammal level at least once fuck yeah im a mammal lotta possibilities like maybe their past lives were on other planets or maybe not everyone is reincarnated or maybe our consciousness spends time elsewhere before returning to a physical body so theres not extra people right now just a lot more here at one time than usual edit could also be that we reincarnate as creatures sometimes if so i would like to be a bear next time because annual hibernation sounds awesome i think youd enjoy reading dr jim tuckers research hes a actually continuing another u of virginia school of medicine psychiatristresearchers work dr ian stevenson so their combined collection of data from children who have past life memories spans decades most children lose these memories by age 7 or so theyve matched soooo many childrens memories with real life people its nuts interestingly most often the remembered deaths are traumatic or sudden in nature so lil suicide baby in the meme fits right in lol just let him go i definitely understand the need for closure but some people just arent willing to have the conversation and hes pretty clearly unwilling you deserve to be with someone who wants to be with you so put your focus on that and try not to take it personally lots of great people out there will want exactly what you have to offer dreams of having a baby are usually to do with birthing a project or a part of yourself something like that similarly a miscarriage dream can be about something that you maybe planned on or started working on that ended for whatever reason but you were happy about it so if theres something you startedended around 2 months ago that you feel good about it ending its likely symbolizing that rather than an actual miscarriage dream interpretation is tricky with strangers because you dont have any idea whats going on in the dreamers life and feelings that may be symbolized but hopefully that helps you get started whenever youre listening youre really just quietly wondering how long until you can talk about yourself some more aww yay no problem im so glad it was helpful best of luck to you and your boyfriend i see what you mean now thank you for clarifying and youre right i dont disagree i just wanted to point out that there are more legit options than say costar for example and for someone like me and presumably op who still has a lot to learn its kind of nice to have something simple to start with not all astrology apps are social media based and some of them are remarkably indepth timepassages has over 70 aspects just for my birth chart with most of the descriptions being multiple paragraphs long including less known aspects like biquintile and asteroids like juno their synastry is just as indepth but you do have to pay for the individual additional charts you sound a lot like me and my boyfriend im a pisces sun cap moon and hes a leo sag moon its been about a year for us as well and we are really compatible if you can get the app timepassages and pay 99 cents for his chart youll be able to use their compare charts feature which is awesome the most thorough and accurate synastry reading ive found it spelled out what makes us compatible really well and even explains the challenges in a helpful hopeful way heyyy you have the same placements as my little 3 year old boy got any parenting advice for me if you can find out his birthdate you can find out his moon sign venus north node and more which will be far more helpful than going by the sun sign alone im a pisces with a leo boyfriend and those two signs are supposedly incompatible but its a really lovely relationship for lent im giving up a little bit of work to work on my life not a bad idea actually nodal returns squares and reverses never miss me lol you can read the timing and descriptions here i grew up in america but this one makes me sad too i feel like humans are meant to live in community and sharing taking care of each other but instead we isolate ourselves and just schedule time to not be alone once in a while im a pisces with a leo boyfriend sometimes our love languages arent exactly aligned like he loves spoiling me with gifts and taking me to nice restaurants and stuff which is very appreciated but id be just as happy smoking a bowl whilst wearing jammies and talking about our childhoods lol im a very affirming person though which works well with his need for praise and i love his physically affectionate nature our senses of humor are pretty compatible too i think if id met him earlier in my life i wouldnt have appreciated our differences nearly as much as i do now it took a long time for me to realize that being super similar to my partner doesnt actually work out too well for me edit another interesting thing is that according to the synestry of some other placements we have we should be butting heads a lot and having to reign in our tempers but i have never had such a peaceful gentle relationship before and when we do have issues were able to talk a them out in a really empathetic and loving way which again may come down to having met at the right time what was your experience like with this combo im a pisces and my baby daddy is an aries we have a 5 year old gemini and a 3 year old scorpio i like to think our parenting styles provide a wellrounded balance but i dont know pluto and saturn making squares oppositions and sextiles to practically everything in my chart lol basically the last two years have been an unending journey watching of everything i used to think would never change changing including my marriage got divorced this past summer doing my best to sit with the uncertainty of it all and trust that greater fulfillment and selfrealization are on the other side aww lol they were giggling so much as they signed it i wondered if they were writing crazy stuff but i guess they were just happy to be signing it thank you thank you this was sad but i enjoyed reading the details thank you for sharing if you dont mind sharing how do you feel about relationships in your current life at a theater where artists are allowed to sign the walls backstage a bunch of teenage performers wrote this and id love to know what it says mr rogers for pisces sensitive gentle guy who lived to make people feel loved and empathized with he had a 29 pisces sun with moon mercury and venus in pisces too lol wow til never really looked into these before but i just looked it up and my life has definitely shifted dramatically right on schedule with these returnsreverse returns no idea we lived there for 3 years and never heard anything like that before or after birth chart and transit chart so very grateful for any input at all i can offer dream interpretation in return this happened to me and my ex one time when we were the only ones in the house two really loud knocks on the bathroom door the only place i have gemini is my chiron but feel like i relate to gemini the most of any sign could be my partners north node is my sun sign and we have the rare and exceptional pattern it specifically says that being together supports the person hes becoming im a cap moonpisces sun and i feel things very strongly but i wont reveal my feelings until im ready which isnt often and i can only talk about my feelings to like 3 people and even then its usually after ive ruminated over it and tried to feel better on my own for a long time i set mine for desired nap length approx how long i think it will take me to fall asleep 10 minutes because it always takes me longer than i think it will i can relate as i have a pisces suncap moon but im learning to appreciate the beauty of being able to deeply empathize with people without getting swept up in whatever is going on with them and that i can have my head in the clouds and my feet on the ground at the same time i would definitely pass on the message even if anonymously like usubfootlover suggested who knows maybe this message could spur an awakening in her that would lead her to change her ways in my experience youll only remember the things youre ready to see i had a deeply uncomfortable feeling of dislike almost hatred for a very minor celebrity on a show i used to watch even though i had no conscious or logical reason why years later id mostly forgotten about him but then i started thinking about him again at random times and feeling so uncomfortable i tried past life regressions many times before eventually seeing flashes of a life in which he was my horrifically abusive uncle now of course
