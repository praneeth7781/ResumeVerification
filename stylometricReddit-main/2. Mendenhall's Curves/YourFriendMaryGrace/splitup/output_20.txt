a few months ago which is about an experience i had which blasted my last remaining christian ideals about god out of the water well except for the god is love part that part absolutely still rings true but thats just me ultimately you have to find the truth for yourself and you may discover something different think about it symbolically and what barbie might represent to you subconsciously if you liked playing with them as a kid maybe its a symbol of carefree childhood joy thats just out of reach or maybe its about trying to live up to a certain image or standard of beautylifestyle and feeling like other people do it better does that help dreams are most often symbolic and the subconscious attaches or in this case doesnt attach emotion accordingly so in this dream id guess that its really about killing some part of yourself associated with that person as a way to grow for example maybe your mom has been a little too pushy about your career choices a dream about killing her wouldnt need to feel sad because letting go of her input and listening to your own life goals would be a helpful thing for you hope that helps but if not let me know true spirituality and drugs are polar opposites im one of many people who was using a psychadelic when my life changed forever i was going through a really hard time and one night i smoked some weed and was crying out asking the universe god something to give me a reason to live then it hit me like a ton of bricks that love is the answer to life the universe and everything i knew it was true to the core of my being and it set me on a path of awakening that has continued sans drugs for five years now ive had equally profound experiences in sober meditation so i dont mean to imply that drugs are necessary at all just that some of them can and do provide a little window or cheat code into 5d that can spark enormous spiritual growth i sure try to be that kind of person everyone needs help and support sometimes ive been lucky to have people on reddit cheer me up when i needed it and im always glad to pay it forward check out rprecognition this is a very cool and surprisingly common thing gosh that must have been traumatizing im so sorry warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info im really sorry youre dealing with physical disabilities and some bad luck but youre right youre a survivor and you can and will cross the ocean i hope you have a good day too and please feel free to reach out any time i dont know you but i have a feeling youre being way too hard on yourself wanna pm me and we can chat i dont have all the answers but ive hit rock bottom and bounced back to a better place more than once and id be honored to be a listening ear this sounds like a disagreement or misalignment between your conscious and unconscious mind youre consciously creating positive thoughts and so the icky stuff comes out of hiding to be dealt with it sucks but ultimately its a good thing because dealing with the icky stuff will allow you to feel consciously and unconsciously better about yourself try to identify the thoughts and feelings youre having just before the selfhating thoughts pop up chances are youre experiencing shame guilt or some other difficult emotion and thinking i hate myself is a sort of mental escape hatch to avoid processing those feelings once youve identified the trigger face the source of those feelings headtohead and work through them forgive yourself forgive the situations that have hurt you or caused you to hurt others and keep up the positive affirmations i love you hold up what happened with the dead body did you call the police ive had some glitchy stuff happen after doing the two cup method but it was harmless stuff i wouldnt fault yourself for that persons death or your fils job loss unless those occurrences could somehow move you closer to your goals i really doubt theyre related i second ucoolchic101 suggestion though neville was awesome and his method is much more gentle i think our brains subconsciously store just about everything sometimes ill have a random flashback to eating at a certain restaurant or hanging out with an old friend and then when i look back at my journal or a photo i took ill discover that it was exactly a year or many years ago its pretty cool were all a lot smarter than we consciously realize ps happy cake day im far from family too and ime ditching social media has actually made me feel more connected to them i actually have to call or text them which enables us to really talk about our struggles and hopes and stuff rather than the superficial level of interaction via social media i wonder if it would help to have a rprecognition link somewhere visible im fascinated by prophetic dreams and ive had one myself but since theres a whole sub dedicated to them and a lot of the dream posts here are precognitive it might cut down on the quantity if there were a link that being said i do enjoy the dream posts here im sorry friend theyre very lucky to have you around hang in there when my mom wants to listen to a song she just turns on the radio and says lets find it and most of the time she does its like she just knows itll be playing even if its an old song weird i definitely feel like theres an energy shifting tonight but for whatever reason im feeling pretty great everything feels more real somehow like im immersed in the present moment more than usual its interesting how these things hit us differently some of my favorite movies are the ones where the character has a lot of sadness and difficulty to overcome it would be a pretty boring movie if everything was just sunshine and rainbows from start to finish think about harry potter his parents are dead he lives with his emotionally abusive aunt and uncle and his bullying cousin then he gets into a magical school only to find out that teachers apparently hate him and some really powerful guy wants to kill him but thats why we keep watching because we know these challenges are what make it an epic story and its not the end yet its not the end of your story either and i for one would like to keep watching sense of adventure gentle gets excited about stuff willing to consider other peoples perspectives and either change his mind or respectfully disagree ive been married to a man like that for 11 years and hes awesome oops thanks edit your bio made me laugh keep up the okay work please listen to me i know it probably just seems like fun and spooky entertainment to interact with these different energies but it isnt a good idea at all until our technology advances enough to detect other dimensions its almost impossible to know for certain what exactly youre inviting in but regardless its almost certainly bad juju i might get roasted for taking you seriously because a lot of people havent had the experiences weve had but look theres far more power and beauty in the love and light kind of energy and it offers real love and protection far better than whatever bullshit a is peddling you need to get rid of the tools youve been using and issue some firm but loving commands to them go away and repeat as needed and if youre still spiritually curious and i hope you are check out subs like rsoulnexus or rastralprojection or rluciddreaming and seek out some positive metaphysical experiences theyre much more fun i promise what can you remember about them are there any recurring themes the subconscious mind tends to create nightmares in effort to help you consciously process emotions that you may be suppressing i had nightmares nearly every night for years until i learned how to understand what they were telling me im happy to help you with this if you feel like sharing youre welcome to pm me as well the first lecture is just a long rambling monologue and its impossible to tell whether or not what theyre saying should go in your notes think about what the old man might represent within yourself for example a dream about killing a greedy person might mean youre trying to be more generous does that help theres nothing wrong with wanting to be around people im not an extrovert by any means but too much alone time makes me feel crazy and kinda sad after a while i think its good and even important to get out of the house and talk to people we have a light to shine after all and dont do what i did and carry on for ages assuming that youre alone im amazed at how many people i meet that are every bit as awake as i am uber drivers homeless people baristas theres a lot of people waking up and have been for a while just gotta give them the space to feel like they can open up in the meantime im always here if you want to chat just to clarify i didnt mean to imply that 1010 bullies were bullied as well though i did say most ime kids and grownups who truly feel good about themselves and their place in the world tend to want others to feel good too and sadly the reverse tends to be true also at any rate you sound like a wonderful teacher and im very glad that lil guy found his way to you sure seems likely to me im so sorry about your pup i hope youre able to take the time you need to grieve sometimes i find that just listening to a sad song really leaning into the feelings id typically try to avoid like sadness and letting myself have a good hard cry makes a big difference this typically represents a situation where youve felt you had to kill some aspect of yourself for example maybe the loved one you strangled is a very funny person irl that would mean youve had to stifle your sense of humor lately does that help i love you with all of the hearts i bought a day pass to the swimming pool for myself and my kids so my life will have a lot more chlorine and floaties im in consider how you should act with young children saying i love you every time they misbehave would be a terrible thing to do to them and it would be deeply and genuinely unfair to the other kids who may be suffering at the hands of unchecked bullying far be it from me to tell you how to parent but in my personal experience as a parent and teacher i have found the opposite to be true when my 4 year old yells at me responding to her with love and compassion is absolutely the most effective way to help her see that shes wrong i used to try and oneup her by being very stern tough love and all that but it only served to create more anger and frustration ive learned that by responding with love and compassion shes infinitely more willing to listen to what i have to say apologize and do better as far as bullies go 1010 times they are acting out
