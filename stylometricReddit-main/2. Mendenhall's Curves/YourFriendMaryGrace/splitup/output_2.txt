and its not worth it coming back to add congrats on getting sober and pulling your life together again that takes enormous strength and im proud of you now boot him lol oh my bad im not sure why i thought it was it sounds like she might not even be aware of why shes getting triggered but even if she is aware the fact that she wont communicate her issue is all the more reason to try and not let it affect you too much at any age but at your age especially relationships are about learning and growing and getting to know yourself better dont let her weirdness throw you off and make you overthink something thats making you happy thats odd i wonder if deep down shes feeling sadweird about the fact that youre in your first relationship and just trying to slow it down for her own comfort at 4 months its perfectly normal to talk every day you could try asking her if shes got any concerns but at the end of the day only you can decide whats best for you in this relationship i hope op sees this i feel so bad for him well regardless shes definitely into you and i think you should ask her to hang out sometime absolutely do not keep him around kick him out change the locks and never speak to him again he ruined your life once and hell do it again narcissistic people almost always have an addiction of some kind and they will bleed you dry of your time energy and money for as long as you let them who cares that hes attractive i promise you youd be a billion times better off with a healthy happy partner who is less attractive than this mess of a person do not fool yourself into thinking you can help him or that youre his best chance to selfimprovement narcissists love it when you think youre the super special person that can save them because it incentives you to keep trying hes not going to change no matter what you do it sounds like its way too early for either of you to really know how you feel besides that you like each other and want to see where it goes so im not sure what your question is from what youve shared here shes 100 into you she was probably hoping for more than just what when she said shed kiss you so she took it back if shes shy then youre probably gonna have to make the next move aww man my heart goes out to you friend i can tell that you take things very seriously when it comes to how you behave and treat others you are not a horrible person by any means your intentions were misguided but honorable i think you already know this but your definition of love is very skewed love is not about putting your own needs and feelings aside and suffering in silence not at all in fact you can only love others to the degree that you love yourself i gather that it might be challenging for you as you tend to intellectualize more than you feel but try to really offer yourself as much love and respect and forgiveness as you can throughout all this youve already been selfharming by way of ignoring your own needs dont double down on it by shaming yourself for the fallout if you can get into therapy i think it would be really helpful and definitely try reading some books on healthy relationships so you have a better understanding about what it means to be a good partner i would highly recommend you stop talking to your ex for a long long time you dont owe her anything and being in contact is only going to confuse you and make it more difficult to move on enjoy life and make your own decisions which is impossible to do in this case because she doesnt even know who she is or how shes going to be just because shes advanced in her career doesnt mean shes advanced on a personal level that can only happen through time and experience you seem like a smart guy i think you already know you need to let this go right not to mention the inherent power imbalance of you having so much more life experience and time to get settled even if youre actively trying to make it even and be fair it wont be and your kids deserve for you to have a partner that is allin for them which it certainly sounds like she isnt in a place to be just the fact that shes looking to settle down because its what her family wants is enough to show you that she still has a ton of growing up and selfdiscovery to do her brain wont be done developing for another 5 years buddy leave her alone for both of your sake you can tell her that you arent ready to try and work on your relationship at this time without closing the door on the future possibility of that the dissolution of her family was very traumatizing for her im sure and we cant always help what triggers us thats not to say that she was right or fair for how she acted at all just that she may not have been in a very stable emotionalmental place at the time give yourself as much time as you need to enjoy your life without the drama and if you find yourself missing her and wanting to work on it reach out if and when you do decide to talk to her be honest about how you felt and how it affected you if shes unwilling to acknowledge that she was hurtful its probably best to move on good luck lifelong friends are very special but remember to look after yourself first youre welcome im proud of you its definitely a process and im still learning alongside you its sad because our natural tendency to be empathetic and helpful and tolerant deserves to be treasured not taken advantage of im hoping for really lovely healthy future partners for the both of us i have also attracted my fair share of abusivestalkery types they are almost always attracted to peoplepleasers because they know that if they push you in just the right way youll give them what they want build up your confidence and your ability to say no decide before you even meet someone exactly what your boundaries are and stick with them the more you know yourself and find your inner strength the more youll repel people like that and going forward limit your interactions with your ex to essential work business only youre welcome i hope the conversation goes well aww man im glad youre at least a little more comfortable but still that sucks dont let the fact that your mom is paying for everything keep you from being upfront about your needs and having a bed is a pretty basic need if she really cares about you having a nice time thats the least she can do and congrats on the wedding i am so sorry youre going through this i dont know of course but its possible he could have attachment issues read up on avoidant attachment specifically but regardless of the reason which you may never know for sure allow yourself plenty of time to grieve the loss of what you had and what you hoped you could have together youre in the hardest part right now and it will get easier i promise i went through something similar and had to learn the hard way to pace myself in relationships because it really does take time to learn how another person operates on a deep level i think that as you heal and grow from this it will get easier to vet future partners and give yourself some time to feel it out before falling too deep there are people out there who will love you just as deeply as you love them i promise another thought if you are able to you could go ahead and go find a couch or something in the house and that will kickstart the conversation in the morning when she finds you no longer on the boat oh my you have every right to be annoyed youre the one being celebrated you shouldnt be sleeping on the floor lol im sorry babe it sounds like its too late to switch it up tonight but in the morning i would tell her that you were really uncomfortable and will need an actual bed for the remainder of the trip if you think she might be argumentative or weird about it then bring it up in the group so that others can help you figure something out its kind of you to not want to hurt her feelings but for the future please know that its perfectly normal and reasonable to tell your partner it makes me uncomfortable to hear about your past partners and experiences i certainly dont want to hear about my partners past lol if you dont see a future with her then i think the sooner you get it over with and tell her the better and i wouldnt advise continuing with the business plan either as that could get messy very quickly definitely bring it up if its bothering you theres a whole range of possibilities he could just be feeling a little down and its affecting his communication style he could have avoidant attachment issues and you guys getting closer triggered him etc try to open up communication and see what he says if you cant get a straight answer from him or he says nothings wrong but then continues to be distant its probably time to walk away good luck that makes my day thank you love ahhhh thank you so much ive been thinking of it like a portal so looking at it through your eyes as a sun or moon adds a whole new perspective and i love it uartisticnoob both those comparisons are making my day thank you guys that means so much to me thank you love this gorgeous love the title too thank you so much thank you so much heres a video showing
