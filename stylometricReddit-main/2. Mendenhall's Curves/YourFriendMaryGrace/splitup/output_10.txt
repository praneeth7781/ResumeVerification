that was not a fun thing to relive but it was actually really helpful for me in working through some issues i had around sex and relationships with men but if id remembered all that earlier i dont think i would have been ready whats interesting too is that i no longer feel that anger or dislike of him anymore at all i actually find it comforting that hes evolved over his lifetimes and is now as far as i can tell a good guy weve probably all been horrible people in the past so whatever you learn from it know that it doesnt define you now im so sorry this happened to your girlfriend shes really lucky to have you in her corner i think a lot of people are intimidated by those who march to the beat of their own drum because theyre unconsciously forced to confront their own conformity like were all incredibly unique at heart but when fitting in is your priority you suppress your own unique qualities and then resent the people who are able to let theirs show i hope that makes sense its something ive thought about a lot as ive dealt with it in my own way keep doing you you sound awesome costar powered by pretentious delusional robots i got caught in that cycle for a while when i was young i didnt have enough selfrespect to leave him but i had enough strength not to do what he said of course its shitty but some people just repeating what they see normalized and havent learned how much better and different a relationship can be my brain went to the same place and i liked it i have taurus in my 8th house as well as ceres in taurus in the 8th what confuses me is that my north node is taurus in the 8th house and the descriptions of having a taurus nn is basically the opposite of the 8th house nn description am i supposed to be embracing comfort and stability or learning to live without it im so sorry you lost your son readingrpastlives might make you feel better my venus is in aries and ive never related to the falls in and out of love quickly thing if i commit to someone its because im hoping it lasts forever my venus is retrograde though so that may have some impact aww well needless to say im a big sag moon fan and yeah the needing space thing took some getting used to because i felt rejected at first but that didnt stop me because my aries venusmars loves the chase lol just curious but have you ever lived with a partner before and how do you handle your need for alone time my two most significant relationships including my ex who i was with for 12 years have been with guys who had a sag moon in the 1st house from my perspective their common themes are loyalty and a deep deep need for autonomy and freedom also both have a very funloving nature i love you i can tell just by looking at you that youre a kind person and i bet youre fun to hang out with too keep being awesome the world needs more people like you ill believe you you might enjoy checking out rprecognition thats so weird but ive read similar stories before so youre not alone what time was it before you blinked vs after thats so beautiful no prob im glad it was helpful the collective unconscious fascinates me too i started learning about it when i was studying dream interpretation and how our subconscious minds use similar themes water emotions for example in dreams to illustrate our deeper feelings i think that and probably many other influences numerical astrological etc probably play a big role in these types of persontoperson coincidences which arent actually coincidental at all take your kiddos with you i drove mine to randomly generated spot in the middle of a suburban neighborhood and there were like 10 deer ambling around it was wild and they loved it never know what you might see i dont have an explanation but id say definitely keep in touch with him you can keep it light and casual and see where it goes maybe youve found each other for a reason if nothing else you know youve got a kindred spirit out there and thats always a blessing in itself if its a metaphorical dream he probably represents a part of yourself that youd like to get reacquainted with or theres something about him that youd like to be more like think about his qualities and if theres anything about him you particularly admired could also be a glimpse into an alternate timeline as a latenights working mom of a 3 and 5 year old quiet time is vital to my sanity lol just having even fifteen minutes or so to myself really helps me regroup and keep going what did she keep in there kenan good morning you sexy beast maybe but im glad you did i think i the way i worded that question was a little more bleak than i intended and i agree with you im still healing but its a process of getting happier and happier and a lot of my healing has happened through metaphorical dreams like these because they help me identify what im feeling on an unconscious level which is why your question caught my eye thank you for the thoughtful response do you also feel like you went through hard times that dramatically decreased your capacity for joy to this day because thats where i think my shitty disney world dreams come from i have recurring locations but what happens there varies theres a ridiculously large mostly empty church that i wander around in sometimes a postapocalyptic disney world where everything is shitty and unsafe but its the best we can do i only date people who are mature enough to value the content of someones character over the color of their skin one of the past life memories i have is of being a woman who died in the 1960s with no spiritualreligious beliefs at all i floated above my hospital bed and just kind of hovered there for a long time before i realized that i wasnt obligated to stay in the room with my body lol after that i zipped around the world and saw things id always wanted to see like the eiffel tower before eventually making my way up to the clouds and beyond to start the betweenlives process which is a long way of saying that i think some souls need time to process the experience of not having a body or they simply arent ready to cross over because of fear or the feeling of unfinished business in this realm and thats probably where a lot of ghost sightings come from edit i dont attribute all spiritual entities to this sort of thing though i think energy good and bad can manifest in this realm all kinds of ways and theres probably an untold number of extradimensional beings passing through at any given time that we cant fully perceive on this planet ps i was raised christian as well welcome to the wonderful world of following your own path wherever it may take you a shuttle cock for bad mitten sounds like the title of a whimsical porn written by a childrens book author my boyfriend has never said i love you to me even though ive said it to him many times hes incredibly kind and affectionate and generous and thoughtful which makes me feel loved but not hearing it is really starting to hurt i wrote about mine here i went to school with someone who is getting fairly well known as a comedian a few people found her annoying but most people including me thought she was funny i guess its still a little surprising just because so few people actually make it in the entertainment industry and she did it i think the idea that anyone can be a bad dancer is silly just move your body in whatever way feels good to you whether alone or with people those who make fun probably just wish they were brave enough to dance its never too late to turn things around geraldo i said no one of either gender should be forced into killing being killed didnt expect that to be an offensive statement how about the kind of equality where no one of either gender gets forced into killingbeing killed on behalf of some rich dudes my moon is in capricorn and i feel like im good at stepping up to the plate for other people not so much for myself lol definitely feel guilty about my irresponsibility on a daily basis but guilt doesnt seem to motivate me so im trying to be more selfaffirming yes been getting a normal amount of sleep at night yet feeling desperate for naps and caffeine just to get through the day way more dreams than usual too this article is really fascinating to me they talk extensively about the pole shift and estimate the number of smaller circular structures similar to this one to be in the millions but for more indepth reading you might find this and this interesting english explorers who discovered the ruins in the late 1800s found it inhabited as is illustrated in the picture i linked above and documented some of the things locals said about it i think it would be super awkward at first and yes painful for a while but personally i believe the vast majority of people are really good at heart and so much of the pain we cause each other is really because we ourselves are confused afraid and hurting and that telepathy would ultimately bring us closer together in a new way because wed be able to feel the pain thats causing people to act the way they do and maybe even inherently understand the source of their pain and the feeling of being understood and empathized with would change peoples lives for the better i think thered still be factions but it would be a much more massive yet simpler twosided one of good vs evil instead of the everymanforhimself sort of world we live in now but im just speculating of course thanks for reading i have had mixed results sharing this with people in real life so its nice to be able to talk about it and not feel like im coming across as crazy haha its weird i feel a deep sense of tragedy and loss looking at pictures of the ruins and if really it was an accident that shifted the poles and caused us to lose telepathy that really would be a great tragedy to be able to communicate and empathize seamlessly and effortlessly and then suddenly everything changes for everybody in an instant and nobody understands why misunderstandings uncertainty about peoples motivations and so much more would be a problem for the first time and our resulting sense of being alone in the world would be so painful to experience all at once and if that is what happened it makes sense that there would be factions and people would start splitting up into tribes and inventing their own way of communicating like in the story of the tower of babel edit another interesting thing about these ruins is that theyve discovered hundreds of much smaller versions of it covering a wide area around it as though the people who built it were experimenting and working their way up to the big one and it doesnt make sense as a fortress or city walls or a place for livestock or really any of the things we associate with ancient human lifestyles i
