you should be doing what makes you feel good and he should love you as you are its weird that hes mad about this if he likes seeing you dressed up thats cool but he should give you a chance to get dressed up for something that makes sense like a nice dinner not football lol im sorry one night stands might not be a good idea for you personally im demisexual so i only feel sexual attraction if i also feel a deep emotional connection so i never do random hookups bc i know its unhealthy for me emotionally not saying its the same for you but its clear that you are having very strong feelings towards someone who doesnt feel the same way you cant change how he feels you can only try and move forward and avoid this situation in the future right im kind of astonished that the words trophy violent and blackmails are all being used to describe the same person you are capable of having a healthy happy relationship even if it didnt work out for your mom she probably means well but shes misguided in thinking that all marriages end horribly lol you have to live your own life and make the choices that are right for you a lot of manipulative people will try and keep the upper hand by always making you feel like youve messed up and you need to make it right the fact that he packed up and left over this is so extreme im embarrassed for him lol hes not trying to believe you that you mean no harm because it benefits him to act like youre the bad guy youre gonna lose your mind if you try and make it work with him run no amount of beauty is worth being physically abused and manipulated over shell only get worse i promise you youll be 10x happier with someone who is sane loving and would never dream of hurting you on purpose i dont feel like its that simple for this long of a relationship it kinda is though whether youve been together for a month or a decade the fact that his family does not support your relationship and not only excludes you but actively tries to replace you is a huge problem clearly hes not able to make them cut it out completely and respect your relationship together hes trying to toe the line between pleasing you and them but thats not possible because theyre opposed to you being around at all i know its hard but please consider if this is what you want for your future because they wont change and it will be a continual source of tension and hurt exactly i had an ex boyfriend who used this exact method to try and warm me up to abuse repeatedly caused pain and then act like he meant no harm and i was overreacting by not liking it he will escalate it as much as he can op and in any case if a partner sees you setting boundaries as a problem you gotta go i absolutely know how you feel im working through multiple heartbreak traumas as well and its difficult but worth it for me personally its been really helpful to just stop dating completely for the time being and focus on my healing youll know when youre ready to get back out there hugs can you please give some examples of him needling poking the bear its hard to get a read on the situation without more context if you feel yourself getting angry do you walk away from the conversation to cool off yes that is very manipulative for sure thats emotional abuse on top of the physical abuse im very glad you got away from him now you know to walk away at the first sign of someone not respecting your boundaries because if theyll do it once theyll do it again worse and worse big hugs to you im proud of you for getting away and learning from it im so sorry this happened to you im concerned that you feel bad about threatening to punch him in that scenario please know that if youre ever in that situation again you need to do what you need to do to get away punch him in the face balls whatever you can your friend is the one whos fake af if shes taking his side keep them and people like them out of your life thats really sad for her im so glad shes in therapy her innocence was taken away at a very young age due to that exposure and she needs support be a listening ear empathize with her and be supportive of her going to therapy and working through the trauma healing is very much possible and it sounds like shes doing what she can it sounds like shes testing the waters looking for a replacement for her actual boyfriend unless thats what you want id definitely let her know that you need her to back off try and pace yourself breakups are traumatizing and it can take a long time to recover and really start thinking clearly again theres nothing wrong with having feelings but id advice against acting on them or even trying to sort out what youre feeling towards her until youve had a few months to heal from the break up youre allowed to feel how you feel porn is highly addictive and he may have a problem if thats a deal breaker for you thats completely fine and nothing you should feel bad about talk to him about it and see how he responds dont feel bad about how you feel or try and pretend to be cool with it if youre not yeah and im sure that was difficult to deal with since youre only trying to help try and keep in mind that ed is a form of addiction so just like with any addict when they feel like their addiction is being threatened they will lash out even at the people who are trying to help its tough and my heart goes out to you personally the mundane daily life stuff from the ancient past is the most interesting to me im not that interested in battles or notable events but i love looking at ancient hair and makeup products restaurants home decor etc it sounds like he felt cornered and accused next time try and use more empathetic language like i love the both of you very much and your health and well being is important to me please know that if you ever need support with your ed or anything else now or in the future id like to help they are adults and they have to make their own decisions so theres only so much you can do im sorry oh my usqitten has given you some solid advice that i agree with please take it to heart the next step with people like her is usually gaslighting making you feel confused and crazy for having a problem with her behavior so please try to keep a clear head and get some outside support as soon as possible that scares me so much to know that people are being actively shamed for showing empathy empathy is like the 1 ingredient to a healthy society lack of empathy indicates a seriously emotionally unintelligent person if that becomes the ideal were screwed whaaa familiarize yourself with darvo deny attack reverse victim and offender thats what shes doing theres nothing misogynistic about standing up for yourself and not wanting to be called names does she do this with issues you try to address i am so very sorry that you lost your brother and father thats an enormous trauma and its very understandable that its affecting your relationships are you in therapy i think you touched on something very important when you said its the same thing i say to myself most of the time we can only give to others the amount of love and empathy that we give to ourselves if youre telling yourself that you shouldnt complain about little problems you wont be able to empathize with others problems either pain comes in all shapes and sizes youre allowed to feel upset about things even if they seem small compared to the tragedy youve experienced and other people are too try and find compassion for yourself and it will get easier to show compassion to your friends please give yourself a hug from me and feel free to reach out any time i care im afraid that cant be your problem he has to want to change make solid efforts to do so and find support along the way as it stands youre enabling him which is the last thing he needs i dont want to sound harsh because i know youre confused and caught up in all this but you have to kick him out and let him hit rock bottom out of your sight for your own sake and his youre welcome and please do i sure benefited from support when i was going through it and im happy to help how i can the real nightmare is wasting even more years of your life trying fix someone whos broken wayyy beyond your ability to repair i understand im 38 and had to walk away from a narcissist almost exactly a year ago it was so hard but by the third month of being no contact i was healed enough that when he found an excuse to reach out i felt nothing but anger lol now i dont miss him at all and my only regret is sticking around for as long as i did im still single which i thought would be miserable but im so much happier than i was in that relationship but going no contact was essential to being able to move on you have to start there good luck and feel free to reach out if you need support do you not have access to the internet at home im confused why you feel the need to just be more cautious rather than just stop doing it being careful about whos looking doesnt guarantee you wont get caught again you said yourself they monitor it and can look at the history just stop lol educate yourself on narcissistic behavior and reading other peoples experiences they all operate from the same playbook and get you hooked on the on again off again cycle it can be very addicting and you will lose your mind if you keep letting her come back also research anxious attachment and codependent attachment im guessing youre somewhere on the spectrum of anxiously attached which makes it much more difficult to let go of people but you have to friend she will not change she will only continue to drain you of all the love and care and energy that you could be giving to someone who can return it blocking her is absolutely essential because by now she knows exactly how to rope you back in with the smallest interaction you absolutely did the right thing by telling her that its not a good time to rush into things whether she wants to admit it or not shes still in a state of emotional distress and cant possibly make clear headed decisions at this point ideally you wouldnt have kissed and cuddled her but its done now so all you can do is not do it again anytime soon to be honest it sounds like this could get messy very quickly with her living with you and being unwilling to accept that you want to take things slowly i mean yes she snitched but you gotta stop looking at inappropriate things on the school computers you will get caught again eventually
