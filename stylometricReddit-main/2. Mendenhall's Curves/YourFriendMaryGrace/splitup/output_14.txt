an urban legend and not at all based in factual evidence the universe and i have arrived at the conclusion that youre a six foot tall pile of awesome i would love that someone posted a dream here like a year ago where aliens invaded and created a test to determine whether she was a real human or an alien in disguise it said what did you do last summer yes or no and she was sweating it out trying to guess what the aliens thought a human would respond that needs to be a meme i still laugh when i think about it im glad it was helpful and congrats on making big strides forward im a straight woman and im not even on tinder but samantha has the power to change all that definitely start keeping a dream journal it will help you start remembering them with way more clarity also check out rprecognition youre not alone the profile pic in my dream was a little different her pose was less sassy and more fml with her shoulders slouching arms down and she was frowning but i could only find so many options for images of women in coveralls isnt it crazy i only discovered the nodes a few months ago and i was amazed as my north node is precisely what i had realized that i needed to cultivate in myself earlier this year i showed a friend of mine how to look up his and he had the same reaction best of luck to you we got this driving your life path the dream with your high school friends might have been about the path you were on back then bridge connection between things so it could be pastpresent and future for example where an unfinished bridge represents an uncertain future or unclear path to get what you want busbus station public aspect of your life journey or the parts of your life that you have less control over these are just some possible metaphors to consider dreams are usually little stories we tell ourselves to illustrate how we feel so think about the feelings in the dreams and what they might represent for you personally like the fear of heights you have in the dreams might represent a fear you have about falling or losing control in some aspect of your real life right now thank you so much normally i default to the metaphorical method of dream interpretation but this is one of those dreams that feels more spiritualenergy related to me i do think its relevant that youre doing emdr therapy right now if i had to guess id say that youre probably ridding yourself of some yucky energy that accumulated in the time you lived in that house and the therapy is bringing it to the surface to be dealt with so while im sure it was awfully scary its probably a sign of progress renergywork might be a good resource for releasing it just remember that youre safe and in control would you mind recommending a website ive tried astroseek and the timepassages app but neither of them seem to include north node in their synastry interpretations the person im seeing now his north node is my sun sign which id think would be a good thing but im an astrology newb how can you tell that hes activating your north node your sister and i have the same sunmoon placements i agree about the pushover stereotype i think its because pisces are intuitive enough to recognize why someone is behaving badly and empathetic enough to give them a pass if they feel like it like if someone is going off on me about some trivial thing i can see that theyre actually stressedangry about something that has nothing to do with me and it makes me feel like figuring out whats actually bothering them more than getting defensive so from an outside perspective it looks like im just incapable of standing up for myself when actually its a conscious choice to let them off the hook and see if i can help my mars is in aries though so im fully equipped with a temper lol it just doesnt flare up easily or to run away from peoplerelationships if you feel pressure to conform to circumstances or the partner i love aquarius so i think thats a nice placement however oh snap thats definitely me i can hang in there for a while i just ended a 12 year marriage that i was mentally ready to leave 6 years ago but i feel very claustrophobic when a partner expects to have a lot of sway in my decisions im still trying to figure out whats fair in that regard and i love leos btw i have no leo in my chart and i wish i did theres just a cheerful magnetism in the leos i know that draws me in like a moth to a flame lol im currently seeing a leo sunsag moon which seems to be working out well in that he needs his freedom and respects mine the lack of communication is trying though secondary characters often represent parts of your psyche that arent fully integrated sex kissing etc often represents the integration or merging of this part of yourself into the whole so for example if youve been working on being more assertive your subconscious might illustrate that with a dream like this thats just one possibility to consider you can try asking yourself what the man represents as you fall asleep and it may be illustrated in a different way with a new dream my jupiter is in aquarius in the 4th house of all my placements ive probably looked into that one the least im still not sure how it manifests in my life my venus is in the 6th house and opposite the ascendant within 35 degrees according to timepassages would that be considered wiggle room mars opposite ascendant within 45 degrees i dont relate to the venus in aries descriptions very much i never knew why but what you said about the double negative and directing the typically outward tendencies onto oneself is interesting and got me thinking mine is 22 degrees so from what i understand if i were to pick up on the tendencies of another venus placement itd be taurus but i relate more to the venus in pisces descriptions hey cool im a libra rising too i wish i could take credit for the chart analysis but it must have been someone with a similar user name im still kinda new to astrology but im glad another your friend or mary grace out there was helpful ha my lilith is also in aries as is my mars both in the 7th house and conjunct my venus it occurred to me recently that in all my major relationships theres been an ongoing power struggle where my independence and need for autonomy is perceived as a threat to the relationship im also very choosy about who i have sex with to the point of long periods of celibacy even though i have a really high sex drive i dont even know why but i just cant do causal sex and im happy with how i look now but its been a loooong road to get here how do you feel like it affects you im a retrograde venus in aries ive forgotten several including the big one that seemed to cause some major glitches in the following days i take it as a sign that my jump was so successful ive just forgotten the previous timeline you can find out right now using this free calculator once you know what nodes you have google north node in and read a few different sites to get a good understanding if you do locate your chart it should also tell you what houses your nodes are in which will give you even more insight into your souls journey i love all of this shes very artistic but she has a short attention span so i think something that requires figuring it out as she goes would be perfect and hold her attention better thanks so much for the suggestions this is so fascinating i absolutely give in to her wanting to quit things all the time and i would say ive been doing less discipline than id planned im a softie pisces sun lol but i can see how it is more helpful to her in the long run to teach her perseverance and responsibility now thanks for taking the time to respond its really useful stuff wow its really good you brought this up because her dad and i are very recently divorced so theres lots of changes happening and my tendency is to keep her out of the loop unless its a big obvious thing that needs to be discussed but shes so observant that i find her asking questions that she wouldnt be asking if she hadnt already picked up on a lot of what is going unsaid thank you if youre open to astrology calculate your birth chart and see what your north node and south node is theyre commonly known as karmic parts of the chart with the north node being the traits you should develop and the south node being what you need to overcome for example my south node is in scorpio which indicates my past lives have been dramatic and probably full of controlabuse issues this is reflected in my past life memories and has been true for my current life as well and my north node is in taurus so im meant to learn how to be in control of myself alone and build a stable enjoyable life for myself i suppose it comes down to a matter of belief but personally i believe that our loved ones animals included can use the dream world as a vehicle to come check in on us and let us know theyre still around i had some very memorable dream moments of conversing with my granddad after he died as did several other people in my family who were close to him im sorry for your losses and hope it helped to be able to see them again this is so helpful and encouraging thank you it definitely sounds like her she loves to paint and seems to have a knack for learning languages my challenge with her is that she is very interactive she doesnt like to entertain herself and wants me to be engaged in everything she does and she wants to do a lot so im always looking for ways to keep her busy so she doesnt feel ignored when mama needs a minute im so sorry to hear that my 5 year old daughter is a gemini sun and moon pisces rising would you guys mind sharing your parenting tips what helped or would have helped little you thrive and feel supported growing up im a pisces sun and a capricorn moon i consider it a blessing because the practical downtoearth cap qualities help me regulate my spaced out pisces tendencies youre the best interpreter of your own dreams so the following is just my first impression take whats helpful and disregard the rest seeing her in a gritty fast food restaurant this was not a healthy or nurturing relationship resembling someone you dislike seeing with new clarity the aspects of her that didnt jive with you all black clothing endings closure holding a baby new beginnings fwiw i find its pretty normal and common to dream of an ex once you find a better partner when youre still single and searching it can be harder to process the emotional impact of a past relationship and harder to see it clearly too youve found someone more compatible which makes it easier for
