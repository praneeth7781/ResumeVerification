one i totally get being wary but it seems like the subconscious has a mechanism of sorts that will only allow you to see what you can handle i tried many times before i saw anything and when i finally did i understood why i hadnt been able to see it before i actually participated in a thread about this recently if youre interested it seems to be a somewhat common experience its its complicated lol but i love him very much when i saw him in the glass thing i looked at him for a long time and then i understood that hed be hurting a lot in this life then i understood a second thing that made me agree to him being my dad unfortunately i dont remember at all what that second thing was but i assume its something that im not supposed to remember just learn over time oh wow ill have to check it out thank you for telling me i did a past life regression once where i saw myself choosing my parents i was sat in front of a giant clear glass with a gold frame that had pictures of all the options and i could kind of flip through them like turning pages in a book but with my mind i was flipping through them thinking nope nope nope because i felt nothing when i looked at the couple until i got to my parents and i totally freaked out with excitement because i recognized my moms soul from having what felt like thousands of happy lifetimes together i said she could be my mom yes yes yes and then i looked at my dad and didnt recognize him at all but understood they were a package deal theres more details but yeah it was very interesting oh interesting my little boy always called water by what sounded like whoa im curious now if that sound matches the word for water in another language oh wow i love this thank you for sharing theoretically though if a conscious or soul if you prefer doesnt need a living brain and body to operate from then one could exist in a plant animal maybe even a drop of rain or just floating in space 22 is an incredibly powerful number in numerology its considered by many to be the most powerful master number really cool that you have a significant astrological event on that date i cant tell you what to expect but i wish you the best adderall starts trying to make the bed while youre still in it youre awesome thank you for saying that i sure want to be a good mother she deserves it re my big 3 yes i absolutely feel pulled in many directions a lot today my pisces sun just wants to meditate feel my feelings read tarot cards and sit with my crystals while my libra rising wants to shop for new nail polish and hang out with my boyfriend meanwhile my cap moon is telling me that all of the above is a luxury and i shouldnt indulge until my house is spotless and ive researched some investments bless you this is all so helpful and encouraging and helps me understand whats going on in her brilliant little head going from distraught to cracking jokes is sooo her its nice to know that isnt unusual and i absolutely love the idea of turning the process of talking about her feelings into a game itself i think shed really enjoy that and it would help create a more positive association with emotional processing bc right now i think she wants to but then feels like it is too boring lol shes a great reader but shes not writing fast enough yet to keep up with all she wants to say so maybe i can create another little game for that where she can tell me what shes thinking and i write it down for her im a pisces sun capricorn moon and libra rising my only gemini placement is my chiron but i do have my moon and neptune in the third house look up attachment styles and specifically anxious attachment i have this and its a struggle but being aware of it is hugely helpful this is such lovely and helpful advice i cant thank you enough definitely sounds like my little fairy she even says no one understands me sometimes which makes my heart ache i have another question if you dont mind a lot of times when shes feeling things deeply and lashing out i take her to a private place and give her space to talk about what shes feeling she often says that first she wants to play some word games like coming up with a word for each letter of the alphabet sooo gemini and i do but then it can be almost impossible to get her to actually start talking about her feelings shell just keep suggesting other games i guess what im trying to figure out is if playing games is actually helping her or is she just avoiding processing her feelings my 6 year old daughter has the same big 3 as you if you have any parenting advice pls share my lifetime before this one i was human in terms of how i felt like my sense of individuality and my emotions but i looked more like a cheetah or leopard on two legs i could run and climb really really fast the planet i lived on was completely peaceful so much so that i found it almost boring i spent most of my time on a small space craft doing missions with my friends who were giant blue lobster looking guys we all communicated telepathically i remember more details about my job than anything else unfortunately i dont remember anything about my childhood and i dont remember there being anything like what we would call a couple or a family so i wonder how babies were even made there wish i could remember more maybe someday yeah those memories were rough they were so much worse than i would have guessed as for who he is in this life the tv show is still on the air and hes still on it so i have some idea of what hes like in this lifetime it seems like hes still got some anger issues but hes come a loooooong way thats for sure i havent tried to contact him im afraid id just sound like a deranged fan lol but im okay with not meeting him in this life i feel like we reincarnate with the people who were meant to learn from in each life so if theres anything to be gained by us meeting itll happen on its own and its a pleasure talking with you too thank you for sharing your story i was in high school when 911 happened and it was all so shocking and tragic its oddly comforting to think of the victims living new lives and the things that happened to them being a distant memory but im so very sorry that happened to you and i hope you get the answers you seek not the person youre responding to but ive had experience with not being ready to remember certain things years ago i used to watch this tv show with a clist celebrity that isnt very interesting on his own but watching him made me feel deeply angry but also kind of aroused im not someone who easily forms emotional attachments to celebrities so this was really confusing bc the feelings were just so irrationally strong i did at least half a dozen past life regressions and never saw anything about him then years later after i had done a lot of work on personal stuff that was affecting me in this life a flood of memories came back while i was meditating that pretty much answered all my questions i wont get into the details but basically he was my uncle in a past life and he was horrible to me but i had a stockholm syndrome type of affection for him nonetheless i saw the horrific things he did to me and yeah i was definitely not ready to see that back when i first started trying the reasons youre not able to see it might be different but like uredseaaquamarine said youll see it when youre ready and itll probably make sense to you then why you couldnt see it before aries scorpio leo im up for almost anything but prefer that it be exciting or novel in some way i feel a little awkward being romantic in the traditional sense so flowers chocolate etc is definitely not a requirement this is great advice thank you so much thank you aries wow thats interesting i found myself reflecting on some events that i experienced in feb 2018 just this morning do you happen to have any more info my son is a scorpio sun and rising leo moon hes only 4 years old though any advice you may have for me as a parent would be appreciated how long do you cook for im close pisces sun cap moon and libra rising im your slightly more approachable sibling not that it matters but what the hell is the context of that like whos children immigrants liberals just random kids no problem this one from 2016 is good because it recaps the historic events that followed previous similar conjunctions like the ones had last year it depends on what youre looking at studying theres different areas of focus like personal astrology your ownsomeone elses birth chart synastry how two peoples charts interact with each other which is used for relationships mundane astrology is used to predict events and tbh im not educated enough on the methods to help with a recommendation i usually look at similar themes in my real life housesapts often represent the dreamers own mind so in this case it might be about wanting to make some changes in yourself but feeling like youre going from bad to worse mentally just an example but hopefully helps theres a lot of old like years old astrology articles saying that 2020 would be a globally historic shitshow we had a whole lot of these types of conjunctions over the past year and were not done the newspaper style horoscopes and stuff are definitely bs but actual astrology the type that is ancient and takes years to learn is really very interesting i really like em i think the piscescap combo balance each other out nicely and the libra rising gives me a nice approachable vibe libra rising yayyy how do you feel about the combo hey were almost twins i have libra rising i couldnt get into the clinical trials so i did a kind of diy version on my own but heres a good rundown on how they do it i had a friend sit with me and im so thankful id love to pay it forward so if you need someone to sit with you id be very glad to help via zoom or something i still struggle at times with intimacy but ive come a loooong way regular therapy helped a lot as well as using mdma aka molly in a therapeutic setting i can go into more details about that if youre interested for me the biggest hurdle was admitting to myself that i needed help processing it and healing thats so awful and so fucked up of your friends to respond that way im so sorry theres nothing lucky about having your bodily autonomy violated no matter what the violator looks like to suggest otherwise is a gross ignorant lack of empathy and understanding it took me 13 years to tell anyone what happened to me because i was
