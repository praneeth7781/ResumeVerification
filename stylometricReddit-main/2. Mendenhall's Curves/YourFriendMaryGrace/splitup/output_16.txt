who only looked like my loved one thank you dreams of having a baby are often about birthing or in this case losing a part of yourself i think its interesting that the baby looked fake to you my guess is that the baby represents some aspect of yourself that you lost in the process of datingbreaking up with him the fact that youre not very sad about it and it didnt look real to you in the first place maybe suggests this part of yourself and wasnt a part of who you truly are just something to consider if it doesnt resonate disregard happy birthday this is a synchronicity for me i had a strong urge yesterday and this morning to lie in the grass and get some sunshine i felt a little bad about it both times because my brain was so quick to remind me that theres chores to be done gotta get ready for work etc but yesterday my 2 year old seemed to read my mind and ran into the back yard and stretched out in the grass smiling i followed suit and then did it again this morning that little bit of spontaneous relaxation just for the pleasure of it seemed to set my whole body and soul on a better track reading this at 1111 oh my never knew about this before but its super intriguing thanks i think so too and i wonder if the magnetic pole shift believed to have happened many thousands of years ago may have messed up earths frequencies or messed up our ability to receive them ive also wondered if this is where the tower of babel story comes from people working together to build something suddenly lose their ability to communicate and have to invent languages amongst themselves youre welcome so glad to hear it was helpful i relate to that very much especially the fear theres always a dozen whatifs that stop me from doing things that i know would serve me and others well we can unlock those chains i believe in us mindless activities like riding the bus can put you in a hypnotic state much like meditation so it could have been some subconscious imagery coming through not unlike a dream it might help to think about it metaphorically bikes are used to move us forward is there a metaphorical bike youre leaving chained up when you could be well on your way to somethingsomewhere else could be a spiritual emotional or even literal journey youre ready to go on when i was ready to go back to work after having my baby but i was nervous and hesitating i started dreaming of cars stuck in a garage feel free to send me a message if youre open to the idea check out the subs for past lives and reincarnation you just made me lol for real full of blood that only music allowed is a solo performance by kenny g i thought he meant it like if youre afraid of death it would mean that you love life but i may have misunderstood it might be helpful to do some imagination work with the end result in mind imagine your excitement in telling your mom how everything is going at work imagine how you feel a little nervous on your first day imagine a year from now when you are welcoming a new employee and remembering back to when you were the new guy i had an interesting conversation with my husband the other day that prior to learning about the me would have turned into an argument lol we were discussing some decisions we made over the summer and the motivations behind them without going into boring detail basically the way i remember his motivations are completely different from the motivations he remembers not only having but discussing with me at length before this would have angered me and i would have thought he was delusional but seeing how me has effected us both differently some of the differences being cultural stuff that has happened since weve been married i feel like theres really no use trying to insist that im right about how i remember him feeling we might just be coming from slightly different timelines ohhh i get it now that makes so much sense thank you for clarifying gonna try it tonight do you set an alarm for every 90 minutes if nikola tesla and johnny depp had a baby thats really sweet one of my coworkers was telling me recently that his wife watched the andy griffith show every night at the same time after she passed away he was watching a game with his friend neither of them touching the remote and the channel flipped over to the andy griffith show not once but twice they were really in love and when her cancer got really bad she told him before she died that she would do her best to let him know she was saying hi from the other side he had a lot of cool experiences like this ps so sorry for your loss hope its a comfort to know hes never really gone its usually a good thing a sign that youre discovering new or long forgotten parts of yourself the windows might represent that this part of yourself gives you a new outlook on life or the world around you heres the original post for 2 cups usneakyrabbit you look like little michael yagoobian before he turns evil which makes me want to take you home with me and love you if youre up for adoption please let me know before its too late love your style probably so the subconscious tends to tell stories to help us work through whatever were consciously thinking about you might really enjoy taking something like meyers briggs to help you get to know yourself better i was in the same boat trying to figure out who i was without the outward influences and it really helped me to take this and read about my type if the first result you get doesnt feel like it describes you very well try this one hope that helps re your post title you might find it interesting to check out the recent research coming out on the nature of our dreams it would seem that they are often meant to be helpful in processing our emotions and experiences anyway i think the finale of the dream is quite interesting because bathrooms are where we tend to our most private business and in dreams they often represent the same thing but youre in a public bathroom which seems to be a hint that this is symbolizing a private element of your life that is difficult to keep under wraps the costume or rather pretending that you are wearing a costume makes me wonder if theres some part of yourself or your personal life that you try to disown in front of others but you are the best interpreter of your dreams since you alone know whats on your mind and whats happening in your life if any of this was helpful awesome but if not please disregard asking for help is an act of strength not weakness theres nothing pathetic about it and the sooner you can accept that the faster youll be able to make some strides this has been the biggest lesson ive had to learn this year and its tough its sad because we come into the world as little babies who are completely dependant on others for survival and we accept this about ourselves naturally but over time we internalize messages about being independent and forget that humanity wouldnt have survived nor would it continue to survive without relying on each other its natural and human to need help and by asking youre giving people like me a chance to experience the joy of lending a hand another thing i see in your post is the negative spin youre putting on your life story i have failed at many things as well but thats just one way to look at my life i could just as easily frame my failures as many different things ive had the opportunity to learn the story we tell about ourselves is very very powerful and sets the stage for our future so look again at your life experiences and think about how much youve grown what youve learned what lessons and experiences youve had that you can utilize in your new chapter i also recommend taking a personality test that can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses i really like meyers briggs which of course is not perfect but has really helped me to understand myself and how i best fit into the world okay i could go on and on but the most important thing i wanna say is that you are doing great housing debt wealth and all other forms of material success can never ever tell us about who you truly are you were worthy of love and acceptance the day you were born and you didnt bring a dime with you the same is true for you now even if it doesnt feel like it i love you and im proud of you and im here for you anytime dreams like this usually represent neglecting yourself in some way water often symbolizes emotions so perhaps you have some emotional cleaning out to do the big dangerous fish could represent anger sadness or some other feelings that are affecting your wellbeing of course this is just one possible interpretation thoughts lots of them have shut down in the past few days heres a partial list credit to

webcam located at mauna kea observatory at the university of hawaii hilo webcam from the canadafrancehawaii telescope observatory in hawaii webcam at jat observatory in fairless hills pennsylvania i have similar dreams about trying to protect my daughter from critters and other dangers i think its just a symbol of the anxiety we feel knowing that we cant protect our children from everything dangerous in the world i just want to say how terribly sorry i am for your loss i know that pain my first pregnancy ended in miscarriage and its a heartbreak i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy please give yourself time to grieve and reach out to me and anyone else who is willing to listen you are not alone and you never have to be im here for you anytime the grungy mirror likely represents not being able to see yourself clearly floods almost always symbolize an overwhelming level of emotion this could be a current situation or something from the past but typically if its set in the past there would be some indication of that in the dream which there doesnt seem to be the person trying to stop you from mopping up the water could be a lot of things think about who or what in your life is an obstacle to sorting out your feelings it could be a representation of some part of yourself that avoids working through difficult times the finale is a bit difficult to guess could indicate that the overwhelming emotions are workrelated but honestly im not sure does any of that help the nasa solar page is down as are a bunch of other observatories ps truthfully i do hope its aliens warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info ive been following this as well and one of the main reasons people have been skeptical about it being related to the sun is that other solar observatories around the
