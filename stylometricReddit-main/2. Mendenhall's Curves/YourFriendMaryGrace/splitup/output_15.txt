your brain to sort out what was wrong before think of it like selftherapy its possible you woke up after did you ever love me because thats not something you can really be certain of either way hope that helps and best of luck with your new relationship the hot and cold thing ok thank you for the straightforward feedback i definitely dont want to change him i guess i just wanted to understand if this is his true nature or if im just not someone he feels safe opening up to or what hes a leo sun not positive but i think hes an aquarius rising no aries in his main planets but a neptune in scorpio venus in gemini yes to the temper tantrum letting it go quickly though the tantrums have so far been directed at people he feels are being tricky or unfair and not at me he does get jealouspissed at the thought of guys hitting on me though i i am so glad you told me this thats the opposite of my natural reaction lol thank you but what if he never brings up anything thats bothering him like ever until eventually hes so fed up about something that he wants to end things and its something i could have made better if only id known does anyone here have advice on getting a sag moon partner to open up about his feelings or at least admit to having them thats amazing if you havent already looked at the research into past lives i think youll be surprised how much evidence there is to support it jim tucker is a great place to start that being said i find its helpful to think about it from the perspective that regardless of whether or not the memories are real these images and storylines came from your own subconscious mind so theres something in olivers experiences that you can learn from or relate to in this life i did one of those regressions and had vivid recollections of being a really sad and sexually degraded woman named marnie who married for money and then spent the rest of her life depressed and bored out of her mind ive always had a strong desire to marry for love respectown my sexuality and make my own living and maybe those hard lessons marnie learned are part of the reason why or maybe its just a story my brain told me to illustrate how i feel either way it was helpful thanks for the update how would this affect someone with their venus in gemini i dont know but i do think it gets easier with practice for me the mental diet definitely seems to be helping that being said last night i found myself worrying again haha so im still learning im reading this 44 minutes after you posted it im so sorry for the things you never got to experience with him i bet hes so proud of you he cant stand it first of all im really sorry youre feeling this way id suggest you start by manifesting better selfesteem imagine that youre happier and more confident in yourself than youve ever been imagine that youre turning heads when you walk into the room or getting compliments that make your day whatever feels like a wish fulfilled of being a confident person to you just leave sp out of it as much as possible for now and when you do think of him try to simply intend that hes happy and fulfilled too i know its not easy and definitely give yourself a grace period of processing that anger but it will help you in the long run to work towards genuinely wishing him well in life with or without you once youve got that selfesteem up then work on the sp by then you may not even be interested in getting back together but if you are youll be all set to have a healthier happier relationship sat state akin to sleep but im not sure how it might be translated into the books youve read its the method of getting very relaxed but still awake and visualising the end result of what you intend to manifest sp specific or special person its not a neville term as far as i know its used by people who have a particular person usually someone they know like a friend or an ex they want to date damn thats exciting youre a badass and you got this there ya go perfect step one for your new formula i like being subscribed to rhydrohomies because its like a wholesome drinking game for me lol if im scrolling reddit and i see one of their posts i stop and drink some water it also helps me to keep a reusable water bottle i can carry around with me its a little annoying to keep up with but thats part of what makes it an effective tool for remembering to hydrate once you get used to the wonderful feeling of being well hydrated for a few days in a row i bet itll become a habit the mental clarity alone makes it worthwhile not to mention youll start to look and feel more healthy without any specifics its hard to offer advice but generally speaking i think starting with small changes in the way youre going about life can get the ball rolling go to bed thirty minutes earlier tonight drink a little more water than usual tomorrow say hi to that neighbor you usually dont speak to kind of depends on the context of the dream but it often represents some new or underdeveloped part of yourself could be an aspect of your personality thats ready to grow or even an idea youd like to see brought to life feel free to message me if youd like some help with anything specific from the dreams usually overwhelming emotions maybe youve been through or are in the midst of an emotional experience the good news is that you either made it through or youre well on your way to making it through oh man thats a lot of stress to deal with and i think its understandable that youd feel totally overwhelmed by it but its also the kind of thing that a few years from now you could be telling a new partner or friend or colleague about and theyd say what you did that and laugh their ass off because it is so out of character for the person theyve come to know and love one of my favorite people in my life is a guy who got duis and stole shit in his younger days even spent some time in jail and now hes so damn accomplished and successful and happy that i a relatively successful woman with two kids look up to him a lot point is as bad as this may seem it is really and truly okay and you can get through it and come out the other side with lessons learned and a hell of a story try and cut yourself some slack were lucky to have you here and i really hope you stick around i often dream of my friends as a representation of some part of myself and sex dreams can often be symbolic of mergingintegratingaccepting two or more disconnected parts of yourself it might be helpful to think of the first thing that comes to mind when you think of each friend for example lets say kevin is really comfortable in social situations a dream about having sex with him might be your subconscious minds way of illustrating that theres a part of you that can also be comfortable around new people and you can integrate it you would probably find rastralprojection very useful youre already halfway there i think first and foremost you should follow what brings you joy that being said real love in my opinion doesnt involve trickery and confusion and demands of loyalty its just freely given to you as you are im wary of anyone or anything that expects you to jump through hoops to meet their needsdesires it sounds like both these fellas have you in a rather vulnerable and confused place even as they may say its for your own good you are all you need to be empowered and vibe high i dont know that theres anything we can be 100 certain about in this realm of existence thats part of the adventure but you might find it helpful or at least entertaining to do a past life regression meditation on youtube i saw myself in vivid detail as a humanoid cheetah looking being from another planet who decided to come here to spread love and light the revelations about that life and what i was like before continued to come to me through dreams and meditation for about a year afterwards regardless of whether or not its true it all came from my subconscious mind and really helped me know myself better as well as refocus my energy and refine my goals for this lifetime i havent experienced flips with anything but fruit loops and it seems to flip every few months for me this reads like a message from you to yourself that you can be more assertive its all started with you saying yes to a date not because youre dying to go but because you dont want to be rude and then you stay in a very uncomfortable situation because he told you to you only get freedom in the end by doing what you want and need to do in spite of the guys orders it seems like a horror story about being passive in other words but thats just my interpretation and i might just be seeing it that way because i tend to be way too passive and im working on being more true to myself gotcha thank you for clarifying were probably going to have to agree to disagree here but personally i believe holding fast to love and light is the only way to fight the dark responding with violence only begets more violence and round and round it goes nothing new about that i also believe that respecting the free will of others is essential to being truly loving and as such we cant really wake people up we find our own way when were ready ok but what does fight mean to you as in physical violence what do you mean by fight is that across the street from the thinkery four years ago at the time there were a lot of sightings reported around there and iirc there was a group of austin people who would meditate together at night in manor because it always seemed to summon ufo but i should have said it used to be a hot spot as i dont know how many have been spotted there as of the last couple years manor seems to be a hot spot for ufo i saw one there on my 30th birthday keep googling them theres an article for just about every number you could possibly see but know this the idea of good and bad numbers is a human concept angels will only send you love and encouragement i get 43 pretty often and i like the last paragraph of this interpretation as it often crops up when im overwhelmed by the clutter in my home or workplace edit oops just realized you said 42 not 43 but hopefully something i said was helpful anyway can confirm am the wife interesting that they chose to live as the person they dont remember being i would rather continue living the life i remembered and as a family member id rather be around the person who thoughtactedremembered as the person i knew than be with a virtual stranger
