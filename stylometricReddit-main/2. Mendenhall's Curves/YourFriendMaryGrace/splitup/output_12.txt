i spend a lot more energy thinking about what i should and shouldnt feel the pros it overrides a lot of the less helpful pisces sun traits like laziness lack of boundless and so on also makes me popular with employers as i have a very overpowering urge to work hard edit to add i like to think that as i continue to learn how to accept and integrate what im feeling it will be even more of an asset i hope i can learn to use my pisces empathy and my libra social skills combined with cap moon stoic side to be a port in the storm for others thanks so much and btw if youre ever interested in reading professionally id love to be a client just read your kim post and its fascinating could you recommend a site for calculating midpoint in synastry charts asenchal oil well you sound like a good parent to me and i appreciate that we were able to chat about our different perspectives without it turning into a pointless fight all the best to you and your family wanting to wear someone elses clothes sure sounds like creatively experimenting to me obviously well have to agree to disagree here and thats fine but my belief is at least partially formed by experiences like when i sat across the table from a gay friend of mine last year and held his hand as he cried about the time when he was 4 years old and his conservative manly man dad made him feel ashamed for wanting to buy a barbie hes 30 years old and that shit still hurts another friend who is trans has memories of being laughed at by his parents for wanting to wear a waitress costume these parents didnt raise manlier boys by censoring their interestsexperimentation they raised boys who grew up to feel like their true selves werent good enough for their parents im not saying youd do these things just explaining why i dont want to be the person who makes my kids feel bad about experimenting and liking what they like theyll get plenty of that from the rest of the world and when that happens ive got their back i get you i was just responding to the other persons question of why not and i get your reason for saying no in your case but yes id let him wear his sisters clothes to school if thats what he wanted to do and she didnt mind hes only 3 but hes worn her shirt with the hearts on it out and about before lil homie just really likes hearts as long as theyre safe and not hurting anybody i try and let them figure out what they like without putting my personal feelings and bias in the mix i have kids and i let my son wear his sisters pajamas lol theyre the same size and she doesnt mind he likes them so yeah why not i think its all pretty much done by ai like they have certain plugin phrases for planetsignhouseaspects and the robots then string sentences together based on your transits for example my moon is in capricorn in the 4th house and my venus is in aries in the 7th house so when theres a transit happening with my moon and venus it might say something like explore what happens when you allow your sturdy emotional connection with home and family to recharge your energy for significant relationships sometimes its eerily helpful and accurate sometimes its just word salad kids will be petty no matter what you do though id rather teach my kids to express themselves in spite of the occasional negative feedback than teach them to try and fit in my 3 year old son likes fire trucks and digging in the dirt and stuff but he also likes having his nails painted different colors he studies his options carefully and usually picks specific colors for specific fingers its cute but if later on he stops wanting to do it ill be cool with it i think theres a balance between encouraging them to be themselves and forcing them to buck the trend all the time i hope i get it right but im far from the perfect parent thats so awesome youre definitely not alone i wasnt feeling well and didnt have the best experience last night in particular but generally i find the days before during and after a new moon and full moon to be extra beneficial for that kind of inner healing libra rising with a lot of aries and scorpio im petite like 53 and 110lbs dark curly hair which i usually have as a pixie cut or a kind of mop top lol big brown eyes small nose often told i look like a fairy libra rising and this moon is transiting my 8th house also my north node is taurus in the 8th house im thinking about my future a lot what will truly make me feel happy and comfortable im also feeling a strong urge to examine my inner self and what my actual wantsneeds are vs what i feel like i should wantneed my moon is in capricorn so i dont often get the urge to just let myself feel what i feel riding the wave while i can full moons are great for releasing think about yourself as a cup and the feeling of heaviness as a symptom of being too full what behaviors fears thought patterns etc are you ready to release edit the moon is in taurus so you can work with the energy of this specific full moon by also thinking about your five senses and indulging in pleasure take a long bath eat something yummy listen to beautiful music etc no worries at all just wanted to offer i bet youll find the perfect deck in no time i dont use tarot myself but ive enjoyed getting readings so if you ever want to practice on someone lemme know well they say your first deck should be given to you if youre comfortable sharing a mailing address with me send me a pm id love to gift you a deck from amazon if not no worries ive seen them in stores that sell games and any crystal or magick shop should have them thats so cool you gotta do it keep me posted if you have time second house is in scorpio with saturn in scorpio and uranus in sagittarius there as well i dont know what im good at but it sure isnt makingkeeping money interestingly my south node is in scorpio in the 2nd house using whole sign so it seems i should be able to overcome this but idk im still pretty new to astrology its cool you had this dream so close to todays date of 1111 i typically read dreams metaphorically but this one might be worth looking into literally get yourself some tarot cards and learn how to read even if its just for fun im so sorry for your loss i hope things look up for you as the days go by be patient with yourself im sure you know this but the grieving process takes time im always here for you if you want to chat i have the exact same placements and disposition thats sounds about right the circumstances of my childhood made me feel like i had to be very stoic and cheerful especially around my mom shes in a much better place now and our relationship is good so i forget how much that probably still affects me subconsciously i think of cancer like a mama bear looks very cuddly and sweet likes to hibernate but holy shit dont mess with her or her loved ones im mostly basing this on my own mama bear who is a lovely very badass cancer and my cancer granddad who was the same way im a pisces sun with a lot of scorpio and while i have some great qualities from those placements sometimes i think theyre less practicalhelpful in the outside world than cancer qualities oh thats really interesting my south node is in scorpio and my life came crashing down at age 27 i went full scorpio lol and basically expedited the burnitdown process myself so i could move on to rebuilding and i had a pretty major epiphany that could be called a spiritual awakening it was a rough time in my life but im thankful for it now everything i lost was just stuff id built trying to please or impress other people oh man i totally do that lol for me its usually because something ive been ignoringsuppressing with various distraction tactics has suddenly bubbled up to the surface and i cant get it out of my mind and because i dont like to talk about my feelings until ive had time to process them alone i end up sitting there unable to pretend nothing is wrong and unable to talk about what is wrong its awkward edit you can help by not forcing them to talk about it just let them know youre there if they want to talk capricorn moon i was just reading about it this placement this morning actually bc im 34 and i still dont understand my own emotions very well id say that it applies to my current career in a sense my midheaven is in cancer and i work with a lot of emotionally sensitive people a nurturing personality isnt required for my job but it sure helps ultimately id like to be an artist fulltime and i can see how my art might take on some cancerlike qualities eventually right now its very scorpio though wow thats awesome i cant think of a more appropriate profession based on your sunrising empathetic yet very comfortable with death re the bowl shape i find it confusing because some of the information i read seemed to indicate that the best way to move forward in life would be to work counterclockwise starting with the first empty area which would be taurus8th house others seemed to be saying that sorting out the saturnscorpio 2nd house stuff would be the biggest factor re the aries at 29 degrees in the 7th house i feel confused about what it means i got married too young and i still struggle with the balance between being myself and going for what i want vs truly merging with another person and my north node is in the 7th house so i feel like this is important to figure out edit i forgot that i used whole sign for this chart which puts my north node in the 8th house and finally my progressed sun hits 29 degrees in aries next march which feels significant heres a pic of my progressed chart for that date in case its helpful any help or insight suggestions etc with any of the above would be hugely appreciated go for it i like to learn what charity why should i move my backpack off the one empty seat left on the bus when youre capable of standing why should i not be a murderer we all do a lot of things because its the right thing to do why do you want the people who run companies to be an exception so bad im glad you mentioned infrastructure because its a great example of what im saying pipelayers provide an incredibly valuable service and the work is difficult af starting pay is about 24000 a year does that seem fair to you yeah it would be dumb because bench pressing cars has no value getting the food i ordered in mere minutes does and just because people arent properly compensated for doing difficult work doesnt mean they shouldnt be if you have a dog capable of standing
