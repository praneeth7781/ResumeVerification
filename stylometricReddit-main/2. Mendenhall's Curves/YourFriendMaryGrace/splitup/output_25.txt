feel like it because of over time were conditioned to think the most important thing we can do is make money theres nothing wrong with the goal of financial success but please dont measure your worth as a person that way you have much to offer just as you are and were all lucky to have you here i love you and im pulling for you keep us updated as you experience the sunrise in your new beginnings i dont think youre crazy but i do think youre freaking out for no reason theres no chance ive been pregnant the past month and ive been seeing 333 like crazy our reality is an unpredictable place so i would ease up on the assumption that this is a sign youre having a baby ime its more likely to be a little pat on the back saying youre doing great you are loved than a prophecy that being said the thing i recommend the most is the power of positive thinking believe that if you have another child it will be a very special child that has been planning to be with you since before you were even born believe that you will have more than enough resources and time to raise another little one believe that you are in the middle of something so much greater than yourself we were practically homeless when i got pregnant with my oldest and for a month or two i wasted so many tears worrying about how things could possibly work out we had to move to a new city and get different jobs etc but in the end we were able to provide for her better than i could have imagined not only that but the sacrifices we made in order to take care of her ended up putting us in a far better position to reach the very goals wed been trying and failing to achieve for years we thought we needed to hit all these goalposts before we could have a baby and it ended up being the other way around so take a deep breath and know that the universe is working in your favor baby or no baby this is great how long does it take you to animate about one minute worth of video in this style id love to will do so shortly careful with that your thoughts are very powerful and if there is a satan hed like nothing more than to make you feel afraid especially when you might be on the verge of some beautiful experiences ive been seeing repeating numbers a lot more recently and i try to remember to mentally express love and gratitude every time assuming that the numbers are a positive sign and guess what ive had extraordinarily good luck lately and so many things ive been working towards for years are just falling into place all of the sudden for every good thing that can happen to you you can find someone on the internet telling you its a bad thing you and only you can allow the energy within yourself to skew negative or positive so if you think youve got an evil entity in yourself you might as well have one simply declare yourself free of their control and you are free declare yourself open to the influences of love and light and expect miracles to believe that youre a helpless victim of darkness is to throw away your tremendous personal power and to miss out on opportunities for a happier life ps im posting this at 1222pm and i feel great about it dont worry be happy this is just one of a dozen or so websites that collect near death experience stories of course you gotta decide for yourself what to believe but it certainly makes for some interesting reading passionate empathetic and creative certainly describes me in fact i was working on illustrating a childrens book when i got your message ha thanks so much for the reading its a very cool gift that you have based on the information id say shes genuinely interested in you if you dont mind me asking at what age did you develop this or did you always have it i used to nanny for a little guy from age 23 who would tell me what color i was after i had a miscarriage he had no idea why i was sad but he started telling me i was gray i moved away 5 years ago but ive always wondered if he was seeing my aura and what color hed see from me now check out the sub rprecognition and youll see this phenomenon is pretty common when i was 11 years old i dreamt about the grisly specifics of my pet rabbits untimely death a few days before it happened been trying to understand the nature of reality ever since ps im so sorry about your pup edit spelling so much food for thought here this is something ive been learning a lot about recently and i feel like its a vitally important topic for our whole society i really respect your courage and honesty anger is something weve all felt but many are afraid to talk about because its not considered a good emotion to have we learn from a young age that only the bad kids get angry and this shaming is reflected in the subsequent years as we become conditioned to choke it out lock it in a cage but there is no part of ourselves that can stay locked up forever just like you described eventually the banished emotion escapes and then youre dealing with the anger of the situation at hand plus an eruption of backlogged anger but it doesnt have to be this way anger when properly integrated is just a calm steady voice of justifiable selfrespect its a small but powerful flame within that gives us the courage to ask for a raise firmly assert boundaries and protect the vulnerable when we accept that anger is a natural emotion just doing its best to protect the self or others were able to harness the selfrespecting motivation behind it and express it lovingly as soon as we feel disrespected its much much easier to keep your cool if you address what youre feeling long before you get hot i tell my kids its okay to be angry but you cant hurt anybody and i even suggest punching a pillow stomping etc sometimes because i firmly believe that anger has to be allowed to be released i actually did a therapy session recently where i found myself screaming fuck you into a pillow over some things that happened back in high school i couldnt believe how much lighter calmer and more forgiving i felt and still feel after that crazy stuff id unknowingly been carrying that rage around with me for 18 years point is your anger isnt shameful its just ready to be let out of the cage so it can become the loving safe and wellintegrated tool its meant to be just my two cents take what resonates and leave the rest behind much love to you my brother keep it up you mean these books i grew up with this set and just started reading them with my own kids thats thankfully a myth dying in a dream is not uncommon but it is usually something that happens in symbolicmetaphorical dreams and is meant to illustrate some aspect of your emotional life i would categorize this as a precognitive dream which is surprisingly common as well check out rprecognition for many similar accounts glad youre okay i pay attention to the feelings i get while considering the action if following him on ig makes you feel excited nervous in a good way joyful etc do it if you feel unpleasantly anxious or conflicted about it wait for the next possible action and see how that feels im so sorry you went through that sounds terrifying youve got such an encouraging and uplifting vibe im really thankful youre okay your story is bound to be controversial because money is a loaded topic to begin with and its such an unexpected twist to the almost died storyline most people will probably be watching expecting to see you speak on a newfound appreciation for life and then your taking the money will seem shallow in comparison but anyone who has been greatly in need of 100 raises hand knows that the gratitude you feel once youre struggling a little bit less is anything but shallow and none of us can say how wed react unless weve been in your shoes so dont let the criticism upset you at the same time i do suggest being willing to consider how you might have responded differently not because you did anything bad but because every moment of our lives is a sliding door to other possibilities and we can learn so much from considering the other paths we might have taken you shouldnt feel any guilt or shame though you are beautiful and deserving of everything good me toobut i also feel like the exhaustion and discomfort arent bad but rather temporary symptoms of having shifted in some way i was meditating last night and i quickly started to feel a really pleasant tinglingvibration the phrase ancient upgrades came to mind and i saw a 2d shape thats been coming to my mind and puzzling me since i was a child the shape started to turn into a 3d construction project being built in ancient times which was so cool aaaand then my son woke up and i had to snap out of it and go be mommy tldr i wonder if something leveled up in our dna or consciousness last night that were energetically adapting to today its a great sign it means youre on the right track in addition many believe its a sign from your angels or guides that theyre with you and proud of you you can google angel number and the numbers you keep seeing and read multiple interpretations but i think its important to remember that only you can sense the true meaning because whatever you see is for you and specific to your experience you might want to try posting this on rretconned as theres some really interesting discussions over there about geography changes rlostreddditors slaying isnt quite what were about here its funny you mention aliens though because a few nights ago i dreamt of an alien invasion everyone was terrified including me but i intuitively knew that wishing them harm was the only way they could get me i focused all my energy on sending them love and light and it was like they had no choice but to pass on by not only was i safe my loving intentions made me uninteresting to them because provoking anger and fear is how they get their kicks edit by they i mean this specific group i think the vast majority of aliens are benevolent oh wow when i wrote the other comment i had no idea that you were the same person i responded to here i read sooo many posts but feel compelled to respond to relatively so few of them its crazy that i inadvertently reached out to you twice you and i must be on the same wavelength im honestly not sure why but i felt like i should delete my other comment and resend it via pm so i deleted it but i hadnt sent the pm yet if youre open to it id love to talk more about these newold friends of ours im on board if youre interested in illustrations oh my goodness youve made my day i appreciate and love you so much too and im here for you anytime its not vain to see your own power and potential
