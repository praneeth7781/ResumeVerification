to lol but it is essential to do so as though they are my beloved brothers because they are so i consider myself a lightworker i just thrive in the presence of darkness and transmute it the best i can this sounds like a game i would have played all day you should try rtipofmytongue i am so very sorry this happened i have been the first person to drive up on the scene of a fatal accident and it was horrible i was so upset i couldnt sleep all night im glad youre reaching out to us and i hope that you can make peace with this as for what the universe is telling you dont stress about it if theres a lesson in this im sure it will be clear to you in good time please know that theres no shame in your feeling that you wanted no part of it its a horrendously traumatic thing to witness and our brains are wired to avoid trauma you managed to override that fight or flight reaction in order to call 911 on her behalf and thats all anyone could ask of you i love you and im sending you all the good vibes i can please feel free to pm me if youd like to talk about it youre not alone when this happens to me i like to stare at the palms of my hands sometimes i pretend im a character that just morphed into the body im in and im seeing my own hands for the first time come to think of it this is a much weirder thing that i do than the other thing i posted in this thread anyway it zaps me back to the present moment and its almost surreal sometimes like i suddenly feel more alive i take it as a sign im on the right track i think we live in the midst of infinite timelines and repeating signs that feel positive are basically a function of the more optimal timelines im sorry im always here for you if you wanna pm i work with moderately famous people but the nature of my job means never talking or posting any details about it lest i lose my job the sheer number of great ideas for art products and businesses that come to my mind every day and i almost never do anything with them when you said it generated energy something clicked in my mind because when i saw the shape turn into a structure being built i felt it had tremendous importance and ive read theories that structures like the pyramids were made to generate energy and maybe even create portals or open dimensions tell me what you think about this image its a recreation of what the great zimbabwe ruins looked like and how they were being used in the 1500s and the people who lived in them at the time said they didnt build the walls they were built in ancient times using unknown technology heres an aerial view edit another potential clue looks an awful lot like a cell its got the nucleus and everything diagram really i was hoping someone would recognize it truly mindblowing how we share these things it makes me feel so thankful for the internet and the opportunity to compare notes tell me about the waves does it feel like the shape is creating the energy somehow i dont feel bizarre but i did have an awful lot of energy both physical and mental all night long couldnt sleep a wink i wrote this to a friend at like 3am because i couldnt stop thinking about it theres this little mystery shape ive had in my minds eye since i was a tiny child maybe 3 or so i knew this shape so well that id constantly see it in clouds patterns textiles everywhere pareidolia but instead of a face i see a 2d twotone shape that looks something like this the feelings i have at the sight of it even today are like a deep recognition and a sense of nostalgia which has always mystified me because what even is this how can i recognize something i dont remember and then one day whilst meditating about two months ago i saw it appear in my minds eye and then transform juuuust a little bit into a birds eye view of an ancient building being constructed with ancient people working together just a super quick 8 bit quality glimpse with the implicit knowing that it was ancient i dont know what any of it means but its jolting to have a sudden development after 30 years of having no idea what i was looking at in addition to the meditation and suggestions already offered it might be helpful to look up some common dream interpretations of the basic elements of these images or even just contemplate and do word association with yourself knights make me think of armor and therefore protection but being in a coffin makes me think of the death of some form of protectionarmor many different cups makes me think of hosting or communing with many people or having an abundance of domestic resources but having them on a shelf behind a knights coffin makes those things feel less than accessible thats just my brain though needless to say it may not be remotely close to what your own self is telling you aww i think its sweet if she was an awful person in life id totally find it sinister but it sounds like she was lovely and just wants to be in the familiar for a while longer im so sorry for your loss op i hope you find it comforting to know her essence is still with you is it okay if i post something i more or less agree with because i think paul sabotaged jesus message on purpose im not op but id be happy to try ive happily eaten way too many burgers and chicken wings to claim that the actual eating part makes me feel sad but thinking about them being killed does i know and far be it from me to begrudge anyone a good meal i just wasnt expecting the adorable rabbitfeelingsafeinacuddlyblanket imagery to take a turn for the slaughterhouse lol that lpt has a surprisingly sad ending this post is turning into a karma goldmine thanks little bots maybe the last few days of downvotes were just their dark night of the code i like to imagine them having little bot protocol meetings dammit qp295 you gave uqueenameliafox 18 upvotes were downvote bots dude downvote bots now get back out there and fix this mess woah 18 upvotes in 2 minutes did the downvote bots have a sudden change of heart this is hilarious and awesome also excellent post its something ive been thinking about a lot the past few days i notice that often when i make peace with the situation im in i actually end up progressing out of it much more quickly i used to live in that neighborhood that blue eiffel tower looking thing is adjacent to sea world and everything else is just a large grassy area okay thanks for letting me know i definitely dont mean to be condescending so i will think about how i can do better im sorry i bothered you just sharing my thoughts love you bro what did you guys do with them also this is excellent rwritingprompts material i dont claim to know how it works but i can elaborate in case its helpful i was telling myself that everything would be okay no matter what and trying not to focus on the money so much as the goal of having our needs met in fact my husband got the email about the money almost immediately after getting off the phone with a family member we were considering moving in with so in a sense it came through the minute we gave up weird manifested 3300 that we were previously told wouldnt be available for many years it came when we really needed it without us even trying it was crazy like some law changed and the funds had to be released to us immediately my body has changed quite a bit too though tthats more of a lesson in be careful what you wish for lol i used to be athletic and pretty thicc but i desperately wanted to be skinny and petite like a ballerina through a years long process of getting sick depressed anemic etc im now so small and skinny that i often hear you should eat more i used to daydream about being told that and now it really bums me out im at the gym trying to put on muscle and eating as much as i can trying to get my booty back haha so yeah i think its all attainable just make sure you have goals youll be happy with longterm im sure hes a great guy and thats probably why hell still be your friend after this personally im much happier now that ive grown into friendships where we dont poke at each others insecurities for fun life has a way of making us feel like crap about ourselves all on its own at best friendships are a welcome break from that not an additional source of it just my personal perspective friend to friend whoever you are the fact that your friend would post something like this tells me that you are someone who is so awesome that people will go out of their way to try and put you down dont let em you keep being awesome and dont let goofballs like op get you down you look like kristin cavallari no problem i used to live in socal and took about a million visitors from back home to see the walk of fame lol theyve always looked this way in my timeline but im curious what others remember grey slab pink star gold letters and an icon for the type of media the celeb was best known for ex a camera for film stars i i thought it was just me nothing wrong with feeling compassion imo there are no bad guys just lost wounded and confused souls who dont realize theyre just pawns it is sad im really sorry about your dad i hope youre hanging in there im so sorry you went through that i cant imagine sending you hugs and lots of love that is so intriguing and weird its rglitchinthematrix material for sure im so sorry for your loss i hope youre doing okay im interested in the story if you feel like sharing also do you remember what the individuals looked like heart stopped beating were you aware that you were dead did you have thoughts or feelings have you guys ever listened to these songs remixed to sound like theyre playing in an empty mall they fill me with a strange mix of nostalgia and existential dread im gonna copy and paste the thing i wrote in an ask reddit thread about alien abduction not an abduction but i saw an alien in my living room about a month ago he was blue with an enormous mushroom shaped noggin i didnt feel afraid though as he looked strangely familiar like an old friend i thought to myself why am i seeing this guy and the answer was telepathic saying you made some deals before you came here i understood this to mean that i knew him in a past life and had done him some favors so he was going to help me out in this life in some way then he disappeared it was bizarre obviously but somehow really comforting i actually got emotional thinking about it the next day i had a series of past life dreams after
