a lot of things done that ive been putting off well thats awesome youve already laid out a foundation for some really helpful stuff definitely give mdma a go if you can get your hands on some quality stuff if you need someone available to talk to during your trip id be really happy to help dm me i think you already know this but start by putting dating wayyy on the back burner until youre in a better relationship with yourself this woman was able to use you because you dont yet fully believe you deserve to be treated as an equal as for what to do expect some trial and error and be open to trying a lot of different things i highly recommend beginning a meditation practice because over time you will learn to detach yourself from your thoughts rather than letting them run the show and negative selfimage is the product of negative thoughts about yourself run wild it sounds like you have a lot of emotional trauma with regards to women and being in society in general so therapy can help you work through a lot of things using psychedelics like mdma with the intention of revisitinghealing negative experiences has been lifechanging for me but of course you should do your research and proceed with caution etc etc also work on building healthy platonic relationships its much easier to get sucked into an unhealthy romantic relationship when you dont have a solid friend or two you can lean on for support and honest feedback im sorry this happened to you and i hope you keep working on yourself and your mindset because there really are great people out there who will treat you as well as you treat them i worked in the tiny backstage of a 105 year theatre before i got laid off due to not being able to have shows anymore i dont know for sure because testing wasnt really available in my area at the time but i think i had the virus already working with internationally traveling performers and crew every day in tight quarters is challenging even without this particular virus idk if i can do that lifestyle again it kinda blew my mind how people were celebrating it like i can understand being happy to see liberal media go down if you arent at all liberal but how could it not even cross their minds it what an awful precedent it was setting yeah hulk hogan vs gawker and im still sad about it gawker could be hella trashy but they had some really great journalists too and were one of the very few mainstream media companies left that were not owned by a billionaire my dad is a retired doctor and has been in a remarkable number of situations where he has been able to help people off the clock via witnessing car accidents people having heart attacks on planes and at a gas station i dont know what it is either but i like to think the universe has a way of putting brave and helpful people like you guys where theyre needed sometimes what is the factor not his literal house though he said my fathers house meaning the temple people had basically turned the temple into a moneymaking scheme and jesus was extremely not okay with that thus the table flipping and such because paul the opportunist came along and claimed to be miraculously converted from the guy who loved dragging jesuss followers to be stoned to the guy who was given special permission to tell everyone what jesus really meant to say he proceeded to write tons and tons of letters that he claimed were the word of god to the point that more than half of the new testament is just paul blabbering on urging people to be judgmental saying stuff completely opposite of what jesus taught and modern christianity is entirely based on pauls teaching not jesus rpracticaleffects especially this post gosh i have a bunch of these and i do think some might be actual alternate timelines playing out like my dream self pops over to experience it for a little while theres a huge openair church that looks like a remodeledexpanded version of the church i grew up in i am no longer religious and i dont go to church but in these dreams it seems im still trying to play along and its very lonely disempowered feeling but the most frequent ones happened around 20122013 and they were scary the world was a dangerous lawless place and my ex husband we were still married at the time though and i had to be extremely careful about leaving our apartment bc there were so many violent people everywhere but every time i was there i knew that apartment complex parking lot etc like the back of my hand even though it doesnt exist in my life here i really like to help people interpret their dreams because i have a gift for reading the metaphorical language of dreams but these types of dreams are just so different in the way they feel and the content is so undreamlike that when i have them i dont even try to interpret them anymore i just assume i went timeline hopping again lol i read somewhere that the draconic nn is set to aries because of the idea that ultimately were all on a solo soul mission of some kind and aries represents that energy personally i resonate with my draconic chart in some ways more so than my birth chart but im not educated enough on it to speak to its validity you dont have to do anything really except be mindful of your thoughts and feelings if you feel anger frustration anxiety whatever lean into it enough to see whats really under there we all have shadows and trauma and stuff weighing us down but remember that this is the energy of rebirth too releasing the old makes room for the new i like to do some symbolic things too like during the day i will clean my house really well get rid of some clutter and at night ill take a long bath or shower idk just something about getting my environment and myself super clean while thinking about releasing and cleansing stuff that my old self went through really feels good you can google rituals and stuff but i suggest trying different things and seeing what feels good and helpful to you just remember to keep directing your mind im a pisces so i cant do anything about it myself lol my capricorn moon strongly disagrees ooo id be interested in reading this if you have a link im a capricorn moon my mom is a virgo moon and she had me when she was 25yo she is a cancer sun and i think thats a combo that led to difficulty expressing her emotions in a healthy way but shes improved a lot i had my first born gemini moon when i was 29 and my second child leo moon 25 years later i think so i feel like i relate to my draconic chart more now than i would have if id seen it at a younger age but i think a lot of it depends on the souls evolution and intention for this incarnation maybe we take on the natal chart characteristics well need for this leg of the journey and for some people more than others that may mean a drastic change in how they operate compared to their draconian chart for example my exs draconic chart has a ton of capricorn and virgo placements which is baffling because he hardly has a drop of those energies in his birth chart or personality lol but his north node is in gemini so it kind of makes sense like if he came into this life with a capvirgo heavy chart itd be that much harder for him to embrace the free curious excitable gemini qualities hes meant to embrace this goround is it really that bad i have toe thumbs and i try to tell myself its okay but i dont feel like its okay pisces being lazy my capricorn moon almost completely cancels out my ability to be lazy unless my chores are done and im at somebody elses house where im not distracted by other things i could be getting done when i was really little i was so gentle and looooved helping people to the point where my older brothers friends would take advantage of my kindness asking me to go get them water or whatever stuff they could have easily done for themselves and id do it one of my earliest memories of getting really pissed off is from when i was in first grade and my brothers friend told me to go get him something and i realized i was getting walked on and said no after that i was a lot less helpful for a few years lol and ive been quite wary of being taken advantage of ever since its funny looking back because thats the year i turned into a little aries im moving into taurus next year i was just thinking about this last night my boyfriend has some troublesome aspects like pluto square venus and i have a lot of 7th house aries placements from what hes told me about his younger self i dont think we would have gotten along very well at all if we were the same age and wed dated in our twenties hes fifteen years older than me though so he has been working through a lot of relationship stuff since before i was even dating age hes also a leo but by progressions hes a virgo which i love i have venus mars lilith and mercury all in aries in the 7th house and i endorse this comment libra rising 25 degrees i have mars in aries best was with fellow fire mars people im a cap moon and i have learned to embrace my rather mechanical structured approach to processing emotions i think it can actually be very helpful for working out problems with others or for helping people sort out their own feelings because the analytical skills i have for it help me break issues down to the root cause see how different feelings are interconnected etc part of fortune is where you can find success so if its in capricorn in the 7th house maybe you find success by working hard alongside your significant other or a business partner chiron is where youre wounded but can ultimately help others heal for example mine is in gemini in the 9th house and boy oh boy does that resonate i was raised with a very strong religious doctrine 9th house stuff but from a young age was having my own spiritual experiences that didnt jive with what i was being taught so talking about my own beliefs sharing what i learned on my own gemini stuff was a liability that would have led to being told that i was wrong a sinner etc which honestly still hurts all these years later i think part of my purpose is to be brave enough to share and in doing so help others feel free of religious constraints lilith is a little more varied in interpretation some people say its the part of you that society rejects or a part of your life where you embrace darkness i would look at different articles about your specific placement of lilith and see what feels applicable how did you determine which fated events were indicated by them by looking at transits or was it the symbology of the placements making it clear internet word for small youd rather die than live without compliments thats crazy i have both the sun and saturn trine my
