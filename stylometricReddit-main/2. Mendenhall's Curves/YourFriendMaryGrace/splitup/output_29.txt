i have a hunch they are often used to distract from the real beauty of the day many people predicted feb 20th as a possible date for the event while others were predicting global chaos i had quite a huge personal breakthrough in meditation on feb 20th and yesterday i had some smaller but powerful realizations so i just think its possible that these dates are important energetically and the thing thats fake about them is what were told will happen i dont think they draw random dates out of a hat i think they try to create fear on dates when we might otherwise be especially likely to raise our vibrations i went from 53 to 55 by improving my posture using a foam roller on my back and retraining my back muscles to strengthen and lengthen im not sure if i manifested it or if i just had two inches worth of height hiding under a slouchweak middle back either way its pretty cool sure they do people all over the world have grueling schedules and need to play sometimes no argument there the question of why those specific words were displayed on their signs remains yeah this isnt the exact article i read but its a bit better because it summarizes the results of many experiments such as the one i mentioned above mediation and violent crime i read an article recently about transcendental meditation it said that when 1 of the towns population practiced meditation the crime rate went down by 16 pretty incredible this is a good one im super intrigued by the possible implications of quantum entanglement and this could be a great example the idea being that your initial interaction and ongoing inside joke about them kept you all entangled enough to subconsciously decide to return at the same time haha yep i had my first lucid dreaming experience recently and it was in one of the many alternate universes i visit in my sleep i was walking down the stairs in my old sorority house and noticed that the walls were painted beige this struck me as odd because i know theyve been painted gray since i graduated my next thought was this must be a dream i can fly i think there must be a suspension of disbelief switch that the subconscious can flip otherwise it makes no sense whatsoever that of all the crazy things ive dreamt some walls being painted beige instead of gray would be the thing that made me go waaaait just a minute now this cant be my daytoday reality she looks like a kind and lovely woman im so glad you found this photo and though its been a long time id still like to say that im sorry for your loss hell yeah your are really showing him whose boss did you feel like you were gonna go crazy i dont know what my mind would do with a week of isolation i relate to your post very much my first awakening came with the meaning of life is love hitting me like a ton of bricks and ive also gotten to experience the feeling of that ultimate love and acceptance surrounding me its hard to put into words what it feels like but if it were a drug id be hooked i think youre right about keeping an open mind i feel a bit sad for people who dont want to ask questions and explore the possibilities the universe is so mysterious and beautiful try keeping a dream journal you can use your phone or an actual notebook by your bed just jot down the key points of whatever dreams you had as soon as you wake up you might be surprised to see some patterns emerge and it can even help you figure out things that are bothering you subconsciously ive learned that keeping a dream journal can sort of prompt the subconscious mind to dream more effectively and helpfully and it should help you distinguish between dreamland and real life too i dont know that it provides proof of anything new but it seems like pretty good evidence of the existence of a collective unconscious ha my badi got my fancy schools mixed up i was feeling like today was special some kind of collaborative energy in the air so i checked the gcp dot and it looks like the coherence of the number generators is off the charts very interesting and i was wondering if anyone has seen it like this before for those who have no idea what im talking about lol heres the stanford university webpage with information on how the data is collected its so weird i can see your first response in my notifications but i cant click on it or read the whole thing anyway yes it is a wand the lovely man i bought it from does the woodworking part and his partner who chooses the crystals and stones was not in the store at the time he thought it might be serpentine its pretty smooth isnt cool to the touch yours might be a true statement though you can find out for yourself that uimreallyokay is sharing the truth all you have to do is experiment no purchase necessary dude you arent kidding its been mindblowing to me im getting chills just typing this lol its like the biggest obstacle is just realizing what the universe is really like once you accept that its operating according to your expectations you can change your life i dont know what it is i first started noticing how real these things are in early 2013 and it seems that a lot of people started noticing around the same time then there was another big influx of people having these experiences in december and again in february of this year maybe theres periodic shifts in energies or frequencies or something that supercharges the effects of the thoughts we have whatever it it seems to be getting stronger and more frequent is this aventurine thanks for sharing your gifts here coincidence just means that two related events happened for no apparent reason it doesnt mean that there is no reason my theory is that the veil over reality started lifting a few years ago and picked up the pace around december 2017 it seems like synchronicities precognition manifestations and other thoughtpowered occurrences are off the charts these days my advice is to stay in a loving and grateful mindset as much as possible it supercharges these abilities and we all have these abilities btw to a degree that still surprises me even after years of practice maybe if i start thinking about money itll appear in my life it will but the key is in how you think about money if youre thinking i dont have enough money youll manifest a continuous lack of money thinking i have an abundance of moneyim thankful for an abundance of money has worked much better for me i have experienced that with personal changes my theory is that its something to do with collapsing timelines you can remember the facts of a collapsed timeline for a while but it eventually fades away as you progress through the remaining timelines yes my skin feels tight and itchy even on my back which was fully clothed all day other than that i feel great i went to bed early feeling out of sorts and irritable woke up at 333am feeling overcome with love for my husband and little ones and the rest of the world too ive been awake ever since feeling perfectly rested we already have the gifts weve just collectively forgotten about themno longer teach them you are capable telepathy remote viewing lucid dreaming and manifestation with or without the event some are foreseeing sign me up please i would be happy to help moderate as well im a philip k dick fan and find this interesting as he had a friend named valis who assisted him in getting his life together but his valis was a pink light and had a female voice i think youll find this interesting then friendly hallucinations are only rare in some places from this article stanford anthropologist tanya luhrmann found that voicehearing experiences of people with serious psychotic disorders are shaped by local culture in the united states the voices are harsh and threatening in africa and india they are more benign and playful this may have clinical implications for how to treat people with schizophrenia she suggests i find that when peoples negative energies limiting beliefs etc bring me down its because theyre mirroring something within myself like if im not experiencing any anger i can observe anger from within a bubble and just feel kind of amused and eager to help sometimes it even seems to supercharge my positive state but if im experiencing even mild pessimism for example the pessimism of others brings me wayyyyy down just my thoughts friend to friend i had a nightmare of an attack on the country maybe the world it was coming from the sky via helicopters and such and i was taking shelter with others i havent had a nightmare in ages and war isnt something that typically worries me so this seemed to come from nowhere aww my daughter is three and doesnt understand that i actually order and pay for the groceries that get delivered i havent explained it to her because its funny and cute seeing her flip out with gratitude over everything she just goes to the door and immediately starts thanking the delivery person for random items a few of my friends and family have had similar experiences like watching a movie or craving a certain food and then learning they watchedate the exact same thing on the same date a few years back my theory is that the subconscious mind keeps track of a lot more than we can consciously remember so basically you listened to the song and recalled that memory because you subconsciously remembered it was the anniversary of your friends post again just a theory but it makes sense to me this article is pretty long so ive copied the relevant parts all of these were minor interventions compared to its apogee the saving of phils sons life phil describes how one morning he was lying in a semisleep state when he heard the voice announce that his recently born son christopher had a potentially fatal birth defect and that urgent medical attention was needed indeed the voice was quite precise when it stated your son has an undiagnosed right inguinal hernia the hydrocele has burst and it has descended into the scrotal sac he requires immediate attention or will soon die tessa acting on her husbands frantic instructions took christopher to the family doctor and it was indeed confirmed that christopher had exactly the problem the voice had described and surgery was needed this is cool philip k dick saw a pink light that he credited with saving his little boys life hey buddy thanks so much woah i love these beautiful coincidences of the universe ive always found it really cool and interesting that albert einstein was born on pi day and now its the day stephen hawking died as well its also my birthday but i have made no significant contributions to math and science hey neighbor i believe in you im really sorry for your loss i havent seen game of thrones or avatar but the header image really gives me the creeps for some reason i think its something to do with the frequency or energy of our thoughts but im not sure the exciting thing is that these phenomenon and things of a similar nature are being observed and studied in mainstream science now whereas in the recent past its been relegated to the mystical realm im of the
