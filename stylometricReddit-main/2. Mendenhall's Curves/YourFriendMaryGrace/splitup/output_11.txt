have past life memories and by far the most vivid one is of being shown the footprint of a massive structure and understanding something similar to what youre saying except the languages came to exist because of a sudden loss of telepathic abilities as a child i would see the shape of this structures footprint everywhere in clouds popcorn ceilings the floral pattern of my bedding and it drove me crazy because i couldnt put into words what it was and how i recognized it then a few years ago i ran across this image of the footprint of the great zimbabwe ruins and it stopped me in my tracks because its the exact same shape ive remembered my whole life then i started reading more about the legends surrounding it and it sounds an awful lot like the tower of babel theres even theories about it being some sort of natural energy producing mechanism that was just too big and too powerful and the people who built it ended up accidentally shifting the magnetic poles which could indeed affect the way our brain computers link up anyway i could go on and on but its a fascinating rabbit hole to fall down for sure warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info or hear me out you love things about yourself that youve actually accomplished things about yourself that make you a good person or a unique individual etc and dont need to cling to where you happened to be born as a form of identity i wanna see as you grow and evolve youll take on characteristics of the sign following your natal sun for example im a pisces sun and i still have many of those characteristics but ive been a progressed aries sun since childhood and i relate to that because i had to learn to be more independent and assertive than the typical pisces at a young age who always has their dms open if you need someone to talk to not at all everyone needs to feel wanted and loved i hope you find someone who appreciates you for you really soon speaking with kindness hearing them out and acknowledging their feelingsperspective even if i disagree and sharing my own feelingsperspective without insisting that my way of thinking about it is the only correct way basically i make every effort to have a polite discussion rather than an argument and by doing so i find that its far more likely to go my way and even if we stay on different pages the relationship can usually carry on just fine i am happy birthday just call it a leg injury and reduce your recovery time by two weeks i love you aww thank you very much for saying that my man i hope you have a great day too youre awesome thank you for chatting with me about this i agree with you that the media is pushing it pretty hard and as someone who has almost zero trust in the media i do have to question why but at the end of the day i think its a good thing for kids to feel free to explore the world around them without having to deal with all the cultural input theyll be dealing with the rest of their lives and if this kind of thing helps parents feel better about itnot read into it too much i think thats great anyway thanks again it says a lot about you that youd earnestly consider the other side and be willing to change your way of looking at it the world would be a much better place if more people were brave enough to do that i have to work on it myself all the time ive read all your comments here and im not a fan of arguing id like to understand your side i dont get it yet but im trying it seems youre okay with your son consciously choosing to dress as a woman once hes old enough to understand that what hes wearing will be perceived as feminine and good for you i think thats great what i dont understand is why youre not okay with a little dude playing dress up before hes old enough to have picked up on all the culturalgendered associations isnt that inherently more pure in intention its like you want to teach him its not okay but then be cool about it if he does it anyway which in my personal opinion is kinda sad because then hell only be able to express himself with the knowledge that hes going against what his parents have taught him is acceptable i have a transgender friend who still gets emotional talking about the time as a child when they said they wanted to wear a waitress costume and their parents laughed at them and said no thats for girls it was the beginning of a 20 year long shameridden hide out in the closet until they were finally able to even think about expressing their femininity again and they still arent close with their parents statistically the odds that one of my kids will be transgender gay etc is low but regardless id so much rather be supportive of them wearing what they like than set up a precedent where they feel like they have to audit their choices based on my personal feelings as long as theyre safe and not hurting anybody i dont see any reason to get picky if a little boy wants to wear a dress its got nothing to do with their sexuality and everything to do with wanting to look like a character they enjoy my 3 year old boy likes to put my makeup on sometimes bc mommy does it and its colorful sparkly shit that can go on your face all of which appeals to his toddler sensibilities assuming that makes him gaytranswhatever would be idiotic i hear you on the first point but you cant just lock your door and keep sleeping when your kids wake up early unless theyre old enough to be unsupervised which takes years ya got me there pal maybe hes allergic to cats befriend everyone on the planet one by one until were all cool just hanging out and making nachos and stuff making all my own decisions isnt nearly as much fun as i expected is this love by bob marley hes singing about the happy life hell have with his lady friend and when he said for ja provide the bread i heard well jump rope on a bridge which i thought was a cute but oddly specific couples activity i love you i walked through my apartment complex after a light rain and the sidewalk was covered in snails just so many snails it freaked me out but i kept on walking until i crunched one at which point i screamed and took off running crunching snails and screaming all the way home psychedelics taken for therapeutic purposes give yourself time to grieve ryan were here for you well done linda and michael amicably coparenting with your ex can be challenging but the rewards are so worth the effort pattern i am my day job i work with artists but not doing art myself but ive been painting for a few years and sell them sometimes ultimately i want to be a filmmaker too im learning how to animate and id like to make short films what about you oh thank you that made me smile and youre welcome please feel free to reach out any time you have a dream youd like some help figuring out of course youre the best interpreter of your dreams because youre living the experiences that lead up to having them but it always seems to help me having someone readhear mine and tell me what sticks out to them i used to have chronic nightmares as well and learning how to understand what my brain was trying to sort outtell me made a huge difference i also usually google the setting and such for common interpretations which helps like last night i had a dream that took place in a stadium and i was on a computer trying to animate i read that dreaming youre in a stadium can mean that you are trying to be more assertive and put yourself out there more which sure enough is what im trying to do with my art so it makes sense interesting im a pisces sun cap moon and an infj makes sense since infj are known for their empathetic yet emotionally reserved ways oh yeah i know but it still might be relevant since the description of the metaphor strangulation stifled emotions aggression kinda fits with your description of the dog having to be kept in the garden due to being aggressive with certain people im sorry it made you feel horrible bad dreams can be really upsetting i would interpret that as your minds way of telling you that whatever the dog represents be it stifling your emotions or something else its a valuable part of yourself that you should protect no part of ourselves are ever really killed forever they just get pushed back or forgotten but theyre still there and you can nurture them it might be worth a try to ask yourself what the dog represents before going to bed tonight i do that sometimes and will get a new dream that illustrates it differently hmm thats interesting i googled the meaning of dreams about strangulation and this came up in dreams the feeling of being strangled suggests a deliberate act of suppression strangulation suggests a violent act of suppression emotionally our more violent aggressive side may not allow us to act appropriately in certain situations to dream of strangling someone is an attempt to stifle our own emotions maybe something in your life has made you feel like you were too aggressive or said too much or like you had to stifle your emotional responses that might explain why your brain chose that dog specifically for this dream possibly but that someone could also be you the subconscious usually creates a character for each part of yourself that it wants to illustrate so sometimes you are all the elements of the dream do you remember any more details like how the dog was killed how would you describe your cousins dogs personality irl animals often represent a vulnerable part of yourself it might help to think about it metaphorically and whether you might feel like youve lost a part of your personality mars in aries here too and same im a pisces woman with a leo man i like our differences for the most part the biggest hurdle probably had to do with his sag moon though he doesnt like to talk about feelings until theres a problem and i could talk about feelings all day lol but ive learned to appreciate his love language of making fun plans and helping me with stuff instead of expecting him to express it my way happy birthday if you look in the shared experiences section of a particular pattern some of the comments may tell you what its based on a lot of things seem to be based on the rising signmc is your rahu different from the north node my western north node is in taurus but if i do a vedic chart i get aries rahu me heres what its like for me personally the cons too much of my self esteem is tied up in feeling accomplished i have an emotion and then i immediately feel compelled to ignore it categorize it explain it away or feel bad for feeling it in the first place lol i rarely get comfortable just feeling
