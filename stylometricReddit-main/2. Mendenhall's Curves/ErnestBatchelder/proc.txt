i wonder if a very blue state in the us is likely the closest to semilow racism or homophobia one can kind of get to still serious systemic racism in california but in the bigger picture of things there are certainly large pockets of overt liberalism even if it gets more performative at times than substantial 

i know there are parts of europe while not being as overtly racisthomophobic as say a deep red state can still be subtly so likely your best bets where you wont run into it too much would be major cities like amsterdam lisbon london  berlin ive hear that norwegians are superficially very polite but can still hold racist attitudes its just the culture of civility means it wont be in your face in italy now the current government is far right and trying to illegalize gay couples from adopting 

dont know enough about travel to south america but the largest blacklatino populations would be in columbia brazil and haiti theres a complex history in parts of south america of colorism left over from colonialism could be less racist than the us europe though i dont know but i would worry about safety around homophobia 

but i also think you shouldnt let that stop you from exploring and you may find something in your industry elsewhere that does feel less biased id start planning to travel make some trips and see what you find
i would recontact air bnb and tell them what the host is doing is illegal according to hud

i would also contact the host and tell them what they are doing is illegal they know and you want a full refund to keep you from reporting them to nyc housing department  hud

get your money back from them then call nyc housing departmenthud and report the hell out of them

that is so skeevy btw if you google it its apparently happened a few times over the years and been reported in the news totally against the by laws of public housing
i think thats the exact conflict you didnt express initially to him that you needed to i would hate to lose you to distance but you are really unhappy here and i cant be the one who encourages you to stay if that makes you miserable because ill feel guilty

those are complete ideas that express your conflicted emotions whatever happens happens is the verbal equivalent of a shrug
it sounds like not feeling like your authentic self by being closeted is keeping you closed off 

you are currently struggling professionally and with your family so one way to look at it is no matter what further realistic discrimination issues barring safety there is also a possibility that some of these facets of your life improve with you transitioning 

its a tough choice with no real easy path but like ujilltro mentions are there any areas in your community to meet other trans and lgbtq people growing that network in a safe way may help you learn more

ask your therapist if they can help you resource maybe group therapy for those who identify as trans that might be the best first step
we started seeing a couples therapist 5 years ago who also became mine and his individual therapist

yes you are correct this is highly inappropriate and she should never have suggested that 

my therapist strongly feels my partner and i are not compatible 

this is not her place a good therapist will help you believe in yourself to make the best decisions for you not make suggestions or try to influence you to do what they think is right for you thats what a meddling mom would do

 

she often interrupts him while he speaks and she talks a lot

not cool

x200b

she talks quite openly about her own children and their relationships she has called me out of the blue to ask me to run an errand for her when she couldnt leave her house and has invited my husband and me over to watch a zoom lecture on a saturday morning

so you pay her to have an audience and take care of her wtf shes got zero boundaries and isnt your therapist at this point id worry shes trying to be your cult leader 

thank her because you did grow some at the beginning of this but leave therapy with her shes a nut job and while id normally encourage someone to have a last session and tell a therapist why they are ending in this case just get out 

if and when you are ready you can both go look for separate individual therapists that meet your individual needs
id worry about weird tik tok influencers and drug dealer neighbors the high price makes it more transient in some situations because theyll rent to anyone willing to sign with cash upfront  

if i was going to go up 1000 per month in rent in apartment living id look for another small building but one that gave me garden access but thats me
the best builds in la are 30s era when walls are still built with plaster and lathe  stay cool but if it has original windows those are paper thin

the 1950s  70s builds  the dingbats in la are made out of paper mache and spit held together with asbestos
two different areas no visible lgbtq communities but i doubt you would run into problems if i were you all id look at some of the foothill communities sierra madre montrose or pasadena proper somewhat less pricey than san marino cute downtowns
lots of opportunities for social cadaverings
very quiet neighbors unless one of the dead is an angry ghost

personally i have no issue with it
low heat low and slow  youre less likely to hit the burn point too fast
mom became a christian as an adult from what she told us after some things happened and someone passed and she turned to it and said her life before it wasnt good

so many people in this country need therapy for traumatic childhoods due to an authoritarian parental figure but instead decide to seek out more authoritarianism and repeat the cycle on their kids
im trying not to be a high maintenance client

wrong attitude figure out what  23 of the house value is and realize your realtor works for you and is making a decent amount here dropping the ball can happen with realtors after the sale looks nearly done but you still need them so call them thats not high maintenance its the very least they should be doing
have a talk with her not about specific past behaviors because after the moment has passed its all confusing the next day she wont get why that joke after dinner last night went on too long  made others uncomfortable and it feels like getting punished for having bad intent when in her mind if shes even thinking about it last nights dinner was fun and now shes reframing it like she was bad 

instead talk to her about how people have different sensibilities and sensitivities and while home is definitely her primary safe space having visitors means accommodating them have a discussion with her to come up with a kind and short phrase something you wont say in anger that means she needs to take a breather and redirect her energies while her niece visits something as simple as new topic time for a gross joke thats going on too long or lets all play 5minute silence and gather our thoughts then come back to this topic if her hyper energy is dominating the conversation 

always frame these discussions starting out with why you love her sense of humor or enthusiasm and end them on a positive note the sandwich cookie of criticism technique make sure the discussion wraps up with her feeling empowered to add some social skills in not crushed and like a loser
shes emotionally immature her feelings are hurt and rather than cope with that shes hoping to manipulate you into begging her to eat come back and cook with you etc

shes 63 she isnt going to starve herself to death leave her be breath and do whatever you need to do to take care of yourself when you feel triggered but do not escalate or engage for now tell your kids grandmas having alone time  dont worry too much about them if you dont get upset they wont you are the one they are looking to to model their emotional regulation on

eventually when shes reengaged and during a period when things are going smoothly you can tell her how it used to upset you greatly when you were a kid that shed refuse to speak to you but as an adult it just makes you sad for her she still cant calmly talk about her feelings
the whole family is creepy 26yearold son brings home a teenager and everyone including parents are like cool lets get drunk  karaoke
theyve known each other for 4 months  are getting married they may not even make it to the actual wedding date but if they do its kind of one of those 5050 things that it works out

id be politenice but really stop taking inventory of how she bugs you stop caring if she includes you or is snubbing you just dgaf be incredibly polite nice and shrug everything else off dont make complicated plans with them if you are going to be irritated that they are flakey
a good hvac installer should handle the permitting for you if you need it
he has no right to get angry about this though you do understand that

hes stealing  strongarming money from you that you want saved for your kid to get himself out of a bad financial situation he got himself into he should be mad at himself you shouldnt be so scared of your partners emotional behavior you do something that is not in your childs best interest

this is not a healthy dynamic
i assume you two arent married

youre saving it for your child thats your kids money a boyfriend doesnt get to make unilateral decisions with your money so learn how to say no or really examine how messed up this relationship is 

tell him no and move it into a 529 college savings with your child as a beneficiary this week 

a 529 college savings plan is a statesponsored investment plan that enables you to save money for a beneficiary and pay for education expenses you can withdraw funds taxfree to cover nearly any type of college expense 529 plans may offer additional state or federal tax benefits
get couples counseling if she used to enjoy sex then this could be hormonal psychological or other issues in the marriage that should be discussed much more indepth than her just wanting to be done with sex or you seeking a sex worker as your first solution
go to al anon you can find meetings online i will give my usual caveat 12 step programs have their issues but theres some support there listen to some peoples stories of what their life was like marrying and living with a drunk listen to how they eventually had their entire lives revolving around watching their spouse hoping it would be an okay night trying to avoid violence and emotional abuse when it was a bad night sunk cost fallacy and the years wasted 

hes going to promise to sober up as soon as you say you want to break it off then you will be right back here again in 4 6 12 months only now youre married and legally bonded to him its a progressive disease and hell get worse and worse as time goes on

if you cant bring yourself to call it off postpone the wedding now 

he needs real sobriety not just white knuckling it then deciding he can have a few you need to really get enough distance to see how you are enabling him  that his drunken outbursts are abuse
yes but what i do is malapropism i just use the wrong word that sounds like the word i want

my birthday was this past month and they made me a cake and threw me a really nice surprise party which ive never had before we also went to dinner which was also actually the first time ive had friends to go to dinner with for my birthday 

so heres the thing gossiping about someone instead of being direct with them is not cool but at the same time these people arent 100 horrible and dont hate you or they would not have made the cake and thrown you a surprise party you have quirks that frustrate and irritate them and they vent about you  gossip behind your back not positive and not letting them off the hook but if they hated you theyd be icing you out never include you in anything and other behavior 

adhd can bring about a sensitivity to criticism sometimes people are bullies and are being really cruel other times they are just being average normal jerks who are immature and dont know how to fully communicate frustrations directly with someone 

my suggest sit with the hurt for a bit dont overplay what you heard in your head if you can help it when you are ready leave a note that youd like to have a pizza night with everyone get pizza and tell them something like the following

i heard you guys talking the other night  it really hurt id like to disclose something to you i have adhd its not an excuse for my behaviors but it is the reason when i make mistakes i am not intentionally trying to hurt anyone i had hoped we were all friends one thing that is helpful for me is direct communication if i am doing something that bothers you it really helps me to be told that in a kind way like hey op would you mind closing the cabinets when you are done and then i can try to improve as you know i am out at the end of this semester but id like to leave here on good terms 

good people will rise to the occasion with direct communication bad people will act fake or be put out you will at least get your answer you also will have taken responsibility for actions that annoy others while at the same time stood up for yourself that you deserve better communication its a really positive thing to do

if that feels too overwhelming know you will be out soon and it is okay
homemade saukraut  yogurt this one crazy secret cure for adhd psychiatrists dont want you to know s 

lol no
somewhat dependent in that if the inspection turns up a ton of issues needs roof foundation plumbing or electrical work then the house likely wont appraise by the lender for the selling price by waiving appraisal gap you are saying even if this home appraises for less and the bank wont give me the full loan i have cash in x amount to make up the gap

but if you waive appraisal but do not waive inspection you have a builtin safety net negotiating tool and wont lose your earnest money say inspection turns up a ton of issues you have your inspection contingency in place and can tell the sellers either lower the price fix these things or im walking
or their parents die young and leave them the house while the kids are still in their prime then the siblings can grow old together in some kind of grey gardens healthy dynamic
not a helpful comment but if you are into fermentation pickling try making your own sauerkraut same as pickles just cabbage and water instead or yogurt

super easy and much tastier than storebought just keep the pickles or sauerkraut away from the yogurt while they are fermenting apparently the two bacterias float around in the air during the process and the two camps of bacteria yogurt versus sauerkraut dislike each other
you can keep your word but also alert your husband that his friend is having a hard time and encourage your husband to reach out to him more

women emotionally abusing men is equal in the psychological damage it does when it is the reverse and can eventually become physical ask yourself if this friend was a woman would you feel more obligated to alert someone to get her help if so this one issue overrides the rule of keeping peoples secrets that is dont keep a secret when their lives are in danger personally i think this one comes out of the vault in order to get him real help he needs professional counseling and the strength to leave his wife
and believes that because he made it then i can too

so thats called a gross lack of empathy  problematic amounts of solipsism the inability to view the world through the lens of what others may experience and instead view it solely on ones own experience and apply that to others

there are any number of paths you can go down in terms of working without getting your degree or maybe one day if you feel ready going back parttime to get a degree etc but the bigger issue is being with someone who accepts you for who you are doesnt laugh at diagnosis and has the emotional capacity to support that

sometimes when you come from childhood abuse your inner compass that points you towards what love and support are can get a little wonky getting help therapy for that can actually be the thing that leads you toward leaving toxic people which makes room for more external successes feeling ready to go back to school finding apprentice positions etc

tldr edit dude sucks and hes bringing you down
good luck i hope hes feeling better soon
maybe others can chime in but go to an urgent care walk in clinic not the er and get it checked out not worth flying sick 

worstcase scenario and it ends up being something he has to go to the hospital for well he will end up with a bill in the us he may not be able to pay but as a uk citizen what are they going to do give him bad us credit
yeah hes going to be unknowingly bringing fentanyl or meth back over the border
its a turn of public opinion it happens with almost all things oversaturation lack of oversight housing crisis issues pandemic housing bubble sentiments change 

i bet if you look through the sub going back a few years the posts had a very different tenor i dont think airbnb is in its death throes but it may eventually get overtaken by a better platform for hosts and guests and people will jump ship usually takes a few years for that to happen
your boyfriend is a sheisty little creep using his moral high ground to shame you into being submissive to him

heres the thing its okay for him to not be comfortable with your sexual past the correct thing for him to do when you were both sharing that information early on is to let you know he wasnt comfortable and you two were incompatible then kindly break up 

instead he uses it as a manipulative tool ill stay with you but let you know occasionally that youre gross is not a healthy okay dynamic
its totally possible you did miss something you were doing at the time or shes still as nutty now as she was when she was going through a divorce

sometimes friendships also just outgrow their course its a really painful but not uncommon experience if you feel she still has the ongoing judgment of your relationship and unless you were previously the affair partner of your current spouse you did nothing ethically wrong then it sounds like it is not worth it 

or write her back your side of things tell her you are struggling to meet up when the premise is that you were hurtful to her by entering into a healthy marriage maybe she wants the friendship back but getting closure isnt a bad thing either
 mountain where hollywood sign can be hiked i expect this to be an all day event

depending on what condition you are in the hike in griffith park all the way up to hollywood sign is a few hours not all day its worth it but while you are there you could drive after coming down from the sign and see some other parts of griffith park the observatory is great or head over to the autry museum avoid the zoo at all costs

malls in la are not the most exciting you might as well drive out to rodeo drive  window shop from a tourist perspective its unique to la and fun to recognize it from the movies 

for food do some googling ethiopian armenian mexican or thai makes more sense than jamaican not a lot of jamaican or pizza best chinese food would be getting dim sum way over in san gabriel valley and a schlep from the areas youve listed
im sorry things feel really lonely right now and i get feeling so taken up by all the things that have to happen for big picture survival theres no time for the amount of energy it takes to make and keep social connections or maintain hobbies 

ive gone through long periods of dysthymia just mild longlasting blahs like not suicidal not dramatic not so depressed i cant go to work or do tasks i need to but meh

one thing i try to do during those periods is look for little tiny pleasures and keep juggling the ability to find them and make them last a little longer each time it is an extra chore but a good chore daily walk even a short one bird watching stretching looking at art even if im not making it listen to a really great song try to be as present as i can for it again we are talking 15 minutes a day here just make sure before i go to bed at one point during the day i did some small thing that brought me a teeny tiny bit of joy and keep stringing that along until i can get back into hobbies or reconnect with people socially  feel normal joy again
ugh sorry i switched to blue shield covered california from anthem blue cross a bit like comparing rotten tomatoes to rotten apples but ive found blue shield incrementally better edit and the appointments i was finally able to make were all 68 weeks out it is bad out there
ive stayed in many places and had a great time this owner has her son in law living out back and he made me uncomfortable by repeatedly trying to enter the home i was renting so i left the booking early the host was upset i found it unacceptable for a strange man who wasnt my host to enter my rental home without warning and has reviewed me poorly as a result

i would respond with facts only  keep it short and sweet the more calm and clear you are in your response the more you appear totally reasonable in dealing with an unreasonable host
it sounds like she is still upset in some ways with me even though i dont think i did anything wrong she is still taking my decisions for my life personally

other than a very notable lack of succinct apology are you reading between the lines or was that explicit in the letter

she may want to apologize in person or she may not feel she does owe you an apology if you need an apology to let her back in then this is probably worth letting go of because you cant know what will happen

sometimes people are in terrible dark places and unfairly project their lived reality onto others in unfair ways and they fail to be happy for others when they are miserable or maybe you were being more thoughtless towards her than you realized in the time up to your marriage maybe a little of both 

i would write back to her what you said in your post i love my stepkids and my husband and am not interested in hearing any judgment or negativity about my family if we can speak without that occurring then lets catch up 

you can create any boundary you want invite her back into your life as long as she can agree to that boundary then it is on her if she wishes to do so if she really wants to rehash why she believes you failed her by entering a loving marriage as a stepmom which is clearly ridiculous that boundary would pretty much weed her out
i could maybe see some hotel cyprus having nondrinkable tap water 

ive stayed in a few hotels in the uk in the last decade and they were all pretty americanized at this point i was almost sad that everything felt like a midtier standardized marriot or hilton so i am wondering where the dirty beds and undrinkable water are 

not saying they dont exist within the euro zone or eu as a whole but curious
 they wanted us to agree to a complete appraisal fallout as well as non refundable earnest 

they knew from the beginning the amount of work the house needed they are sellers convinced that their neighbor sold last year a house in better condition with better mortgage rates for x amount of money and they deserve to make the samemore 

walk if they come to their senses on a counter still be very realistic with yourselves that there will be more repairs you will discover as you go along even the best inspection will miss them would you be happier longterm in a semiless special spot but with much fewer headaches
curious if you are in eastern europe not used to seeing nonpotable water in most western european countries
he needs a good talk maybe hell change his behavior and understand me

you both need to have a real discussion that goes both ways this is one of those things that shouldnt be one persons way over the others it should be are we fundamentally compatible or fundamentally incompatible on this issue 

if the latter its better to part ways sooner rather than later 

for the record i never had or wanted children but it is such a huge decision that both people need to be really honest about it if he really wants kids sooner rather than later he needs to admit as much and make plans with a partner that feels that way too otherwise it just breeds pardon the pun deep resentments

its not fair to him or you for him to be with you pretending hes okay with the given timeline and secretly just hoping youll one day wake up and change your mind which sounds like what is happening 

or it was a blip and he was having an off day

someone offered higher and better but their inspection turned up several major  problems roofing foundation electrical plumbingsewer line

someone waived contingencies so their offer looked better but then the house didnt appraise or they still did their inspection and were willing to walk and lose earnest money so to smooth the sale over the seller lowered 

someone made a lower offer but it was all cash or a huge deposit and in the interest of a quicker sale  less risk a loan could go wrong the sellers took it

went through the same thing with the medical groups then i just went through my insurers list and made an appointment with a doctor covered by my insurance but not with any medical group 

your insurer has to provide you with a list of all doctors in your area that take their insurance so even if their online system is effed call them and they should email you a complete list good luck it sucks

heres a breakdown of what the fair housing act covers 

race  
color  
national origin  
religion  
sex including gender identity and sexual orientation  
familial status  
disability

familial status usually means you cant refuse to rent to a pregnant woman or people trying to adopt i have no clue what the agent is thinking 

i would say you are within your rights to say that all tenants living in the unit over 18 are subject to a background check
i dont know what to believe

but you do know your body is telling you walking on eggshells is what a human under duress fight or flight or freeze mode does to try and keep the person safe

you have internalized some of his manipulations as to why this is okay he has earlier trauma his work is stressful the bruises are from accidents even though throwing things is an intentional action not an accident

hes laid down the emotionally manipulative groundwork im the love of his life for you to keep upping your tolerance to be his wastebasket when he wants to toss anger into something but you know listen to your gut which is telling you none of this is okay and the inbetween good times are just reprieve moments from the next emotional bomb session
my feelings on airbnb which i had used for 10 years as a guest in the us  several countries are that 1 oversaturation  fastpaced growth have done it a great disservice 2 a lot of newer people who jumped into the game have zero experience with hospitality and arent cut out for it

in earlier years the only people that gravitated towards it had more inclination with hospitality

i used craigslist for years to buy and sell stuff i saw the same shift there most of the time you would be dealing with the best of humanity in pleasant interactions and all would be good it was fun to swing by a strangers garage have a short convo and pick up a very niche item then move on the occasional bad interaction or weirdo would be really sheisty though then there was a shift where just more clearly scamoriented postings than good ones 

my current theory is that any online platform has a window where only people truly interested in that thing are involved and as it gets larger it just becomes more unwieldy used to be about a decadelong shelf life now seems to cycle within 57 years
its a stimulant that helps make up for the perpetual lack of natural vitamin d
so my whole life i am the weirdo who is only attracted to people based on personality  not looks their physical attraction grows along with my fondness for them and getting to be witness to their actions that endear me conventionally hot people i can appreciate them but unless they have a personality to back up their looks i dont feel attraction

you are pretty young and being concerned with how others perceive you is pretty common insecurity especially during the phase of life when you are still figuring out who you are and how you want others to perceive you

i suggest you start noting when you are out things he does that you love small stuff make yourself more present to really see him in the world what you will probably see is the wonderful person you care for so start telling yourself in those moments how lucky you are to be with someone like that the internal shift towards yourself and your bf will help shut up the insecurities about the external world the more you also acknowledge how great he is the more you shift how other people perceive you as a couple

the out of his or her league stuff is bullshit that has no place in mature love and respect stop giving it headspace
the official term is democratic backsliding or autocratization 

while the article focuses on wealth inequity the shift in our supreme court the granting of corporations the same rights as people increase in the wealth gap are all more on par with an oligarchy than a democracy add bullying  threats now common for smaller elections school boards county positions county election offices goes along with that

plus our last election was the eradication of a standard democratic norm the peaceful transition of power so we are a few stages into backsliding now
cash out refinance and use it for investmentrental property

i wish people would stop watching youtube gurus on how to get rich quick schemes because being a landlord isnt passive easy income it should be viewed as a real pt job that is supplying a needed service 

you tap into the 300k for a heloc at 78 for a downpayment to buy an apartment or small rental in a crazyhigh market place needs some work got to cover mortgage and property taxes property management costs enough money set aside for any major repairs you arent recouping a large profit on that 

enjoy your home and be happy to get something in this market thats affordable in a few years if interest rates have come down take out a heloc to do some needed upgrades on your own property equity only becomes real money when you go to sell
my paranoid brain thinks but what if there is a fire and im already asleep with carbon monoxide poisoning someone rescuer tries the door then cant open it and moves on
i feel like too many organizations in the us at least tend to use cultish tactics or have very strong tendency to use cult of personality to get people to identify with them even if they arent really cults i have done my informal education and wont ever fall for it lol i even left a meditation retreat early once because i was like nope day 23 theyre suddenly feeding us less cult
nope sold a house in a gentrifying part of la county i never loved in 21 for double what i paid thinking it was the peak and id get back in in a year have been tracking ever since both in socal and a few spots in northern ca 

if priced at the top of the market we now have more sitting homes as if 3060 days wasnt what happened in a normal market anyway if underpriced in a decent area still getting a bidding war  moving more sales do seem to drop out of escrow but overall i think ca has some new normals baked in we arent ever going back to 2019 minus a major global financial catastrophe and even then theyll go back up within a few years  

i lived in la for too many years that i couldnt bring myself to pay 12 for a flipped bungalow in glassell park  i refuse to buy a 800k condo with high hoa fees that dont do much so my time there is done
la in the height of the frenzy i saw a burnedout husk of a home literal fire damage go for 12 in south pas if the location is in a good school district they wont mind raising their asthmatic kid near a freeway flipper is going to gut and put it back on for 12
so unless you are on the deed it is not your house 

what you do next is up to you make a financial agreement to pay rent that is more equivalent to your financial situation instead of half you pay less if you do not earn equal amounts stop funding repairs  projects hes your landlord or discuss with him that you want to own a home and need to start living your life in such a way that you can save your own money to do so or discuss with him if you two plan to get married and does it become joint property then or stay in his name only

time to lay cards on the table youll either reach a decision you are both happy with in the house and your relationship or you will realize you arent on the same page but never enter into next phase of relationship steps without full honest conversations about financials
i worded it poorly

heres the quote from the cdc

oral herpes caused by hsv1 can spread from the mouth to the genitals through oral sex this is why some cases of genital herpes are due to hsv1
so theres never a lot of training for teaching college except doing it on the fly in grad school when i first started i learned and made a lot of mistakes along the way

one thing that helped me is there are a ton of books on teaching college per certain subjects i ended up buying a bunch online lots on the theory of pedagogy not as helpful and some with practical assignments how to organize yourself etc etc it also really helps to make friends with some people who have more experience than you and ask for mentorship plus sit in on others classes also 15 of teaching is having some decent confidence and stage presence unfortunately that makes students stay engaged fake it until you make it

they probably wont let you go and if thats the case pick yourself up know that beginning teachers make mistakes and go find yourself some resources

edit also look for some resources for the depression that will help a lot too
i worded this poorly and am being downvoted so let me quote cdc

oral herpes caused by hsv1 can spread from the mouth to the genitals through oral sex this is why some cases of genital herpes are due to hsv1

the most likely answer is he gave it to you talk to a gynecologist
yeah i listen to way too many cult podcasts heard one on synanon and then would hear guests on other podcasts referencing their experiences at troubled teen schools again some still very much in existence and realized a lot of them seem founded on the same gross ineffective  destructive methodologies poor kids

did not know that fun fact though
took me years to learn there are two types of people i interact with on a more personal bossesfriendsfamily level those that get frustrated angry or upset with me  those that are really very patient and kind 

took me a few more years to realize the first type made me nervous to the point i was more likely to make mistakes around them drop and break things forget things interrupt them resulting in them getting angry whereas while i still made errors with the second group it wasnt really ever that big of a deal and lo and behold i made less of those types of errors around them because i wasnt goddamn walking on eggshells 

then i also started realizing half the time the first group was irritated or blowing up it was usually way above the pay grade for the mistake i made ie i didnt actively hurt them or do something cruel or unkind interrupting someone breaking something or forgetting something isnt really a good enough reason to yell at someone really there are no good reasons to yell at people imo 

tldr years of therapy helped me realize i tolerated abuse stemming from feeling inadequate due to adhd  my upbringing and it helped me either institute boundaries or really drop most of that first group out of my life
there are still schools like this in the us that are open although they may not be as severe 

the fight club bs comes from a cult in southern california in the 1970s that started as a way of helping junkies called the church of synanon run by a narcissistic leader 

the philosophy was a control method where theyd put a member on the hot seat and the group would yell all the horrible things they saw in the person to break their ego supposedly somehow even after synanon was shut down this idea moved into the troubled teen moneygrab system that was bigger in the 90s and 00s but is still around today 

same thing with policing anything the kids say to the parents just horrifying forprofit crap that destroys kids
according to battlestar galactica abusing toasters is how we end up nuking earth
low information diet dont discuss your job with her

you cant get her to stop judging you cant create an argument that will win her over and the job is important to you both financially and it seems you like it shes going to always be negative about it so keep it to yourself and find other things you both share to discuss instead if she ever brings it up first tell her it isnt worth discussing since it upsets her and youd like to avoid that

sometimes you just have to accept someone wont be happy for you and is too attached to their own ideas to let it go for one person sucks but it is the way it is and is especially with crunchy granola moms

edit saw your replies below get some therapy if you havent already you are stuck in a cycle of being mad at people who hurt you while also probably still looking for their approval its never going to happen you can only change yourself and your reactions
ha my first job in the bay area was at a local bakery where i made sandwiches handled deli slicers equipment and ovens i have fond memories of it but it was the late 80s so child exploitation was considered more runofthemill and i did always get my paycheck
no because the longer he spent with roman the more chances of roman just doing something atrocious to him he was too precious to be destroyed by the roy family curse
its a bit of a chicken and the egg situation is his complete lack of responsibility allowing him to avoid social situations and stay in a comfortable depression or does his depression prevent him from pursuing any responsibilities that would make him feel better

hed probably do well to get counseling and medication you cant force that on him but you can begin to start the conversation he may also benefit from some career counseling testing to find out what hed be good at or consider certification at a local community college but all that is something that happens after a bit of therapy and potential medication so there are some coping skills put into place

btw a lot of people entered reclusive states during the pandemic and never fully came back out of them its not uncommon  

but given hes lived a sheltered life  while alive your parents may have enabled him hes really lacking life skills by inheriting the home you also inherited their problem you dont have to enable him but you can only tell him if the current situation is to work out longer term between you two you need to see him get help for social anxiety andor depression then start helping himself more 

if hes completely resistant then let him know maybe it is best to sell the house and split the proceeds without any life skills hell likely blow through his in a certain amount of time youll have to decide how much you want to help him in this life
yeah a oneyear 13 drop when the peak was 30 increase over 2 year period is not that substantial of a drop 

it also seems very location  condition specific while it is great people arent snatching up 900k11 mil teardowns like crazy people anymore any decent house in a decent location is still going to sell for over asking 

the only thing that will bring about an actual crash would be a real longerlasting recession  longer period of higher mortgage rates even then house prices may stabilize at 2019 levels which were still fairly high
i did the uk one via my mother laws changed for those born before a certain year to go back and include mothers just required gathering documents birth certificates forms and paying fees  then swearing allegiance to the queen now the king i suppose at an embassy  the last part is weird because they dont make naturalized citizens do that but small hoop to jump through after that i got a passport via more forms

id be more inclined to find a lawyer or dual cpa to help with tax laws after emigrating but the citizenship part wasnt hard although i did it about 15 years ago so brexit may have complicated things but also the uk has gotten a better online system for bureaucracy since then

id hit up the nearest embassies andor consulates with questions prior to going straight to lawyers
op youve been just as selfish by taking items that were included in a sale 

you messed up on a contract deal get over yourself and fix it
uh you removed several fixtures  the dog did do damage the bathroom mirror one seems especially sneaky since you replaced it that is the kind of thing some shady sellers do with appliances sell with nice ones installed then switch them to cheaper ones

id offer 1500 2000 and get this over with

your realtor should have told you to leave everything that was bolted to the walls in place or if you wanted to take them you needed to put that in the contract your realtor absolutely should have advised you not to let people move in before funds were released either

edit looking at your replies i highly suggest taking some time to breathe through this and stop making this personal fork over a little bit of money lesson learned move on you are seeing something as a personal attack when it is a business mistake on your end and your realtors
i am actually prolandlords and believe it is a necessary service  am looking to take over a family rental to become one 

but then i read posts like this and think damn tossing out good tenants youve had for years because you feel you arent making enough  well at least i better understand the general disdain for landlords

give them notice to remove the dog
i mean in a twisted way narcissists like having people indebted to them and logan uses the murder to shame kendall plenty 

i think it more plays into the idea that logan mocks kendall for not being a killer in early seasons to take over the company  tells him he needs to be a killer 

kendall doesnt really become a logan replacement until after his mothers wedding when he drops the weight of guilt for being a murderer once he can disavow himself of any moral compass  internalized guilt and shame hes finally grown into his lovely daddys shoes
i would offer 6 months paid up front last months rent paid proof of savings and after 6 months see if landlord would accept a monthtomonth lease try also getting a letter of recommendation from a previous landlord that states you are a good tenant 

this way if they wanted you out they have a loophole after 6 months 

landlords are replying theyd all say no but you just need one to okay the offer depending on how competitive the market is in plenty of areas in the us rent has increased well beyond yearly incomes making the 3x income requirement harder and harder to fill realistically people are just paying more of their income to rent or mortgages now eventually the market has to catch up to realize this or units will just sit empty
by this logic though people lose good jobs all the time an employed tenant can also be out of work after a year
op your husband sucks on multiple levels he should be proud of you defend you and if his friends didnt snap out of it the first time he defended you he should have left the friend circle 

they are bullies and horrible people tell your husband this is nonnegotiable you will not subject yourself to people who disrespect you and call you names and that he cant see why thats offensive is telling on him
so it is a monthtomonth lease in ca i believe monthtomonth leases can give landlords the ability to raise rents but only twice per year they must give written notice  there is a cap if it is a standalone home then it is outside of any rent control and yes the landlord can raise rents at any time 

id ask if they can put into wording on the lease only once per year and capped by a  say 35 if shes talking about her property taxes then that is a one time yearly increase for her otherwise shes able to come to you with any kind of unreasonable charges  i wouldnt sign it

it happened to a friend of mine they got bedbugs in the place and the host had the gall to accuse them of bringing them in its always a possibility even in hotels although they tend to do better pest control but i check beds everywhere now
i mean did he do anything special in those 5 days to make you feel romantic some people feel desire all the time  some people feel it because the other person initiates intimacy with them and that makes them experience desire also when you are new things are different

anyway the way you can talk about things is to start the conversation
why dont you during regular meal times cook together watch a cooking video on a simple good meal and delegate tasks

i get being irritated or thinking someone is using weaponized incompetence but it seems he is willing to do the chore you just dont like what he makes  that hes asking you questions 

but if instead of asking him to take over when you are busy if you made normal meal times a shared fun job at least a couple times a week hed learn as he goes
fyi bedbugs bite in 2s and 3s in a line they call it breakfast lunch and dinner those are likely bed bug bites 

next time pull up all the bedding and look for small black or brown stains around the seams of any mattress id bag up my suitcase and toss all clothes in a high dryer 

id reply to the host saying after first night brother woke up to about 20 bites  a bug in the bed host was unconcerned  said it as mosquitoes  brother slept on the couch for remainder of stay  got no more bites

just keep it to the facts and be unemotional as to what exactly happened  dont be afraid to give bad reviews for hosts either
you dont have to be in this relationship you dont need him to start individual therapy and you certainly dont need a biased therapist to give you the approval to leave
two negatives make a positive
not in the forest as it upsets the trees and rabbits

i was there for over 15 years in the middle of that period i went away for about 3 yrs to another part of the country the south men in this area would chat you up if you were out on a saturday night then ask for your number then call you on a wednesday to plan a dinner date for the following weekend

while i never found love in that state either i would be mind blown every time a guy just acted like a decent interested human instead of texting you up at 2 am five weeks after asking for your number ha
fyi in this post  your replies it seems you are trying to present yourself as the reasonable one who wants to be  classy genuine  sincere and that your exs mom is the true shitstirrer 

while she may be one you come across as just as problematic the classy way to handle a breakup is to be polite when you see your ex but dont go poking around in petty emotional wounds or reinserting yourself into their life or familys life 

if the mother is so histrionic that your leaving without saying goodbye made her clutch pearls and faint then there is no apology that could salve that wound because the whole issue is stupid to begin with
oh no now i looked its heartbreaking op needs some therapy for selfesteem issues  why shes so afraid to just be alone for a bit 

shes also in la from experience its a tough town to date in
look there are a ton of other hateful people online i guess im okay

 he has acknowledged that his reactions are misogynistic and inappropriate but its the reality and he cant get through it

why would you want to help someone cope with their own internalized misogyny when they have expressed zero interest in changing and instead are claiming this is normal

this isnt on you to fix but it is on you to feel empowered enough to know you dont deserve this 

either he works on himself or for your own sense of self you leave you dont have to retraumatize yourself by putting up with someone dehumanizing you again
in king lear cordelia was actually good none of his kids are it could just as easily be based on richard iii but that would be an argument that tom swoops in macbeth or julius caesar and roman knives him in the final scene 

i mean its loosely shakespearean in that ken wins but it also destroys him which is really more traditional greek tragedy now that i write it out

wait shes your ex and you knew she was drama when you chose to be roommates

okay this one is on you
you arent going to get her to stop dating like another commenter suggested but you dont have to be the frontline audience to her drama

i adore having you as a friend and as a roomie but since youve gotten back into dating i dont have the bandwidth to keep cycling through your emotional ups and downs with guys when i am at home sometimes i just need to relax we can discuss anything else tell me about your day at work tv show plots blah blah shared interest but i am putting a moratorium on the saga of your love life discussions 

she may not take it well but all you have to do is continue being nice but shut down the guy talk the moment it happens
i used to work at a university tutoring center and most of the students that used it were foreign language students who needed help checking their english in final papers i never laughed at any of them why would i but i often delighted in how foreign language speakers would translate their own idioms into english or their use of adjectives and verbs were technically correct but so different from how native speakers construct sentences

i delighted in it because it often created a poetic use of english we native speakers cant access i found it to be really engaging and spoke to how we are all trying to explain our world

i get why it comes across more as patronizing but i think it is helpful to have a sense of humor about our own struggles with language there is a study that says one reason children are better at learning a second language is not that they arent selfconscious yet about making mistakes so theyll practice anywhere without editing themselves
i dont understand why hes so against my diagnosis

because rather than support you and learn hed rather have you think you are just a deficient human he can chastise 

he goes through the dsm5 criteria and just pulls out everything and says see you dont meet this or that says because i was diagnosed within one visit it must be wrong     

holy hell wtf ah it must be nice for him to be an unlicensed psychiatry  psychology expert i wonder what other forms of unearned expertise he has under his belt

and yes some types of adhd can hyper focus  be quite attentive 

suggestion tell him under no uncertain terms to get on board with supporting you or to eff off  you will no longer be discussing this issue with you you are both young so he isnt an authoritativedaddysmartsuperdoctor man hes just being a trash young guy who is diminishing his wife as you are getting help for adhd look into some counseling you may grow as you learn about your diagnosis hell either grow with you or try to hold you back if it is the latter you will need to know you can and do deserve better
its kendall because thats also the shakespearean ending the poison drips through is the line that speaks to the entire series
cbt is pretty much all about homework as others have said next session let her know that the adhd side of you is making doing assignments feel like another task to fail at and you are feeling overwhelmed can the two of you brainstorm solutions 

few 2 things that i can think of off the top of my head

1 video or voice record instead of writing down much easier just to pop open a voice record memo state datetimethought 
2 2 other option may be voice to text should be available via google docs in the uk ive found voice to text notes in one document make it easier for me to get something down rather than trying to do the writing
3 asking her to up praisereward or check ins if shes open to it would she text or email you something every few days thats just a little keep going write those thoughts down thing this is actually more adhd coaching than therapy but if her background is in social work she may be open to it this one works because you do the task in part not to let the other person down even if you are in such a low place you dont feel motivated to do it for yourself 

good luck the few occasions ive stuck with cbt type processes they can help it is trickier when the depressionanxiety is stemming from adhd for sure
email send the email stating per my texts on list dates the following repairs need attention list the repairs ask if he would prefer you pay for fixes and take the cost off of next months rent 

its more formal and should get a reply as for the key as others said just go get a spare made

herzliya is right by tel aviv but nice because its a little quieter i cant say much as to what living there as an expat will be like or the bureaucracy you will run into but its an easy area for speaking english  meeting other people from around the world plus the mediterranean is beautiful driving on the other hand is hell but im a nervous driver

ah i lived in la for decades la  bay area are both very hustle culture heavy areas 

the good news is la is vast if you are back for family and committed to staying you can find your people in my experience la takes a few years to find the niches you want to be in
wait people are either bragging about how much theyve traveled or they are not interested in foreign experiences you cant have both 

us is so regional youve kinda described the bay area though i suppose it could be like that in other cities i know that in ca in general people tend to find friendships through mutual interests as opposed to neighborhoods may want to look at some groups near you that involve an interest the friendly superficial thing is a generalization depending on your age making friends just gets harder and harder as you get older i find that the best friends ive made tend to be a handful of people i had to make an effort to get to know and sustain the relationship 

as for the jobmoneyschools talk thats definitely here in a more open and crass way ive found other cultures tend to do the classstatus stuff too just much more subtle or lowkey than we do in the us
ok hes still a bit of a sociopathic water hoarder for when the water wars come but i still find him the least offensive
i have zero sympathy for any of them they are wealthier than god and could have figured how to exit the family dynamic undergo a hundred years of therapy and go off and be happy planting roses and growing pluots traumatic childhoods aside as adults they have free will and access to more resources than 99 of the people on earth with traumatic childhoods money isnt happiness but it provides options 

the only characters i tend to like would be willa  conner conner even if his political theories are narcissistic and thinly fleshed out and willa may not have the actual talent for her playwriting aspirations but they dont actively go about damaging others just live in their weird little fantasy wealth bubble

romans sociopathy can be fun in moments to watch his abuse may have been more physical than the other two but he was always the kind of person whod torture children and animals
some people me really cannot handle focussing on getting to know more than one person at a time 

i know some people can meet several different people in one week i think thats fine too i however would never push someone to be exclusive at the just texting or talking phase and who else they are dating or speaking with is their business until such time as weve actually established a reallife connection 

my point is could be love bombed or simply how they navigate online dating be clear in whatever your boundaries are  hey if you want to stop chatting with others thats your choice i prefer to stay open when getting to know people until such time as weve been actually dating and agreed to exclusivity 

if they respect that you are fine if they give you pushback eff em
handicapped spaces are important but anything aside from those if the imperative is to ensure equal access to the beaches for all californians then wed have jitneys set up that go around  make stops at several inland locations in the early morning take people to the beach for the day then return in the early evening 

there used to be a service like that in the summers in la that went specifically from an area like altadena to santa monicamalibu to help people get to the ocean for the day dont think it has run in many years but getting that going  leaving more outdoor spaces for people to enjoy the ocean makes more sense than building more car infrastructure
my grandmother was born in the us alaska but went back to ireland as a teenager then married an englishman and settled in england she spent the majority of her 99 years in the uk being very proud of her american citizenship even had a american ladies club she attended went through ww2 in london raised two kids paid british taxes and eventually died in her home in the countryside but never dropped that she was a us citizen from her identity 

for some people i think the point is enjoying always being a foreigner
the us for all its current and past problems is probably the one place in the world where the end goal for immigration is usually integration especially for the 1st gen kids born here its become more loudly mainstream nativist in the past 510 years but for decades even  if we didnt quite live up to it we liked to describe the us as a successful melting pot

some of the proudest americans are immigrants who eventually got citizenship probably because of the number of years it takes and hoops to jump through ironically they tend to know more basic american history than the average americanborn citizen in order to pass their citizenship exam
they feel rejected in their home countries so are more bothered by not being accepted in a new country either

i feel like the experience of not fully identifying with your home country or feeling accepted could set an individual up mentally to be better at handling the stranger in a strange land syndrome it depends if the person saw moving as a way to find acceptance vs taking the skill of experiencing things as an outsider and applying it to a positive outsider experience
eh if they are just washing it in a colander and little bits are going down that shouldnt be breaking a garbage disposal still its normal to rinse rice ive done it long since before tiktok existed it does cook better and rice is really dirty like picking stones and rinsing dirt out of dried lentils 

i thought they were dumping bags of it in 

this all is likely to be the reset button and the disposal is really delicate so if the motor goes too hard on anything it sets itself off they might be running it for too long its plugged into an outlet that cant carry the electrical etc 

first thing they should do is learn to look under the sink see if the reset button has popped and push it back in second thing is buy one of those little sink strain things for the drain
you take a broom handle and jam it in till you can turn the little rotator knifey bits then hit the reset button under the sink at least thats what my old landlord use to do

also a little bit of cooked rice shouldnt break a garbage disposal unless they are putting gallons of it down and letting it swell or putting in uncooked
been an ongoing problem here for several years the farther south slosanta barbara the more inured people are at fire season and the following mudslide season much of slo county is inland and is high brush higher heat more fires 

right near the coast the air quality is always much much better but depending on the fire season you still might get a few days or weeks of reddish air with high pollutants during the malibu fires several years ago the coastline in southern california was deep red for the longest ive ever seen it 

also right near the coast anywhere in ca will be premium rent and housing costs
i agree with this 100 i think its one of those things thats low priority to some people high priority to others 

i come from one of the most carreliant cities in the us la that people dream of expatriating to and many expats that land there love it especially uk to la or anywhere in ca due to weather i lived there for 20 years and pretty much burned out part of my brain on commuting dealing with road rage people insane traffic at all hours of the day stopped going out in the evening if it meant drivingparking 

also as a dual citizen grew up spending a lot of time in the uk id always come back from visits feeling physically better  mentally calmer then want to cry when i had to get back into my car for daily life
in california i think its like 90k tjs pays its employees well and has great benefits they just dont want them to unionize
oh thanks love a good new word
this is hysterical 

reminds me when i was a kid i swore tina turner was singing whats love but a secondhand abortion when she sang whats love got to do with it
she added an edit they have a kid together 

he either locked her down with a baby or she naively ignored the glaring warnings and still had a kid with him
im finding myself freezing like a deer in headlights 

yeah thats a common trauma response fightflight or freeze

x200b

i found out he was on dating apps behind my back

so hes projecting his cheating onto you he is a cheater even if he isnt actively doing so right now he still thinks like a cheater and therefore has decided everyone is like him so rather than change he is controlling you 

x200b

we have a new baby

oh god this is not a situation that is going to go away you have a baby with a controlling cheater
i would absolutely let them know in a very polite professional manner while you were happy with their work while purchasing the ghosting and failed promise at the end means you will not be referring them to 3 new clients nor using them to purchase a second property 

you cant report it once everythings signed and hes gotten the keys in your hands his job is technically over but a good realtor will keep in touch and continue to offer some reasonable support to a client because half their business is generating leads 

dude should learn from unprofessional behavior
as long as you didnt waive inspections then it is probably what you need to do right now to be competitive 

if you can afford the monthly payments  property taxes then you stayed within your budget and if they take your offer then you can always negotiate down for any issues found during inspections make sure your home inspector has good reviews and id also do my due diligence on sewer line and roof inspection separate from a general home inspection 

paying over asking and buying a lemon sucks paying over asking and getting the home you want  general state of things now
my therapist discounted that i could have had trauma or anything like it caused by masking because as she said my trauma caused my adhd not the other way around

if you like this therapist then it is worth bringing up this sentence in therapy next session and explaining why it upsets you 

your therapist may have crackpot theories she may have failed to explain herself well you may have misinterpreted her in session part of therapy esp for people with cptsd is learning we can speak up to people who we think see us wrong and they will still be there for us if she is a good therapist and the right one for you you should be able to resolve this in therapy

now she may double down or further invalidate you in which case i am sorry but maybe shes not the right therapist for trauma work for you but you still will have spoken up for yourself and how you view your own bodymind  diagnosis
you are looking at this incident in the context of larger behavioral patterns asking people to judge the incident outside of any context i dont think you can get a fair take on that

incident alone id say it deserved a discussion where both parents agree the creek is off limits for now or a walk down there to as a family to assess the poison oak situation if it was only in certain areas and obvious then you can tell the kids where they could play they go into it at that point it was on them is it everywhere okay off limits both parents act like a team

in your situation you are trying to get her to parent for you you have to make a unilateral decision and that system is failing the kids know you both arent on the same page  arent a team their own emotional development isnt going great because mom is checked out they have learned to play one parent off the other

id highly suggest you look into individual therapy for yourself if your wife wont seek help or go to couples counseling heres why you are the enabler of a dysfunctional family unit right now even though you are doing what you can to keep everything together but taking on that role youve also allowed your wife to stay comfortable in neglecting her own mental illness and neglecting the kids 1 it may help if she sees you take that initiative for yourself  she may be more open to help 2 at the very least it will help you decide if this situation is sustainable feel less like you have to bring things to reddit as you learn to understand better whats happening to you and your own reactions in these situations 

edited to add good luck it is a lot
are you quoting the film chinatown

la is a medditerean climate joshua tree mojave and those areas well outside of la county are desert climates 

in plenty of parts la has much better native plants restoration than the bay area esp individual homes that have given up green lawns for natives in the past 10 years 

as for parks they arent green spaces like golden gate ie manmade or cultivated while there are some invasive species in the areas i listed most of those park areas are chaparral griffith park or santa monica mts for example are a wide expansive set of trails through public lands

we do have too many golf courses though
read through the comments got to several of your replies that are way more illuminating than your original post your wife has depression she is completely checked out right now  you are not sure she even likes being a mom you have to remind her to be kind to her own kids

at the same time you have one neurodivergent kid the oldest you describe as emotionally immature who doesnt feel responsible towards younger siblings acting like mom  a middle child out in the world trying to prove how tough he is middle child stuff  trying to prove he doesnt need a mom

your wifes mental health is impacting your kids 

couples counseling for communication and she needs individual therapy  doctors visits get to the bottom of the depression if it has been going on for years she has clinical depression which will not magically go poof away on its own is it hormonal or chemical imbalance has your wife been tested for adhd asd adhd and asd are genetic and frequently kids who are diagnosed with it help a parent realize they too are neurodivergent or that they had a parent who was women with it often go undiagnosed especially if they are smart enough to do well or okay in school and years of living with it without any support or education can lead to clinical depression
it turned to crap in the last year because you got married in her mind now you wont leave her and she can let who she wants to be out

she could have any number of mental health problems unless she wants to get help she wont change in the meantime shes grooming you to start walking on eggshells cede to her version of reality and to tolerate the same kind of abuse you grew up with

id ultimatum this she either agrees she has a rage problem and she needs  gets help or you need to leave

edit read your other comments she says this is just who she is  complete crap she likes taking her emotions out on you and wont change get out
because theyve been sold a bag of lies by the wedding industry that marriage is supposed to start with a bended knee proposal in an idyllic setting that someone who takes professional photos nearby just so happens to capture the moment then it goes from there 

people cant talk about the nuts and bolts of their relationships 5year plans financials housing goals marriage timelines kid timelines but they want an entire lifelong committed relationship to be birthed from unicorn farts and fairy dust
i know this situation is at least half my own fault 

nope completely skewed power dynamic she was inappropriately building intimacy with you and her dumping her divorce stuff on you was also bs no offense but no 18yearold kid gives good advice about a marriage falling apart she was using you as an emotional crutch and then set up a scenario to seduce you i am guessing afterwards she feels ashamed enough to not continue the pattern 

while this is a terrible thing for you to have to experience you do need to remove yourself from the situation but it should not negatively impact your career aspirations back off of her for a while  start looking for internships or other opportunities in this field to make contacts then reach out very professionally via email and ask her for a letter of recommendation she may or may not do it but she should after you have that letter put her out of your mind 

if you are still feeling emotional fall out do not be afraid to speak to a counselor you were taken advantage of and it can impact a lot of facets of your life without your realizing it but you did not destroy anything
alright if you really cant get out of there and need to finish up school then deny him a huge drama scene or hashing it out tell him you need some time  he sleeps on the couch then carry on with life he brings it up you need some time etc etc 

it absolutely will not work for 3 months but it may buy you about a month of reprieve if you need to find a 3rd place outside of schoolwork and home to do your studying like a library or cafe 

basically grey rock his cheating ass
la county is huge lots of concrete throughout but some neighborhoods are tree lined pasadena comes to mind and there is access to huge swaths of hiking and green spaces griffith park san gabriels mts hacienda hills santa monica mts

the difference is you have to drive to them
buy in spring because thats when neighborhoods are at their peak noisy go to the areablock you are looking at at varying times of day and night plus weekends and walk around walking is different than being in your car you see more stuff and get a better feel 

when ready to buy do a little googling to see if you can find out who owns the neighbor houses are the owneroccupied for a long time or rentals air bnb rentals means having a high turnover of neighbors so you may get along with someone and then the next family in is noisy air bnbs are a nogo ultimately you can never predict the future and people near you can sell to whoever so you have to go on faith 

look for homes with good windows  solid insulation older windows more noise homes above street level by a bit are better than homes below street level for how sounds carry 

i am noise sensitive while there are definitely neighborhoods that have a culture of quiet they tend to skew older and wealthier at the end of the day assume you will be hearing life around you in a much different way than when you live on an acreage think leaf blowers and construction etc and look into playing calming music and other things in the home to mask
hello child your inability to hide your emotional reactions around me due to my shitty parenting makes me uncomfortable perhaps youd like a pill for that

1 take some time off for just you and your partner just because they paid for the vacation doesnt mean you have to be around them 247 go off on your own for a bit or book a dinner just the two of you
2 theres a little box where any hurtful comments from parents go into you do not respond in real time to the hurtful comment other to shut it down and not engage or take the bait said box can be emptied at a later point postvacay when safe to do so
3 enjoy the good parts

sorry but screenshot all the deleted texts and save them to a cloud server only you have the password for and contact a lawyer

maybe you want to make it work and i wouldnt judge you for that if thats your ultimate decision but you should also protect yourself in case it is heading to divorce proceedings
that book he mentions  the four turnings is beloved by steve bannon  trumps former white house chief strategist who is more than a bit of a crackpot  was also obsessed that the us should be getting into a war over islands in the south china seas very much a burn it all down guy who got fired before he was able to i think he now runs a school for fascists in italy or something 

bigger picture the chances of major war or climate catastrophe based on the cycles of history  the current issues with the environment are quite high but i dont think we should be hoping for it
i could never be with someone who refuses to ever laugh when i make a joke or who drags me when i am just trying to tell them something dude sounds like a soulcrushing clown
the last time i had an issue as a guest i ran things up the chain and made the biggest professionalsounding stink i could and didnt drop it until i got a refund

i was asking for a partial refund and got a full refund i am pretty sure they made a mistake in my favor  but being persistent was the only way i got anything to happen i didnt sit around waiting for them to get back to me

that said i no longer use the service it was a fantastic way to travel about 10 years ago
if you are young you have zero things keeping you then trying it out cant hurt also its bullshit that neither sister invites you to christmas unless you had some grave falling out seems very callous 

i think as long as you dont view a move to a new country as a solution to fixing inner problems but making your outer life align more with what you want to see then its always great to try an adventure
people are defending this and i dont get it i think your response is ethical and the fact that you as nonclinical staff find it offputting is understandable if they are talking with you about a session it is not because they expect you as administrative staff to have clinical insight that would help someone but because they want to gossip unload vent not your job to offer that to them they can vent with other therapists or their own therapist

most clients would be devastated to know of this behavior it speaks poorly of the clinic you work at and i am guessing that is because it is run by someone who has these issues  comes from the top

next time a coworker dumps information on you that makes you uncomfortable i would just say as someone in an administrative role i am uncomfortable knowing this much about a patients private information as to what goes on in session  and end the convo they will either respect that and clean up or ice you out but if they respond to a reasonable request like that in a petty way its more proof they are in the wrong field its a toxic work environment for you
because this post isnt about providers speaking among themselves or making dark jokes its about them mocking patients  laughing about them in front of administrative staff to the point that the staff in question ie op feels its questionable enough to post on here 

want to vent to another therapist about a patient without using names okay want to go to your own therapy session and complain about them understandable but mocking them in meetings where there should be some expectation of professionalism is offputting
where i am in the us only 50 of cars on the road use their blinker regardless of brand using your blinker would be telling the enemy your plans and then the enemy could stymie those plans
this actually varies state by state in ca you must stop at a red to turn right then if it is clear you can go i did it in louisiannastopped then turned on a red and i got a citation
oh you can get a ticket for jaywalking in the us in plenty of states its just that it is a law that isnt enforced in any meaningful way after being illegal for years california recently changed the law making it legal if it doesnt cause a crash which is ambiguous at best
sent a message hehehehehehehehehehe 

you are being way to polite with air bnbs response raise bloody hell with them and get more angry you should be escalating this until you get the platform to contribute to the cost of a higher airbnb will it work i dont know but i would try

can a host cancel a reservation to make more money probably ways to go about it yes but to do so and taunt you is an ahole that should be banned from their server i would be agitating for a much bigger response and i would not stop beating home that the guy will cost you 1200 and mocked you 

send support a text message and screen shot his message
i honestly dont want to go comfort her at this point

you arent being too sensitive you are being insensitive 

but you can go alone if not please dont be annoyed about this

someone took off a weekend shift and was really looking forward to getting to do something fun with her new husband and friends after not having any weekend fun i assume for awhile

when you go to tell her your response is to request she shouldnt be annoyed

you not feeling up to going is fine i dont even think its that big of a deal that you could tolerate tv but didnt want to risk a bar and i get being tired out even after a migraine has passed only all you had to say is hey i know you were really looking forward to this id love for you to go have fun  i am sorry im not up for it i want to make this up to you when i am feeling better

not try to get ahead of her reaction and tell her not to be annoyed
forgetting procons list which you can write yourself for the things that matter to you i always think that you only have one life and to experience different things at different phases of it is a luxury some people never get
some of my most comfortable  treasured relationships are with people i can sit quietly beside to me its a form of really nice intimacy to be even on a road trip and not have to speak the entire time
im from a vhcol area and there were articles and anecdotal stories starting ages ago before this current house market but back when rents were starting to shoot up in that city  of couples who stayed in the same rental or home even after breaking up because of cost of housing 

give it 5 more years and well be getting think pieces on the subject i swear
you two are fundamentally incompatible he should know you at a deep enough level to know his idea of work for you is not something youd consider failing that he should drop it immediately once he received a no 

finally say you did earn enough money for a deposit on a home off your bum pics whyd you want his lazy noncontributing ass on the title with you
one flaw in the older downsize folks wont downsize anymore is that plenty of the boomers who bought suburban family homes in the early 80s  never moved now have more equity in their homes than mortgages left for them to sell means a cash sale to buy their next downsized home mortgage rates dont matter in ca there are a lot of really nice 55 gated communities where prices on condos and homes are capped so if you went to sell your 4 bedroom suburban empty nest home for 15 2 mil cost of houses here you can easily get into a nice 2 bedroom in a gated community wit amenities for 750k cash again this is very location dependent 

i agree though that a lot of currently bought starter homes for this generation will become longerterm homes we used to see people postboomer gen more likely to sell and move up in 57 years i think that cycle is over
i know thats sort of my sarcastic point people who are claiming that those will who bought with low mortgage rates will never sell are missing the fact that over time life happens it wont be everyone of course  in the case of divorce for people who can refi at a higher rate and buy someone out it will be okay 

for a lot of other people job changes divorce death etc will make selling the reasonable option same for the subset of panic buys during the pandemic and crazy market when folks chose houses they really didnt like just to get in eventually in the next 510 yrs they probably will make the choice to sell if they can make the move and recessions are cyclical maybe the current cycle is a prolonged period of healthy employment numbers but it is unlikely looking to the future that is a foreverandever factor

im sure many low mortgage rate folks will stay and enjoy their forever homes while i very much doubt a major housing crash i also dont think the current stalemate market  low inventory is a permanent state maybe a decadelong one but not permanent 

everything is a casebycase scenario  highly localized though
divorcee duplexes
this woman was friends with ops mom when she started sleeping with her married friends husband 

dont get me wrong ops father is 100 morally culpable for cheating on and leaving his wife but him being surprised his 2nd wife is a backstabby piece of work given how they met
you make an agreement no politics at the birthday breakfast you break the agreement and make a little offhand comment then proceed to be upset that the other person is upset and doesnt defend his own kid because it is more important to have another man chime in and tell him he is correct even if that guy starts yelling at his kid you can tell he was dizzy with happiness that he got a backup person 

he takes zero responsibility for his own shitty behavior even when he is trying to paint himself as reasonable
so the thing that would drive me crazy is if any extraneous noise from its generators carried i assume it isnt near the property at all and ten acres should mean when you are at the home you cant hear it but i would walk around and see how noticeable it is once you are in real quiet industrial sounds tend to stick out more

abstract how many couples remained married between 20222042 despite desperately wanting to divorce due to onceinalifetime low mortgage rates

article so you are going to stay shackedup with your divorced husbandwife because of that low mortgage rate here are 10 ways to decorate
my god being alone would be a better option than this what happens when you are sick does he laugh at you when you are in pain 

let me ask you this what would you say or do if he came to you and he had been sad would you have the ability to have empathy and be a little comforting if so maybe you arent so low eq as you are making yourself to be 

partnership in life means going through tough things with another person you deserve help
hey its okay it makes a lot of sense that after a year of texting he earned your trust 

please get help or talk to someone at rainn the national hotline for sexual assault its important to have a safe person to speak with bigger picture youve been through abuse for a long period of time and it takes time to undo that i hope you can or have had access to therapy and support
 i am definitely going to hurt her feelings and it might have a long term effect 

her feelings are not your responsibility and if a reasonable boundary and request from you causes her to remain resentful for years thats on her 

 she might spend a long time questioning me and bringing up things to make me feel guilty for making this choice

you and your husband come up with one or two sentences 3 max that describe your boundary and decision succinctly kindly and firmly begin it with a positive 1 we love that you are excited about our child 2 then the reason they cant come keep it short advised by a medical professional it will be too much stress 3 the offer youre making instead

she throws stuff at you repeat the statement drags out to long you get off the phone by saying this i hear that you sound frustrated i am going to get off the phone to let you process i hope you consider our offer 

stop fearing your mom will dump you or she controls this situation she wants to be in her grandchilds life she will need to learn how to respect your boundaries as a parent the moment she sends shitty youtube videos state these are not helpful i will be deleting them she gives bad advice say i use my doctor for advice on vaccines one sentence answers then stop engaging on the topic she goes off longer get off the phone 

you need to learn how to give them clearly and politely and hold onto boundaries without fearing her reactions but you actually have the power in this situation good luck
so no dont contact him congratulations on learning a painful life lesson at an ageappropriate moment in life sometimes people say a bunch of crap they dont really mean planning a year head to your anniversary after only dating 4 months bringing up living together dropping hints about wanting you to get along with his parents all fantasy horseshit he was making future plans as a way to play games not because the intention was to follow through 

you were in the early stages of getting to know each other my personal theory is it is usually around the 3 or 4 month part when someone starts to reveal who they are without trying to be on their bestest behavior all the time now you know who he is 

mourn for a bit feel shitty then take the lesson and apply it to the next guy
oh i discovered geoguesser one weekend played compulsively and was pretty decent at it but then never played again it was fun to zoom around different cities though
he gave you 33 days notice what he did was legal what you are trying to do isnt 30 days notice to quit means just that they are quitting after the 30 days is up

edit correction 34 days given may has 31 days in it
i had a former annoying neighbor that was both invasive everything was his business and a bit of a hoarder and crazy one day i smelled a seriously high kerosene fuel burning for about 3 hours smoke everywhere i figured the nutjob wanted to grill some steak and didnt know not to use a bottle of lighter fluid

nope that asshole was smoking out a beehive on his property so all these poor colony collapse bees came into my yard to die 1000s of bees flopped on my lawn sadly buzzing and moving in confused circles for several days before they shriveled up i got to go outside and look helplessly at the slowmoving bee massacre that was my yard
i had a neighbor reroof his house himself during the pandemic instead of 35 days of a crew getting in getting out it was about 3 months of that dude and his nail gun slooooowly placing every goddamn roof shingle and poppoppopping it down for about 3 or 4 hours a day 

like a form of goddamn torture it was i looked online and he hadnt gotten it permitted and i felt so petty and going crazy at month 2 that i called the county then it stopped for a month victory only to start back up for another month crushing sadness
at first i was thinking maybe your father abused your mom or there are details you are missing

doesnt matter a parent should never put your brother in the position your mom has chosen she has no right to manipulate him into cutting you out and it makes me assume there are other things shes manipulated him on over the years even his girlfriend is spinning out over these demands your mom has a whole host of people shes managing to keep in her orbit and try to control

reach out and tell him you love him and you will always be available to him but that you are not following a request to control who or who isnt in your life from a parent you have no connection to id add if his mom loved him she would not be placing the burden of her resentments onto him suggest he look into therapy because he should not have to take on this much of your mothers resentments and be so controlled by her
true it doesnt work in all areas though you can get a gist of things 

pretty much all of new orleans can get noisy if theres any festival in town but the french quarter is especially bad if you like to sleep and not listen to revelers street vomiting under your charming balcony
ah the collective you not the individual you 

i lived in a liberalleaning part of la for years that bordered on a very red county  we had are trump voters  trump flag people so very familiar with the incorrect perception that la is solely some liberal paradise i think the misperception is true of california in general

anyhoo i have edited it to remove my snark and apologize for misreading tone
im so neurotic that prior to booking i open up google maps and hone in on the small area air bnb shows without exact address before booking and you can google street maps view to see if it is a meh part of town
same goes for real estate postings that do this i now have a biased assumption all the brightened and whitened closeups of a bowl of lemons on the kitchen counter with a soft focus background are just an attempt to hide some moldy neglected grout
my husband announced to me yesterday that he wants to renounce his us citizenship hes had since birth and claim danish citizenship

wait does it even work that way or was he already a dual citizen and feels he needs to make a political statement to unamerican himself

anyway i am not sure how much this sub can help because this sounds more like a marriage issue than an emigration one like a partner stating they want to make a unilateral decision that impacts the entire family rather than open up a discussion is never a healthy thing
are there no hotels around you for 200 per night so he can have a hotel room

i will get downvoted into oblivion because this sub is mostly people who run airbnbs but airbnb has changed over the years and it really lost its charm with me as a traveler 12 years ago i used it to travel around the world and had great experiences i would now either look to hotels with small kitchenettes a real b  b or if i want to pay airbnb prices go straight to a corporaterun vacation rental company in my chosen destination many of the airbnbs posted now are run by a corporate property management company anyway  the listings can make it difficult to tell id rather use a company that has its own website and contact numbers than try to resolve issues through airbnbs platform 

it sucks because i am sure there are still some great ones but with even critical reviews being removed  a huge oversaturation of people doing it too many wild cards you kind of have to brace yourself now and think this may be great or it may be terrible
buy a trash house and get a new hobby house repairs buy something with good plumbing electrical and roof learn how to fix interior bleh 

this may be contrarian advice on this sub but if you can find a home that means your mortgage  property taxes will be the equivalent of your rent you plan to stay in the home for 57 years and you can learn to be handy and sink a lot of free time plus money into repairs you would be better off with a shitty starter home in a good area now than trying to get in in 5 years i italicized in a good area because for the intent of one day selling and moving up a shitty house in a shitty area may very well drop in value over time markets are unknown

edit i see others addressing this but my advice here is skewed because you live in st louis and it really is one of the cheapest cities in the us your incomes  deposit amount more than cover you for a 250k house
 i last lived here la is still a huge area of about 10 million people county at least  i think that reflects a wider spectrum of viewpoints represented on the sub

dear friend i addressed your concerns thus my point the la sub is more split this is what we call reading comprehension
in true blood hes at least a loveable asshole
green tea gen mai matcha and a turkey sandwich is my go to ltryptophan in turkey  ltheanine in the green tea is a perfect combo for calm but active and focused brain
most of the time that grass thats where a sidewalk should be is owned by the county and is for public access even without a paved sidewalk on it he likely doesnt own it but its his responsibility to maintain it next time you can tell him to call the cops and youll wait while they explain to him not to make dumb calls to the police 

or just cross the road to avoid him old people get weird
as a former angelino who is now in the bay area and on both subs bay area subs in general suck its very complainy las sub is partly bad news crime jokes about meth on the subway but also nice things about the city and lostfound pets

i wouldnt say its all astroturfed its also a subset of residents in the bay area  definitely a more conservativelibertarian bubble now than when i last lived here la is still a huge area of about 10 million people county at least  i think that reflects a wider spectrum of viewpoints represented on the sub
people are going on about your bf being a git for wanting bigger boobs but what gets me is his friend disrespected  sexualized you and from his reaction trying to hide it this was an ongoing discussion or joke between them 

who cares about him finding you sexually attractive at this point hes a disrespectful twat
i swear i learned so much when i went into nordstroms and had the ladies in the lingerie department actually do a proper fitting on me they make you try on a bunch of bras in a certain range then look at how they fit and actually teach you your proper size apparently most of us wear band sizes that are too big  should go down in band size but up in cup size its all very confusing
there actually is its complicated but the smaller the band size then the smaller the cup size even if the letter stays the same a 36b could also likely fit a 34c 

nonetheless ops boyfriend is a git
i feel like wine is totally appropriate if the house is in wine country  go for it people visiting are clearly there for wine usually and something local is nice otherwise not everyone drinks and even people who drink dont always drink wine 

a neater host gift is something that represents the area local honey or something
some of these were discussed and shed read them and made a post with ever detail about him and me saying that our kids should be taken away and that neither of us are fit parents

the mother based the accusations directly from texts between her daughter and the husband and people are reacting strongly so i assume there was so highly problematic behavior  no made up accusations although it may have been from the past  no longer relevant andor taken out of context
i am glad youve had a positive experience the mild weather is its own special benefit too i will certainly miss it when i go
similar to in new orleans where the question is how you doing and the correct answer is how you doing back 

nobody actually knows how anyone is doing but the question has been properly asked
thanks for the thoughtful reply i agree but i feel like bay area and south bay are a super separate microcosm within the us even when it comes to suburban diversity i think almost 40 of an area like santa clara are immigrants 2nd gen or people here on visas so the diversity of cultures living within same neighborhoods here is much higher than even other metros i find friendliness throughout the south bay to be very hitormiss since ive been back but i am not really tied into my current neighborhood

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

i lived in the south 3 years and even there i still think its really regional still atlanta not so much new orleans almost every person who crosses your path ive been in small towns in texas  mississippi and would call them extremely unfriendly to outsiders
dont try to hold her accountable but do tell her youd like to help her find help and its a topic you wont discuss with her 

id frame it this way i feel you are making selfdestructive choices id like to help you find a therapist you can speak with i know your dad and is marriagedivorce troubles may have impacted you growing up  wasnt the greatest example so i would love to see you find a healthy way to love

thats my offer to help you find help but i wont listen to you discuss your choice in a partner or any issues you are having when you tell me they are married 

none of this is about love or sex even though she may frame it that way she likes the power of being chosen over someone else she doesnt know how to be a friend to herself or others if shes not ready to get help thats on her but you dont need to be part of her drama cycle and bear witness to her blowing up others lives
will never do meth again

oh be careful friend you know how gross it made you feel but its a highly highly addictive drug for a reason put that on a postit on your mirror  block the guys number and grindr profile because you may get out of this totally fine but only if you really never do it again
pretty much any smaller region with a huge wealth gap and inequality in living standards is going to have crime silicon valley has the top 1 of households holding 48 times more of the total wealth than the bottom 50 there was a very healthy middle class here about 20 years ago thats now hanging on by a thread 

johanneseburg would be an example of this on steroids given it is a postapartheid apartheid city with intense wealth divide and high violent crime coming out of a recent enough history of total oppression  violence that certainly went well beyond even us redlining laws or racial covenants of which ca historically had many 

crime has for the most part been on the increase globally in metro areas since the pandemic along with higher incidents of car accidents at the same time there is a global housing crisis in many major metro areas that intensified from 2020 on i dont think the issue is solely a bay area one and there are more mitigating factors here as well its just whatever cracks were there pre2020 have gotten amplified since in many places 

the one thing we have that some other countries dont have necessarily is a lot more guns which also doesnt help
ar7e you m0cking me
imo people dont have common sense and its all about me me me independence is awesome but it seems like everyone wants to be better than everyone else here and has no respect for anyone else

its funny because the very thing you hate about here you dislike the inverse in japan social pressure to conform  not rise above ones station  it also bums you out

one thing i am a firm believer in there are cultures and places that are better intrinsic matches for us based on how we like to navigate the world but also that any move will never fix issues that are more internal

i am currently stuck in the south bay for family issues lived in la for 20 years  now back here probably for at least another year but planning on my exodus because i do have duel citizenship elsewhere

i am trying to also use this time to learn how to feel positive about the things that i know i do like  love about ca so that i dont take that frustration and irritation with me when i leave i take a nature walk every day or at least walk around the neighborhood and i make an effort to note the things that are pretty here once a month try to see the ocean there is a lot you can find thats lovely and i appreciate that even though it is no longer my place or thing it is still an area that people from around the world would love to live in so i must be able to find a few good things the weather is nice i am grateful for the kind of produce that is reasonably local to ca i focus on the friendly people i meet and try to ignore some of the ruder ones

thats all the advice ive got edit spelling
offer to celebrate her birthday with her on another night or during a different part of the day and plan to do something special for her if its been 4 months and she wants to keep you out of this party for social reasons that will make it less stressful for her thats her business you not caring isnt the issue its what she wants
i assume that means the price increase in value is capped so not the best way to build starter home equity moreover while i dont think most people need half the sq footage they have to raise a family 2 bedrooms  1 bath at 1000 square feet is only comfortably doable if you have one young small child that doesnt move around a lot  you dont have 2 wfh adults 

condos would be a better option here but so many come with prohibitive hoas and not much to show for the yearly costs
most of it i think is just to get a rise out of people and fight with people which he enjoys  
  
my husband has bluntly said i dont care about that its boring 

so the issue isnt politics its that you married a man who is the living embodiment of a nihilistic online troll who enjoys fighting with people 

there are ultimately a 1000 things people can discuss in this world the social dynamics of meerkats planetary solar systems fashion music etc politics is often an undercurrent in most daily things but there are topics where they arent omnipresent 

the issue isnt you both have nothing to talk about it is that he is actively showing you he doesnt want to engage with you 

i mean i would have a get it together  become a better partner conversation with him or explain given you dont want to cohabitate with a phonescrolling lump for the remainder of your days that you will be packing up
its a sort of oldtimey mentality that can really be as innocent as wanting to be generous with nothing more implied

does he earn more than you i know some people feel very put off taking from others that they know arent as well off if you are worried its about him having feelings but hes never crossed a line in any other manner then thats really on him to sort through

i do know that if it was someones birthday and i knew they were like this i would have excused myself to go to the bathroom and instead snuck my credit card to the waitress to pay the bill thats the most too late ive treated you way to do it with people like this rather than offer when the bill arrives knowing they will refuse

edit seeing your comments regarding offering to pay dont insist or wait for the bill again hand off your card and have it already taken care of just tell him when the paid bill comes for you to sign that you want to repay him balance can be important in a dynamic
clicked on richmond one and any house for sale at 400k with no interior photos is a teardown even in richmond its also 800 sq feet

edit and now looked at the one in oakland now i think you are being sarcastic that doesnt need sweat equity it needs to be burned to the ground for carrying diseases

the one on manila street is nice though
 includes op that one pesky office mime who has to chat
maybe they are mimes who have to make their own bookings for mime events so phone privileges are exempt from coming out of their invisible boxes of total silence
back in the day i used to walk into the fairmont like i was a guest and go straight to their lobby bathrooms i think they are across from the tea room nice stalls good marble countertops 10 out of 10 toilet
well mimes for one
scorched marketplace  i assume it was at the very least a nod to kristallnacht the night germans and austrians rampaged and destroyed thousands of jewish businesses  set fire to 100s of synagogues

what would convince you that they are not psychotic what
hire a moving company that will come pack everything and move it for you 

make sure the company sends 4 guys even a totally unstable person isnt going to try and mess with 4 burly movers 

you dont owe them an explanation or to try and be reasonable when they are not reasonable do plan that the day the movers come you may have to call the police again if they completely lose their shit and let the moving company know that there is an unstable roommate in the house 

it will be about 4 hours of torture then done
i think it is more emotionally underdeveloped than that more about them witnessing the positive changes in him as he matured and wanting him to stay at their level so they have their friend back
they are crabs in a bucket op crawled out of that lifestyle so they disregard his explicit instructions and who he clearly had become and created a setup to drag him back into their bucket im sure they used the excuse that they were soooo drunk
i looked at places over there in 2015 that were going for 500k that i thought were overpriced thats a tripling in 8 years
i agree the barrier in the us is especially high for most visas green cards or eventual citizenship i think we also still have a lottery thats also a snowballs chance in hell 

my point that maybe i didnt make clear is that theres no reason for op to take that personally
i was in southern louisiana i dont know the actual numbers
the nazis being nazis is both 

1 true and problematic

2 happening with greater frequency in many counties 

x200b

also the whooole green card process like they dont want us there

to be fair most countries put up some barriers to immigration the us is an extremely diverse place because of the history of immigration here  even if a subsection of our population doesnt like it many are really happy on a daytoday basis to have different cultures around 

as for the rest of it its all very valid  part of my reason for my expatriating plan because i am getting older and therefore more tired and it can take a lot to be here its also true that the us is so very vast and regional that you really will find almost different cultures in different parts not everything is like it is on tv although outside of several metro areas car culture is an inevitable 

id refrain from reading too much online for a bit and wait to spend your time here and see for yourself it may not be your forever place but the absolute best time to try an adventure is right out of college
its just a matter of courtesy

tell him he can start being the courteous one and text you when he needs home alone time to masturbate to porn have an affair or hide the bodies
not quite an answer to your question but some people i know who sold a home in a hcol to buy a nice piece of farmland to raise kids on are now in their 50s and shes saying no way can she retire there too much physical labor needed to maintain in old old age even if it isnt an active farm

chonky newish build at a ridiculous 3000 square feet
it could be something to do with your location  brand association since i think the most subaru sales are in southern california colorado and the rural northeast i lived in the south for several years and now that i think about it i rarely saw any subaru drivers visited a friend in vermont and it was definitely the most popular car on the road next to older trucks

every current car on the market seems to have associated issues so i gave up trying to find one that would be the best new build toyota and honda were best known for reliability but have also had issues in recent years

go test drive some outbacks under various road conditions and see how you feel driving it thats your best indicator
reading solely for pleasure should be a thing we allow ourselves without further condemnation hell i am jealous still trying to get through a 300 pg scifi novel years after grad school burnout killed my ability to pleasure read 

my theory about any reading for knowledge is that people should skim skip and approach it with no rules for read 1 then if they really need retention and understanding go back in for read 2 so you are getting much practice in step one of my made up theory

also i can think of 1000 worse for your attention span than skipping around as a reader like being on reddit ha if you really like any of those books you get the joy of rereading at a later date and discovering all the things you missed or forgot from the first read
if there are stats i stand corrected i knew several my age gen x to younger 20s voters who simply didnt vote after sanders lost the nomination rather than vote for clinton  were very vocal about it so perhaps i am mixing up my own semirelated anecdotal experience with the stats
 he told me im ditching him because i think he has bad intentions and how i shouldnt think that

so yeah you should absolutely presume he has bad intentions is predatory and proceed by protecting yourself go back into work and behave as professionally as possible while being a firm cold no to any impropriety while the hospitality industry is rife with inappropriate behavior in plenty of places doesnt make it okay if you are not in a country with human resources or any higher ups to share concerns with yeah time to look around for other jobs and play it cool at work try to find someone to go with you when you go home after your shift

not to be too scary but if you really feel unsafe trust your gut a job is not worth stalking or assault from a nutjob  you are allowed to quit for any reason
i think based on the previous episode that its been many nights of sleep deprivation stress coke to keep going on sleep deprivation and also hes a shit human

edit to add before someone comes at me i am firmly in the camp they are all shit humans to various degrees
i bet its charming  less to heat with the 8foot ceilings because everything really is a tradeoff
fuck the system types met with a heavy dose of misogyny  well a trump presidency wont hurt me and maybe hell tear it all down

weirdly the idea of getting better social safety nets in place probably would have happened with the woman who did try to start universal health care in the 90s she later pivoted due to the backlash she received but a lot of her comments on single payer were taken so far out of context by the leftleft to demonize her

so bring in trump who would burn it all down then theyd rebuild im not 100 sure the logic but the conspiracy on the left of voter suppression around why bernie who i did originally vote for in the primaries didnt get the nom would later be echoed by the magas who still believe to this day that 2020 was rigged

horseshoe theory at play also a lot of online propaganda that is better curated and then targeted a specific audience open to receive it now more than ever in our history

edit to add it wasnt old white men as much as it was younger voting demographic
she said but yes
oh my god do better from here on out not just once a year but do better daily

theres no way in hell that she hasnt communicated over the prior 15 years for being disappointed that as the mother to two boys she also has to do the work to plan her own celebration ostensibly celebrating her for the work she does ffs
homes built after the 1940s are a bit better than earlier although i love us turn of the century up to 1920s because by the 40s they give you real closets my first home was a 1920s cottage 850 square feet and it did drive even solo me up a wall i had no place to put my limited stuff and would have killed for my friends 1940s closets 

im only making things worse given i sold and cant likely buy in my choice state ca been really considering taking the profits from the sale and buying in my other country uk cash no mortgage and making the great schelp although for what i could purchase  everything i look at online the edwardians were even worse for zero closet space somehow the high ceilings make it okay will learn to live without stuff
the long answer

we have subsidized large farms for decades so many small farms with varying crops and crop rotation were bought up by larger corporate farms which then found corn and soy the most profitable with government subsidies a lot of soybeans get turned into oil which is much different than the taste of olive oil or bought by china corn gets made into high fructose corn syrup which is then sold as a sweetener for everything it hits differently than cane sugar 

most restaurants across the us buy up a lot of their bulk food from the same 3 chain food suppliers i think sysco or tyson is the biggest so there is always a sameness to chicken in every restaurant unless you are fine dining many smaller fine dining establishments in places like california oregon vermont maine etc will try to buy from local farming and in ca especially you have more access to local produce but for a lot of states they are reliant on import only 

short answer we let corporations and big ag fuck up our food supplies micheal pollen wrote about this a lot in the 2000s
so depression unsupportive family life  likely some trauma there  untreated adhd is a big ugly cosmic soup to be swimming in the great news is that you have a grasp of what is really going on in your brain even if those who are meant to support you most have chosen ignorance 

if you are in the us please speak with the office of students with disabilities and find out what accommodations you are eligible for and also what kind of community support systems may be available at your college ask your school therapist if they can refer you to any community therapy clinics that do low costfree counseling for a weekly session even if the school therapist is great you may need more support find out about any tutoring centers on campus or other networks you may hate school right now but between the fire and the fryingpan home or school its your best chance at getting some real support 

as for your family get used to learning how to protect yourself around them and make the slow painful journey to eventually being less enmeshed dont look for the kind of parental understanding you long for there but start to find that feeling elsewhere whatever that looks like to you anytime you go to them hoping it will be different and you can somehow prove you have a neurobehavioral condition you will only set yourself back being your best advocate means learning where its worth advocating for yourself

look i love stuff and i come from a family that bordered on a hoarders love of stuff but most of that square footage over 15001700 for a family of 4 is only necessary because americans love stuff you can easily have 3 bedrooms  a masters suite in 1700 square feet and live like kings  queens imo

ill admit the character of roman was always reprehensible to me for the amount of stuff he did that seemed like an online incel troll come to life but i still had some empathy for him based on how he was the kid who was clearly the most physically abused  degraded of the 3 and the character had these occasionally sympathetic moments then last nights episode i felt kinda sick at having thought that for an ideologically vapid nazi good writing again

i got one from a landlord whom i had rented for 5 years  had a good relationship with they wrote something similar but also added was a good communicator  always worked with us to schedule any repairs make op sound like a betterthanaverage tenant if they were
its not a bad idea to ask you dont need one its in no way required because a new place will run a credit check  call you previous landlord but if you are looking to move to a competitive rental market having a letter that states you are a good tenant to add to your application certainly cant hurt
uk trains that actually take you around the country ferries to other nearby countries high walkability everywhere the brits love their walking paths and i love walking everywhere 

unfortunately the weather is going to suck
this is growing pains

eh the growing pains phase has been going on since the us became a country  for any historical progress there is always a major blowback 

but i agree that for homogeneous countries to judge the us as more racist is disingenuous given we have every community from around the world living here when people do immigrate here there is also frequently a much faster level of integration within one generation and a path to maintaining  practicing heritage other countries with immigrant communities can end up isolating them
i hope you havent already sent your drivers license or social security credit info edit if so you may want to check your credit and do a freeze that is a sure scam

honestly think it is the same for all the university healthcare systems stanford usc keck ucsf general practitioners who need to build up their skills start out at them after theyve finished up residency then move on to where they can build their own practice on the other hand as someone else pointed out a lot of specialists stay
look hes a barnacle not a friend friends dont make other friends miss classes or dump suicidal ideation on a love interest as a way to trap them into caretaking it is not your job to be a mental health counselor to him you are not responsible for his inappropriate behaviors or reactions because heres the thing you were never going to fix or help him he just wants you in his orbit if he cant have you romantically then hell eeyore his way into you keeping him around because you feel sorry for him

being a good friend is a twoway street

i can no longer support you you need mental health support from a trained professional which you can find at the university health center if you are feeling suicidal please call 988 for the sake of my grades this semester and my own mental health i need a break please leave me alone

seriously it seems cruel but his low selfesteem is for him to fix not you meanwhile start looking at your own behaviors college is always an okay time to learn about our personal behaviors that dont help us in life people pleasing caretaking trying to fix people and overenmeshment can lead you into dynamics like this which you do have a part in you are allowed to tell people no and not dive in right when you meet someone to try and fix them

cat etiquette  

step 1 do not make direct eye contact either the human blinks or looks off to the side if cat does not respond in a similar fashion you are not approved and should abort the mission to pet if cat does respond in a similar fashion blinks back or looks off to side move on to step 2

step 2 hold out hand palm down allow several inches of distance between your hand and cats face and move slowly introduce to yourself dont just wave your hand in cats face while screaming kitty that is rude and susceptible to a swipe or scratching if cat ignores hand and looks away abort mission to pet if cat leans in to sniff and then do a chin rub move on to step 3 

step 3 youve arrived you may pet the cat please go in the direction of the fur stay in the safety zones under chin and back of cat never too much in the area above tail unless invited stomach rubs are at the sole discretion of the cat
im sorry i need to stop talking i ruin everything

yeah its manipulative you fucked you so you apologized thats great taking ownership for messing up and apologizing is a good thing then in the next breath you went straight to putting yourself down which undercuts the apology its fishing for the other person to comfort you 

a good formula is apologize acknowledge the persons hurt feelings then offer a solution i am sorry for doing  i hear that it upsets you and i will work on not doing that anymore
her family has 2 dogs that dont get attention nor have they been on a walk in the last who knows how many years

ill never understand this unless you live on a farm and have a working dog why have a pet you are going to dump in a yard  ignore thats neglect and animal neglect is abuse she comes from a family of people who treat animals like crap 

i dont know i couldnt love anyone who got angry over properly caring for and petting a dog ffs
after which he snaps crutches out of my hands so i was standing on one leg i slapped him and he grabbed me by the neck and arms

do not kid yourself that this cant escalate beyond everything you wrote neglect and psychological abuse someone ripping the crutches away from a person who just had knee surgery is a sadist

to the us likely though other countries may have a different answer hospitality visas here are only for manageriallevel positions and require a college degree 

one thing to look at is nannying or au pair visa if you got some experience first you would need to work with an agency or get a family to sponsor you there is some bias in favor of women in childcare but a male nanny is not unheard of
is it possible to simply rock up to a country and figure it out as you go

illegally yes most illegal immigration is someone overstaying a tourist visa  simply trying to disappear from any immigration authority rather stressful though without a support infrastructure in your chosen place to assist with housing and work and still stressful even then in the us alone there are estimated 50000 irish citizens living and working illegally but there are multigenerational irish communities within several cities here

give it 35 days when the ingrown hairs start forming a nice smattering of cysts  you need to ask your wife to pop them so you can sit down
he answered hed try to understand why im angry

i call bullshit on this and the apology if it were a sincere apology hed simply agree he fucked up and if you had done the same to him it would make him upset because it would upset any normal person to be shoved pushed or elbowed by a partner regardless of whether that person was in a foul mood
you say i have a cat do you share the cat or is it solely yours

solely yours then i suppose you may go ahead and exploit for the likes any way you please

shared ownership then i think you both should have discussed things like dressing up pet for likes prior and had an understanding 

do i think it is animal cruelty no not really i do think most dogs love the attention and cats are really something like 3070 on being okay being dressed up or putting things on them if it was acting stressed during or ran and hid after then you are an arse but for your behavior towards the cat not the fight with the gf
put the issue with your girlfriend in a little box for right now put the lid on it and keep it closed focus on your mom and your grief and saying a proper goodbye to her you will regret it if you let the gfs bomb dropping take from these last moments with your mom

hello given we are coworkers i hope i can expect a given level of professionalism in your correspondence in the future so that i do not need to contact hr  

or just go straight to hr  report it 

dont brush it away because the pos will think it is acceptable to bully coworkers and he deserves to know hes crap 

fyi this is all personal opinion but when i think of masculine looking women or handsome women i think of mariska hagarity and connie britton who have larger features than conventional pretty standards and they are both stunners imo dont let these fools tear down your selfesteem
i got headhunted for an academic teaching position in qatar several years ago that also looked financially quite good on paper i think they look for people on linked in who graduated from certain respected us universities job backgrounds

 as a woman i did not pursue it even the pictures online of the university that was reaching out to me showed only men as students in the photos i am also jewish though not apparent by my name so that felt like a double mark against me 

politically i believe the us is moving towards a bifurcated two different realities and very contentious place that it wont be coming back from in the next decade gun violence will also not be resolved in any collective way as with everything problems living in the us are locationspecific 

qatar may be more politically stable only because it is a semimonarchy i believe but in terms of human rights freedom of speech womens rights etc i could never qualify it as better than the us your mileage may vary as someone in an academic role but id still watch what you say
 i feel guilty because our invites are out and people whod be traveling out of state for this have already booked flights and hotels

not a good reason to marry 

 i also have put a lot of money down on deposits

divorce after a few years is more costly than your deposits

i am not saying break up for this incident but i am saying you will need to have a lot of discussions once he is sober over what has happened and if you have any doubts about how you feel over the next few weeks then putting a wedding on hold to sort those doubts is always smarter than getting married because of out of town guests and deposits
i know this is a funny cute story and no one besides glasses got hurt but your bf should have warned you of potential issues and also done at least a few trial walks where he hung way back and watched how well the dog responded to your cues 

you are so lucky you didnt tear a rotator cuff or break a bone
how would you like it if you were pooping on your neighbors roof and someone snapped a pic of you
super dangerous paranoid accusation however you are responding like theres a rational solution to a delusional fear there isnt

suggestion it comes up again simply reply we have not photographed you at any time let us contact the authorities now and speak to them

brief simple concise i would for now try to open a police report although maybe others can chime in if thats wise she likely does need a check from cps for the kids safety but may escalate after that
fair enough i havent worked in the restaurant industry in probably 2 decades so that may no longer be a thing
the funny thing is in the 80s no one knew or cared where their children were then one generation later helicopter parenting became normalized

take a break from the dynamic and let him know you and your wife would really appreciate some privacy at this time and you will reach back out when you are ready 

thats a good leave us alone without a door slam if he doesnt respect your wishes then you know hes a fullon twat to be blocked if he does you have plenty of time to mull over if you want to continue the friendship to any degree

while he was inappropriate and had no right to psychoanalyze your wife like hes some authority regardless of an unused degree what also sticks out to me is that the entire tenor of the dinner began with a weird reveal about their private lives 

i know we are all meant to be more honest about mental health but i have a very firm boundary now around people who disclose a lot when the relationship may be an old one but is not a current close intimate friendship in my lived experience these are people looking to trauma bond which is what happened with your wife 

i understand the resentment you feel towards him valid because it endangered your wife and the child shes carrying id refocus as much on keeping her feeling healthy try to not dwell on the friend and put him out of your mind your wife may want to later think about what should be the parameters for her disclosing her bipolar i diagnosis with people its fine for her to share with those she feels safe with but also set a boundary that it isnt conversation for things like a dinner party with old friends
ignoring the hand jobs aspect here 

i assume can you get a job without a work visa is your real question most restaurant work pays in cash tips but you will still need to get a work visa for hire otherwise day laborers completely under the table but no hand jobs are really what a lot of undocumented workers do but it is often difficult manual labor with no work protections and i wouldnt plan on that for a summer vacay
since the owner said they also had adhd you could take a risk and reach back out to them ask if they wouldnt mind being really specific with what they felt was wrong tell them as it was your first job youd like the opportunity to learn from the experience so you dont carry the behavior over into the next job and that you really did enjoy your time there

i know that when i am trying to do several tasks at once or keep one task straight i can sound mean or short with people if they interrupt my flow im really not irritated by them im just trying to follow the order of things in my head and concentrate 

also just know that good bosses or managers actually will take the time to train you and to give you feedback or tell you at the end of the day if something went wrong instead of letting it pile up and then fire you after a couple of weeks interviewing and hiring people takes a lot of work so it is better for them to try and work with a new hire if these guys didnt bother to do that they are probably stressed and not running the greatest shop to begin with

how many homes sold last year were investor vacation rentals pine mountain is a lot like idyllwild one of those places where a lot of people have a second home from la that they use for vacations versus allyear residents
get yourself to the office of students with disabilities and make sure you are receiving every accommodation you qualify for they dont help if you dont use them sometimes not always osd is run by very helpful people who have a pretty good idea of what professors believe in adhd and will follow accommodations and what professors arent great to work with they can even possibly help you choose your best classes 

consider an adhd coach qualified ones can be found online if things get too hard to stay on top of take advantage of the free college tutors on campus usually available in maths and english even if you just make appointments once a week when you are doing well in a course but you do homework with them for a standing weekly appointment it helps for accountability  really helps at the end of the semester when everything is nuts to have that relationship already established 

i did graduate from a very hard university with unmedicated adhd but i failed the first few goarounds the biggest difference the last time around was that i advocated for myself got ahead of accommodations at the start of the semester not weeks after things were already going downhill and took advantage of every support system professors office hours tutoring librarians the university offered
many people here would scoff at paying more for a jeep grand cherokee than a fully loaded lexus suv

i was car shopping a few months ago people have been paying addon fees in the 1000s something like 50007000 above msrp just to get a new toyota rav4 or honda crv electric both dealerships calmly explained the fees and they were getting them edit to add i did go with a friend to lexus their fees were something like 2000 extra  wait list

i believe it is unsustainable too but my point is people will buy overpriced crap if it is all they can get people in your situation will no longer sell even if you wanted to move up making scarcity worse crazy market  people go crazy 

im one of the people who sold at what i thought was the height and now pretty much cant get back in without compromising a great deal
hey thanks
he says its similar to the fact that he owns a gun he would only use it for self protection

thats great it makes him feel safe but the issue is when someone goes from securityminded to paranoid  perceives a nonthreat as a threat that makes them triggerhappy 

from your comments below you are both already in marriage counseling i think it is time to ask him to attend solo therapy as well it cant be okay going through life always believing in worsecase scenarios and it is no way to raise a kid together hes insecure in a survivalmode kind of thinking that he needs to get to the bottom of on his own

you may also bring up in therapy what making a postnuptial would look like ie make a legal contract for what you would both agree to in a divorce it sounds counterintuitive but if you are both actively discussing how you would theoretically dissolve the marriage without hurting each other it might help the marriage 

you absolutely have your rights to how you feel about this the question is if you feel you need to defend yourself in this situation or can extend empathy while also looking out for yourself and your kid
i really want to know if anyone has discovered any therapies that have worked as an adult for misophonia hyperacusis there is some cbt program thats meant to help but i havent had the faith or hope to start it 

during the pandemic my formerly quiet street became the main cutthrough road everyone starting speeding all day and night down 

3 years later and now the sound of car engines and low bass beats hurts physically lifelong misophonia turned into severe hyperacusis and given this is a car culture country car sounds hurting is not great not great at all i still dont want to sink thousands of dollars to a specialist to get no results
healthcare in italy is provided to anyone regardless of nationality while it might not be free it would be extremely affordable there to go to the doctor look for a clinic near you and go see a doctor  for one thing if it is covid or even flu you really shouldnt be pushing yourself to travel until your fever has broken and you really shouldnt be on public transit while contagious
move to the us for any number of reasons but moving here to save money right now is an odd choice 

forgetting the cost of such a large schlep childcare car and transit expenses in most us cities with kids  both you working youll need two cars  medical even with health insurance expect a level of outofpocket expenses and thats minus a major emergency the areas where you would get a 130k salary  live near the coast are going to have a very high cost for 3 bedroom rentals 

i know it feels like doubling your salary is the payoff but the costs here likely might offset that if the move was for other reasons then go for it
i really do hate how difficult it is to detach from your parents

yeah it can be a lifelong process therapy is the best starting place if its a good match therapist for you 

theres sometimes a manageable middle road you can make that is in between being super caught up in their narrativeworldview versus going nocontact lots of good wishes to you
so your mom would rather you be a defective person than cope with the idea that she was a defective parent who didnt get you help and a diagnosis at a younger age when it could have really helped

your best bet is to limit how much you share with them stop thinking theres a magical moment where they see you for who you are and support you in this dont share the little things like washing dishes it will be received with disbelief take it to a place with real support you can find that support in any other stable place therapy disabilities services at uni etc and dont seek comfort or normal parental support give yourself as much distance as you can for now its a tough one but as you learn to advocate for yourself you will need their acceptance less
until she gets her untreated bipolar under control if that is what she has the dog is screwed 

in the name of a longterm friendship id offer to meet her in public sans all dogs and tell her your concerns for her mental health and that she needs help 

theres a form of bipolar bipolar ii that isnt as severe as type i problem is they can function they just cycle faster and not as dramatic as bipolar i so theres more of a chance they scrape by without having to get treatment while still having a lot of lifedamage 

 she may take it worse than the dog being banned and nothing comes of it but its honestly a lastditch attempt if not to salvage the friendship but hell at least to save her dog from an owner who isnt well your friendship is at a breaking point and being totally upfront about this is one thing is something you could do to help her not to get further enmeshed but to encourage her to get a therapist and an actual diagnosis from a doctor 

as for the rest of it you are well within your rights to tell her she cant bring the dog to your house
thats all fantastic until a wall falls or a poop tank explodes
are you the aunt in question

caretaking is no easy task  often unfairly falls to one person in a family regardless limiting the elderly adults contact with other family members and isolating them is abuse
i know this may sound outlandish but have you tried telling them to please call first
no help but i assume you also love getting caught in the rain
this is one of those rare bad situations where i would disclose adhd to human resources if you actually have not already because by law you are a little more protected from an unfair firing edit if in the us under the disabilities act

i would then be sure to document it all so id back document the hrsupervisor convo and at least summarize what was said  i would backdate and summarize the directorys secretary and i would absolutely mention the duning kruger effect comment it is very insulting because it means overestimating ones abilities because you are not smart enough to be aware of your limitations these people are being catty

further note any of the times you have asked for feedback  received none

i know you probably dont want to sue but if things dont change for you after disclosing you have adhd and repeating again for better feedback even if it isnt as dramatic as a lawsuit you certainly may be able to protect yourself during any firing that may be coming after the busy season

op i will say this has little to do with your work and more to do with very poor management for a supervisor to discuss an employee right next to them refuse to offer feedback and the general description of the office they really are the ones bad at their jobs

even if a hire isnt skilled when hired a good workplace would put effort into training and mentorship to get them up to par not sit around having bitch sessions in a cubicle
id stick with off whites  creams that are very light and organic looking like natural white untreated fabrics the white you have there is very cool white i wouldnt go that way if you want splashes of color like pillows and a throw add in ochre and earthy greens there was an ikea curtain some time ago that was white with yellow and green botanical images on it which could be fun but may be discontinued my theory for wood paneling is not to make it feel like oppressive dark cabin but try to bring in some warm spring 

too much base color introduced colored curtains colored duvet could be fun but with old wood paneling could also really overdo the room
so i personally dont see anything wrong with being married and living unconventionally in separate arrangements ive known one long term relationships without the marriage we are talking decades who both lived on two sides of one duplex quite happily 

financially though it works when you come into the relationship each with your own property and simply continue that way without merging those assets or you do something like purchase a duplex   

you have a very lowinterest rate and it doesnt really make sense to sell your current property and it is a lousy time to buy if you could turn your current home more into a duplex or place with a separate entrance kitchenbath apartment that may be one solution 

otherwise its obviously not a good financial stretch but if it means you get to both stay happy in your marriage then the cost may be worth that if it means you are currently in a strained marriage and this is a lastditch effort to save it maybe the costs arent worth it have either one of you tried living separately for a month or two to see what it does to your marriage if it helps or makes things more strained

id definitely knock out a prenup first make sure that if the marriage dissolves there will be an understanding of who owns what
so keep it as professional as possible with her but also build yourself a little invisible shield when you do interact with her i mean completely imaginary in your mind you have a shield around you

does she hate you no probably not is it possible she is biased against you yeah it totally happens toxic coworkers are a thing

your absolute best bet is to stop caring about winning her over being friendly with her or really worrying too much about her otherwise she is an energy suck in your daily life do not seek her approval or people please because it isnt coming do what she does keep everything short super polite but to the point cut down good morning how are you today to good morning with no extra questions or engagement she cuts in and takes over let her speak and try to reengage your point after they are done

the more you are trying to find an in with her the more she will reject you i cant explain it but people like this only deescalate when you stop having this inner desire for their approval its very hard to get to that place internally where you dont care but the faster you do the better it will be for you
honestly wouldnt trust an inspection paid for by the seller though id assume even with certified theyd be looking for the easiest going inspector i paid for an inspection when i bought that was detailed when i went to sell we went with asis and disclose everything so we paid another inspector to do a report to give sellers i was shocked that they were much less detailed than the original report 

anyway dont budge on your refusal to waive inspections it is the one contingency that i hate buyers have folded on it does make everything worse to go into a bigticket purchase blind like that
sky and the building feel empty id do a little bit of soft detailing no need to fill all blank space but some clouds or sky the way youve done plants or some brick or texture for the building 

but honestly very charming and delightful scene

i think there are no dumb questions so heres my answer 

as far as abortion rights and the overturning of roe v wade plenty of western countries have or had restrictions on abortion for decades now it wasnt legal in places like ireland until 2018 sucks for women but thats a general way of plenty of parts of the world 

gay rights are also pretty horrific in plenty of parts of the world there are regions where being caught in a samesex relationship will result in jail or death 

so while i would absolutely say the us is backsliding we still are not on par with some of the worst dictatorships or even semidemocracies just last year farright wins in italy and sweden happened with many of the same issues are coming up italy is trying to diminish parental rights of same sex marriages 

refugee status is really left for people suffering from genocide or political persecution to the point that their lives are threatened for who they are in their home country people fleeing afghanistan under the taliban wouldnt be viewed the same as someone dealing with increasingly oppressive laws or rolling back of their rights here in the us the good thing about the us is there are states where rights are protected and making a move between states while costly isnt impossible 

as for the shootings i got nothing weve become ridiculous on that front but if you look at the number of deaths from mass shootings per year per capita how many people live in the us it is still nowhere near gun deaths like el salvador venezuela or other places south of here that being said we have way more gun deaths not just mass shootings but overall gun deaths per year per 100000 citizens than in europe australia africa or the middle east in the coming decades if we stay on this trajectory who knows we still wont be eligible for refugee status but it will be a sad state of affairs

she doesnt want to get married but she wants you to do the breaking up the way shes going about this is a particular brand of fucked up that you do not need in your life so do it break it off
to provide a best and final offer

dont do this while it is done i have no idea the legality of it its also just messed up to ask for a bidding war on a rental they arent bidding to buy a home 

take down the ad repost at the proper rent and reach out to those that youve offered a tour to and explain the ad had the incorrect rent in it tell them if they are still interested you will provide the tour

start looking for a new place but also stop being a doormat to a ridiculous request in house share situation and give her a boundary 

hey i pay rent so i can come and go as i need to for my daily life and i cant accommodate you using your the home as a rehearsal space or updating you to my whereabouts every week if that was something you needed it should have been clearly stated at the time i signed the lease so i could decide then im happy to stick to my room for a brief period if i happen to be here while you rehearse but i can no longer give you updates on my schedule 

shes being ridiculous and also shes not an actress its probably porn if she actually was an actress then she should learn to appreciate having an audience
he was her emotional doormat up until the great betrayal he would always act as her emotional fluffer during her schemes even when he was hankering to get in a little on the power and watched her instead push him out 

its the dynamics of a dysfunctional relationship everyone has a role to play that keeps the power balance in this case shiv stepping all over toms aspirations and constantly making sure he knew his place was beneath her once he did something in his own selfinterest side with logan he tossed their dynamic out the window cant come back from that 

i dont know why people root for this marriage its just kinda sad from all angles also tom is a morally ambiguous abuser ahole in his own right but it is a credit to the writers that he still comes across as worthy of being sympathetic for him at times
heres the thing she has been blowing up her life and cheating since you first knew her you probably feel a little culpable because youve always supported her while you are not responsible for her actions you have been an enabler of sorts 

its okay to break off any relationship but i think ghosting should really be saved for people who are so toxic the dynamic could become abusive if you were to tell them the nicest thing to do with a longterm friendship thats gone belly up is to remove yourself but leave a door open for the chance that the person does grow or change 

i really have great memories of our friendship over the years id like to step back from it for a while now however because i really cannot support you through your cheating it bothers me a great deal and it is part of a larger pattern i cant ignore if down the road you get professional help and resolve this behavior please reach out to me
its not like the label would make a difference in our relationship

only it would make a difference you would know if you two were exclusive if hes seeing other people right now or if you are on the same page at all instead of trying to glean whats happening based on texts

just wait until you get back then explain youd like to date exclusively and hes either on board or hes not 5 months is plenty of time to know that by
the worst thing about california is we have direct democracy through propositions no one understands due to wording and large  blocks can advertise for or against further confusing people 

renters voted against their own interests in the last election i forget which proposition it was but it offered better protections for renters i think it may have covered shfs which arent currently under the same rent raise laws as apartments who advertised against it real estate corps 

  
i was a homeowner at the time and even i voted for it when i spoke with renter friends they had misunderstood the prop and voted against it
youve been together since you were both 16 do you know if this is the person you want to marry and have kids with or is this the only guy youve ever dated and thats a hard thing to think about letting go of

you are both really young still instead of taking his varying plans travel then one kid by 30 or whatever hes coming up with what do you want your adulthood to look like career marriage and how many kids and when think about it for awhile and sit with it if it feels very strongly to you that there is a path you want then you can see if hes the one who wants to be on it with you
try one more time with clarity to explain the problem and give a tangible solution

hey you know you are one of my favorite people but we are really different people i am an introvert and i absolutely need some alone time when i am home its not personal but it is the only way i can recharge so heres what i am going to do when i am having me time and you are engaging i am going to tell you im not available right now or think of a simple sentence that communicates not available that means i wont be engaging or responding to anything said after that point when i am recharged  available again to chat i will let you know 

as far as him joining if you have a friend over i think you have to suck that one up if you are going to hang out in communal spaces in a shared living arrangement you cant exactly expect a housemate to stay out of those spaces
fixerupper can mean a lot of things from a total tear down to a house with decent infrastructure plumbing electrical roof foundation in older but working condition with older appliances nearing the end of their shelf life and a dated interior is one thing even with a good inspection expect to have unexpected issues but under those conditions you can move in and slowly chip away at repairs replace a water heater or furnace paint or fix lighting fixtures and flooring new kitchen appliances etc while living in the dated decor older kitchenbathroom until such time you can do full renovations 

but you better love the location and want to be in that area for some time and plan for the absolute time suck of what repairs mean also second but the chances of a dated interior but solid infrastructure are really difficult unicorn to find heres why usually those are the homes that elderly people who are downsizing sell that means in the last ten years they probably let a lot of things go 

my first home was sort of in that scenario while i made decent progress on its known issues in the 5 years there  focussed on making the interior really lovely there was still a laundry list of issues that it needed the only reason i benefitted was the ridiculous nature of my local market in 21 when i went to sell while my realtor and i decided to make it pretty we would sell as is and disclose everything i did well on it only because it was a stupid competitive market i definitely feel like i unburdened myself of a total money pit lemon that had surface charm but after 5 years i was fed up with living in something that needed band aids and fixes at every turn
in se england its closer to 1 in 3

is this true of areas like folkstone i read that part of kent gets more sun
i love it glanced at it quickly while scrolling and immediately knew what it was really magical feel to it
if you say yes all you are signing up to do is a make your workplace eventually a miserable place to be b get yourself hurt 

when people tell you what they want who they are believe them theres no magical future where they suddenly change to be the fantasy version of themselves that youve created in your mind
i wouldnt let someone act like being easily amused by monuments is a fault  get away with that what a bore of person
i have ibs and caveat even chelated magnesium hits hard during an uh episode best ive found for me is long epsom salts baths with a huge amount of epsom salts it does absorb through the skin theres also a magnesium cream but its texture is terrible still hits pretty hard the next day but not as bad as drinking magnesium powder or taking the pills
that sucks i called a few times over the years plus used 311 for certain issues and never had any problems getting through i guess it has also lost dispatchers
there is a nonemergency line for the police and if people are that illinformed that they dont know to use the nonemergency line for nonemergencies then we need better civic education to cover the basics
wibta if i asked her if she was okay 

yes thats a fine thing to do if you are actually ready to listen to her or want to get involved

and told her to take a chill pill and to just move on from the failure

yes because anyone going through any kind of life crisis always gets much better after being told to suck it up im being sarcastic obviously but dont say that to her

if you want to engage you can ask her if shes okay she may or may not respond but thats only if you want to engage not to tell her to get over it

 you are well within your roommate rights to tell her the yelling on the phone can be heard in your room and its really getting to you
if you look on psychology todays find a therapist tool and filter for sliding scale thats a start otherwise there are several lowcost slidingscale clinics in sf listed here you may need to show proof of income

how to be open not worrying about judging

its good to make sure you feel comfortable with the therapist ideally this would mean being able to interview them even a 15minute phone call to start often offered gratis but if you are looking at sliding scale or going to a clinic you usually dont get that option you will tell someone at intake what your concerns are in a general sense and they should put you with someone they think will be a good fit if you dont like the clinician you can ask to be placed with someone else but its worth giving them a try i will say i had one of my best therapists from a lowcost clinic years ago who helped me a lot

good luck
i mean its a transferrable skill to set building for film  studio photography so you could maybe expand your job search
well it is just delightful whimsy i love it
im of the school of thought when you have an interaction with a nutter who has no boundaries your best option is to put as much space between you and the nutter as you can it sounds like there are already plenty of public reviews online describing her behavior so adding to those wont do much the bbb is unlikely to take any action since they are more about protecting people from being fleeced for money its okay to just walk away from this 

talk to your employment about not letting people who call outside of family have your info it sucks that we live in the times we do but probably best not to wear a shirt advertising your work or give out too many private details to strangers until you build a certain amount of trust dust yourself off and know that 9 times out of 10 most interactions you will have in a shop will be pleasant  this was that one off 10th time
i went once about 10 years ago there was a soloelephant exhibiting stress behaviors rocking itself not stop because elephants are not meant to be single creatures a single koala sat in a tree and every time you stood near its cage it would turn so its back was to you and also had that depressed look to it 

the whole place kinda broke my heart and i never went back it has a deeply depressing vibe there that i think they tried to put some  into awhile back to make the park look more festive but sounds like that didnt work my guess is that san diego zoo is so much more famous that it draws bigger crowds more  the la zoo should really be closed and remaining animals sold to better institutions 

all that being said the nearby gene autry is a great little museum
 i think the public beating this girl took sent a message and this girl would not have continued bullying her

maybe maybe not some turds refuse to be flushed in this life if the girl got up in your sisters face just a few days ago then there is no reason for your sister to apologize at this time the original bully still has learned zero lessons 

is your sister becoming a mean girl maybe or she may be learning the horrible lessons of high school show no weakness either way i think your focus on empathy for the original bully is a bit off 

if you have a good relationship with your sister older or younger cant tell from this post id start by talking with her and asking her how she feels about becoming the person she once loathed i would not suggest apologizing because that just gives bullies more power even beaten down ones but discuss with her ways to neutralize the situation neutralizing means she agrees to start ignoring the other girl not go out of her way to bump into her and places her focus elsewhere if the girl is really whipped then she wont reengage with your sister 

otherwise if you are in high school too this is really not your problem to solve going to a trusted adult with your concerns is a fine option
its okay we discussed focussing on the leaves
la to its credit has very good museums highend restaurants music taco trucks  food from every part of the world  many cultural events but its not an easy city to navigate with traffic and the level of encampments in the past 510 years have taken over entire areas then worsened even more with the pandemic i had friends from other countries visit and while they love la the dichotomy of nice living  extreme poverty is jarring for them i almost just got used to it living there but its a messed up thing to exist with as normal 

san diego definitely lacks culture but it does have a nice walkable downtown area 

santa barbara is probably the happy medium but it takes real money to live nicely there
its more independent living for seniors but this place in altadena


la santa barbara or san diego are the closest climatewise but the cost of living housing is insane in all three  you will likely be very cardependent
it seriously doesnt matter the breed or how friendly the dog is any breed can run up to an otherwise okaybehaving leashed dog that is leash reactive  get itself killed

im not really concerned with trump so much as the template and infrastructure he left in place for a stronger person than him to succeed in overturning an election next time 

i am also more concerned with reports from small towns around the country shasta county ca sequim wa where small coups against sitting county council members have succeeded or any of the school boards where sitting members were terrorized into quitting also decent election administrators of either party who received enough death threats in 2020 that they quit 

its contentiousness thats simmering in lots of pockets of the country that trump started though i highly doubt hes in any condition to finish
uh look up your state and boundary by acquiescence laws you may be giving him the legal right to not only now own your land but when you go to sell down the road you will have changed property lines that wont match your deed and you will have been paying taxes on land hes enjoying 

who gives if he is putting in a nicer fence while that is normally an expense that two neighbors should agree upon and share he could do that along the exact fenceline where it currently stands not a nice guy your neighbor is literally stealing land from you that you are paying property taxes on sorry but hes got you marked as a fool  

if i were to proceed with this i would have him buy the square footage outright from you and have the property line changed he wont want to do that
logan also goes to hit kendalls son his grandson in season 1 where its implied the kid is probably autistic roman is socially awkward and doesnt present as normally as shiv and kendall logan hates deviations from any norms that arent smooth edges being gay having a weird kink for older women  showing any sensitivities are all weaknesses in his book
i mean some of the issues in the us are very real tangible problems but many are going to be location dependent if you were a woman living in an antiabortion state who wanted kids knowing you cant get needed medical attention for failed pregnancies is certainly a fact of life to take into consideration the whole shootings thing isnt great if you are living in a highcostofliving area housing not wonderful cardependent culture in some areas the last several years have been politically fraught  the pandemic wasnt pretty but careers pay more money here than say europe then you also have high medical costs and low vacation time

lots of people from around the world still want to immigrate to the us what makes life qualitatively better for one person than another is rather subjective

i have dual uk citizenship and spent a lot of time there as a kid i am currently thinking of leaving the us for the uk mainly because i could buy a house outright with no mortgage in a decent part of england for what i made selling a ca shack here after decades of freeway commutes i wouldnt mind having a decent even if it has issues train system im sick of fires again ca i have medical insurance and still cant get in to see a doctor for 36 months out is the overworked underfunded nhs going to be a downgrade from that

i also formerly lived in a part of ca where i have never seen so many uk expats settle and be happy probably due to mild climate and sunshine
if the show is good enough and i like the characters its okay ill end up rewatching the entirety of it years later  its like a little gift because i had forgotten most of it
if you are spun out enough to be posting on reddit when you got ghosted after three texts that you are still thinking about someone then you are kidding yourself that sleeping with him later is going to get him out of your system
one of the most disappointing realizations i had by young adulthood is how many adults at least here in the us behave  think like children well into middleage quanon works so well here on at least a percentage of the electorate because it was bolstered by several propaganda channels and a president plus it feeds into magical thinking theyre still stuck in

still not an excuse or a reprieve but from my perspective they truly believed that their tinpot dictator was on the right side of history an election was stolen from them and theyd be received as heroes once he was reinstalled there were enough gop members running interference tweeting bullshit taking several groups on tours the day before to show them the tunnels denying election results their little brains were spun into a massive mind fuck
then about a year into our relationship after proposal something just switched 

yeah he thought he had you on lockdown for marriage so he could show his true colors abuse is meant to make the victims selfesteem plummet so they wont leave and will accept further abusive tactics you getting fit is a threat to that 

he says i should just learn to accept his sense of humor

ask him next time point bank why tearing you down is funny and can he explain the joke actually dont just know life is too short to tie yourself to someone who makes you feel like shit
 a will saying shes leaving all her money to me but if i dont come see her shes taking me out of the will 

so we know she hasnt changed if shes using manipulation to try and get you to see her true change would be respecting your wishes and leaving you an inheritance as some small way to make things up to you with zero expectations or hoops for you to jump through 

i hope youve received therapy for the abuse you went through what you do should be whatever you believe is best for your mental health you are under no obligation to smooth out your mothers sins at the end of her life if you need the money you are also free to use the hell out of her at this point just know whatever action you take there may actually be no money or you may never see it because abusers arent people who keep their word
weve been together for four months  
  
a pretty strong bond of love has formed with my girlfriend

yeah i am of the school of thought that you cannot really know a person enough in 4 months to have a strong bond of love you can be excited by them intrigued enjoy their company into sex with them but ya just dont really know a person in that short of time

im also of theory that masks or any issues usually start around 3 or 4 months thats great that shes done so much therapy shes an open communicator except she isnt because rather than state clearly 4 months ago she doesnt like close malefemale friendships she just got snippy 

so now youve bonded with someone and you are seeing how they handle being upset when they feel threatened they shut down  go cold lots of therapy is in my book a good thing but it doesnt mean a person doesnt still have problematic ways of expressing themselves 

while i think it is fine for her to have her boundaries you get to decide if her boundaries are ones you can accept you can certainly ask her to meet the friend i think respecting that you wont cook meals together isnt unreasonable and you can tell your gf youd like to be able to reach out once a month to your friend or whatever feels good to you or youd really like it if you can all grab drinks together

you can also tell her that her way of expressing her distress the cold shut down freaked you out 

at the end of the day people can give ultimatums they just have to accept the fall out people who receive ultimatums should decide if they really can abide by the requests and not agree to them if they cant
its never stated explicitly but i always got the sense that logan married conners mother then abused a likely fragile person to the point of mental breakdown thus her institutionalization 

he would have married caroline for her pedigree as an aristocrat narcissists love owning things that give them prestige but the issue there is caroline was too much of an overt narcissist for them to work 

marcia was a good match likely a covert narcissist but she offered social prestige in how she presented was class and ageappropriate she understood she was meant to be a buffer she made logan look classy and she was to protect him from emotional fallout in return she was securing power for her bioson i think her long game was to sit out each of the roy kids failing and eventually get her son in somewhere important she was fine with affairs as long as they werent with important powerful women so the rhea affair broke the rules 

one of her most disarming power moves was to say the things you arent meant to say out loud in a charming unbothered way she totally recognized willa for what willa was because i am pretty sure during some of her early socialclimbing years she had been likely a paid escort of sorts
a bunch of people replying to you acting like the rioters didnt want to kill senators and congressmen  it wasnt a genuine attempt at a coup even if it was a disorganized hot mess some of those rioters went in with tactile gear on zip ties etc and mobs managed to kill 5 capital police officers from injuries 

several gop were completely on board and involved their secondary plan was to deny election results they didnt want to certify electoral votes  wanted the coup to steal those videos show that rep loudermilk was giving hourslong tour the day before to showing a tour group the tunnels and several offices there were several republican representatives and senators that were hoping for an attack or dogwhistling for one on the capitol  later denied election results they were 100 wanting a coup 

the real difference between italy or germanys fascist takeover history is lets be real both mussolini and hitler were better organized and better at the strong man stuff
i think it was kind of the teacher told us we could ransack the classroom whyd we get in trouble mentality 

aka people who have no clue how anything actually functions
this is so funny because while ive never been to miami i always had this assumption it was kinda las spiritual sister city in the us but with more humidity including the problems
no i went out of town and left her to show the house sell it it was during the crazy peak of the market so i left to visit a friend and it was sold within the week edit we had a buyer within the week escrow was about a month
id try putting a french drain and install a sump pump in my own basement before trying them
he still makes little comments or tries to get me to watch videos or talk me into believing in a god or heaven 

so he is pushing his views on you because if hes really going to commit to this line of thinking then you are going to hell and he likely cant handle that so you would also need to convert 

honestly i am still trying to get over that his initial belief was the universe is created by aliens because i mean who created the aliens then why is that easier to accept than the big bang theory

anyhoo you likely have to have a serious talk either he has his newfound faith and respects your boundaries that you dont want to share it with him or he finds himself a nice christian girl and you all go your separate ways
wait did your dad cheat on your mom because thats info your mother deserves to know

also cmon think about the seriously awkward future family events that staying in this relationship entails it wasnt a fun secret on her part it was her trying to avoid openly dating the son of the guy she had an affair with
i lucked out so well when i went to sell my realtor was a really nice helpful one who also had adhd that lady helped me actually pack at one point i hadnt finished what i needed to get put away i left town for her to show and she called me like wtf and i started to cry she ended up finishing putting the last of the stuff away too 

i know i made her work so hard for that commission i like to think hope we are still friends because i really did like her as a person

anyway your realtor is making serious commission  off the sale of your house tell her or him to come over early before the open houses and hold your hand for a bit open houses are just as much for the realtor to get new clients as it is for them to help sell your home they can put some elbow grease in
this cant be the first stupid thing he thinksbelieves or has said to you 

my advice is this learn the signs early so you dont waste a year on someone 

these comments made me insecure how do you have blonde hair if youre not even white

when you are with someone and feel insecure because of the comments they make to you take note sometimes you can feel insecure because of your own baggage but if you are feeling good about yourself and the guy you are dating keeps saying stupid stuff that suddenly makes you feel selfconscious or bad about yourself speak up and tell them to knock it off if they dont then that means you are likely dating a jerk
the also showed how much he enjoyed abusing greg the way he was abused by the company he chose to work for having money is not a prerequisite for being statushungry or moneygrubbing plenty of people will voluntarily social climb and toss aside less useful friends along the way
the sugar in juice spike your glucose levels much faster than eating the sugars in whole fruit which are slowed down by fiber thats why if a diabetic is in a hypoglycemic state drinking a glass of orange juice is the easiest way to quickly get their blood sugar levels back up 

that being said a glass of juice fruit or vegetable isnt unhealthy imo it has need vitamins and minerals can be filling enough to stop you from snacking on unhealthy things or reaching for a soda and is fine in moderation
love the skin on the second layer its phenomenal but i actually like the rougher look of the hair texture in the first pic
go to kelly blue book online and put in all the details for the model  mileage and youll see what they are selling for used in your area

we all grieve death in our own ways
its poorly worded like english as a second language maybe i think the phrasing rise of toxic masculinity makes it the second interpretation because if they were looking for a country where women are subservient it wouldnt be a rising or new thing happening recently plenty of parts of the world have simply been that way for centuries
tom has long been statushungry and moneygrubbing so i doubt his early friendships were deep emotional connections  that being said he did so very wrong by the fly guys
it is a very delightful frog pot

i swear the oh thats so fabulous you should sell those is the kiss of death for all creative inspiration
academic setting

do you have accommodations or are in a country where you are eligible because if you do use them and if you dont apply asap 

i finally survived college  started doing really well once i got my accommodations recorded all lectures got copies of notes and was eligible to take tests in a quiet room during lectures i sat in the very front because i found less distraction helped a bit 

if your school has an office of students with disabilities make an appointment asap
is your mom in treatment because she may need med changes esp if shes bipolar  schitzophrenic 

that being said none of her emergencies are emergencies even your uncle could have called a medic van if need be or plan ahead if he knew he was going to the hospital 

she wasnt supposed to know where i lived

how did she find out and has she threatened you in the past because this is a bigger issue if your safety is at risk

otherwise give her a breakdown during a nonmomemergency time when shes not calling you yelling mom i will not be helping you when i am at work you will need to come up with an alternative solution for any emergencies that arise when i am working during work hours i will be blocking your number you may not show up at my home during work hours 

come up with a short phrase if she does drop bys mom i can not help you i am working now 

if she has a psychiatrist you can tell her she needs to check in with them for a med check if your mom escalates to threats against you or herself you need to be prepared to 5150 her 

if you arent in it get therapy for being raised by an unstable parent it does a number on your ability to enforce boundaries 

good luck
dont say no right out the gate sit her down and listen to the podcast together stop it when misogynistic crap comes up ask your daughter what she thinks about what was said ask questions and be inquisitive she might answer its funny or its cool so ask follow ups like how explain to me the joke she may hear it herself as she tries to explain share with her a bit why you see it as hurtful to women

whats likely going on is some desire on her part for attention or to fit in theres a whole steaming pile of toxic shit out there right now that she doesnt need to step in but she also needs to get why she should be avoiding it

ultimately yeah put your foot down that crap can bite her in the ass as shes getting ready to go to college because people can google her and find it but the bigger more important thing is to help her learn to hearsee what misogyny sounds and looks like  to spot it
please tell a trusted friend family member or someone in your life you know is safe whats going on try contacting a trained person at rainn who knows domestic abuse doesnt matter if he hasnt physically hurt you yet they can advise you on a safe exit 

yes you are in danger youve been forced into a relationship since you were a teen the dynamic is coercive you are punished for trying to leave  your perception of normal is very skewed by that this is not normal and threats of violence lead to actions of violence get help getting out and staying safe
nothing helps social anxiety like getting lectured that you arent performing socially well s

take it up with your therapist what do you want your social interactions to look like break down into small steps things you can do to speak up for yourself join in a convo or bring a little of your athome self into the public sphere but do it safely and on your own terms honestly as your work in therapy progresses and you learn more about your own personal emotional reality standing up for yourself or being more true happens organically you may always have a bit of an indooroutdoor split too and thats okay
im pretty sure it is not uncommon to think in moments excitedly that youve found your answers therefore everyones answers then have to eventually roll that back 

the worst is realizing like grief its a fluid process with a thousand different offramps onramps along the way recognizing being wrong or coming to terms that absolutes never help is one of the best onramps back in 

i have adhd too in my late 20s i got into exercise clean diet amino acids all lifelong problems solved poof thank god there wasnt a ton of social media yet because i would have been insufferable i actually wanted to write a book hahaha little did i know i would not be able to maintain that lifestyle and chronic illness can really set a person back i dont do well with adhd meds but i will support anyone who benefits
on our second date i made it clear that i was looking for something more serious

making it clear you were in general looking for something more serious or did you state i really like you and id like us to be exclusive while we are dating then she agrees to exclusivity 

because if it was the former and it sounds like it was she did absolutely nothing wrong you seem to grasp that but cant get over the emotional sense of being cheated on even if it wasnt a technical cheating you have a right to your feelings but what you do with them matters if it is something you cant get over then you owe it to you and her to break up 

plenty of people date the way she was trying not to get attached or overly focus on one person until they know that person is really in it

if you cant get over it but want to try start focussing more on the present like literally take note when you are with her why shes a good partner and why you enjoy each others company make an effort you are basically trying to get your brain to stop dwelling and to refocus
my family would also happily accept me back home but it would be so humiliating to tell them it didnt work after i did all this 

if you have a loving supportive family get over your embarrassment get the cat and go one thing controlling people do is isolate the person they want to control dont help him by further dumping on yourself that those that love you will judge you

you are really young a few years of being ground down has already made you doubt yourself and start drinking you can get out now and have all the time to start again
not to be harsh but you were his sugar momma not his gf 

you fixed his problems and gave him a soft place to land and in any codependent relationship you had to be getting something from that its not surprising he turned on you when you were sick someone who sees an older person as their caretaker doesnt want to stick around to caretake  someone who viewed you as a soft landing doesnt want to financially contribute

take care of your physical health right now its your number one priority when you are ready reflect on the glaring issues that were likely there from the start so you can see the whole thing in its entirety clearly  be grateful that its over
i have no idea what cocaine in the uk costs but once high he could be spending on drinks gambling any number of things all with the coke he may be addicted to debt and spending as much as the coke 

right now he will make a grand gesture tell you he will quit then unless real steps are taken on his part not yours has to come from him he will do the exact same thing over and over 

if big if he was willing to go to a treatment center for a month get 30 days sober and some actual tools for quitting there may be a path out of it or attend meetings or find counseling to help otherwise you are now in a cycle with someone and its one that can get really bad including losing everything you own 

i suggest you look at al anon uk its got issues like all 12 step programs but if you replace alcohol with coke and at least listen to a few meetings you will get a lot more insight into the lengths addicts go to lie and hide their disease when he is in the grips of addiction he is counting somewhat on your naivete to hide so you really need to educate yourself now the worse thing you can do is become his enabler and at least al anon will give you some tools to see those pitfalls 

good luck
google codependency you like being needed as much as she needs someone to dump one you both are in a toxic dynamic and you are way too invested in her life and life choices your friendship with her will never have some magical healing power for her it wont ever not a thing you can do or say for someone who likes blowing their own life up you are primarily just an audience to her for her dysfunction

most important thing is for you to learn what is being a good friend versus codependent relationships so you dont have this dynamic again

as for the rest of it start being honest i am not a trained therapist and this is taking a toll on my mental health i highly suggest you look into talking with a professional repeat until it gets across 

or move out
please go to therapy with someone who specializes in trauma recovery 

i realize in your first post you probably have remaining trauma from previous institutionalizations as a teen and medical trauma from psychiatry is real but no matter how much positivity you have or feel healed there are a lot of really tough things in your past and your recent relationship that create unresolved trauma cycles

the good news is you are an adult now with your own agency you can interview therapists and you get to choose someone who you feel good about
my friend what you are looking for is courier services there are professional companies that will do this for likely less than 500 and it doesnt have to feel like a shady drug delivery deal posted on craiglist google courier services

i mean if the shop will toss that item in a box for you you can just call fedex or dhl to do a pickup you even may be able to get them to pack it
moving around a lot career and job change is an adhd thing i think i know thats been my life but it was also compounded by a certain amount of ptsd so i dont know which is what

getting paralysis and being too overwhelmed to take first steps  staying too long at a miserable party is also an adhd thing and can be ptsd

instead of looking at the statement essay or even job postings give yourself a tiny doable task that you can try to make fun do some journaling or freewriting nonjudgemental writing about what your ideal day at a job would look like or just make bullet lists of things you would want to do make it fantasy dont get caught up in the this isnt possible part trying to refind joy after being ground down is so hard but its the small space that if you can grow it change can get some momentum to get you unstuck
i actually think connor is the best off of all the siblings say what you will about his relationship with willa they are both honest with each other that she is marrying for money but they also both support each other and their individual delusions in a sweet way he paid for her play even though it was a total mess and she doesnt have a problem with his ridiculous run for president except for maybe  they have the most honest relationship in the show
ask your wife pointed questions about what tools she was recommended for this situation encourage her to ask her therapist for tactics or techniques 

i honestly dont think op should involve himself at all the tool the wife is likely getting right now is a safe space to talk in and a better recognition of how she feels in her day to day life the therapist likely gave her assignments early on to get her through the initial process she has those tools and is now applying them to life but still needs an outlet for support ie talk therapy

its not on op to interfere if the wifes mental health issues seem to worsen then he can bring up adjunct therapies meditation or medication or whatever but a spouse shouldnt be standing outside a door and then later being like what have you learned can you ask to learn more tools in therapy please
yes your expectations are way off one a therapist shouldnt be offering insights all the time they arent a partner or a parent who is there to guide and tell the patient what to do the goal is for the therapist to gently lead the patient to their own insights and for the patient to better learn to understand their emotions some therapies like cognitive behavioral or mindfulness may have assignments emdr may have trauma processing but talk therapy is really about having one safe space in your life to talk to feel safe with one person who wont judge or direct you in how to behave and through that process of support get a better understanding of how you are interacting with the world what you probably arent hearing is when the therapist is occasionally redirecting her to ask how those peopleevents are making her feel 

heres why talking to you isnt the same you are her husband you are always going to have needs and opinions the therapist is one person whose needs and feelings she doesnt have to take into consideration or worry what their opinions are and again if they are doing even an okay job they are helping her understand how all the aspects so and so did this i said this are causing an emotional reaction in her this helps someone learn how to regulate their emotional responses 

maybe its not the greatest therapist maybe she needs further interventions if her anxiety is still high but honestly thats none of your business if your wife is getting something out of this process and wants to continue thats for her to do
sort of the premise of justified which came before ozarks and was a much better show imo even if it was kind of a crime procedural
put security cameras in the hallways and public spaces
hey you know i enjoy our friendship so much but could you cut out the love stuff please even with the platonic declarations im married and it makes me uncomfortable now lets discuss insert artsy topic here

if he doesnt respect that blunt but kind request then you do have a bigger issue i am guessing it is a crush which he can fully get over however if he shows he cant you do need to cut him off
first off herpes psa 1 in 6 people in the us have genital herpes you will need to disclose that info before sleeping with new partners which can be scary but its the right thing to do you can also take an antiviral med that suppresses future outbreaks or llysine helps so talk to your doctor sometimes people have one outbreak and thats it you are only contagious right before the outbreak happens and if you get another one you may notice what that prebreakout feels like itching or tingling and know to abstain do not touch any sores or wash your hands well if you do 

as for the boyfriend hell no hes a lying cheater who claims you are hurting his mental health because he gave you herpes you deserve so much better do not let the herpes diagnosis keep you in a shitty worthless relationship
its the 2020s if you are not vetting for flat earthers and vaccine truthers at a bare minimum within the first few dates you are probably doing it wrong 

i found out a few years ago that a friend i have known for 15 years believes the moon landing is faked ive had two friends let out their antisemitic beliefs over the past few years like i had no idea they solidly believed jews control all the global money and the media i am jewish
you are enabling a gambling addict this doesnt improve unless they get help 

housing is the least of your problems
 im crying because i feel like he settled for me

friend you are settling for him hes negging you and undermining your confidence  selfesteem a cruddy personality is a poor quality in a partner want better for yourself let him know he may be an 8 in looks according to his own personal scale but a 0 in personality
animals dont read parenting books so why should we

hes going to be a great father male lions will kick out male cubs from the pride due to competition and prairie dog females will eat eachs young we should totally adopt those techniques

youre dating a nitwit who doesnt respect your field dont send articles to nitwits their entire thing is being right even when they are wrong and its like bashing your head on a rock and waiting for the rock to start bleeding
two things first you can only help or mentor someone who directly asks for it if they dont ask for help then anything you say or do will be perceived as you attacking them

secondly whenif she asks directly for help the best method of constructive criticism is to tell someone something good about them then the issue then the positive place they will get to when they take steps ie the better version of themselves they are capable of achieving

the one thing you do have a total right to speak up about if you are living with someone is if they have terrible table manners that are offputting or their hygiene is bad and they stink for table manners you can start with being direct but kind i love having my little sister here and i love sharing meals with you but when you talk during the meal with your mouth full of food its really hard or when you sit at the table on your phone and dont join in talking with us it sucks for my boyfriend and me and feels like a missed opportunity to catch up about our days

as for the rest of it id wait until she comes to you directly with the issue then you can involve yourself for interviews if shes bummed she didnt get it then you can say something like you are really smart and clearly a good candidate do you want some tips for how to win over an interviewer and make yourself stand out more ie dont frame it initially as you did it wrong but ask her if she wants to hear how to improve also it seems like you are hovering over her waiting for her to fail give her a little space to fail and pick herself back up and come to you
if you answer no it actually could go either way you overpaid or you underpaid
hes a 38yearold man acting like a 16yearold you are making an awful lot of excuses for him in the comments but by his age being emotionally mature enough to listen to a partner and then respect their wishes during sex should be a given not something he needs to be trained to understand he heard you in your conversation he just chose to disregard you in his actions

the other thing that stands out to me is that what youve described him doing without real discussion with you first has a degrading element to it if that is not your thing it is fine to break it off for lack of real sexual compatibility 

i do think porn has done more damage to peoples expectations for sex but my god moving between the anus and vagina without discussion and preparation is 1 way for women to get reoccurring bacterial vaginosis again okay if someone is in their 20s and still learning about sex and being a good partner but wtf by your 40s
question did you have an inspection when you bought it because the lifespan of most of those items would be apparent during inspection 

my first house was an older house and everything was in functional condition but kind of on its last legs your best bet is to get several opinions on anything have a couple of roofers come out and give you bids if they all say the same thing then you know you have immediate issues usually one guy will be complete doom and gloom one will be more middle of the road 

otherwise make yourself a list of bigger ticket items that are on their last legs and replace them slowly one major fix per year or two and youll eventually have newer components under a 10year warranty roof or any basement leak issues if in real disrepair should be number one and move slowly inwards from there
i mean every coastal city in the 80s90s besides san diego and monterey both more military were kind of hippie surfer enclaves with artists and environmentalists housing prices for a 2 bedroom bungalow werent starting at 1 mil back then
wait was the black lexus shooting at the white truck and in order to alert other drivers and execute a safe road rage shooting black lexus turned on their emergency blinkers
i mean other than being known for gumbo  hospitality it has the best jazz  high  of shootings combo in the country
uh get your legal ducks in a row in terms of him moving in name not on deed or mortgage and clear communication on splitting costs 

but really why do you want to cohabitate with someone who isnt jazzed for you for getting to a huge life milestone
dont take the tenants property to sell even if its within the lease or you feel used by them give them until saturday if they dont come saturday have it hauled off how much can you make off a used trampoline 100 not worth dealing with them coming around trying to sue or dealing with them being messy

youve listed why you are upset with this tenant but most of that was on you dont keep working with people who are bad tenants dont cut deals with them and dont cover expenses if they are at fault 

as far as the trampoline goes consider the value of the cost versus having a clean break from them
california absolutely has better produce than many other states we grow close to most of it for the country what we dont ship to mexico due to nafta plenty of farming in the middle of the country is corn and soy while every market in the us is going to have vegetables outside of areas that are food deserts fresh fruit  veg versus the stuff that has been on trucks for weeks is a big difference in quality

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

i am not so sure i want this to happen

oh you 100 know you do not want it to happen speak clearly and say no it was too much falling on you to be housebound with her as a caretaker the first time

his answer was that she and the other elderly neighbor could hang out while we worked

what happens when that neighbor falls or gets hurt or goes into a home

shes settled somewhere now dont take her out of her routine because he feels guilty but not guilty enough to change his work schedule and be the primary caretaker tell him you can both up your visits from the home or have her stay for overnights but she isnt moving back in with you
telling him depends on what state you live in if in the us and what kind of end you two ended on do you feel 100 confident he will respect and support your decision

as for financial assistance if you are in the us in a state that has planned parenthood start there
a 22yearold started dating you when you were 15

you were a child a creepy college age dude was scouring high schools for a teen to molest ffs you arent wifey material because you aged out for the pedo who wanted a teen bang maid 

theres nothing you could have done differently when you are in a relationship with a misogynistic creep you are still incredibly young please go out and experience a good relationship for the first time find out what it is to be loved respected and to be treated like an equal you deserve that
if shes still competent enough ask her how she feels about writing up a trust for herself shell be the one creating the trust with your and a lawyers help so she isnt giving up total independence but shes in control of creating a foolproof system of safety for herself 

the trust can give her a monthly stipend and grow her assets if she asks for a large lump sum the trust has to approve so if she contacts her trustee for an amazon scam they are given permission to deny funds 

you can help her set up an account to have draft limits unless something is set on autopay so her bills will all be autopay but she cant withdraw thousands of dollars 

i dont know just spitballing
i dont mean to pathologize everything but this is the internet so why not but that all sounds a lot like executive dysfunction its common with adhd but also with a host of other things 

one thing that helps people with executive dysfunction is learning their own coping skills but they have to want to change ie admit they have a problem and also be personally frustrated with their inability to finish things some people just dont care or cant get to the first part admit there is a problem

another thing that can help is calm patient help if you want her to pick something out instead of sending her away to go find the thing make it a task you do together lets set a timer and look at tables now for the next hour and a half then pick one out and decide on it 

projects okay if you want to start a painting project in the apartment then lets schedule a weekend day where we get supplies and another day to complete it 

if you dont want to have this kind of dynamic  be the taskfinisher police and you want a selfmotivated person who is a project finisher it doesnt sound like thats the person you are dating so you have to decide
you may be somewhere on the aromantic spectrum id look it up and see if some of the descriptors fit your lived experience 

whatever you do you should be compassionate but honest with her it does take some people longer to find feelings for others but also sometimes you know right away and are just hiding the truth from yourself 

meanwhile she is growing feelings  you are not you work together so you have invited in some serious potential drama to your life
you were compatible over things like marriage and children wanting them but not what that actual scenario looked like real estate is very image oriented career path its not just that she wanted to travel and enjoy nice things her industry is about projecting that kind of lifestyle to appeal to clientele 

people are saying you are picking social work and a path to lower income but if you wanted to become a private practice therapist you can eventually make a stable middle class income while saving some slots for lower pay its not the same thing as being a social worker or working for the county 

sounds like she didnt want to wait for that to happen it takes time of grad school getting your clinical hours in and then building clients is several years you are looking at mid to late 30s before your income evens out she is already 5 years older and probably didnt want to wait until her 40s for a financially stable partner or to spend the last of her 30s with a grad student its not personal so much as incompatibilty in lifestyles 

getting out after several months because of seeing a glaring issue coming down the road is kind of a no harm no foul situation none of this makes you undatable but you do need to look for compatibility beyond more than just wants marriage wants kids and explore what potential partners wants their short term versus long term life to look like 

when you are ready you can put yourself back out there
just start adding 20 minutes onto when you want to meet you want to meet at 8 tell her 820830

shes not going to stop this habit the compulsively early people are like the compulsively late people especially when it is anxiety fueled can they get better for a bit sometimes but it will creep back in just wait until you travel together and need to go to an airport you will be leaving 4 hours ahead of schedule 

its one of those things you can either relax and accept or its a deal breaker
uh if your girlfriend thinks having your neck grabbed or face punched is good fun  is okay with her friend doing that to you plus wants to live with this person you have a really really lousy girlfriend who doesnt give two craps about your health or safety
solid like a rock
clear direct communication  ultimatum

hey i know you are struggling but your constant dissatisfaction with me and your need to use me to vent all time are taking a toll on my mental health either you get help up help  work on taking notice of how frequently you are criticizing me or using me to dump on or we have to break up 

sometimes a kick in the ass gets someone to realize how they are impacting others sometimes they dont want to change you can only find out by clear direct communication
eh i have friends in 1015 year age gap relationships that are 100 from what i see and i admire their relationships 

but they were all grown up when they met each other a 42yearold and a 56yearold or even a 28yearold with a 38yearold  whatever they are all adults if they have a healthy relationship good for them  

anyone who is still a teen dating someone in their midtwenties i am going to look a little askance at if there are clear issues in the relationship plus age gap then yeah theres usually a power dynamic issue someone in their 20s dating a 40 something ehhhh

the good healthy agegap relationship people arent posting on reddit for another thing
unless you are breeding to eat or you plan on keeping the rabbits for the duration of their lifetime there are not enough longterm homes for pet rabbits currently and county shelters are overflowing with older rabbits specifically because people breed them by longterm i mean their lifetime not a year and dumped at the pound there is no need to be raising domesticated rabbits to breed again outside of for food sources 

spay and neuter your pets
you say you have a good therapist now so this is the perfect thing to discuss with him or her

what is it that would make things right from your parents would an acknowledgment that what went on there was scarring for you even if the end result was what they wanted be enough

rather than try to tell them about it ask your therapist to help you write a letter detailing some of what you went through it can be retraumatizing to revisit these things so important to have the therapist on board at the end of the letter tell them what you are looking for apology understanding etc

the truth is they probably were at the end of their ropes with you and the boarding school told them a lot of what they wanted to hear so even if they have their suspicions about what you went through they are coping by being in denial

for the record i went through something different but very similar over 30 years ago yup it is effing scarring but recovery is possible one thing that helps you get to forgiveness with others is knowing that you dont have to fear them anymore if the fear is this is something they did once it can happen again it is very hard to feel at peace with them some repairs may happen down the road when you are independent and no longer reliant on their decisions over your life
you were 19 when a 25yearold woman was interested in you while you both clearly have physical and mental health issues that need support and work your relationship sounds toxic codependent and yeah abusive i could only read half of this then it just got too painful 

look a grown woman 6 years older than you is not your responsibility you need to find housing on your own and break up someone looping nonstop on childhood trauma isnt your job to fix and you couldnt fix her even if you wanted to all you are doing right now is enabling a deeply unhealthy person while not learning how to care for yourself 

dont spend the rest of your 20s like this
plus the cuffed pants are illfitting and too short the whole look is awkward  the stylist needs to be fired
i love him as an actor but he is standing like he crapped his pants and his arms are trying to run away from the ensuing mess
nah i agree with you i think we were meant to view logan in his prime as a strategic genius who was already losing it when the show starts the whole point is how that the type of person logan was machiavellian and a tyrant can create one thing a business empire but only by destroying another his kids  most of his wives the children and other bit players are all malformed by logans legacy of abuse  any wins are usually just them failing upwards and also tend to be shortlived
logan was a king lear character his character flaw was his own lack of selfknowledge and inability to be loved or accept love so he demanded complete unquestioning allegiance instead i think a larger theme of the show is that logan may have successfully built an empire but he destroyed his family by doing so so his tragedy is that he has no one to leave the empire to the natural conclusion is where we are at the kids floundering and his legacy likely being destroyed kendall just had a small win last episode if i am correct he will blow it by next episode
your father solved the garbage issue for you he took himself out of your and your sons life sounds by his behavior that is the most mature decision hes likely made in life

i wouldnt sweat what hes telling others anyone who believes a oneyearold grandchild is out there breaking up marriages is another adult you also dont want to deal with

enjoy your mom as a grandmother who knows she may have been looking for an out for years and this was the motivation she needed
ugh thanks i had to edit that it could have been worsebetter and been pubic organism
i think the fact that last season he was floating face down in the pool versus the final scene showing him floating face up is meant to illuminate his core issues havent changed but his position has improved
yeah probably its the gross selfcentered behavior of that oeuvre

its incredibly rude to the other concertgoers and to the performers i dont know why but i get absurdly pissed off at people who behave badly during any live performance performers put so much work into recitals and training the audience pays good money for seats and one asshole who thinks the world revolves around them needs to get loudly fingered

yay for her public organism orgasm but do it quietly like a normal perv
yeah i did the math they lost 6750 suck but wont kill them in the long run
its the difference between acting in the us versus say if he were acting in the uk or in the theater here

if you ever watch inside the actors studio plenty of a list actors talk like he did about craft i think he got skewed because hes not at their level and he doesnt fall into the friendly easy teen crushtype personalities most upandcoming tv actors who want success in the us now tend to follow its even built into the way people go about fandom now with a stronger sense of parasocial relationship and ownership people want a cute blank slate to project their ideas onto

is he a bit pretentious absolutely but does it help him do a great job at the character hes playing sure so no reason to mock it i like the shakespearean nods in the show it reminds me of how deadwood approached storytelling
no collars so unless they got out of their collars and jumped out of the back of a truck going slow enough for that to happen this was likely dumping even if they did get out of their collars they shouldnt have been riding in the back of a pickup on the freeway for this exact reason and its still pretty shitty ownership
first youll need to set up your downline  list any friends you think would want in on this exciting opportunity 

just kidding obviously the wrong sub but i do like the parallels since both involve reaming someone metaphorically speaking
any shelter right now is overflowing with rabbits if you can make the drive the san jose animal care has hundreds some are young and some are incredibly friendly
 i was considering going back to school to get a masters in art history or any art background

while this sounds delightful to me and like a dream thing to do it is in no way going to secure you better work opportunities that graphic design isnt currently university positions are hard to come by in any country and only a foreigner who was top of their field and wrote an award winning book would likely get a visiting scholar visa it would get you a student visa for a few years though youd have better luck getting certified to teach english as a second language

your best bet is to look at the countries you are thinking of emigrating to and what skilled labor they give work visas for or look at us companies that have an overseas division and apply to them for jobs
i cant move out for a long time

why not you are 23 not 16 you know how to travel and stay in hostels then you can find a room share somewhere start saving money now

your mother has no intention of giving up control over you and no intention of respecting your boundaries i know this may be some cultural stuff but it is also the behavior of a mentally unwell person who doesnt intend to get help 

write in a diary online and learn how to use twofactor authentication on everything stop sharing anything with her become boring get rid of as much stuff as you can so your room is bland go find friends to play music with outside of the house dont share anything you are doing be vague and make a plan get therapy
currently they are much better i should have included the word historically 

i am talking about under castro when gay men or any men who even looked suspiciously effeminate were routinely rounded up in the streets and placed in concentration camps because he believed any sexual deviation incompatible with the revolution during that period gay men did flee cuba seeking asylum 

op is hinting on that kind of government taking over in the us while i think us laws can target certain groups extremely unfairly i dont think we are on the brink of creating federally run concentration camps for sexuality 

the worst thing we have are private christian conversion camps which are psychologically extremely damaging but as far as i know the government and laws are not involved with them  its still not castro having police rounding up people in the streets level of persecution to require asylum
based on his reaction to you getting cold feet if you hadnt agreed to it in the first place he was still going to go look for other people to sleep with he was just hoping he could get you to sign off on it first
people are making fun of you in this thread but being gay or queer certainly can get you beat up attacked or harassed in plenty of parts of the us and it does suck to have a major political party make criminalizing forms of gender expression a big part of their current platform 

however i dont see any threat from the us government like what gay people in cuba or parts of africa and the mid east face parts of the world where yeah actual jail time or capital punishment 

doesnt mean you should live in an area where you feel fear what you will find is plenty of parts of the us where it is not only highly normalized to be queer but there are large communities of queer people the issue is you will find it in higher costofliving areas like most major us metros or more liberal states that are also higher cost of living 

you arent going to get asylum and by your own admission you arent a highly skilled worker there are syrian refugees who fled death living on islands in greece that will never get off of that island they are living in refugee camps on 

focus on acquiring skills working in a restaurant or hospitality industry carpentry doesnt matter go to a local community college and see what certifications they have something to save some money up and pick a larger city or liberal state to head towards with some job skills and make your exit from ohio you may feel a lot better just leaving your current area  seeking out a bigger community
if i were the exfriend and this ever got out to me i would definitely feel ick its not kind of sexualizing your ex it totally is 

one thing about roleplaying or fantasy is you can basically make up a scenario without having to involve someone in your mutual circle it would be one thing if the person wasnt part of any current social circle but this is someone in your daily life now

id ask her during a nonsexy time where this is coming from and given it makes you uncomfortable share that
email the department head for your program directly if the personal reason is really good enough ie medical 

but a semester is only about 3 and a half months long so you cant miss almost a third of that and have enough hours to qualify 

and you are welcome good luck
if it is a monthtomonth lease then yes they can raise the rents twice a year
some colleges start the fall semester in late august some midseptember you need to contact the university asap and find out what they recommend no way missing an entire month of a semester would be doable so you may want to delay enrollment until spring
honestly if someone lost their crap over something so insignificant that they felt entitled to berate me  my child i doubt id be able to move past it even a sincere thoughtful apology 

yelling during an ongoing fight or during a highstress situation still needs an apology but its at least an understandable human reaction 

yelling  insulting people because you cant play your video game like a 12 year old brat no thank you
the post is a troll but replacing the driveway would start at 10k in the bay area
professional help therapy counseling whatever figure out why you think you deserve to be in an abusive dynamic and why even any part of you would bring a child into such an equation
a realtor making a double commission benefits the seller but works out doubly badly for the buyer its in this realtors best interest for you to pay the maximum in this case

normally with a buyer agent sure theyd make more if the sale is higher but in the bigger picture of referrals it works to their benefit to at least make their client feel like theyre getting a good deal

this agent has zero incentive to help you in this sale and you are going to pay them for the pleasure of getting screwed

edit if you had a buyers agent they should be present for the inspection noting what the inspector is saying and looking for ways to protect you in further negotiations if anything is discovered this one is on vacay
if you eliminate the need to get something out of relationships and naturally overflow with joy you can have fabulous relationships with all sorts of people

im sorry but this is why imo a ton of eastern philosophy and western new agey stuff doesnt actually translate to better mental health none of us naturally overflow with joy all day every day and we get to have reasonable expectations of others what is important is to realize when your expectations are reasonable versus you are overthinking things so and so doesnt text back instantly they hate me versus so and so has blown me off 3 times in a row maybe they have life events going on right now but also maybe they are a shitty friend

long story short see how you feel around people relationships are gives and takes no one will make us feel happy and seen all the time but the goal is to surround yourself with people you are comfortable with and have a shared sense of interests and care for each other you arent going to make yourself some 247 spiritual robot who exudes joy all the time and never has any personal needs i dont care how many books you read or years of yoga  meditation
i assume a lot of these types of businesses are franchises my inclination with any work on the home is to get 3 bids i dont always go with the cheapest i go often with the person i have the best communication with and who explains the work theyll do really well to me if someone brought up the incans to explain a drainage system theyd be out solely because dude does not apply to the current situation
yeah i think it has its roots as a post1950s us economic boom thing when we suddenly had a growing collegeeducated middle class for the first time people became class stratified by their careers and anyone could move up the chain more 

i dont know about south america or the middle east or other cultures but in europe the idea of class still feels like a thing people are born into at least it used to be declasse to talk about money or status although where you had your education is certainly something the british will discuss but you will know more about their class and upbringing based on accent than anything else 

california on the other hand has a lot of new money and people coming here seeking economic wealth networking and categorizing acquaintances by where they are in their careers makes social sense
hi all how nice you are making a special plan to surprise brothers name and i am sure your efforts will delight him as you may know we are twins so your party date also falls on my birthday i have solo plans with girlfriends name this year and will be unable to attend my brothers party

then leave the group chat and plan the best date you and your girlfriend could ever want book a reservation at a nice restaurant make a day trip whatever do not let them suddenly tag you into the event go make your own memories 

not your brothers fault but whoo boy cruddy oversight of that friend group
it was a reasonable fee they were timely i would politely ask 

when i got locked out by the broken bottom lock i needed to let the dogs out of their crates asap so i went with a timely locksmith however i was able to locate one who did the job for a reasonable cost of 129 id like to submit the receipt to you for reimbursement please let me know where to send it 

also will the front door lock be fixed while i am staying here if so let me know when you schedule it and i will make sure to have the dogs crated when your locksmith arrives

honestly for 3500 per month you should be able to lock and unlock a front door without the deadbolt its a reasonable expectation
its not common in europe but ive found that conversation in almost any city in the us its certainly an la  new york thing as well
gah dementia is horrible this starts off sad then gets a secondary layer of sadtragic
she needs therapy but honestly so do you youve enabled her to the point of isolating yourself what you are doing isnt helping her and it is hurting you 

tell her she needs therapy and possibly medication also go talk to a therapist different one yourself about codependency setting healthy boundaries and how to mend the divide with your other two kids

letting one child alienate you from two other children is not okay and allowing it to go that far is also on you
 idk if that will look too aggressive or not

thats not aggressive thats a polite update you need someone looking out for your interests and trying to reach out to show you homes not you chasing an agent around worrying you are being too aggressive they are set to make a commission off a large purchase youre about to make they should be holding your hand and walking you through this process

fire them and find someone better interview a few
no they can be set up to impact descendants its a way to ensure a parent wont do anything that would negatively affect their kids portion of the inheritance problem is it assumes the parent cares
your boyfriend raped you and then denied it and tried to blame you 

contact rainn at 800656hope 4673 to be put in touch with a confidential trained sexual abuse counselor near you 

please make an appointment to have a checkup for the bleeding  ask the doctor to document any bruising know that if you want to press charges that you have a medical record of the assault if that sounds too overwhelming right now at least get the checkup for your own medical health and so you have a track record of it
is it valid for me to be hurt by his comment 

your feelings are always valid sometimes what we do with feelings or how we express them isnt okay but if you have a feeling thats your feeling in this case your bf attacked you for something he very well may be the issue with what an asshole

does he have a point

no while some ssris can make people take longer to orgasm that stops once you stop them and even if they do a loving partner would be happy their partner is doing well mentally and put in the effort to work with them where they are at also for many women in their 20s it can take some time to reach orgasms or learn what works for them and for a lot of guys in their 20s who grew up on porn they have no clue what they are doing kind of a combo thing maybe the ssri you are on maybe the natural path your body  personal development is on maybe your boyfriend is a shitty lover
so you are growing up in a dysfunctional household first off your moms trauma isnt yours to fix  your parents marriage isnt something you can control not all men are your father and not all women are your mother 

secondly your only job right now is to finish school and pursue what makes you happy and what you want for yourself 

when your mom brings up what kind of marriage you should have dont engage with her further than okay mom not arguing about it or asking her questions will neutralize the discussion its a toxic belief she has you dont need to correct that in her or take it on yourself box it up and toss it on a garbage heap 

what you will want to put away for a rainy day is considering therapy at some point growing up with a parent with mental illness and two parents in a bad marriage is a lot to carry one of the best ways to not repeat mistakes you are fully aware of from growing up around them is to have some time to learn about yourself  to learn some healthy coping skills  therapy can help with that

good luck
have her read this  its for all of ca not la county and it is for tenants but the more she understands tenants rights the more she can combat what a tenant requests that is unreasonable

eviction if they are paying rent is tough the one thing is if one of your moms kids wanted to live in the house for a period of time might be two years she can move in a relative and that would evict them talking to a lawyer is your best bet but the more your mom is informed on the reasonable things expected of her the more she may be able to shrug off how unreasonable her current tenants are

her tenant is a bully the best way to deal with bullies is to push back firmly and calmly the woman is carrying on like this because it is working for her for now
i dont think of the bay area as northern california i think of it as located in northern california 

northern california is one of two things in my mind the top entire half of the state starting at the central coast but if you call it norcal then it is an area located at the very very top that covers everything above chico
its a book based on a popular tv series could easily be an oversight or they left quickly and didnt care about it and even if it was intentional on the tenants part id let it go and not worry about it
so if you are looking for a term for this behavior its called being an ungrateful twat 

you cant change peoples behavior but you can change your reactions which will sometimes impact them if you have already told her all this stuff and she claims it doesnt happen then

the best way to help someone realize they are being an ungrateful twat is to tell them how their exact behavior makes you feel in the moment right when its happening doing it later wont work because theyve already changed what happened in their memory you have to point it out as they are doing it specific words and actions and how you feel around it

you pull into the restaurant parking lot looking forward to a nice lunch with your sister at a place she claims to love and she starts sighing about how sick of it she is you say hey that makes me feel really bad i thought you loved this place based on all you ig stories about it and i wanted to show you a nice afternoon im not going to make you eat somewhere you are sick of so lets cancel next time when i initiate a plan to go somewhere you dont want to please suggest where youd prefer

you get her a gift in a color she asks for and she opens it and complains hey that makes me feel really bad i was trying to do something to make you happy and asked you specifically what you wanted rejecting my gift feels shitty the good news is theres a receipt so you can return it

as for you always paying dont make any plans without specifying you are going dutch once you get to the place ask the waitress if you can have separate bills
is he worth this every discussion turning into an argument with someone who always needs to be right sounds exhausting to me 

yelling or shouting at someone is abuse imo i dont think raising your voice is to the point of yelling or shouting though whats really abusive is calling you stupid and also gaslighting you the denying he turned a light off when he did type stuff intentionally pushing someones buttons until they explode so he can call you out on exploding is highly manipulative
life is too short to spend it with people who crap on your joy
while i asked why he was so upset he couldnt give me an answer

either he thinks it reflects back on him as not as goodlooking as he liked to consider himself worried that you arent as into his looks as hed like a significant other or he thinks it reflects badly back onto you and youre not as much of a prize as he wanted if youve settled in the past 

either way its vanity and superficial insecurity on his part tell him to think it over and get to a place where he can articulate the issue i think once he says it out loud if he is a semidecent guy hell realize how superficial hes being
such as seperate sleeping arrangements with her getting the king double in the bedroom and me on the couch for 4 nights of the week she knows i hate this but sacrifices we have to make day to day i guess anyone else relate to this

no this is not a good relationship really reconsider all the times youve sacrificed your own comfort or decisions you wanted then think about the number of times shes compromised im guessing its about zero good luck with that in life
friend four years you got a lemon there
there was really just under a decade of la being a functional place and kinda getting its shit together in a lot of areas before backsliding 

the early aughts to about 2010 fewer gang wars homeless population bad but not bad like it is now lapd relatively not corruptly run postrampart scandal firings housing still affordable in areas it was a nice run
i read the title since it was posted 4 hours ago  right after the incident happened according to op am makes more sense shrugs
1140 am as in the late morning 

we do need to be able to go into public on occasion you know
whoever lashed out online at a dying man seeking advice phew check your humanity 

his final update got me in the feels sounds like he actually had a pretty decent head on his shoulders when he was alive and i hope he had good people around him when he passed
i get that writing this book is part of his own healing journey and i respect that

you actually dont owe him any respect he hasnt shown you any

as his kids you had a right to be informed  give permission before he started this project that he would be sharing your personal mental health information with the world

its pretty funny hes framing it as his healing journey because its really a big admission of his own fuck ups as a father

anyone can write a memoir but they arent allowed a free pass at what that ultimately does to their personal relationships i tend to be more forgiving of people exposing the ugly side of abuse theyve endured but putting your own kids privacy on blast is just punching down while looking for accolades look how great i am at overcoming my childrens struggles gross

you have every right to tell him hes violated your trust and you are not sure he deserves it your father is selfcentered

edit this actually made me angry for you hes potentially screwing you over if hes well known enough that this info about your family impacts your future negatively if hes shared actual private medical diagnosis you have legal   the right to get him to take those parts out dont fear or think in terms of what he wants be clear about what you want
1 be a little wary of all men 12 years older than you when you are under 25 same goes for guys under 25 with women 12 years older than them are all age gaps bad no but when something is wrong  age gap its just so much worse

2 you did nothing wrong and his behavior has zero to do with you you are both strangers to each other anyone who wants to hook up then suddenly tells you that you make them feel icky is an asshole there are a 1000 things you can tell a person i am tired lets call it a night etc that arent intentionally hurtful rude ways to reject them 

3 start listening to your earlier instincts a bit more you felt something off because he wanted to meet at his apartment first thing thats a person testing boundaries no one should be meeting internet strangers in their homes for the first time unless both parties are explicitly looking for hookups and have stated so outright if someone is testing boundaries right out the gate they arent going to improve over time 

4 someone who is an untrustworthy stranger tells you that you give them ick dont ask them why dont take it any further with them trust the opinions of people who care about you not randos the proper response to that is telling them to go fuck themselves for being rude and leaving 

tldr never let a rando rate your selfworth
next time get a quote bid from someone on what the costs to fix would be and then try to get the seller to come down by that amount then youd also know the scope of the work how long it will take to fix etc
what youve never seen a production of the doughnut hole of being earnest
it was a larger rule of thumb that prethis current bubble tended to be true 

now its really dependent on a ton of things heres a decent calculator and overview rentvsbuycalculator

the only hard and fast rule that is still true is the best time to buy was 10 years ago sadly
i dont know im not buying everything oop is selling in this post its constructed in such a way that she is such a blatant victim and the bad people are sooo so bad some of it reads like fantasy early on she writes

i never had a doubt in my mind that i would not be alone in this world as long as i have him

thats a pretty toxic idea of motherhood in and of itself you dont have kids so youll never be alone they arent little emotional support animals

maybe im reading too much into it just assuming the dad was a master manipulator and oop may have dumped a lot on the sons head during the divorce 

doesnt make the son a good person but he sounds more to me like the product of a completely effed up environment by both parents
depends on the costs of buying versus renting look at the monthly costs not the lump sum of the houseprice also depends on the rental market in the area you want to retire in 

it also really depends on what your longterm picture of retirement looks like to you are you planning on traveling a ton and eventually moving to a retirement community or do you want to focus on homebased projects in retirement gardening woodwork etc do you have kids and want to leave them the equity in the home

one thing to consider is as you age moving gets exponentially more difficult for many people when you rent you are always at risk of a landlord selling a property 

look at is 55 communities if there are any near you in my state they are subsidized you buy the home pay the hoa but the homes are usually below market value when you go to sell they are capped on how high they can increase if i were going to travel a ton and was 55 or older thats where id look you get a house no one can take from you but less hassle than regular home ownership grounds maintained usually have a staff repair guy builtin community but privacy
crepuscular is in between nocturnal and diurnal animals who become active at dusk but also dawn and dont stay awake all night but also take naps during the day

ive never heard it used to describe sunlight
its crusty having an attraction to someone is not really something anyone can control but she could control her actions and behaviors and she didnt 

also how is 18 any better really in this situation or even 20 the young woman is still really young in a professional situation where she had to be friendly and your wife was overtexting her and stalking her and showing her picture to coworkers even if she never overtly flirted or hit on the girl she took it far in her head

if she was a guy wed all say she was grooming emma

your wife has impulse control issues while she may not be a predator ahe showed predatory behavior no advice just your instinct to be put off is right
i believe i am crepuscular

im going to get downvoted probably but

20 years ago sf wasnt the bestrun city even then it had swaths of wealth and old money butting up against really intense poverty but there was also a middleclass contingent then that lived and existed there in between tons of small businesses could exist and add to different neighborhoods it wasnt really a la or ny large important city in any way it was pretty 

over the past 20 years tech money  badly run politics have done nothing to improve the city most of the middle class is gone small businesses cant last poverty up and incredibly bad solutions put forth but a tech ruling class for decades of ted talks about making the world a better place are just as shitty as the political ineffectuality and equally responsible for gutting a healthy middle class  growing a poverty class
well this sucks i feel so badly for the children in this situation because daddys a nutjob and mom is about to parrot his beliefs in order to hold things together so they dont have a snowballs chance in hell of a normal childhood

you can have the boundary that you dont want him in your life abandonment and neglect are abuse and forcing inane ideas on children is bad however you are correct that you may completely lose your sister

id reach out to her and tell her how you feel say you want to keep the connection between her and your nieces nephew open and be there for them but you do not want to see bruce ask her to work with you on this maybe you can set up a monthly visit between you her and the kids but let her know you cant stand to be around him after what he did
no he wont have to walk out again because now he has the threat to hold over his wife op is right the wife will move closer to her husbands crazy positions in the future and accept the next layer of crazy that comes along in order to keep the family together 

doesnt mean op has to be around to witness it
in altadena several years ago people began tying them to this tree at the beginning of the trailhead when there were garbage cans nearby it was just awful to see this poor disgusting poop tree humanity really is a bag of turds sometimes
you are going to be losing a 22 mortgage rate so look at what your monthly will be on the new house at a 7 rate unless you find an arms 71 that starts at 5 lower property taxes wont mean much when youre monthly payments can go up significantly

you dont say how long youve been in the new house but less than 5 years and you are also eating the closing costs on that place

you can put in an offer with a home sale contingency offer is based on you selling your new home  they may accept it but look at the current comps where you are have house sales slowed down even if the price hasnt things arent moving in a week anymore unless you are in the ne so the contingency may mean if your home doesnt sell within x amount of time the sale falls through 

mostly what strikes me is 1 you havent even seen the house yet 2 you want to do this partially for your wealthy parents so they have an inlaw on your property youd be screwing up your own finances to find a property to help them then i would pause button this whole thing work on your current home and make it something you like more despite the area have a discussion with your husband first and your parents second if you are all really that close and your husband is comfortable with the idea as well then maybe in a few years after youve been at your current home for 5 years they help with the purchase of a larger property so they can have the inlaw 

i hate my first home it is a thing that happens the best thing you can do is learn from that process and not rush back out and make similar mistakes
im glad you got that moment of closure
if it had a funky smell then that would be a no from me

new carpets flooring can offgas but offgassing is a much different smell than funky its usually like scented chemicals funky implies rotted bo with an earthiness which makes me think exploded body rot

a new carpet flooring rolled out over subflooring that wasnt replaced so it still has bodyrotjuice in it nooooope

if they wanted to sell they should have industrialozone treated the whole place first my fear with funky smells is that in heat or summer or damp they just get funkier
it was also a this american life episode about a guy whose job it was to go into homes and clean up after dead bodies
honestly think cops should be required to complete a 2 year associates degree from community college before being allowed to enroll in the police academy

if anything it would weed out a lot of lazier contenders for the salary and the responsibility there should be a few more hoops to jump through  they can take some classes in social work community building deescalation how to talk to the public who pay their salaries etc basically any issues currently in their current training

most firefighters if they want to rise up in their careers need a fire science  either 2 year or 4 year degree not required but to get to captain or other positions its really needed
you are probably out of luck legally because it seems like a grey area could fall under emergency maintenance besides that what are you going to do anyway sue over them entering to replace a fire alarm i agree though that it is an ineffectual  inconvenient way for them to handle it 

id try one more tactic with your landlord let them know politely that in order to not disturb your working hours would the landlord please allow you to contact the outside company to directly so you can request from them a days alert before they are arriving in order to adjust your work schedule

you can also let them know that you are concerned about reasonable privacy workers entering your unit without warning while you may be indisposed ask if they will have keys or be alerting tenants to their arrival
la is pretty much city to city so while santa monica is starting to be proactive plenty of other parts of the county arent 

im interested to see if in a year or two there is any significant decline of airbnbs or not in the areas where ordinances have passed
they are cheap  have been for decades if that were the case it would have happened 

they are left as part of a golden visa program which grants citizenship if they are redeveloped
there is still a part of the golden visa that says if you buy and renovate a neglected building in lisbon portos etc its a path to citizenship i have no idea how it plays into short term rentals but they can be rented out as long term rentals 

part of the issue even here in the us isnt just the housing shortage its that communities with a high number of transient lodgers arent great for neighborhoods 

they arent locking the out but capping them due to oversaturation so grandfathered in ones are ok but no new ones i think it is smart because neighborhoods oversaturated in airbnbs and str do change for the worse 

also foreign owners pocketing tourist money does nothing for the country i wish the us would limit the amount of housing nonus citizens who live elsewhere could buy our housing shortage issue is a mix of zoning law issues underbuilding new developments str corporate ibuyers and foreign money buying us property as investment often to park money as a tax haven outside of their own country
like do i even want my masters even though ill make a lot more money

yes you do same way you dont expect him at a year to pay more than half the rent or take on your finances then neither you nor he shouldnt expect you at the oneyear point to give up on significant career goals
is it being enforced though 

every city in ca that passed ordinances to try and curb str and airbnbs doesnt seem to enforce them and airbnb does zero enforcement so illegal ones are still doing business
yes but some countries are trying to do something about it due to housing crises portugal just passed laws to ban any more new str properties in urban centers 

in the us some counties have passed ordinances but in places like southern california no one enforces them so its all toothless
okay so heres how a letter could maybe help 

their realtor isnt actually going to show them the letter in order to protect their client from discrimination accusations but if the letter sways their realtor that you are a highly committed buyer who isnt going to back out of escrow because you are willing to sacrifice your firstborn baby for this house blah blah blah the realtor may explain to the client you are a strong contender even with a slightly lower offer 

also a smart seller wont look at the largest offer but the strongest in terms of downpayment financing buyers supposed commitment to not getting cold feet etc 

i personally hate the entire loveletter thing imo its a business transaction and its another bs hoop to jump through but if you love the house just do it 

put another way it cant hurt and honestly if you dont get the place keep the letter as a template for your next bid
something is bullshit 

one needing to pass on your genes is just weird its one thing to want a baby its another thing to think your superior genetics must be floating around in the world for you to sleep well at night 

secondly no one in their right mind would be donating sperm or eggs all of a sudden without discussing it with a partner 

he either sold sperm to make some money and is embarrassed or he cheated and got someone preggers 

if he wants there to be any chance at reconciliation he needs to explain this way better
i cant speak to the intellipure i know i researched read reviews etc several years back my austin air got me through several miserable fire seasons in california i also had a high end blue air that was incredible at whisking away all kitchen smells almost instantly but they now seem to put more into their lowend models than the really nice ones they made 5 years ago

the austin is nothing fancy and it is noisy on high but i think it may have the most carbon  hepa  other filters inside for its size and price range i also liked that due to the amount of filtration inside it the need to replace filters is less frequent 

good luck  congrats on the house
sounds like they were trained to expand their business by pestering former clients in order to get referrals thing is no one likes this level of intensity get rid of them clearly and do them a favor and let them know their business technique is backfiring

hey you were a great realtor at the time we bought this house but your current tactic of dropping by unannounced or not taking a hint when i dont respond to calls is turning into harassment please refrain from future contact and let us enjoy our home in peace 

sending you a christmas card once a year really should be the only contact a year after a sale is complete
get a highend air purifier like austin air and run it for several days on high also replace carbon monoxide alarm

it could be the cleaners used the fungi carbon monoxide poisoning any one of those things  i get a headache after being in bed bath and beyond for more than 15 minutes from the intense potpourri scent everywhere so it could be as simple as you are sensitive to chemical fragrance smells and once the scented cleaning agents have faded you will be fine
despite their drafters calculations for the span that the porch and the redone footings indicating sufficient support for the heavier sliding door

was this a designbuild company sounds like they made a booboo in their calculations and are now trying to scare you into letting them cut corners in order to let their error slide pardon the door pun

id rethink the door choice you are stuck with them since you already paid  but if i had a building attached to the side of my home i wanted to safely enjoy that already had a sinking issue then no i wouldnt let contractors cut official corners 

nevermind that if a neighbor decides they dislike you and reports it to the citycounty  an inspector comes out you will end up paying for permits and any redo to the foundation needed down the road

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

first off he may feel this way because his depressive brain is telling him this not because of anything you are actually doing or saying 

but it cant hurt to ask him what makes him feel appreciated or part of it may be as simple as joining you in a task or just having a moment when he gets home to talk for a bit about your days etc i think it can only strengthen your relationship to both get to feel appreciated  integral  explore what makes you feel that way with a new baby it is easy for partners to forget each other over the emotional work the baby requires
thanks now throughout the day i am probably going to have assless chaps in a singsong voice popping up or looping in my brain 

i also get a new filler word every so often its usually an adverb phrase at the start of any thought for a long time it was well technically speaking  in emails and writing i can see it and edit it out but when conversating it will start driving me up a wall but i need it to start my thought
i would repeat what you heard her say and then ask her to clarify

sometimes we hear things weird some times therapists put things badly very badly in this case and some times therapists are just completely wrong had a bad moment and effed up

how they respond tells you a lot about how good they are at their job to continue working with 

i would address the two issues with her statement if that is what she meant she should not be telling you what to do in the future in terms of who to date and what she said reflects back onto you and makes you feel like people shouldnt be dating you because of your diagnosis 

if you otherwise really like this therapist it is worth bringing up in session at the very least moments like this have helped me get through conflict resolution with someone and the discussion may further reveal that maybe shes not a great therapist for adhd issues
id talk to some doctors who have been working in the specific field of medicine you are interested in informational interviews and really ask whats changed in their fields quality of life issues etc 

also even with fi can you afford the cost of medical school without loans

is there a niche field close to medicine that would fufill the same desire starting a nonprofit that helped with medical issues would use your background better but also move you closer into the field that interested you without 10 years of student attending etc 

going back to school as an adult is never a waste imo if you can financially swing it but i think there are some fields going through intense burnout right now nursing medicine in general teaching for really good reasons 

if i were in your shoes id switch careers and pursue something that interested me but id also weigh the amount of schooling and years in training needed
first off dont sell your place if you really want to move ahead with cohabitation can you rent your place out

if you sell now there is a possibility of not being able to get back into the housing market think of it this way you are 41 now if living together with someone youve had a shaky relationship with doesnt work out do you want to go back to renting at 50

also by 50 even if we as women eat well  exercise most of us will get hit during menopause with some weight gain unless you are genetically built to be skinny or one of those people willing to never eat bread and do 5 hours of pilates a day its just a fact of life one that shouldnt be something you have to fear will cause you to lose a partner 

youre going to have to bring up the list you werent snooping and he kept it this whole time  if you dont have a brutally honest discussion it will impact things 

also highly suggest thinking about why you are doing all the lifecompromising in this move
if she did not explicitly ask you then no you should not go 

while everyone gets a reprieve for how they communicate when grieving and she may have been handling her stepdads decline when she was busy before his death right now isnt the time to ask her for clarity the clarity is in the fact that shes not reaching out

you already sent condolences so send flowers and work on your own stuff it sounds like you two have broken up
so shes raising him to be a narcissist when hes old enough to disappoint her that hes not jesus then shell begin to abuse him
when could you see yourself considering it or being open to talking seriously about marriage after a year two years 5

id tell her you feel like you are both compatible and you would be open to discussing it in  amount of time just share your schedule and be honest tell her as much as you feel you are both heading that way the jokes are starting to give you anxiety because you are not quite at that point but want to revisit it with her 

she may want to end things as is her right if your timelines really dont match up but in your 30s you both should be able to handle a serious conversation about what your goals are
sooo you are a better person than your coworkers 

ng gave up a good thing because she cant handle peer pressure  is too insecure to stand up to them and the rest of them sound like turds 

we dont actually know what your coworkers told ng just that shes either thoughtless enough or cruel to say that stuff to you

ask other women out outside of your job  youll find better keep your private life private and away from your work world while it will likely blow over in time now you know the type of people they are immature and insecure high schoollevel gossips who can only feel good about themselves by putting others down

sorry that happened op but i bet youll find a better partner soon
first off congratulation on getting out its tough and youre brave 

i imagine you care what other people think because so much of what he did in gaslighting you was make you question what you thought and that his behavior was okay and you deserved it keep going to therapy a real one not a church therapist or counselor 

eventually with the right therapist believing you it can be enough to validate your lived experience so you can believe it meanwhile make friends outside of the church where he is a pastor those people are conditioned to believe hes good youre bad because they need that to believe theyre in a good church work on your own sense of self  find support away from that circle

if you hear murmurs or rumors you are bad or to blame you can respond no one ever knows what goes on behind closed doors so they should refrain from commenting this way you dont have to reveal details you feel wont be believed and it shuts it down
friend your 30s are not the time to start dating broke musicians thats what your 20s were for
i dont really think you messed up a fan should be able to be run for an hour without the motor blowing double pane windows should be sealed properly and you have the right to a reasonable expectation of privacy when showering although window curtains  open window is private and gets some steam out
so once a double pane window gasket springs a leak its likely impossible to repair its not like its something you broke either thats just an old window or cheap one theres a sealant in there that over time breaks down

try to find a clear link that describes the problem do this in writing not verbally explain the seal on the window has deteriorated  the mold is inside the double pane 

to be fair the bathroom should have a strong enough ceiling fan and vent that you dont need a window and door open to take a normallength shower
if someone is emotionally unavailable but wanted to win someones favor back by doing zero work on themselves buying a box of stuff would be a great start 

obviously sending it back is expensive take the gifts send him a nice thank you but also let him know youd prefer not to receive any presents in the future where a nice card would do no point in reopening the door 

fyi whenever you break up with someone and finally start moving on feeling good or hopeful again 9 times out of 10 thats the exact moment the ex will pop up again in some way i swear its a test
hes 7 years older than you he gets drunk and acts like a rude disrespectful asshole then he spins it around that hes pissed with you that you dont like his rude disrespectful behavior 

if you are going to date someone older do it because you get along and they are emotionally mature  emotionally intelligent humans not two 12yearolds wearing a trench coat
neither of us wanted a relationship but we maybe established that we were exclusive

whaaat

my guy has never even taken me out for coffee

so you are exclusively having sex only no romance no dates with some guy as a fwb thingie but not dating and not in a relationship

so you are exclusive fwb just dont do that that sounds miserable 

you are either exclusively dating someone as in you go out together and do normal partner stuff  they are your only sexual partner or you are just sleeping with someone in a fwb situation where they have no say over who else you see
you can try calling county mental health hotline and see if they will connect you to a caseworker who may come out and see if hes open to shelters etc probably not with the meth thing going on 

you could get motion sensor sprinklers to go off when someone walks on your front lawn area 

heres a list of resources you will see there are some nonpolice numbers for mental health and mobile response teams  some county and some nonprofit first off id call la county health and open a case on him to start the ball rolling 

for la countys access crisis hotline  
247 mobile crisis response team access operates 24 hoursday 7 daysweek as the entry point for mental health services in los angeles county services include deployment of crisis evaluation teams information and referrals gatekeeping of acute inpatient psychiatric beds interpreter services and patient transport request psychiatric mobile response team  team is made up of two dmh clinicians law enforcement will be involved only if requested by clinicians based on danger assessment  
1 800 8547771 press 1 for crisis services  


you say he is not aggressive and always goes away when you ask so hes really not a violent threat so he cant be taken away so to speak away from your neighborhood without his permission to go to a shelter or temp housing or treatment

it doesnt mean if meth is involved that he wont get a bit stabby but i think your best bet is call the la county mental health  and try to get to a caseworker if a caseworker makes contact with him it is a loooong process but housing or treatment can be offered and sometimes they can get them off the streets 

second best is temporarily make your front porch as noninviting as possible no chairs cap spigot motion sensor sprinklers 

unfortunately once your home is chosen it is very difficult to getting unchosen without investing a front yard fence and locked gate
while there are plenty of small towns in northern california where things can get weird the fact that the lady and the dog had little to no reaction makes me think it was sound bouncing or echoing against something so when you and your sister heard it across the street you both heard it as warped
wipe him down with a warm washcloth to get the oil off him so he doesnt lick it clean try mixing the kitten wet food with the kitten milk to see if that helps him get some down 

there is a way to safely wash stray kittens but no need to overstress him right now vet asap to get rid of wormsfleas 

such a good grump face
add it to salad dressings make tzatziki blend with fresh or frozen fruit then freeze to make popsicles
the people in this thread including op rationalizing what she did are really gross

  
at one party investigators said oconnor gave a boy a condom and pushed him into a bedroom where a girl was slipping in and out of consciousness the girl was so scared that she locked herself in a bathroom to get away from the boy another girl said she cried as she was sexually assaulted by a boy and oconnor reacted by laughing  
some of the sexual encounters between teens happened in oconnors hot tube while the mom was also in the hot tube one 14yearold girl said she almost drowned because she was dangerously intoxicated oconnor was always the only adult present at the parties hanks wrote

oconnor told all minors who attended parties at her residence or were given alcohol not to tell anyone about the parties she stated if anyone was told she could go to jail hanks wrote 

oconnor believed jane doe 5 age 14 was breaking this rule she imposed as a result oconnor threatened to spread rumors about jane doe 5 

she threatened a 14 year old girl to spread rumors if she reported what happened multiple teen girls from age 1315 came forward to collaborate the woman is a child sex predator 

if you think this is some mom wanting to have fun please never have kids 


dude she got girls drunk then when they were passed out she brought the boys into where they were passed  encouraged them to rape them what the fuck are you trying to defend you weird sicko none of this is like a parent giving kids booze and condoms
she didnt encourage drunk kids to have sex she got teenager girls drunk to the point they were in and out of consciousness then encouraged her son and friends to rape them 

she then fled the state 

why minimize rape is a violent crime btw and yeah kids party and have sex   parents have bought teens booze to drink not a big deal in my opinion but being the consigliere to help assist in sexual assault is completely abhorrent predatory behavior
has been caught alone with my toddler in her room several times  
has been caught alone with my toddler in her bathroom several times while indecent

i would have called the police or still call and start a paper trail in case she escalates her behavior  you need a restraining order this is a disturbed individual and you definitely never should have let her be in your home after the first incident 

i am a push over and let ppl take advantage of me bc i dont like confrontation

my friend therapy lear to speak up this was beyond being a doormat or a pushover you endangered your kid with an unhinged individual in your home
be polite firm and cut ties

wanting flowers from your garden that you paid for  now own is a huge overstep so these are the types to view themselves as still entitled to a home they sold

i had similar with the first house i bought i put up with it somewhat because i wanted to be able to address any questions but the guy actually did not give me good info over time  felt like he still had some connection to the home older invasive personality type i should have shut it down

lesson learned any questions after i buy go i will go back to my agent and ask them to follow up with the seller agent even a few months down the road the agent made decent money off the sale and wants referrals from me so they can field a few emails for me as a buffer if a few months have passed by then its on me to do the legwork and figure out any previous work
im convinced that all home warranty companies only outsource to 1star repair companies intentionally so they never have to pay to fix like they scour google looking for repair people who have all bad reviews this way the insured person will get fed up after 1 or 2 goarounds and pay for it themselves as you are

you are better off going through the original warranty on the appliance or replacing it if its out of warranty
look i am someone who strongly believes that a fetus is not a human and early termination is 100 okay thing to have to happen its not okay to repetitively use abortion instead of practicing safe sex and birth control but thats not what happened here

know that when you are making the right choice for you you are making the right choice for what is currently part of your body seek normal counseling be very careful about prolife centers offering fake counseling to deal with any emotional fallout but whatever your gut instincts tell you you need to do you can trust your insticts are right
you are in seattle but in ca it is like this

landlord must accept first qualified applicant  the 2012 fair housing handbook of california says on page 24 the landlord should take the time to check out the information and make a selection based on the first qualified applicants although there is no statute to support this its recommended but not law

basically even if it is seattle law its got no real way of being enforced while they are only taking zillow applications they can also claim someone was there before you and gave them an inperson application and you have no real way of disputing it

if they didnt receive the credit report they can use that reason so i would resolve the issue with experian or get pdf from experian or transunion since those are more official than credit karma

edit if your main concern is how long to reach back out check in by end of day today and ask if the credit report still qualifies you or if theyd like to receive something from the other two if they only take messages through zillow they should be checking it once a day at least being too eager but polite isnt a crime
first off i am sorry for your loss but you are going to have to forgive yourself and in a way you owe the friend an apology for putting her in this situation 

if one dog is aggressive  reactive to the point of fighting that dog needs training just keeping two dogs who live in the same household separated was never a tenable longterm situation at the very least have them housesat separately when away because an untrained reactive dog left without its owner that was the moment it was going to happen
forward the email to the pm cc all parties on the lease  write at the top pm is handling this unit for legal purposes please keep all communication with the correct party i will not be responding to any future correspondence 

block and live your life you are paying the pm to deal in the future with asshole people never be generous because its never enough
if you are in therapy talk to your therapist if you are not in therapy get into therapy 

someone taking no action to change the cycle or help themselves is difficult to observe someone taking even babysteps to get out of where they are at makes it much easier for a partner to cope

can you rectify the situation yes with the right person you can it will take some active listening and being vulnerable and honest without dumping on them i know ive been hard to live with and youve taken the brunt of where i am at right now can i do something small or can we plan something fun and not heacy to help us both have some relief i am working on looking to get myself help

problem is thats hard to do when youre depressed so that is why you need to be seeking outside help to get yourself there
that poor monstera has already seen some things
if you are with someone who puts you down and makes you feel bad about yourself for something as innate as how you speak you are with a bad person relationships should in theory be with people who lift us up you deserve better

edit for nonuk dwellers he is basically telling her she sounds workingclass or lowerclass dudes a little twat
i vote its fake but wellwritten revenge fantasy

does sally has no shame i said enough is enough my parents need to see what kind of person maya is 

oop meant to write what kind of person sally is but lost track of the character list id say thats just a mixup but given how much resentment the entire saga is about how horrific sally is kinda weird to suddenly forget sallys name there
as someone who has lived in both the us is still probably much faster paced than the grinding slowness of the uk but know that some systems are pretty effed here postpandemic while its not the bureaucratic or the oldtimey some things still only exist in a paper trail call your solicitor slowness there supply chain issues have caused a lot of issues in almost all industries from construction appliances cars to even restaurants and pretty much universally hearing that from the cheapy hmos to even higherend private medical care there is a burnout factor medical professionals in certain fields seem less careoriented getting appointments has become difficult and everywhere is understaffed from the great resignation also much higher increase across the country in car accidents and fatalities americans completely forgot how to even pretend like they care when driving 

still what we dont have in easy access to great produce and meat  delightfully named cookies biscuits we make up in 24 hour grocers with 1015 types of frozen pizzas 
if the suicidal thoughts continue call or text someone at the hotline 

your life is easily worth more than 5000  and you have a kid so thats the number one priority 

number two priority if you had a therapist call them or go to a meeting get some help for staying sober if you have friends or family that you trust who are a good support system tell them what is going on 

your financial messup isnt the worst by a long shot get your mental health squared away first
so some community colleges have a program where you can study abroad for a semester its not the same as enrolling in a european university but with a 23 gpa thats really your only path 

but a better focus would be to keep going to the community college you are at start attending the tutoring center for assistance in the classes you are struggling in then transfer to a decent 4 year school that has a study abroad program until you deal with whats causing the low grades distractions time management learning issues an overseas trip isnt going to make you a better student
unacceptable especially pic 2 and 3 they did such a crap job id be worried if they know how to do it right send pics to the owner if he or she had a crew  ask for different people to come back to fix it
when say put your foot down do you mean floor it like push down fast and all the way to the floor with the gas pedal because i basically have avoided that after the first few lurches if i press down smoothly  not too fast i have no problem with smooth acceleration 

look up subaru throttle calibration on the subaru outback forums theres some calibration you can do at home or the second thing is you can have the dealer reset the adaptive memory when it comes to shifting and the car learning how aggressivesubdued the driver is from my basic understanding the first 1000 miles is you kinda training the car to handle various driving situations so its good to avoid flooring it during that period 

again  just trying to learn the nuances myself
hubs really wants to move to a cheaper state where we will have no income tax

make sure he looks into the cost of property taxes in the new state lots of ca residents moved to cheaper regions only to realize property taxes are much higher even if cost of housing is lower 

anyway as for the rest of it sounds like the new home ticks all your boxes and ca housing is never that hard hit even in a recession what drops comes back fairly quickly so if you plan on this to be a forever home or even your next 57 year home you will make it back in equity  increased property values down the road
still trying to figure it out so take with a grain of salt

i have the xt if i am already at 2000 rpm and then trying to get up to higher speed everything goes very smoothly 

if i am oh trying to run through a yellow light has happened a few times and floored it  last minute to get through then there was a weird pause almost like the car is thinking about which gear it wants then a high lurch forward 

basically if i am very smooth on the throttle and never lead foot the gas pedal all the way to floor there is a fairly smooth response in getting up to speed anytime i am running around in traffic then suddenly want an immediate speed up bad response
i know what does he expect tenants with ibs to do hold it
seconded for michael sealy i forgot about him he got me through some rough sleep periods
you may be able to make enough of a stink pardon the pun to get out of your lease if its a big concern for you  you are having physical symptoms

you can avoid the 750 fee and find online labs that will send you a few petri dishes you leave out in various rooms then mail back to their lab for an assessment for about 100 is it the most reliable sensitive nope but if there really is enough mold to be making that kind of smell something will likely show in the report i was getting sick at a place next to a dry cleaners and the company report showed a whole host of chemicals used in dry cleaning and mold in the air in my apartment so they did okay
she doesnt need a boyfriend she needs a treatment center to dry out in 30 days sober with meetings and a support group and to want to do that on her own you cant make her unless you actually do leave because without help shes going to be drinking again you are going to keep moving the goalposts and are currently her enabler 

go to alanon and learn about codependency
eh at some point especially in your 20s you realize some friend groups arent meant to last forever the selling you out for clout part bugged me not 100 even sure what that means but it sounds like they put you down to make them look better thats just shitty behavior 

focus on the new people in your life if theres someone in the group you especially like or felt really close to in the past you can have a oneonone with them and tell them how you feel but focus on new people near where you live explore your interests and expand your circles never make more effort for people than they are showing you they want to make for you
yeah i have adhd was a hot mess at 25 but held down a job and i sure as hell didnt have a kid but if i was away from my pet rabbit that i loved i thought about him all the time out of sight out of mind is an excuse hes using to be a horrific emotionally negligent dad 

while its always a spectrum you are dating a manchild who is weaponizing a disability to be coddled for his entire life adhd grants you the right to accommodations in the workplace or school  should be given empathy for someone who is struggling but someone who is struggling should be getting themselves help 

hes not struggling hes just committed to a life being a lump on a stick  arranging people around him who will enable those life goals

you can break up with people for any reason
part of the issue with sf east bay and south bay is as soon as you go under 1m you are competing with a really high pool of buyers 

from my nonscientific study checking redfin homes priced at 15m  up that are still really starter house range size age condition now sit longer although they still eventually move maybe a little lower than asking sometimes over 

otherwise yeah i am not really seeing the crash the west coast is supposedly having in northern or southern ca
have the family member ask their doctor make sure they tell them its for if and when it is terminal but that theyd like to know the process 

my friend chose this option when she had tried multiple treatments for bone cancer for 4 years she had options to do it at home but in the end they went to ucla she had a nice private room and she passed there the main thing i recall is that she had to take the medication herself no one could administer it to her  it was not instantaneous though she went out of consciousness within an hour
to be fair in the current market homebuying is the one situation where an emotional support animal makes sense
look oregon trail millennials a microgeneration of millennials who would have been teens in the early 2000s for most of them there would be a computer at school the public library and maybe they had a friend who had one but the internet didnt impact an average teenagers daily life in any significant way
tell him to shut up and get over himself his behavior is completely unacceptable  you wont tolerate being spoken to like that 

he knows you love the dog so hes dragging you over hot coals and you feel like crud about the dog so some part of your brain believes him dont its a totally normal dog owner mistake

question has she said or done things in front of you that were rude  disrespectful

its not that i wouldnt believe his twin  cousin but when you are bringing up an issue with someone or their significant other it is best to keep it to the stuff youve been subject to or observed otherwise you dont have as strong an argument they can claim a misunderstanding or misinterpretation and you werent there to combat that 

and it is fair game to tell him what you think based on your experience
if you are considering it ask him what changed his reply may tell you a lot in the end trust your gut  how you feel
watch a bunch of film and tv from that era friends and seinfield dont count tons of art house and indie films made in the 90s captured cultural attitudes  the nihilistic weirdness better hackers party girl slackers office space my own private idaho night on earth some documentaries do a great job of getting the feel of what was culturally shifting

the internet did not dominate peoples lives cell phones and car phones were huge edit huge as in they were physically big but not comon and people who had them were considered selfimportant or trying to show off doctors and drug dealers carried beepers answering machines could eat an important message you would never know who called mixed tapes still happened and were works of art

it wasnt really into y2k that people outside of silicon valley and specific industries developed awareness of what we had just lived through and what the future would be like  how globalized things were nato expansion was happening after the fall of the soviet union late 90s wto protests good luck

pro they have their rent covered  it is paid directly to the landlord from the program

i believe however double check it is up to a landlord to agree to accept housing vouchers or not
the nice thing is doesnt it feel like whoa free shoes
you were approved on paper at one rate then the rate changes and the buyer cant make the monthly payments as you get closer to closing escrow the mortgage lender can ask for more paperwork that screws things up buyer made a large purchase during escrow never got preapproval for the mortgage and then are denied issues with the home like easements or property lines discovered issues with the titledeed that arent discovered until escrow buyer got cold feet tons of reasons

then they can rent from a different person

outback drives and feels like a sedan when you are in it forester definitely drives more like a truck from a seating and height perspective

honestly could do with something in between a crosstrek and an outback in terms of a better quality interior crosstrek or a slightly smaller outback but given the size of every other car on the road where i am  how people drive now id rather have the larger amount of steel between me and an suv or a truck in case of an accident
bonus points for engineers they fix everything themselves

downvote i bought a home from an engineer he fixed everything himself and while it was all functional until it wasnt every person who came to do a repair electrical plumbing etc would have a wtf moment trying to decipher what the hell he had done 

not to mention he spent a couple of decades doing his own interior design fixes like putting up his own crown molding and his own kitchen cabinets i spent a few years sinking screws and puttying calking and puttying and generally trying to make semistructurally sound improvements actually look decent 

i called all the wtfs neds after him why does the kitchen wall tile backsplash parallel the crooked floor instead of having been applied level oh thats just a ned

dont respond go about your life silent treatment is passiveaggressive abusive bullshit people are allowed to say i am angry and i need some space but the cold shoulder and fuck off bs nope

i have a flight home in four weeks to renew my visa

when you get home take several days to feel how it feels not to be living in a tense house with a partner who gives you the silent treatment over petty things really feel if you physically feel different less stress in your body are you more relaxed 

if the answer is yes to that you may want to stay in your home country a little bit longer
she keeps saying i love you and spending our lives together

after 4 months and only just meeting up in person she is in a honeymoon phase and loves the idea of you add to that the heightened intensity of intimacy from texting  talking for months 

but you dont even feel the honeymoon rush anymore so cut it out now break up asap or it will get worse for her

everyone is different some people feel physical attraction from emotional intimacy  some people need certain physical features in their partner to feel desire you now know you need the physical aspect to be a certain way to desire someone so dont do this longdistance thing again you both built up an entire world without meeting in person and it is always a risk to go that route can it work out sure especially for people who primarily feel attraction via emotional and intellectual stimulation and are less in need of a specific physical appearance
being out in the public sphere in new orleans is a whole thing 

it is the only city in the world where complete strangers would call out how you doin baby with that no accent and id be like how you doin back  totally charmed instead of wanting to hit them upside the head

the rest of the south being friendly is bs everything is catty backtalk and bless your heart passiveaggressive bs but no does have real warmth to it despite all its issues 

flipside complete randos ending up telling me their entire life stories including inappropriate crazy ass details and while very interesting it got a bit emotionally draining

could also be too much betacarotene in the vitamins it can cause a yellowish discoloration of the skin

one is benign and will reverse as soon as he stops taking the vitamins the other is lifeendangering so he needs to go to the doctor

evil psychopath who convinced people she was a genius 

her idea would never work she was told it would never work then she went into smoke and mirrors con artist mode she likely deluded herself but not an actual genius
however i know that there are some things that my wife would not open up about to a therapist 

no you dont none of us are in other peoples heads just because shes never fully opened up to you doesnt mean she wouldnt open up to a therapist people are complicated and trauma can be very personal but often it feels safer to explain it to an expert than it does sometimes to share with a partner especially if you are talking about childhood trauma thats now impacted her view of her own body

x200b

would i be completely out of line

yes dont try to start controlling her therapy before shes even started or set up a failure success dichotomy if you dont tell them x then you wont have success in therapy bad idea dont ask her what goes on during private sessions just tell her you support the idea that she wants to get help make sure she can get to therapy easily on the days she has it and be gentle and extra aware on those days to not overburden her
stop engaging shes not pregnant shes creating drama and youre feeding it youre a fixation of hers right now any response especially this type of reaction

i called her around 20 times

is feeding the drama cycle of bs you are acting as unhinged as she is by responding to a nonsensical statement i have a belly button like that 

take the lessons learned and walk away no more contact
individual counseling getting jumped and assaulted is trauma and you need to focus on your own recovery as much as it seems like a double letdown he both failed to protect you in the moment  then later wanted to abandon you a second time because of that failure witness to violence is also a traumatic event 

just get some counseling for right now and heal you can decide the fate of your relationship when you have some tools under your belt to cope with the immediate aftermath of the incident best wishes
hes almost 40 his best friend is a 27yearold who is emotionally immature even for that age and plays mind games he enjoys or hed be setting the boundaries and 

x200b

he says she is too emotionally unstable to be in a relationship with

so if she gets her mental health together hed be dating her

you are a placeholder after 3 months of being given second place during the honeymoon phase where you both should be having fun you are mainly an invited audience member to watch their drama unfold you shouldnt have to be explaining half of this to someone who just lost a previous relationship over the same issue walk away friend
i like it a lot but its skulls there are not a lot of ways to despooky the exposed head bones of dead animals on a black background

if it was a larger still life of more objects skulls hat flowers wine etc on a light background like a southwestern blue sky it would be less spooky 

but with the way youve centered the skulls on a dark background i mostly want you to paint a moon above that is the light source for them which is only going to spookify it more i say embrace the tone thats created here 
so the thing that doesnt make sense the wife had an old prescription for seroquel meaning at one time she was prescribed antipsychotic medication and must have had at least one psychotic episode herself yet in the update post shes described as confused and didnt know what was going on him

wouldnt the wife know what a psychotic episode looks like
you can at least ask what theyd be asking and tell them what you were thinking

yes meant to be implied in the order of the sentence but probably should have used then tell them let owners go first
looks like monterey ca very beautiful
he makes major life decisions on a whim like buying a house so yeah why wouldnt he flip on other major life decisions like a longterm plan to move

hes 7 years older than you and likes how he has his life arranged if you want something different moving to sf then plan for it on your own if you want to stay in the current situation no real intent to change your relationship dynamic then stay
i dont know if it is a bad photo but that just looks like the slight damage from having a dresser against a wall aka normal wear and tear try a magic eraser melamine foam on it
hi you know we love this house and our time here over the past 8 years and you have been stellar landlords as we eventually start our plans to buy our own first home we thought it worth asking if youd ever consider selling to us 

just keep it vague and polite and start a conversation they can always say no they may say yes its a no harm no foul situation if you make a polite inquiry 

id have comps ready know how much home you can buy and what sort of mortgage youd be looking at so if they do say yes you can at least ask what theyd be asking and tell them what you were thinking in terms of a solid offer
you are way too invested in someone who has porous boundaries as do you you secretly hope youll get back together and she is using you as a safe person 

she told you to leave her alone believe her and respect that stay professional at work shell probably reach back out when she needs another standin as a partner you should move on and not reengage although based on your behaviors in the post you likely will
maybe dont do that
there are stories that use a lot of references to brands or companies think american psycho  it is a stylistic choice so its constant throughout 

while google is part of our daily lexicon it wont really be a word until the company itself has collapsed may happen or is replaced by stronger competition and people still use it to mean searched online 

i would use looked or searched online
op wont get their commission unless their clients pay over asking on one of the current crapboxes available so suck it up homebuyers

they imply this is meant to be a public service announcement but if they have multiple clients pulling out of sales at the last minute i question how great of a realtor they are both in making sure the homes their clients are bidding on match the clients needs   they are transparent on the process of closing
sounds like a combo platter of things older population older buildings thin floors less insulation and a possible sprinkling of very real xenophobia especially as you feel it is coming from an older generation in general 

start your search for a topstory apartment youve found coping mechanisms for now headphones maybe also find peaceful areas to work a few hours a day outside of your home to get a reprieve if you can then take your time and do a really long apartment search until you find something that covers everything you want maybe looking at smaller buildings top floor etc

as a noisesensitive person i can tell you sounds coming through the floorboards never hit as badly as when there is banging over your head good luck
i dont know id prefer a tenant who wants to be cautious of what they are signing and take the time to read things thoroughly over one who signs a lease without reading it

you could ask them what their specific questions and concerns are

explain that you prefer to give the lease to those that apply and qualify first but id understand not wanting to pay an application fee if the lease has problematic clauses in it
my god this would horrify me 

its not even the food waste though it is that its the pure decadence of it in search of fame likes followers

i get liking to cook but a huge part of what makes cooking feel good to most nonsociopaths is the act of enjoying eating it sharing it or at least seeing someone else enjoy it even the most megalomaniac chefs in highend restaurants want their art to be enjoyed 

theres even been a movement in highend food photography to promote less waste so it can be eaten after a photo shoot rather than get tossed  

if his instagram thing was making overthetop food and having people over to enjoy it id be okay with the charcuterie or the lobster or the thanksgiving spread but this is like a psychopathic level of removal from reality
nice very lush  beautiful up there
ooooh what island or island groups may i ask
id show her the box and ask her also check the box to see the manufacturing date just in case she really hasnt cleaned her car in years
i like the term and will continue using it maybe not on this sub for whatever reasons but quite frankly it is a much better descriptor

i mean fuck it im not normal edited to add and theres no inherent shame in that
he then said that any other women can do the exact same thing and that im nothing special i was speechless i know hes right

friend hes not right when someone loves and respects you you arent interchangeable with a bunch of other people because they love you

he sees women as interchangeable objects for transactional exchanges hell help you out but you are nothing to him big picture because hes incapable of it you deserve so much better even being on your own and struggling a bit is 1000 better than being with this hot bag of garbage
ah yes thank you

i like it slightly bigger rug under the couch sitting area and then another rug by the stairway maybe tape off the floor and really see how large of rugs youd want that could ground the space more
yeah all of mine prospered very well for at least a few years until one day they didnt it was like 

im alive 

im alive

im alive

oops i died
what section of the country
well at least we all know yes she likely was an awful parent based on that response and yes a lot of your struggles were her fault not your adhd but her lack of empathetic response her need to make everything about her and her shitty emotional skills

keep up the therapy eventually you will get to a place where you can  see your mom for the flawed person she is and wont need her support because youve learned how to support yourself and you have learned you deserve safe people in your life 

its doable
what part of the country is this east coast that looks like a crapfest out there 

im on west coast where we are supposedly having a decline in prices and it just seems like a locking pattern not a lot on the market whats on it is either in bad condition  sits or in decent condition area still sells quickly over very little inventory because i think a lot of people have decided not to sell under current conditions minus death or life moves
thanks for the input what part of the uk are you in if you dont mind saying
are you still going back to the uk frequently if so i have a question is the uk on the same path but a little less than the us

i grew up in the us primarily but have a british passport and a us passport and have been thinking about moving to the uk i havent really spent any real time there since 2010 though  most of my family there grandmother uncle have all passed now or moved away

postbrexit i am wondering if the uk is that much better off on social issues than the us

i feel like the overturning of roe v wade our higher amount of guns per capita school shootings high costs of medical care failing infrastructure are all getting to me and ive had to deal with gun violence here us a few times in my work and old neighborhood

but then i hear about the nhs getting defunded nazis in the labor party and ukipers in the right housing issues gross inequity i worry is the uk just a lesser degree of dystopia now
i had a horrible emotional crash on focalin and ritalin it made me extremely sad every evening when it wore off tell your prescribing doctor whats happening and ask them if you should continue or if they want to try a different medication
is your dog crate trained thats the best way to stop him or her from barking when you are not home the dog may not bark a lot when you are there but could have anxiety when you leave most of the time 1020 minutes of nonstop barks will get a neighbor to report you

id contact the office and let them know you are getting a camera to monitor the situation inside your home and are working on training to make sure the dog barks less this way they know you take them seriously but also that you will have a record of the dogs barking if they go further
get out see if it has a collar with a phone number on it call animal control be a fucking semidecent human
ooof thats the worst
got it thanks
ah thank you i was trying rotating and couldnt make it work
you can certainly ask you may get farther if you ask for a reduced fee and cite that no furniture will be moved in if that is truly the case its a condo board however and they like their fees if it is in the ccr rules regulations and covenants then you dont have any right to a discount but it cant hurt to try
now theyre asking for another year

problem is you are dealing with thin edge of the wedge types who keep pushing the goalposts 

normally id suggest having tenants pay a percentage of back rent owed with each rent payment once they are back on their feet to prevent later problems 

but for now just move forward with your goal talk to a re lawyer in your area and find out what the absolute proper steps are for evictions are and proceed from there you gave them a year youve been more than flexible and you dont want to be doing this so youve acted above and beyond 

as far as recouping losses down the road sure small claims court but if people have no money its a lot of work for unlikely pay sometimes you just take a financial loss to learn a lesson i wouldnt worry about that until the situation arises i probably shouldnt have brought it up
 as well as selling plasma

not a solid longterm plan you can only safely do that about once a month and getting sick at any point in the year would make it more difficult 

unasked for financial advice fafsa to cover cost of school or textbooks okay but dont take out student loans to live beyond your means you decide you dont like the program or drop out you are on the line for those loans always try for the least amount of student loans possible 

look for a roomtorent or small inlaw situation based on your gi monthly housing allowance you will have it a lot easier as a tenant in a private home than getting an apartment depending on cost of living in the area
thats already been reduced by a forfeit of the security deposit

just to prepare you this is moving into eviction territory and you need to prepare yourself that the place will be trashed since they no longer have a security deposit on the line
you are in your 30s time to start wanting better for yourself

i see all your excuses in the comments dude has a platonic love affair with another woman he shows her more respect than he shows you he shows his friends more respect than he shows you hell never date her because hes a friends ex  keeps convincing you are the one who is out of line

the thing is we get to have boundaries but if someone doesnt like our boundaries we get to see they arent right for us you have given him several chances to institute less intimacy with her and each time he gets mad at you andor calls you crazy

you sound so insecure in this post you arent sure if you are wrong for feeling this way etc etc you are allowing someone to shout at you in public yelling and calling you crazy is an unacceptable response  berating someone in private or public is unacceptable behavior

your feelings are valid how you and your partner handle them is what matters youve gotten so brow beaten by this dynamic you are internalizing that wanting respect  you are in the wrong
okay so what qualifies as lowincome renter in the bill 

because if this is for people who qualify for section 8 i can just see the unintended consequences of less section 8 housing being offered if this is about income qualifications then the same but it would be less clear cut ie tenant moves in with a certain income then faces unemployment
im in the south bay and dealing with a neglected rental property trying to fix it up to better standards for an elderly family member id love some good resources for making sure everything is on the up and up before i put it back up for rent please
also was just thinking that we tend to be on semihigher alert when out in public especially when you are a woman but you want to be able to just relax by the time you make it into your apartment shut the door and lock it 

also no one wants to be looking at their neighbors in their building and thinking is this one going to go full shooter on us

i suppose more will come out later but i really hope it wasnt a neighbor feud that went south 
several bullet holes were in the victims front door the rounds appeared to have been fired from the apartment located across the hall from the victims

yee gods if it was a neighbor going postal somehow thats so much worse than your usual mugging or home invasion
for a builtin bidet make sure you have a seal on the back of the seat using your arse and your knees clenched creating a total wall to block any spray the secret is to try and use as low of pressure as you can at first  make sure youre aiming at the correct parts never go full force out the gate
legally i have no idea what your recourse is but id be looking at tenant rights groups in the area they often have a lawyer you can at least consult with for no fees or email if you are paying full rent they should be providing you with comparable housing ie another unit thats similar not a hotel

asbestos mitigation can be anything from containment of a few air ducts to a full hazmat suit type jobby and it takes time  i looked up your address and unfortunately your building was built during the heyday of asbestos in everything from ceilings to floors id be asking questions to find out if there even is a reasonable timeline for a fix if they were waiting on the citycounty to do a check that makes sense that it took two weeks because the county moves slow 

but its kind of weird most of the asbestos from that period is in linoleum flooring or ceiling popcorn its technically not a hazard unless disturbed so unless a bunch of major leaks popped up in units and the ceilings are falling apart i would be wondering if they are kicking tenants out to do a major remodel and up rents that seems like a lot of mishagas to go through
friend you need therapy if those two raised you bullying  harassing your grown child into dating someone is not normal 

also you are so beat down from their controlling nature that you question your own gut instincts your gut instincts tell you the guy they want you to date has some core ideologies you disagree with homophobic thinks misogynists have some good points critical of your work in a way that is unnecessary

parents start berating you you learn to stand up to them that doesnt work then you put them on information diets give nonanswers etc until you can leave 

guys can be nice enough and also not the right romantic partner no one manipulates or pushes you into dating someone if you are questioning how you feel then you have every right to say no

if you are emotionally numb its not just your past romantic experiences its also the family home you are in
oh he totally married his mother thats why they hate each other
but she doesnt want me seeing my family even my siblings which havent done anything are lumped into the same pot the other day she told my daughter that my mother is not nice and later that same day called her a fing bh in front of the kids

honestly thats not your wifes call to make and the way shes bringing the kids onto her side is gross on multiple levels 

i dont know what your mom did you dont really say so she may be a real piece of work but between how your wife is handling it and the vague cheating you bring in at the end id say right now you have more of a wife problem than a parent problem 

how you move past it is some serious counseling with your wife about boundaries and supporting each other that goes for her to support you as well 

also you may have just married your mother which would explain a lot
this is how adults argue 

oh look the 36 year old man is telling the woman 10 years younger than him how adult he is 

except adults and emotionally mature people actually regulate their emotions so that they can express frustration or even anger without yelling or being abusive 

hes taking his bullshit out on you and its damaging to you its damaging to your central nervous system  physical and psychological wellbeing 

develop a zero tolerance for tantrumthrowing adults its the best policy
i would have left the drip system on a timer and then put in the lease that it is the tenants responsibility to maintain the yard in good alive condition however the landlord will be by twice quarterly or bimonthly to do any larger maintenance projects
ya never know what someone else is going through she may have deleted her entire account she may be in her own downward shame spiral and unable to socialize but feels like she has to keep trying or she may secretly have hated you for years unlikely

you seriously cant know anything other than this person dropped the ball on you you made a goodfaith effort to be in touch and whatever is going on the most likely scenario is it has nothing to do with you

best path forward wish her well in your heart and if she does touch base be open to it
 im sick of walking on eggshells

if you are an adult and you feel you are walking on eggshells with your mom you have problems in the relationship therapy could really help you basically need to get your own phone line the insane deal is bullshit and you instead are asking her permission 

what you mom is doing is very controlling youve been conditioned to just accept this quirk and call it overprotective but it is detrimental to your own sense of individualism and independence 

setting boundaries with a controlling person even someone who does love you takes a lot of growth again either put your foot down and get your own phone line now or go to therapy until you have the skill set to do so
once my business closes there will be no landing place for me here in this city again 

honestly you can never say never you are only 27 young and will have an acupuncture license when the next phase is through i think you are convincing yourself it is over in order to close the door on this period albeit cost of living and other things you are likely correct but you still never know 100 

you are making a really smart choice in terms of paying for school so keep that the focus you are also choosing a path that will be less hard on your body so those two points alone make it a smart move 

it will make the current moment less stressful if you convince yourself of something different maybe ill be back here someday with a different career maybe i wont meanwhile spend a little time going around to your favorite parts of the city you are in and have a little goodbye ceremony time
honestly looking at your comments there is nothing a new different house is going to fix in this relationship that couldnt be fixed in your current situation if he wanted to make it work

you keep saying you are thwarted in the home because its his house so theres this feeling like a new different home in both your names would give you equal say if the relationship was working it would work now through reasonable compromises where you are

he has a home hes not invested in buying a new home with you  hes making that clear i suggest you start looking based on your own income at townhouses condos and smaller places 

if you dont want your life on hold then move it ahead 

if you do buy together talk to a lawyer because you are setting yourself up without some sort of agreement in place if the relationship doesnt work out long term and you arent married
i have gotten hints that she might not attend and honestly that would be a breaking point in our relationship for me 

i hate to say it but shes not coming to your wedding no one goes through 3 years of being a shutin to decide their first foray into the world will be airplane travel and attending a large party sorry 

while it sounds like a combo of agoraphobia mixing with realworld events i dont think this is your problem to fix you have to move into acceptance while hoping she decides this is something she herself wants to fix 

i think a lot of people discovered that they preferred the quiet and the lack of social pressures during lockdown some of it can be mental health but some of it can be that this is actually a preferred lifestyle for her  covid is the excuse to keep it going but thats for her to fix in therapy and first she has to want to fix it
its always going to be a slight game of russian roulette most people will be fine miserably sick for a few weeks to a month but otherwise fine

her friends fear of long covid is a valid enough concern in that she isnt wrong that it is a possibility we dont have enough data to know why some people get it and some dont 

though the two people i know with long term symptoms got it back before vaccines so i wish there was more information made public on how well vaccines prevent it
beautiful did you use a stencil or freehand
he uses it and then 3 minutes later he uses it again

thats absolutely not normal and indicates a urinary track issue he needs to be checked by a vet
like im some culinary assassin

uh you are not the assassin here hes the one who may have killed you
the best times to negotiate on rents are situations like early days of the pandemic or during a bad economic downturn like 2008

if the landlord can easily get what he or she wants to raise the rent to from a new tenant you do not have a ton of power unless you are a good longterm tenant with a known track record with them

read up on what is and isnt covered under rent control in california

edit oh i see it is a house i would not try to negotiate rent increase on a freestanding home in ca unfortunately for you free standing homes are not under rent control which means the owner can actually yonk your rent up to whatever amount they want with no caps 8 is common amount for a rent control unit during high inflation so theyd stayed within the realm of decent
a visa gift card can be used anywhere so that makes the most sense to me
i work from home and enjoy an empty house

then you really shouldnt really be subleasing to a roommate if you want to control the times of day they are in the home 

i dont know why any of that sounds not on the up and up so unless mysterious russian men are dropping off large packages at weird hours or a parole officer is making unannounced visits you have a clean courteous tenant who pays rent on time
not to victim blame that counter but a wood countertop in a rental is kinda asking for it
look when i clear a level in 2 dots and it responds with brilliant or genius i say thank you out loud 

i currently have positive accountability with someone texting on a daily goal and receiving positive short replies but i like this almost better ill see if it keeps working nicely done
i am of the school of thought that no one should ever presume common sense sorry op and that one of the issues with running a shortterm rental is you will get a high number of people coming through therefore you need to clearly and concisely reiterate any caretaking you want them to do while they stay this includes how to operate any large appliances that arent common 

there should have been either a sign by the tub or instructions in the place for use and care every public hot tub or sauna ive gone to has some sort of instruction and disclaimers posted 

personally that much damage from a storm i think they are yanking your chain  most of that sounds like yearly maintenance they should be on the hook for unless a gaint hairball the size of a small baby flew into a tub during the storm 

id push back and escalate it through airbnb you could always offer to pay half but i dont think you should
i will only accept the advert that defines adhd types incorrectly by animals

even then my type is a monkey who plays a constant tambourine but will stop suddenly to pet a dog  can hyperorganize a friends spice rack by usage and country while stopstarting a new craft and that one is sadly missing
you can still reach out to them via email that you will be using them as a reference and put their info plus dates of when you lived there down for any application and it is up to the new landlord to contact them

any schoolwork employment or mentors you can use as a character reference even a babysitting job

the reason i say start by looking for shared housing or someone renting out a room is they are more likely to run on meeting you and liking you than a paper trail of references

id look for facebook or reddit groups for the town you are moving to and post a few questions how people find shared housing there also worth asking the company where you are starting what they recommend perfectly fair inquiry as a new employee who is relocating 

edit and be very wary of scammers or people wanting to secure housing via facetime in person only
finally realises all he wants is me

took him 14 years to get there

x200b

he did resent me but no longer does 

amazing no therapy no reflection on his behavior all it took was you really taking measures to separate and now his resentments aka excuses for being abusive all went poof so if you choose to go back in and stay trust that all those resentments will be coming back they only disappear if he thinks hes losing you 

x200b

unfortunately we have to live in the same house and he has been smothering me with apology texts and looking for cheat hugs 

if this were me id use this short vacation away to put some effort into having breathing room and a lot of effort into figuring how to get out of the home 

the next few months will be him on best behavior with reoccurring lapses like the air tag he wants you to stay you will either be tempted to because you will get worn down or you will continue to try and separate being in a home with an abusive partner who you are trying to leave is an unsafe place to be
first off you had a traumatic incident that has shifted how safe you feel in the world therapy can really help process that and i highly recommend looking into it i dont think you ever have to go back to trusting total strangers with open doors but it may help skew the negativity around people you now feel more focused on

secondly for all his talk about values your boyfriend lacks empathy where it matters to you theres something off about seeing himself as this generous welcoming person to strangers when he cant be bothered to give that same empathy to his own significant other hes putting his personal ideology over your physical sense of safety 

so yeah you maybe dont have values that align but his are in no way superior despite how it sounds like hes viewing himself
its disrespectful to you and disrespectful to her he sees the value in women as objects also the fact that his friend group accepts thats a cool way to speak about another woman and to treat you is pretty gross too
as a curly hair the daily brushing oooof way to create a nonstop cycle of frizzzzzy
if she voices she doesnt like it and his response is to ignore her own input into her own appearance and act put out hes acting rather manipulatively 

you can suggest things you personally like to a so but you dont get to make it about your feelings when it is their appearance
just an fyi curly or wavey hair hates daily brushing hates it you are really causing more frizz brushing it out especially dry every day wide tooth comb while damp is the way to go but consult with a hair stylist who specializes in curly hair and youll get proper advice for your hair type

otherwise i think the issue you are having is that you feel fetishized or it certainly sounds like hes fetishizing your hair

you do need to work on your own insecurities and are likely seeing your own face through a slightly warped lens based on how you talk about yourself however i have never heard of someone building more confidence because their so calls them stupid i dont care how sweetly hes saying it or takes over control of how they look

for me personally someone invested in my grooming as a romantic gesture occasionally could be a nice experience but id get completely overwhelmed  irritated by someone controlling how i looked daily or assigning themselves that responsibility

tldr there is dressing or grooming a way that a so likes versus a so taking control over your appearance and refusing to listen to your valid concerns
i get that hes your first proper love but look at this objectively as an outsider hes 7 years older than you now has two kids from two different mothers and he lied early on in the relationship to the point id be questioning everything

the fact that he didnt want you traveling and hooking up with others while he himself did just that is another bad sign

sometimes you have to take the loss at 23 you have plenty of options to take the good and bad lessons from this relationship and find yourself a partner without this much baggage and questionable maturity

edit and your comment below

he says he wants to prioritise his daughter he did raise from birth as well as our relationship

yay hes also a deadbeat dad with no sense of responsibility for life

you are not bagging a winner here
you are talking about two different things the homes value versus rental income value 

not every homebuyer wants to be a landlord so an adu may not add to the homes value if you intend to rent out the house and keep it for some time id look at the potential rental income of both units versus the cost to build 

if you are thinking of selling it in the next year or two it isnt likely worth building an adu if you plan to rent it out for the next 710 years then it likely is
 and the last time i lived in an apartment was several years ago in undergrad

worth reaching out to the property manager or landlord there and seeing if they have a record of you paying rent on time and leaving the place in ok condition so you can use them as a referral 

otherwise look for a room to rent initially in your new town and once youve worked for 6 months to a year you will have enough pay stubs to start looking for your own place plus a local reference you can see if anyone rents specifically to grad students if it is a college town that will get you a quieter type of home
your bf isnt helping his friend hes being a white knight savior

she needs clinical help which he cant provide thats great you set a reasonable and totally logical boundary down no she cannot live with both of you and that he complied but i dont really see this getting better as a whole unless he can come to terms with the part he plays in her addiction cycle codependent rescuer

if he was a real friend hed be setting clear boundaries she needs longterm mental health care trauma therapy and addiction recovery likely in long term clean and sober living

none of these he can actually provide she prefers going to him because it keeps someone in her life and allows her to continue making the crap choices that her addiction follows he likes her coming to him because being someones rock makes him feel good about himself

ask him to attend alanon with you and see if he is willing its got issues but a lot of this kind of codependent bs  cycles are addressed there
you put down 20k in earnest money eeek

your father is correct on this one and in a weird way so is your so

you are not married he so is not contributing to the down payment  he is not on the mortgage his loans do make him a liability for all intents  purposes it is not his house so it makes sense his contribution should be viewed as rent and he should sign papers that he has no claim on the home edit in case of break up

if you and your dad cant really make that work with him viewed solely as a tenant then youve bought too much house
whispy willie
thats something i wonder about the entirety of the maga cultist i am talking about the diehards that later got into qanon  trumpism filled a social void in their lives 

especially the ones that used to travel around going to his rallies compulsively like the hateful dead for 65 and up its like the people who were completely lost after jerry garcia died
ah i misunderstood that you are the tenant

you are 100 in the right that is a shite fix and it will cause water damage down the road 

reword your email to sound professional you can still demand a proper fix and point out that you are paying market rent and have a right to expect market standards to be met in the apartment also point out the issues with longterm water damage and get what you want better if you first approach professionally 

escalate only after you get rebuffed dont come in swinging
if you dont have one lined up get a proper property manager you mention in the comments you are out of state  the other person who could go and check wont be back for a week you state he didnt return the keys but theres nobody there to see if the keys are there in an empty apartment if the place is truly clean or trashed 

does the previous lease state where the 30 days notice should go and was their a former contact he may have used 

if i just inherited a multiunit complex id want to get everyone on the same page know whats in all the leases plus avoid headaches thats too difficult to do out of state without a manager
its weird but it is always so much easier to get a job when you have a job its like hiring committees are more invested in wooing those that would be harder to snag and hate actual availability

you didnt ask for suggestions but a volunteer commitment once or twice a week outside of your home is helpful to regain that im a busy important person feeling that goes to help in interviews it also helps with the hopelessuseless feelings of unemployment and its also not a bad way to network a bit 

you mention wanting to change to a more communitybased field which means volunteering in something that is nearish to what interests you could really pay off
i pay for takeout and groceries

you pay for his meat products all groceries and you both split the cost of takeout

hes got it made no wonder hes refusing to learn to cook simple meals it would mean hed next have to learn how to grocery shop and pay for his own food

id go with an ultimatum any adult can watch youtube videos and learn how to prepare a few simple meals also stop making him special meat stuff he can go figure out the primal esoteric knowledge of meat  hot coalsfire  food
plus you have good food
haha thats my other joke that im coldblooded and need to sit on a sunny rock to recharge like a lizard
i hate to tell you but your best bet as an israeli is getting through service getting a topnotch engineering or tech degree and getting out via a work visa otherwise it is likely a ton of  and trying to go to college elsewhere but i have no clue what the illegalities are of leaving before serving 

isnt there a pacifist clause where you can do your military time in the idf in the kitchen or nonactive service
i found some relief when i got really really into lighting in general turns out halogen bulbs and fluorescents what a lot of the older models of sun lamps were made from come with whats called higher cri they duplicate color that noon sun would show better leds just have this weird synthetic feel to me i know delicate snowflake that i am

dark houses with old lighting are my bane i built a bunch of lights using halogen bulbs currently no longer available in the us but i bought a bunch on ebay and flooded my home with light yes that helped a great bit

the sit in front of this light box for 1020 minutes every morning and youll feel better solution never worked for me not saying they dont work just not in my case 

as others mentioned also getting your vit d levels checked and taking a vit d supplement can also help with the depression who knows if this is placebo but iron and b12 also helped me a bit too as i run anemic 

i still say nothing hits like sitting in a room filled with natural sunlight nothing
want to do tradesies i kid sort of grass always greener

higher wages come with their own issues especially in higher costofliving areas where the work expectations are also intense i want it now and i want it done right is great when you are on the receiving end but sucks when you have adhd and are meant to be delivering it i can do it right or i can do it now but i cant do both
first off you are alive they are alive and cars are replaceable thats all actually very good stuff

i have developed over years of dissociative tendencies to form what i call life or death mindfulness do i suck in general at the concept of mindfulness yes do i hate meditation and other techniques mindfulness proponents swear are the secret keys to a better life sure do but 

life or death mindfulness goes like this is my current action capable of major injury to life or limb for me or someone else if yes hey brain this action is all that matters right now 

cooking or any flammable task driving carrying a knife  climbing ladders  even walking down steep stairs or hiking rickety areas i can remind myself now that i do have to be present for this action if not for me then for others i still have accidents every so many years especially when i fall out of the practice usually prior to those accidents i can look back and note there was an increase in dissociating or high levels of stress so this is in no way a guaranteed process its an improvement only those accidents however set me up to be better for the next several years after one car accident and a few broken bones have gotten me to stay relatively alive  not killing anyone else for several decades on earth
i used to teach english i will die on the hill that local dialects are just as good as formal english for communicating if not better because they add life  nuance to language 

now for writing in formal settings it is always to the advantage of someone to learn basic grammar plus acceptable language and writing skills mainly because the world is filled with snobs like your girlfriend who will judge the crap out of you doesnt mean they are right just because there are many of them 

anyhoo you deserve to be with someone who sees you as worthy for your personal qualities not classist ideals i would bring it up she should know this hurts you and it is disrespectful to be badmouthing you to others or act ashamed of a partner badmouthing is very different than venting
going from a year lease to monthtomonth is common it makes your life somewhat easier ifwhen you want to move

as for the landlord considering selling it is not rude the next time you interact to ask him or her if they are looking to sell in the near future they only owe you a certain number of days notice 30 or 60 but its not offensive to casually inquire if they know what their longterm plans for the place are
i have always joked i have an oldschool camera aperture in my brain that is constantly seeking more light dark homes dark climates i get severe sad and am less productive 

ive bought the sun lamps taken vit d but nothing works like actual exposure to real sunlight 

one day i hope to move to the mediterranean will i be more productive i doubt it but my daily mood will be fantastic
i dont know why people are reading adhd into it in it he specifically says she was diagnosed at one point in childhood with autism he uses the word aspergers and depressed since childhood but never addressed it  she doesnt speak with her family its pretty easy to presume chaotic or traumatic childhood autism since thats the given diagnosis and lifelong depression from both of those sure she can have both but the post indicates a severely depressed person to me with possible autism more than adhd 

we have no idea whats really going on in anyones marriage if shes refusing therapy then thats one thing if no one has ever tried to get her help including him thats a totally different thing 

the term weaponized incompetence hurts when you are genuinely doing everything in your damn power to get through the day but some people also truly give up having depression adhd or autism means you deserve support and help only we do have to at some point in life meet people halfway and get outside help not rely on a single friend parent or spouse as your only source of caretaking or support
you had a terrible realtor if the inspection contingency was not waived then no need to forfeit your earnest money also you 100 made the right choice manufactured homes are the one area where repairs often cost more than the value the original building materials are worth and once water is in walls for a long time you are looking at mold conditions
your daughter is 100 correct

also as long as you are talking to her every night then you arent really seeing who else is out there that is actually available and actually interested in dating you 

id go so far as to guess you might be in love with her because shes not available  it is a convenient way for you to feel like you have somebody while not risking a real relationship 

go really date some women who want to be dating and are officially single
yeah that agent wants to buy it or a friend of his wants it or he wants to do a quick sale without having to market it for them unless it is in really poor condition theres no benefit for them to have fewer eyes on the house 

if they havent signed a seller agreement with him thats so shady that i would cut him loose
a properly wired habitable unit should be able to handle a coffee maker and microwave or have the right amount of outlets on separate breakers thats not extreme use
its called pharmacogenomic testing  i linked you to a mayo clinic page describing the process op said he was taking effexor its primarily used for antidepressants and i know it has been used somewhat for adhd meds it doesnt say what meds will work but narrows down metabolizing issues to let a psychiatrist at least see what is more likely to work better  have fewer side effect issues
any words of advice for how i might respond

since hes gone unilateral in his decisionmaking  putting his foot down you go unilateral in yours i will be quitting the restaurant and continuing to expand my business you can either support me or we can talk with lawyers

a partnership consists of compromises and two people supporting each other youve compromised for years now he wont do either in return also waitressing has a shelf life its physically exhausting work not that 35 is old by any means but a lifetime career of being a waitress is asking for physical impairments as you get into your 40s ask me how i know
if you are priced below market you will get extra attention at market not so much zillow i believe has a system where renters can fill out a form once and then blanket apply to as many apartments as they want so it is a noharmnofoul situation for people to apply to as many places as theyd like 

clearly list your requirements in the post but expect to have applicants ignore the requirements by those same measures just ignore any applicants who dont qualify
pretty sure he had to fork over your social security number to do this and any money hes made off of you would have been issued 1099 reports to the irs as you were falsely made an independent contractor

you can report this for identity theft possibly tax fraud quite frankly thats i would do 

or you can speak to him that you need every piece of paper on this your name removed from the whole shindig or you will be reporting him he wont want to do that because it will take away his downline hes created but you need to get this done asap 

id also temporarily freeze my credit get a credit report and make sure he hasnt opened any lines of credit for himself in your name 

sorry your dad is sleazy
i get why people feel rejected by others but the truth is what causes you to be rejected by someone has nothing intrinsically to do with you

it has to do with their projection onto you and the combination both of you make together in each other

you have no idea if both women are the love of his sexytime life paid escorts after he went full mra if his life is filled with nostrings sex fests or lonely at his core maybe he discovered viagra maybe he dropped acid and had an epiphany or maybe its all false surface level changes we never know what truly is happening behind closed doors 

married now and ive got two children and wouldnt trade them or my wonderful husband for the world

then put your money where your mouth is do not contact plan something wonderful to do with your family and enjoy  appreciate the life you do have not the past one that is no longer there

if you are still ruminating on this months from now get therapy
my friend is the only person i allow to come over when it looks this way and she knows that 

except  you were asking a favor for another issue you have beeping smoke alarm so i am pretty sure under the emergency circumstances she prioritized helping you in a way most convenient for her 

you could have texted hey place is a mess can you just run up and help me while he waits in the car

friend is not a mind reader she helped you the best she was able i think its best for you to be grateful you have a friend who comes over to help and let the rest go with the intent to communicate with better clarity next time
i like it its one of those got to do the whole place or paint it over the disjointed feeling is in part that you havent completed it yet 

probably if you painted the cabinets on the vanity and the little side cabinet in the same taupe once youre done or painted them both the same white that would help the main clash right now is that each cabinet is different  you have the quartz countertop to contend with  wall design
 i feel like hes completely lost interest in me 

i am willing to bet if you got wife 13 into a room together theyd all have a similar tale to tell moves quickly loving and present gets married loses all interest

should i make a last ditch effort and pay for marriage counseling

you can certainly broach it but if his response is that you should pay for it in its entirety instead of splitting the cost that tells you how much effort he will put in to the work needed to salvage things

it just sounds like you married a serial monogamist who is in love with love but not in love with actual people
i love old vintage salton sea postcards it absolutely was once was a charming vacation destination instead of a manmade cancer cluster and algae bloom mess
we have been seeing a counselor for nearly a year

i am a big believer in marriage counseling but sometimes counseling is helpful to get people to the point of realizing whats broken isnt getting fixed and walking away as amicably as possible 

what is it you are looking for when you complete a task a thank you you could tell her you need to hear some appreciation criticisms  commentary are fine you missed a spot but they are heard better after a positive reaffirming statement thank you so much for your hard work theres a corner that needs some help ill fix it etc etc and the information hits differently tone goes a long way

if this is someplace youve both been before and it keeps happening anyway even after honest communication about both your needs you may be getting your answer
question have you looked at what current homes in your area comps in okay condition are going for

now that you know the varying issues on the home you will legally have to disclose those to new buyers markets are slowing in some areas where mortgage rates are impacting if its still in fixer upper status  no one waves inspections it may be a tough sell unless it is priced below comps
yeah sewer lining feels like one of those bs things a yearly roter rooter does the same or better to just keep roots out of your line and move on unless part of the entire sewage system has collapsed
on one hand its only been 4 months some people take longer to integrate a partner into their family

on the other hand sounds like his family are in his daily life and hes locking you in a bedroom to keep you from his dad wtf

just be blunt and honest it really feels at this point like you want to keep me away from your family  i feel like you are ashamed of me given you are deeply tied to family  your behavior around this i dont see us going anywhere longterm can you confirm this or explain whats going on for you
sell it to carvana process is quick and pay off what you owe
salton sea is likely beyond repair its a much younger lake from the early 1900s colorado river run off into a sink and it will never see those levels again in southern california everyone reliant on the colorado river including new mexico and arizona are likely going to run out of access 

its also the most polluted lake in california i think with problematic saline levels  about 100 years of chemical runoff from all the farms down there once that dried up as it lost water levels over the past few decades even the air makes people sick rip
ask your doctor to do genetic testing for meds it will give you both an idea of how quickly you metabolize various medications  that may help point you both in the right direction
why dont you try solo therapy first so you can maybe get to the root of what it is thats upsetting you about him
yup
the longer you look at listings the better you get at seeing the photoshop and computer mockups 

whole house glows with a bright white light yet theres no sun spots from the window falling shadows andor overhead lights are on its a dark place and they just amped the photo brightness

every room gets weird and elongated towards the front stretch filter feature that can make a twin bed look like a warped full or a toilet bowl thats super long

computer simulation ones nothing in real life sits with those lines and usually the shadows have a funky feel to them mostly because there is zero light source to even indicate where theyd come from but also the furniture always seems a little like its hovering in space
theyre offering to pay for part of an overall improvement on your place the issue between current fixtures and recessed can be that normal ceiling overheads can leave a place feeling dark depending on how much light it gets during the day so its a longterm improvement for the apartment 

id be inclined to keep a good tenant who wants to make improvements over the unit  is taking care of it happy especially if costs of the improvement are reasonable and you already have a 3 year history but thats me
i mean i do does it work nah but feels good
location dependent of course but if we ever got even close to 2019 wed still be in crazy town but a moderately acceptable version of crazy town

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

the people stating ignore them i tend to disagree its the dog shit theory of coping if theres a neighborhood dog whose owner lets them poop right in the middle of your front yard and you leave it there  ignore it all you get is more dog owners letting their dogs poop next to it 

your best bet is a large peaceful counterprotest next time lots of people who come out to equally display their right to freedom of speech in a happy fun way you can absolutely rid your town of nazis by overwhelming them with a large pleasant antinazi rally  were talking w baked goods and music these little groups go away from areas that push back but intimidate in numbers not aggressive behaviors

the next worse thing after the ignore method however is to have a small volatile counterprotest that acts antagonistic or allows for fights to break out that tends to give them what they really really want attention and victim status
herpes is a disclosebeforesex thing but if this was your first time having sex together then it sounds like you were both getting into it to the point of no protection no discussion so you have some culpability here in not being responsible either then again the fact that she didnt disclose after until you brought an issue up is nooooot great 

cant say what to do in this situation but now you have a wonderful experience to remind you that 

1 always use protection until a longer discussion on birth control exclusivity and stds has happened 

2 always have a talk prior to sex the first time birth control expectations stds etc 

you are in your 30s well time enough to be an adult about this kind of stuff
self esteem letting your children feel good about what they can do not completely praising for every poop they make but valuing them as capable little individuals i was great at art as a kid and all i heard was how i was good at it but cant make a living that way insert later money issues and charging my worth to overcome let children explore talents they enjoy without bringing up careers to begin with  does your kid love trains let them explore that in childhood without talking about how they will become civil engineers

allowing them some facets of agency in their lives they can say no or negotiate reasonably around expectations again not handing them total control of their lives but incremental and developmentally appropriate attempts at independence and allowing them to fail or succeed on their own as they get older

open door policy they can always come talk to you about something or someone who is bothering them without fear of being punished or getting in trouble

i think there is a concept of good enough parenting youll mess up on a lot of stuff but theres a foundation of trust between the parent and child versus gen x abandoned to figure the world on our own millenial helicopter parenting until they couldnt do anything for themselves something in between those two extremes
im an overwriter i can communicate faster in writingtyping than speech and god i love a tangent 

heres where modern technology actually serves 

1 you dont have to answer that text or email right away you just need to remember it needs a response
2 you can take a beat or even 12 hours to think about your response
3 you can write a wordvomit response that covers way too many details and exited little side stories
4 then editing magic
5 you can write a wordvomit response that covers way to many details and exited little side stories 

the main hurdle is impulse control learning to sit with what you want to say over time i have learned who i can word vomit on and they wont mind so i have some outlet and how to cultivate more professional interactions with the more i edit writing for texts or emails prior to sending the more i also internalize how to edit while composing 

its a process
i dont know what to do

if you live in their home and are of age move out none of this is your problem to solve get some therapy because having a mother who is trying to poison your father is not a normal family upbringing 

he got mad at me started rolling his eyes and eventually slammed the door on me  
  
he made me set up the camera for him a few times cause he guilted and threatened me into doing it

seriously get some real distance from your family neither of your parents are okay people none of this mess is yours to fix
the main reason i lean towards new cars right now is the savings on used is no longer great enough to feel like they are a deal used costs too much imo 

cpo are usually a safe bet but those are also the ones that really are priced the highest if i wanted used id look on auto trader then take it to a dealership to get checked prior to buying 

with new you always run a small risk of some lemon issued from the factory state of affairs in almost all car lines now with used even cpo you run the risk that someone drove it really hard during the first few thousand miles you do get the assurance now of seeing that someone got oil changes in at least since those are recorded 

best used option are fleet cars with under 10000 on them that way if someone was a bad driver they only had it for a day or two i did find one or two of those in my area but spent the extra for new in the end not sure wilderness end up in fleet car sales though
how big of chips there are colormatch epoxies made to fill in chips  professional companies can do resurface fixes if the chips are dimesized or less i would look into a fix before going through a full replacement and charge accordingly for that
wear gloves and a mask or respirator when exposed to a ton of mouse poop and urine and moving it around in any way sweeping i know you were not expecting a cabinet of poop but that is the exact scenario of how you get hantavirus old sealedup mouse or rat droppings  urine are suddenly disturbed or moved by being swept up and it is released into the air 

yes tell the landlord immediately they should do the proper thing and have the home recleaned and all openings under the building and in the attic sealed along with proper extermination

i am kind of guessing they did have an infestation and maybe had an exterminator out there but did not properly clean the last tenants unit 

there should still be a check of your place that no small openings exist in those cabinets for mice they can squeeze through a hole 14 inch in size good luck
so lovely
damn i am impressed i was thinking howd they get a giant compass but you made your own it did work out well
all of it is great howd you get the circle marked out so neatly
talk to your landlord about the shed because thats your property in there

let the neighbor broach the landlord about the fence 

yes those are things that should be fixed
talk to your therapist or go back to therapy find some tools for anxious thinking cbt to test out validity of thoughts breathing  calming techniques

thinking about an abusive expartner  still getting the remnants of toxicity out of your life is a process finding someone new you like is part of the process of healing sometimes before we are about to get really better there is a natural pull to backslide

the long and the short of it is you can ask someone for exclusivity and still end up breaking up with them or deciding you werent really ready for more but you are here now so why not stay more in the moment of what you are doing and less in the past or potential problematic future

the money thing is neither here nor there unless you make is something that just sounds like excuses

edit to add the religious thing isnt really a red flag since shes moving past that you are making it one because your ex had a similar background red flags are behaviors like your ex manipulation putting you down being emotionally volatile 

the shitty thing with ptsd is we become avoidant and the only way to get through ptsd is to stop avoiding the thing that scares you safely with support but to still face it
 i long for something new

well el salvador will certainly be different for you

i would think costa rica chile argentina or mexico would all offer a higher quality of life than making your first choice el salvador
but now i cant look at them with anything but disgust

thats an extreme reaction look you are 17 i get it and you have a right to your feelings you get to feel however you feel how you act on those feelings however is what makes for emotional maturity 

falling for a friend happens theres nothing disingenuous or sneaky plotting about it we usually want to be friends with people we are attracted to not necessarily sexually attracted but who have characteristics or personalities we like 

try doing a thought experiment if you slowly over time fell for a friend of yours how would you want them to respond to you if it is not reciprocated

id just let them know the feeling isnt mutual in the nicest way possible take a little break from your group and when you are feeling less ick show back up like nothing happened
therapy you have childhood neglect issues financial and emotional enmeshment and you need to learn how to have healthy boundaries with someone who doesnt want that for you 

its doable but it takes a lot of work you dont mention your ages but you are probably in your early 20s young enough now to realize that what your mom wants to likely always live with you and depend on you may not be what you want for yourself you cannot change her but you can learn in time to change your reactions in order to handle her
let me put it a different way if your dad died when you were 6 you may have often felt like you had to take care of your mom 

you dont thats not your job your mom can handle what she needs to handle even if this hurts her
thats totally fair most people who end up in southern california from the uk are delighted with the weather change alone i spent my childhood in parts of england and i want a change now  have a uk passport so its my easiest path

trying to decide if i can go back to the rain though
i cannot get myself to ask him to stop following me

time to learn a new skill how to communicate with someone firmly and still kindly that they are out
stop doing projects with him 

he is eligible for accommodations from his professors he can use tutoring centers request more time from the professors not you get copies of notes but hes not your personal burden

you can have adhd and also be a jerk or just too immature and not ready yet for collegelevel work etc he has probably decided that since you will ultimately pick up the slack every time he isnt going to find the help he needs to actually accomplish work 

tell him straight up that you can be his friend but can no longer work with him on group projects and that he needs to go to the office of students with disabilities and sort himself out
 with the state of the uk and the way things are goingi want something better for myself

i say this as someone considering going to the uk from california for a variety of reasons and i love it here but if your issue is a highly divided political culture  underfunding for the nhs medical care and pay the uk is likely a hair better than it is here 

california is dealing also with high costs of housing high homelessness which has a lot to do with underserved mental health  addiction issues and a worsening fire season we also have more gun incidents than the uk 

to practice in ca you would need to get licensing will vary from state to state you want to practice in and may have to do whats called clinical hours work under supervision for less pay
thought experiment you stay with him and eventually have a kid  your child is diagnosed with adhd in school kid is struggling in class he sits your child down and tells them what hes said to you in that text

how do you feel because id be angry
what the fuck is wrong with people rhetorical question
no one can tell you how you feel about this only you can decide probably the best thing you can do for yourself right now is separate and get into your own therapy to process the grief and get enough emotional distance to see the whole thing clearly
i had that really intensely especially around dating and used to think that reaction was rsd but i am no longer so sure i had some terrible bullying growing up often by friends and pretty severe attachment issues from emotionally unpredictable parenting 

i did a lot of work in therapy on attachment issues and selfadvocating being clear in expressing needs and have found that those triggers are not hit as much now im also a lot more choosey however in who i let in i think it helped me to see the sort of people i gravitated towards giving a lot of myself were the kind who did let me down so being less involved in that helped 

im not saying rsd wasnt part of my issue just that i question if it stemmed in a biological way from adhd or an environmental way from old relationship patterns caused by adhd if that makes any sense it only matters for the reasons of how best to lessen it
as a rule i think teasing or sarcasm toward others only works when it is a joke about someone that everyone knows is absolutely not true in any way so its ridiculous to suggest and everyone can laugh

punching down aka making fun of someone struggling and laughing about something they are truly struggling with is not funny because there are so many hidden things you may struggle with as someone with adhd its a lot more likely that friendly banter is going to hit a sore spot 

so they may not intent to be teasing in a bad way but they are ask them kindly to stop and let them know it actually hurts friends will respect that if they dont not a friend
well you see his depression will be cured if she acts like a housekeeperbarbierobotfuckmaid for 28 days
he says that he needs my softer support and encouragement to get out of this and back to himself 

oh bullshit he can go to therapy and learn the root causes for his issues not have you as a cuddly submissive caretaker cooking cleaning and buying a grown man groceries

what hes asking for isnt interesting it sounds like a total mind fuck to me what are you going to do praise him for sitting home all day while you cook dinner cuddle him and help him care for his home welcome to bangmaiddom
to be honest its not my job to uphold your boundaries its on you

it is not a partners job to uphold your boundaries but it is their job to respect them he doesnt hes also coercive  manipulating you

x200b

i dont feel comfortable with him sexually currently 

listen to that your lack of comfort is important  valid and you get to respect that even if he doesnt
look him closely in the face  you have blackheads on your nose just a factual observation time but gosh i think youre handsome clogged pores and all

next time his shirt is off wow your back is really hairy and it forms a weird pattern just sharing a factual observation lets snuggle now

no one should actually continue any behavior with you after you tell them it hurts you the simple fact that youve said this hurts me and he wants to continue the behavior then tell you that you are the one whose wrong for being hurt is a deep lack of empathy  a selfaggrandized nature
la gives and la takes
i feel like i should tell her this once i confirm a diagnosis with my therapist

nope no no no you should not you should respect the request to leave her alone

something you are doing in this post is still making this about you while pretending it is to validate her experience she doesnt need you to validate her lived experience that you abused her

but most importantly the why you did what you did that doesnt do shit all for people who have suffered abuse abuse hurts a victim whether it stems from malicious and calculated intent or because of mental health her experience isnt changed just because you have a diagnosis

mental health may be the reason but it is never an excuse

in fact the very fact that you are so focussed on reaching out to her indicates you have a long long ass way to go in therapy so keep going to therapy and ask your therapist to help you implement a control mechanism so when you have thoughts of reaching out to her you have tools to cope with them

thats how you improve and she can do what she needs to heal

thats a lot of printer ink going to waste
why are you trying to put chair out of a job in this economy
no the twist is the person who made the post is in their 20s30s  is the younger version of the guy who actually made the offensive art 3040 years earlier that version was trying to make a small homage to the 80s cultural ideas of inclusivity
its been nearly a year have you ever sat down and actually discussed life goals and long term visions

because that conversation in clear terms would basically confirm what everyone is saying you two have no longterm compatibility 

this isnt a there is this one little detail we arent on the same page about issue this is on an ideological level of how to live life we have nothing in common issue
yes it is called being verbally abusive and waving a trash bag in your face is getting to the point of escalating to the threat of physical abusive shoving is actual physical abuse 

the 90 nice  and i am doubting your percentages because we get a skewed reality when we are living with this crap doesnt make the 10 threat of or experience of abuse and assault okay being apologetic for something without ever really changing means nothing
no you do not do online personality tests that have zero validity and besides its a rental not a job with the cia 

you take references contact past landlords  can do a legal background search for any arrest records or issues there 

if someone is displaying online aggressive or annoying tendencies you block or ignore them because of the fair housing act you dont do anything that shows discriminatory behavior
the deposit should be used to cover any structural issues with your unit id take pictures of the condition you left it in ask him to schedule a walkthrough with you after youve cleaned and emptied it to have him show you any issues he would like fixed and assume for the best

if you were an annoying tenant to the landlord that may mean you are both happy you are moving on but its not an entitlement to your deposit

do everything by the letter of the book and presume it will be fine
the deck flooring is a different wood this looks like a shitty homemade job at some fencing edit railings but the question that matters is the structure of the flooring can you get under the house and look for termite damage and how the floorboards are constructed when you walk around on the deck is it spongey and has some give or fairly solid

the fencing should have been screwed in  he should fix it however i dont think it is get out of lease bad unless there are greater structural issues or the interior is not habitable

it is however a lawsuit waiting to happen id rewrite a letter saying you have children nieces nephews whatever that visit you and loose railing  exposed nails are a liability youd like to see properly fixed and see how that goes over
really should have used screws and it depends on if the wood is solid or if there is termitewater rot

while its shoddy and a lawsuit waiting to happen for the landlord im an adult so i can go and just never lean on the fencing of a deck what would concern me more is the wood and structural condition of the deck floor
i hate to say this but age gap shes 10 years older than you at 37 she totally knows better and is not dissuading him and is also closer in age to him than you

you will need to fess up to the snooping and state clearly that hes hit on your exes in the past  you are not okay with their texting like this shell either agree or not and youll know
its the rug its too close to matchymatchy with the couch a foresty green or sage green rug or even a teal and the couch walls would look great id also get a rug thats a bit smaller and doesnt go all the way to the windows and wall 

i like how the dog looks concerned with whats happening haha
can you work the ot for a year tighten your belts and get your deposit up to 3040 that may significantly lower monthly mortgage depending on what interest rates do by next year 

i know theres this intense feeling that buy now or be priced out forever but there is always a way

id be very suspicious mortgage lenders are getting hit by the higher interest rates so this feels more like shes relying on astrology than insider secret knowledge of what the fed is going to do
it wasnt a random shooting though to be fairpeople got in an argument and were shooting at each other

i always find this a funny way to low key downplay the experience i say this as an american who has been near or in the middle of 3 shootings in my late 40s lived in several metro areas  one next door neighbors held at gunpoint but no guns discharged

the fact that we have gotten to the point where we have levels for our shooting incidents gang fight neighbors domestic issue not a random mall shooting but two angry people shooting i think that itself is kind of indicative of how bad the issue is

there were several shootings in my old neighborhood and even when they were going after specific targets la drivebys every so many years some kid would get shot by accident and it was harrowing and messed up

it wont be double utilities if you are staying primarily in one home or the rental 

id keep it take your time moving and hopefully you have a smooth closing after keys in hand end lease early if you still want but if you do move by may or june you are only on the hook for the months they cant rent it out to someone else 

plus if you need to do something like paint or repairs you can do them before moving in your furniture
i dont know about their fine print on the program but probably not given joint tenancy is a way for you to inherit their home when they die without it going into probate so you are in fact already part owner of a home
first off going back on medication is not taking steps back if youve taken it in the past and it helps then its steps forward 

secondly putting aside the total ick factor of what he said if the idea of you as mentally ill is a turnon to this guy then understand he has a vested interest in you staying ill that actually is a major step backward in your mental health journey 

that he is going through his own stuff is no excuse
the homeless crisis is bad absolutely but ive been from southern ca to northern and have never seen tents on beaches unless it is near an official campsite and its regular campers
reframe your experience you were 25 when you met a 42yearold online and you had no previous sexual experience moved to a strange country then got trapped in what sounds like a loveless marriage being coerced into pleasureless sex 

stop taking it as a chore and say no you have agency over your body no matter what hes led you to believe
every one of your replies you claim you arent failing your daughter because you fight with your wife and if you leave youd be failing your sons 

this is what your daughter will remember daddys new wife was a monster and daddy picked staying with her and raising his new family over me 

thats it thats the damage also trust me your two boys know you fight all the time so congrats theyre getting effed by this situation too
there was a time and place when flippers were more like renovators and actually did a service by restoring inhabitable houses for resale 

that was probably about a decade or more ago then everyone became a house flipper now i always look sideeyed at any grey black white home  assume they are a mess of cut corners and cheap buildersgrade lies
just because you got someone pawned off on you doesnt mean you have to work with them unless you signed an exclusivity agreement fire her and interview more agents at various agencies

cabinet looks nicer against the primer white than the color swatches

what grey did you paint your cabinets if you know you can look it up online and plenty of paint blogs will tell you the specific undertones purple orange pink blue of that grey 

to me it looks like a warmer griegegrey so it would go great with any swiss coffee white from the major lines those whites tend to present as very bright and clean but have the tiniest bit of yellowcream to them 

colored kitchen  grey cabinets is a tough thing to pull off but some softer light light blues or very pale yellows could work but it could also be a mess 

grey  grey tends to go dingey and dark in a kitchen maybe in a living room with a fireplace and a darker feeling but kitchens imo should have a bit of cheer
im getting lowerend marriot hotel foyer from them everything else looks really nice or has some personal touches but id say let the mirror eye wall go
doctors visit for mental health check plus cognitive decline  cut off her internet

seriously pull the plug on the internet act like you all are doing everything you can to fix it and drag it out for as long as possible meanwhile someone drops by and suggests a small walk around the block

shes likely trapped by facebook trash algorithms that are relentlessly showing her crime videos crimes are up in a lot of places but depending on where she lives most of it could be very low chances in her neck of the woods she needs to detox from the newsfeed of doom
one document everything and then go to a higher up or hr to report a hostile work environment 

or take away their power this is the hardest path but i highly recommend it they are doing this because like all lowlife assholes who hate themselves they need to find sources of power outside of themselves to suck dry like emotional vampires right now picking on you  seeing how it makes you feel bad gives them that power 

you take it back by 1 not giving a shit what they think of you no wanting to be friends no people pleasing only cold professional interactions 

2 confront when it is to your face someone cracks a joke at your expense reply in a calm flatlined voice please explain why that is funny they stumble to explain or whatnot just reply huh sounds more like insecurity on your part than an actual joke 

you will be a fantastic nurse but nursing in the us and hospital settings in general are notorious for this kind of coworker pecking order there is a way to push back grey rock not having an emotional investment in these people they think youre stupid who gives a fuck what they think they dont set a schedule or grade you in your classes 

but it is lonely and can very much take a toll on you and i do think we are more vulnerable to being bullied 

good luck you got this
eh i see things like this or a prenup as a decent step to make sure everyone is on the same page in case of break up  if done well it should actually protect both parties 

i would try to move past the distaste and view it as a really good way to also protect your own interests  negotiate moving into someone elses home especially one bought for them and possibly not fully owned by them is complicated and you should have a fair way to make sure youre going to be okay too 

are you planning on paying rent aka their mortgage if so whats the division and what rights do you have if you two break up 30 days to locate another place to live etc 

id go over it with a lawyer then come back to the table with whatever you dont agree with and what youd like included to protect you

i bought some books  think home buying for dummies but not under that specific umbrella for my market california they were probably already outdated given the changes during the pandemic boom but i think there was enough information to make it worth the time i have already bought and sold my first home cant get back into the market right now so a lot of what my current knowledge also comes from knowing what i dont want to do again after the first experience 

start brainpicking every one you can think of interview re agents dont just grab one someone else recommends ask what their home buying philosophy is and what they wish first time buyers knew get a feel for them find someone you think will bring more than just opening doors from a lockbox to the table speak with mortgage brokers in a few different areas big bank credit union solo mortgage brokerage just because you email or chat with someone doesnt mean you have to work with them but its a great opportunity to line up who you do want to work with and to learn more info 

i think the better armed you are with information while it can bog you down the better off you are to make good decisions for yourself  later not have regrets
you are acting already defeated in the comments 

i get it you are tired this guy and his friends have worn you down the campus you are on is poorly policed and a lot of situations where nothing was resolved youve lost friends from the relationship all of that are valid reasons for feeling defeated 

but thats exactly how he or any stalker wants you to feel defeated and trapped 

your only choice is to become untrapped and that means finding every damn resource you can to report this write down your concerns with his behavior every recent event with him popping up with dates and time estimates write it down so you have a paper copy and dont have to repeat the traumatic events over and over make copies and take them to health services and ask to speak to a mental health counselor to the campus police and to your local police  to the dean of the college start with someone and ask for help they will either help refer you to someone who can help or you go to the next person

you dont have any friends because he isolated you reach out to old friends say you want to get a coffee  reconnect some might blow you off but youd be surprised who is happy to hear from you 

your stalker wants you defeated and trapped if you already feel defeated then hes gotten what he wants a way to drain you and force you to stay in his orbit dont give him the win get angry it will help you find the energy
okay you dont list your age but im guessing your early 20s it all sounds like a drama circle and like it or not you were part of the dramaseeking behaviors maybe you dont have a great instinct for who is trustworthy because youve been getting caught up with people who seem exciting rather than good and reliable 

throw yourself into something volunteer a new hobby hiking a class find groups one thing about la its a city of 4 million people there are plenty of nonacting influencers existing outside of one social media bubble

i think it is overall stunning work i love the feeling of movement the pops of foilage and the viewpoint its painted from it feels very alive which is a difficult thing to achieve with a flat medium like gouache 

the main thing that throws me with the pink ground is how much of it is still present in the flowing water the water would reflect the surrounding trees but also the sky so my mind is processing sunset warm dusk lighting on the water but the sky is telling me grey afternoon light if that makes any sense 

i little bit more differentiation in tonecolor on the water from the rocks and trees would also break it up and make it easier to visually move around the painting may be as simple as eliminating the pink in the water with more highlights and lowlights in white and a browngreyblue
any way around paywall id love to see where they are falling out west because where i am in the west id say a haircut off the top in a correction but hardly a fall as of now
theres a historical 5 year drought cycle in ca its just that the past decade or so theyve become significantly drier dry years  hotter summers if we got 23 years of rain then the 5 year drought wed actually function in terms of water although not in terms of current infrastructure 

real question is if this summer gets hotter more current lush green spaces dry up worse fire season because that shit is not sustainable

why dont you pause your normal classes for one semester and take a writing class find out how much you can do and what you feel about doing it with more focus most community classes will have writing classes but if you are in the us look at things like the uc extension programs a bit pricey but one class to dip your toe in wont hurt prior to shifting and entire major life focus
i know this is a painful thing to go through if they are actually puppies and still very young while i realize you love them deeply they can go to a rescue and will be adopted if it is a good rescue then the families who adopt are vetted and the rescue commits to the life of the dog to always take those dogs back in

you could also see if any rescues would take them as short term fosters 

get a room and stabilizing should be your first priority i wish you luck
they can suddenly read very well when they realize a tenant understands their rights and will push back otherwise slumlords conveniently dont read true
sometimes when you lose patience with someone or get fed up with them while you still need to watch your own behaviors its a sign you may need a little break

anyone selfdiagnosing or online diagnosing themselves with did from tik tok is making a huge leap the bigger issue may be having a friend who has very real mental health issues but is still at a stage where creating added drama feels rewarding to them i mean youre teens not to be condescending but thats bound to happen youre allowed to step away in kindness if its getting too much so let him have his period of ignoring you most cases hell reach out again down the road
trainer or classes can help you push through nothing like other people around to make you step up im not a competitive person but sometimes i pretend im in a competition with someone else around me at the gym  it helps me work harder  even if they are clearly in better shape i dont stare at them or watch their workouts i just make up a game in my head that i have to beat soandso when really i am just pushing myself to beat my own level im at stay a little longer on cardio or do more reps
 i was just making banter but my bf told me that i was masculine and made him unattracted to me 

hes a total misogynist plenty of people enjoy outgoing personalities this guy is a dud who just wanted arm candy that didnt speak nothing about being able to hold your own in conversation is masculine thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard
email  mail a hard copy registered mail

dear slumlord

as per my text and emails on dates list all dates and times you contacted them alerting you that we have no hot water and requesting a timeline of the fix i am reaching out one last time to let you know we will be withholding rent on the 1st until the issue is fixed we will put rent aside and prorate it for when the fix occurs

the other option can be for us to replace the hot water heater and deduct the cost from aprils rent in which case we supply you with all receipts with our remaining rent payment

as you know by california law all tenants have a right to live in a habitable property this means there must be running water both hot and cold

please let us know how youd like to proceed

 double check la county law if you choose to go withholding rent you may need to open up an escrow account and put it in there you dont want to withhold rent and end up evicted paper trail everything good luck
its called info dumping honestly an info dumper needs to learn the time and place i say that as an info dumper otherwise it is its own form of rudeness 

maybe you can find some audiobooks or bookbooks on the art of conservation and active listening tell him youd love it if his mindset could expand in those directions

or just say hey i miss our conversations more and more lately i feel like you are lecturing me and it makes me feel really diminished can we work on the oldtime art of conversating with some give and take

in louisianna nondisclosure state lived in a place where someone odd in the bathtub it was a former meth lab with an explosion but the new owners had gutted and down a really nice reno jobby on it beautiful views of the bayou too i only learned the storied history from all the neighbors in other homes and apartment buildings around it  

unless you properly remediate meth chemicals from walls they are toxic and really bad to live with

everyone in that building went nuts and i moved out because the immediate neighbors in my building drove me up a wall but it also just had bad vibes and i seriously couldnt take baths in the od tub 

i am going to go with meth walls made everyone nuts but maybe it was the junkie ghosts who knows
id negotiate for 6 months up front cash then for the lease to state month to month after the first 6 months that gives you half a year to get a job but also a way out if things dont pan out place the other 7500 in a high yield savings or cd make sure the contract lease is very clear and no loopholes that could come back to bite you in the ass
from all of your comments below you come up with some reasonable solutions or accommodations and your wife is shooting them down 

she sounds like she has some form of untreated ppd  likely anxiety right now you are letting the person with dysfunction set all the rules for your family and the rules shes making keep her in her cycle of episodes and keep you running around trying to accommodate 

thing is even if shes the greatest mom on earth this is impacting the mental health of your children too witnessing their mother having episodes is fucking with their development little kids blame themselves and babies very much need calm anchors to turn to 

she needs medical treatment and support in the home period you cannot continue to accommodate her refusal for treatment or her refusal to let you hire people come into the home to help 

the discussion needs to be with her during a good period and it needs to be framed with the childrens needs and the impact on them not as much about you tell her that you will be there for treatment and look for doctors and therapists who are experts in endocrinology and mental health but at the end of the day your children deserve to have a mom who is willing to take care of herself to be there for her kids
so current owner is really just a buyer who cant finish their sale until a sucker pays them over what they are in contract to pay

this sucks for the original seller and the next buyer i am guessing its one of those we buy dumps for cash flyer groups

we have a conversation he apologizes swears hell do better even lists off how he plans to do better and then never follows through for more than a day

option 1 one last ditch effort to get him to really see what you are verbally telling him get out a poster board and place it somewhere highly visible kitchen whatever write down one item of his plan to do better  a commitment to every day complete x task then make m t w th f s su boxes underneath and for every day he completes x task he will check the box for that day

this either externalizes things to the point that he actually can functionally do stuff adhd technique or if the depression is so bad its blocking even lowlevel functioning there is an external piece of evidence where he has to acknowledge the reality of how bad it is sometimes with adhd  depression there can be a very high level of denial as to how bad its gotten as a coping mechanism to acknowledge how bad it is to see the very tall mountain he needs to climb and seeing that with no tools or skills for handling adhd is paralyzing so the cycle of nothing happening continues

option 2 ultimatum he either gets treatment or you are separating problem with ultimatums is you have to really be willing to follow through
thanks
eh nothing is bringing home values back down in los feliz

i think recent murder no almost 100yearold murder house frame only intact full renovation  new electricityplumbingroof the chances of it feeling bad inside are very low now if it was kept as some creepy shrine that would be different and gross 

it is california law that any death in a home must be disclosed at sale and possibly to renters not sure about that which is better than louisianna where i briefly lived for a few years and definitely ended up renting some murder homes neighbors would tell me stories of what happened after i moved in just bad vibes all around and i hated it
from the pictures of the last time it was on the market gutted its actually got good bones those old 1920s villas are stunning large foyers high ceilings old growth frames albeit some of the bedrooms are usually pokey with no closets

west coast is always tearing old stuff down would be nice to see someone restore it gutted its still not worth double the value in 3 years though even if the land is worth a lot not 5 million for a half acre lot with a tear down on it
wheres this
this is torus trajectory in murakamis wind up bird chronicles im not in love with that book for many reasons but murakami does make it work and it is a beloved book by many id call him a passive protagonist its honestly a hard thing to pull off so i dont think theres really a term for it 

its also sort of the plot in candide but candide does have agency just all the worst things keep happening to everyone in that story

if my dad can feel this way about one group of people does he feel the same way about the community that im from that the woman he loved and married for that last 20 years is from the one his grandkids by my older sister his stepdaughter are apart of

so heres the thing your dad is racist its very easy for racist people to dislike an entire group but have exceptions their neighbor their kids the people they know personally who they make an exception for or mentally to them dont fit into the hate they have for a certain group they simply bifurcate in their brain

he also may be a bit of drunk who lets that part of him loose when he drinks its worth saying to him when hes sober why it hurts you and what you wrote above a lot of people who lack empathy can only get it when someone they know feels pain and explains it in personal terms so you tell him intellectually why it sucks that he feels comfortable yelling racial epithets he doesnt get it and calls you a democrat but you tell him why it hurts you personally he may have a bit of a moment for reflection 

hell still be racist in his heart but at least maybe not yell shit in front of you

other people in comments who are saying leave nope you need to finish school it doesnt make you a bad person to stay with him for a few years and get through what you need to do to care for yourself
great deal enjoy the new car  congrats

they may have been poor negotiators who knows
the buyer may have gotten 15k in credits that went to closing costs  fixes instead of the sale price 

personally did something when i bought my first home at the advice of my then crappy agent wouldnt do that again if you have the funds to buy a 1m house you can pay closing costs and i think now in retrospect it is better to make the sale price lower for the sake of the mortgage

if you have an agent they can look at the mls and see if there are any notes
im a big walker and used to walk in altadena to many things for short errands under 3 miles but our infrastructure does not make it pleasant in most of ca

sidewalks arent maintained plenty of areas where it is more traffic and much less safe space to walk and the constant trying to make eye contact  prove your humanity with drivers crossing at any intersection so you dont have to become road smoosh suck
meh on the manic pixie dream girl or not like other girls stuff because it always places some kind of masculine ideal at the center then plays ideas or archetypes of feminity off of that

i was super into it in my 20s and was friends with a lot of guys but then one day i realized its kinda bullshit and stopped pursuing situations where i could frame myself that way

im a weirdo and i know it i dont relate to a ton of things that are normal in our culture that i should and ive learned to keep some of that info to myself in public at least but being in acceptance of my own eccentricities doesnt have to be gendered or pit me against individual women even if it does make me dislike the larger paradigm were all inside of
dammit was this the modest dealership and howd you get the extra 300 i took the 3k off and didnt negotiate further other than refuse their weird safety addon

yeah thats 3000 off msrp its what i think they call invoice pricing 45000 out the door is what i paid its pretty much the best you can do on a new xt from my several months of watching and trying to negotiate at varying dealers for lower than msrp the one thing i forgot to do is get a subaru loyalty coupon for an extra 500 off

your living with a nightmare nothing youve listed here is normal and you keep saying how it is fine  you respect these ridiculous expectations she has even taking 3 days off to help someone with wisdom teeth removal they can pop some vicodin eat ice cream and watch tv just fine its not like she cant get herself to the bathroom ridiculous no one needs a fulltime caretaker for wisdom teeth removal my god  

you are walking around on eggshells in your own home asking permission to have your boyfriend over its like she owns the place

set reasonable rules tell her how its going to be or she can go out there and pay regular rent this friendship really is toxic shes not your best friend you are her caretaker servant  shes got you convinced the sky is whatever color she says it is
but to me getting yelled at due to the ed doesnt feel weird or out of line

op your inner compass is severely offkilter if someone yelling at you when you are struggling with a mental health disorder feels normal

just because it happened a lot in the past doesnt mean it was ever okay needs to continue happening or should be your future
 he doesnt start getting better and talk about what happened to him she will force him to go to therapy andor ground him

those are 2 very different solutions and implementing neither for several months of this is kind of negligent esp for it to get this bad sorry but it that makes me judge his moms own judgement ill punish him or tell him to go someplace to heal are vastly different ways to address an issue and its not magically going back to the way it was without someone taking action simmering resentments rarely get better being left simmering 

you keep mentioning something happened was it the information about college or do you think there was an actual traumatic incident that shifted his behavior maybe hes mad at his own father and taking it out on you who knows thats why communication therapy and addressing the issue is better than wait a bit then ill start punishing him

therapy now  and meetings in family therapy after hes done some work to have a safe discussion

teens dont completely change overnight at 17 unless something has been brewing for a long time that both of you were just unaware of or there is an incident that upsets them deeply the incident may not be completely rational maybe it is about paying for college but you cant just let it go on for months on end until he leaves the house
if you suspected mental health like an undiagnosed disorder or a physical issue some kind of stroke that caused a personality change like impulsiveness that would be one reason to have empathy and intervene i cant advise you how because id have no clue other than to encourage him to see a doctor and get a full workup

but without any evidence of that happening it means he made a clearheaded choice at some point to cheat on your mom and he is an adult i am sure this is horrible and traumatizing for all of you but when someone decides to blow up their life sometimes you let them 

i hope your mom has spoken to a lawyer and began proceedings regardless of if she chooses to help him if his new whatever she is has access to your fathers accounts it could destroy your moms financial stability
honestly it could be a weird hardhit moment of nostalgia or a feeling about that time in her life without actually still wanting to be with him give it a bit and then discuss how it made you feel and what was going on for her youll get clarity

do not surgically alter yourself for someone youve known for 9 months honestly id say see ya because now i know how he feels by your 40s its time to be with other people who understand we age  can still be into you not seeking out bikini models

i know plenty of guys who are very liberalleaning nontoxic and into several of your hobbies

divorce attorney can sue bears for spousal support how come it is always just the momma bear out there with the cubs
dont bother explaining things that fall on deaf ears arent worth the  emotional energy it takes 

it sucks when your own family chooses to believe the worst in you im guessing this is a lifelong pattern but when they do call you lazy if you can learn to control your reaction dont get defensive seek empathy or counterpoint they may move away from it some of it is the routine a family has where they decide on the role of one family member the messy one or the lazy one  then pick on them getting a reaction is part of what keeps them doing it 

when you are without meds just say you are feeling under the weather or have a cold starting and leave it at that 

it sucks and i hope you do have supportive people in your life or a way to get some space from it it can be a very cultural attitude
if you can and online dating makes it sort of possible try pursuing dating with the intention of learning call it practice dating 

ie dont approach every date like this is the one and im going to screw it up from lack of knowing how to do this but think what can i learn from this experience if goes badly what can you try differently the next time learn to get a thick skin people are choosing and not choosing each other all the time and get out there 

probably with everything in your life especially things like jobs or work you had a learning curve is your learning curve on love a bit behind others sure but the only way you will catch up is if you start somewhere
so the worse thing in your breakfast imo is the kraft peanut butter it has trans fat hydrogenated oil included exchange that for a health food peanut butter thats just crushed peanuts with no added oils or corn syrup and it looks good to me esp if it keeps you full for the entire morning 

a little tablespoon of chocolate chips isnt terrible and they are good energy in the morning the peanut butter if healthier would be great longlasting protein and fat and oats are great fiber
if he cheated and only him  wants the divorce then it is perfectly possible you are owed by him to pay for your lawyer

majority of lawyers will do a free initial consult get your ducks in a row asap and start consulting with attorneys find out if they can initiate he pays your fees no dragging feet on this or asking him to work with you 

do not tell him he isnt supportive no matter what he seems he cheated and wants you now gone take care of your own interests
haha as a californian dealing with the changes in the past few decades here i have a very old grumpy irish relative in dublin and his complaint is that dublin isnt dublin anymore i think he mainly bemoans affordability

i had them years ago once in echo park right outside my bedroom in a jacaranda tree then a different group i think years later liked some berry tree i had in my backyard in altadena that particular group were a bunch of seasonal regulars theyd nail my car every time with berry poop

i can never look at solopet parrots the same i know they love their owners and all but in a party pack those guys are estatic yelling and laughing and screaming at each other i dont know what they are communicating but they dont stop
authenticity without trauma dumping is very freeing and very attractive to the right person

if this went nowhere then you know he wasnt the right person  

dating is a process of weeding out the people who arent going to work you currently have no idea why you were rejected sucks but it could be anything from he was already interested in someone else more isnt in a committing place total flake got hit by a car 

pick yourself up and go back out there there will be a lot of misses but that means you need a lot of swings  only one real hit sorry i am not a baseball person so maybe that metaphor doesnt work
thats how i got 3000 off not a wilderness but the caveat was the better price didnt show up in any aggregate website searches like cars or autotrader it showed up when i went to their dealership website and clicked online price  it showed they were doing a deal on all outbacks in stock then i could take that to a closer place and negotiate a match

i temporarily live in a hcol bubble right now so i did a dealership search about 100 miles out to mcollcol areas and got the better price from there
i just got 3000 off msrp on a 2023 subaru touring xt  not the newer wilderness but i think its very area dependent 

in most cases doesnt hurt to ask if you can find a dealership farther out from where you ar with some negotiation room then take that to a closer dealership sometimes theyll match
gotcha i still say be careful of duplicating the realistic repetitive nature of patients notes because if it gets overly repetitive the reader who isnt a clinician will start to want to skim that section making it filler if the patients notes can occasionally be repetitive only where that informs the reader say highlights the difference in the journal experience while also adding information and moving things along it works well thats just my opinion
ah i left the area a year ago when it was still sleepy honestly though good for them it deserves to make it hopefully it will die down into a steady stream
i think its a twofer people often have some sort of freeze reaction in the moment when shocked so it seems like they are acquiescent 

even though someone by their goddamn 30s should understand consent porn consumption  the internet has culturally shifted expectations and normalized a lot of behavior that actually deserves clear consent first

i think all porn sites should be regulated to have a mandatory 1 minute or so public service announcement on what safe consent is but it will never happen

multiple credit card debts around 10k not my personal usage my parents used it in my name

going to need that paid off not to be brutal but if your father chooses to drop the ball on those payments you will live with the consequences for decades  you are already working 3 jobs you will need to advocate for yourself 

i am really sorry for your loss it also sounds like you are being put in the drivers seat here and i wish you good luck because thats a lot
car artisan chocolate  manufactory  cafe cant speak to plugs or wifi but the owner is an incredibly nice guy and the coffee pastries are amazing id bet hed be fine if you asked if it was a good place to work for a few hours even though it doesnt really have that vibe per say

i had seen people working there before and it never felt crowded any time i went just not sure if it is a place to park 3 hours either

edit hadnt been in over year since i left pasadena but apparently it is now a really busy place  the croissants are now recognized for what they are amazing
just because patients notes in real life tend to be repetitive if you are going to use this as a plot structure make sure any repetitiveness exists only in purpose to the story  try to limit it or it would be somewhat a drag to read without any other kind of break or plot movement character development 

i could see it working really well if the main character is the patient but we get more insight into them from also interspersing the doctors lived experience one chapter of doctors pov in service of the main character interspersed with patients notes 

interesting concept
i lived in new orleans for almost 4 years for schoolwork and hated much of it due to failing housing roaches the size of small babies sorry palmettos mosquitoes some southern attitudes loud drunks neighborhood shootings and an element of constant chaos thats just not my thing 

but you could be walking down a street of little colorful shotgun houses at dusk while the cicada started and everything smelled like nightblooming jasmine sorry confederate jasmine eye roll people would walk by and always say how you doing and it was a beautiful place despite much of the rot
i assume these were her normal social media posts not some porn site photos in which case he violated your trust and he violated a normal boundary with her total twofer of ick behavior 

no advice other than obviously needs a long conversation about whats acceptable  take whatever time you need to make sure you feel better about it 

my feeling has always been that we as humans cant always control our thoughts  theres no shame in that but we have the power to control our actions
related to her living situation and how she was worried if her dad passed away that she wouldnt have a place to live i feel lied to

i think it is fair to wait until you see her in person and tell her something like i am so glad you are doing better i understand you have trust issues that amplified your anxiety and i think we can both agree i have tried very hard to be supportive the fact that you made up detailed lies about living with your dad and fakeworried about his death is a breach of trust for me i am not hurt that you didnt disclose where you are living but i am deeply hurt that you actively lied to me 

or something like that without a sincere apology and understanding of how violating it is to be detaillied to as opposed to lie of ommission i would have a hard time trusting this person or wanting to be a support system for them the aspect of the lie that would most upset me is it isnt really about safety she could have just never mentioned where she was living since you two never met in person anymore its that she lied in a way that was seeking empathy how do you continue giving so much of yourself to someone who needs a lot of support when you can no longer trust what is real and whats possibly attentionseeking

if she can acknowledge it was fucked up thats another thing i guess where maybe you can rebuild trust 

it sounds overall that you put a lot into this friendship do you get any love and support back
yes yellow boots
he texted a 14yearold to kill herself he sounds like when he was a kid hed torture animals for looking at him wrong
dolores
i hope you have or can get therapy thats a lifetime of hurt in that relationship 

nothing in your text was wrong it was the truth and also you dont have to love your mother you mention you do love her a lot in your post because shes your mom but her mental health is no excuse for her behavior  it is not the behavior of someone worth loving you do not have to make up with her before she dies shes never apologized or atoned not everyone deserves forgiveness in this life either its a hard truth people want others to act like things are okay to make their own refusal to say the truth feel better not your job to do so 

what you do need to do is take care of yourself get therapy to sort out the deeper hurts and live your best life
you need to consult with a child therapist and lawyer if you dont want to coparent with him because of his behavior fair enough but find out your legal rights he did not sign away parental rights  could sue you may be better off getting mediation and an agreement of rights signed edit i would not go off any verbal agreements between you two without a serious understanding of your legal rights first 

also whenif this all comes out you are going to need help explaining to your kids the whole thing child therapist consult
do you need a house is homeownership something you want can you make the payments with current mortgage rates do you have enough of a savings that after the 100k youd still have money for house emergencies because there usually is one are you looking to stay in that locations for 5 years

if so house is a good deal only because it is a thing and it does keep you warm even with a crash if it is a decent area then the house will go back up enough in 57 year cycle that its not terrible 

no one can time the market so its more about what your current needs are than anything else you could buy total crash comes and prices go down but at the same time banks will tighten up on loans so you are still waiting out a cycle

because drug dealers dealing in large sums weekly launder their money through business fronts first mom closet money is a onetime thing
ooh
one thing i was told by my very upfront  honest real estate agent who truly believed there was a bubble even 2 years ago when i sold with her until the word recession is officially spoken everything is in crazy land once a recession gets official then house prices especially condos or townhomes because those always lose value first drop in a market where 4050 of buyers are cash you will not see interest rates shift much only a recession job loss etc 

but rents do not necessarily go down in a housing market downturn or a recession they may dip for about 6 months but then you usually have more people renting during recessions than normal markets and rents stabilize and continue to increase 

take that info as you will if you are not ready to buy i would apply the same hunt mentality to rentals to look for a better deal if you can grab one
as an american exsmoker part of me thinks if i make it to 70 im going to pick one of these smoking countries and spend my last 10 years on earth growing cancer and yellowing my teeth while drinking espresso and chain smoking 

i mean i get it its gross as hell but sometimes i miss that feeling
ambiverts are a thing but also being an extrovert just means you get energy from being around people and being an introvert means you get energy from alone time how good you are with people how talkative or entertaining isnt really the defining quality you could be awkward and not very verbal but still need to be around people and be an extrovert you could be engaging and chatty with stragners but need alone time to energize so introvert

im great in front of groups can be very entertaining used to give lectures while i get energy during those situations as soon as they are over im exhausted and need to just sit and decompress by staring at a doorknob for 6 hours
because she doesnt love you and may even be bordering on sociopathic levels of zero empathy my friend
from your comments below

i didnt tolerate it i spoke to him i just dont understand i feel embarrassed i dont know if its my looks or my personality or something else

op do you even see how you are thinking about yourself in response to gross disrespect from your husband 

rather than realize my husband is disrespecting me hes pursuing a form of intimacy with his ex and pretending i dont exist hes acting a bit like a high school mean girl you are listing all the things wrong with yourself to be disinvited thereby indicating some part of you believes you deserve to be treated like this

this isnt about you not being good enough in any sense its about your husband treating you like an afterthought and with disrespect instead of viewing him as possibly cheating lying to you andor being a dick why are you focused on how if you were different it wouldnt have happened hes the one who should be different

question does your husband pick on you cut you down in small ways or compare you to  make you feel less than others or are you with him because you already had very low selfesteem and believe you deserve to be treated like this

friend think and want better for yourself you arent in the schoolyard waiting to be picked for kickball  found wanting youre married to an ass
no landscaping or fence was going to mitigate grease air and people blasting music waiting in the drivethrough at 1 am
you are 19 you should go live life just have some street smarts make sure your friends will all have each others backs and dont drink until you are stupid drunk
eh if you arent homeless you have options in sf to avoid public bathrooms or at least use a good one i havent lived there in eons mind you but i would always go into one of any number of fancy hotels and use their bathroom certain neighborhoods yes you are out of luck no fancy hotel but if you are friendly you can usually pop into a corner bar and ask nicely and theyd let you
your boyfriend tolerates this which is not okay its on him to tell them to back off and he hasnt

but also next time they ask for a freebie say no cant do that its for your own good i wouldnt want to sully your pure soul with my corporate blood money
she has a drinking problem and i dont mean like an alcoholic 

oh no shes absolutely an alcoholic you are misunderstanding that just because she doesnt drink every day she cant be a fullblown alcoholic anyone who drinks the way you are describing  who frequently experiences blackouts is a bingedrinking alcoholic 

twice shes also blaming being drugged and maybe she was roofied but she also just as easily could be falling into blackouts with less alcohol than she thought because her tolerance is shot 

long story short you are an enabler you dont mean to be but you watch out for her hope shell be okay let her get so drunk shes unruly then wait for her to pass out to get her home you are caretaking a drunk as long as you continue to enable her shes not going to change 

she needs way more than to cut down or quit on her own she needs therapy a program of some sort for alcoholism and a lifelong commitment to stop drinking shell likely never be a just one drink person it can hold for a week or two then shell be back to blackout drinking 

i always recommend alanon to people in your shoes with the caveat that 12step programs have issues but it is free and available online or in person anywhere in the world i highly recommend you think about attending a meeting and hearing from others who have been through this 

if you did choose to break up you would be well within your rights to do so  it may well be the best thing for you know that might be good for her in the end too because you staying as an enabler isnt helping
first off congrats on the career change teacher burn out is real and i can imagine how amazing it is to find a new trajectory that interests you and that you are good at 

x200b

i have been walking on egg shells trying to be a good wife but its never enough

secondly stop doing that do a reasonable share of chores your son is old enough to contribute and your husband knows how to wash the dishes or go to the store 

he has begin to signal divorce 

lol does he think a 50yearold divorcee who is unsupportive is going to do well out there let him signal away he can divorce you and learn how to buy his own cereal
you are taking meds for anxiety but what about treatment or therapy to learn some helpful coping skills

basically if you ran all those thoughts through some cognitive behavior practice theyd come out for what they are anxiety it sounds like shes a tad flakey and the onus on getting together is on you thats more a sign of who she is in this dynamic than leaping to wants out of the friendship 

those are also things that when you are secure you can just bring up to a friend or when you have several people to hang out with it puts less pressure on the one but when you overthink things to the point of worst case scenario you can sometimes create the issue you are scared of

therapy would help if you arent in it already its really great to work with someone who specializes in anxiety and get a better grasp on the root causes
i would not accept this given youve decided to stay i dont know if this falls on deaf ears but i would mandate couples therapy and her taking full responsibility or i walk completely 

otherwise if she blames you now shes just going to blame you next time
the blue in the shade is almost a rich more interesting gray ive always had grey or neutral cars though so i wasnt daring enough

shes a 22yearold woman who does great work for you and is allowed a life outside of her job if your daughters saw her pictures and thought princess that tells me these are likely normal bikini vacation pictures

dont bring it up but if it ever comes back up then shut the neighbor down much more in defense of sofia tell her shes a fantastic nanny and her hours outside of work are not owned by you or your husband but if it offends her or her husbands sensibilities they can certainly block sofia on any social media
he leaves for a long time to smoke rude gets pissy you talk with someone else while he left you alone possessiveinsecure leaves you there rude and insecure is already drunk alcoholic next he proceeds to break down about an ex from 5 years ago an abortion and his depression on a first date  so you make out with him

the guy was screaming i am an emotionally stunted unstable alcoholic with serious issues the 3rd date weirdness was telegraphed to you from moment one

im not trying to be mean i am just saying this guy was an arse from the get go and each step of the way that he becomes a bigger arse you keep following him in i stand by my point recalibrate how you believe you should be treated
i mean yes marriage kids and i love you by date 2 could qualify as love bombing i guess but the whole thing reads more like hes a terrible drunk and batshit crazy so just why why continue after the first drama bullshit behavior on the 1st date
friend even your standards for what you think would qualify as love bombing are low like that first date was yikes 2nd one was yikes 3rd one was holy hell god wtf

please recalibrate how you believe you should be treated
any addictive medicine is only good to use during highly stressful extreme situations imo as a daily tool to cope with physical or mental stress no bueno welcome to getting hooked i feel the same way about xanax ativan  ambian do i loooove them yes yes i do do they eventually make everything worse in my lived experience yes yes they do 

epsom salt baths magnesium to tolerance or potassium and look into drug interactions if you take medication but most of all take a daily walk and then stretch or do some simple yoga 

it is not easy by any means but its the only thing i have found that will be successful over the long term otherwise im staring down the barrel of physical dependence
please dont have a child with an abusive rageaholic who used to hit you with objects please its not your job to help him and dont think for one minute that once you are pregnant this all goes away it all gets very much worse
he just prefers to make the money and buy it whenever we can

thats cute whens that going to be

he was in love with the idea of finding a house together and doesnt feel like getting it from my dad satisfies this dream

again great dream and exactly how much money is saved for a downpayment towards this dream what monthly mortgage can you afford have you looked at current mortgage rates and what homes are selling for

sorry but your partner 1 is being an ass 2 should not get a say regarding an inheritance between you and your dad you arent married and have no legal financial ties with a boyfriend 

do not cut your nose off to spite his face it sounds like his ego at wanting to be a provider is making him insert himself into something that he has no right to control he can move in with you to your property and pay you rent if this is really the hill he wants to die on

if this is in the us the current housing market is a disaster most people who get into first homes now actually do benefit from inheritance unless your dad was abusive coercive with money or a monster to forgo that opportunity over ego would make me question the long term viability of the relationship in other words hes being a very stupid dumbass
the only advice is block him 

hes in a frat there is likely a collection of girls pics being shared the only reason hes charming and pursuing you is getting pics from a girl who initially refuses is probably worth double points 

also you have great boundaries  you stick to them thats fantastic but you need better instincts to cut out boundary stompers earlier and faster everything you describe about this guy is fake charm insisting on sex insisting on pictures sending you unwanted pictures calling you a tease stating you need to pay back a favor this is sexually coercive behavior you know very clearly he does not actually respect boundaries yet you are hanging on like this behavior is changeable  there are redeemable qualities here its not  there isnt
i am a woman who is hetero but goddamn i love big noses on women look up rossy de palma or anjelica huston actresses in the 70s and 80s could still have noses with real definition before it became law everyone had to get them fixed and have the same little nocharacter schnoz i miss big interesting noses in film and tv they add visual interest to faces i find it so nice to see all types of faces in the world instead of the narrow definition of attractive we currently lean toward fixed teeth small nose straight hair smoothedout skin

the point i am trying to make is you deserve someone who adores you for your nose and whole face not despite it those people exist its great this one gave himself away after 5 dates so you can cut him loose dont even tell him why hell backtrack accept nothing less than enthusiastic appreciation of who you are
i dont think its manipulation depending on the attitude behind it but you both need a set of ground rules for living together

have a clear explicit conversation state one last time you want a committed relationship and dont want to be hooking up anymore if she really does not want that with you then you need to respect her wishes in other words not im rejecting you sexually to punish you for hurting my feelings but hey i need to protect myself here so were changing our dynamic

you both need to really decide what is best for raising a child together get a legal agreement in order with both parents rights stated and if separate homes is the way to go

no offense but the whole thing is really messy at least put the kid first from here on out including working on your communication with each other to coparent decently
it looks like a pretty small space so id stay with a warm white or match the tile but a few shades lighter a warm greigey taupe but very light there are lots of fun colors that would complement the tile especially in the earthy green ranges but as you can see with the busy shower curtain already more feels like a lot with those tiles better to get some continuity on the walls and open it up
well sometimes having someone recognize how much they hurt you helps apologies are great but not if they dont include a complete understanding of the pain theyve caused

think of it this way currently you are struggling in the friendship you are worried if you bring it up you will be put down or theyll minimize it but what if they realize it was really bad for you and acknowledge that so you can feel trust again

say nothing friendship is struggling in its current state

say something and it blows up well at least you got your answer as to how good of friends they are

say something and clear the air friendship is made whole again

the other thing is sometimes friendships just run their course but its always worth trying communication first before deciding that
next time he does it in front of others calmly respond im sick of feeling like shit around you every time you insult me about how i look it isnt a joke theres nothing funny in it its just mean and spiteful please stop

do it in front of others people go along to get along until someone stops it if you stay calm and speak clearly without sounding upset it really drives the point home basically a little public shaming is needed 

also you are defending him in the comments as decent 90 of the time but hes really not hes a misogynist that saw you as someone who could potentially fuck and now that thats off the table his instinct is to deride you not really a friend and actually not a decent person
the post actually makes more sense if they were all living in a zoo
i think you have a drinking problem
picks her up by just her collar so shes hanging off her body weight

yes it is an abusive relationship and please for the love of all things decent keep this horrible person away from your dog
redwoods root system dry up and shrink in the drought then the tree suddenly fills up with water too quickly from these rains making it really heavy plus add in the high winds several have come down in and around santa cruz mountains
not all age gaps  abusive dynamic but shes young like really young hasnt graduated college yet young the difference in life experience between 22 and almost 40 are pretty huge developmental gaps 

id give it some time because the crush part may fade if you have longer to realize her youth be friends for now but also respect the boundaries of the group
people are picking and not picking each other every day you hardly know her so its not like you can really take it that personally that shes rejected you just move on with your life 

blocking is for exes stalkers and toxic people this is such a nonoccurrence if you are really lonely expand your idea of what friends may look like maybe not an influencer for one thing
depends on the state or county but usually theres some county department that if it is so dirty its a health concern like rats or drums of oil public nuisance theyll send someone out to speak with the homeowners plus possible fines if they dont clean up

hard to know if they are just a junky house based on ops post or it really gets into health hazard territory

most counties definitely have restrictions on front yards so if it is spilled over to the front that would be an issue if it is some kind of fire hazard is another issue

edit op writes standing water  brush and weeds but most of it sounds nonhazardous just gross
and you are a rude asshole who can screw off feels punchier imo
in most urbansuburban areas in ca we have a lot of coyotes they are all over la 

i consider myself lucky that ive had a few fox  even a few owl sightings but they are definitely shyer
their behaviors at their age are what sounds exhausting drama sloppy drunks no boundaries if some woman told me my bf was allowed to finger her while he was dry humping from behind in public yeah i would expect them to be about 24 years old

these sound not that bad  

no they actually sound worse than you realize it sounds exhausting and demoralizing youve just grown inured to being nitpicked to death

look im not a doctor or a nutritionist but eating the same thing wont shock your system though your system will adapt to the expectation of the same meal every day and autopilot on that if it makes any sense 

you have been doing great i would fill my fridge with any healthy vegetable i wanted then keep the chicken and rice part if you get so restrictive its boring and miserable to eat you are setting yourself up for an eating disorder or failure on your diet dont restrict varying vegetables at least have a salad with chicken one day it is healthy and good the calories in  the calories being good fuel for your body is what matters 

there are carbs in onions fructose which is a healthy carb its also a prebiotic which means it helps process probiotics in your gut eating some sauteed onion is in no way going to derail you from your goals
hes basically placing the burden to break up on you otherwise hes telling you you are a placeholder

its an incredibly weakwilled way to go  he never should have met your parents if he knew this was how he felt be glad you are getting this info now  be glad to break up even without the religious issue he has pretty big character flaws including being unable to stand up to his family

the chances of talking to hoarders directly  that gets them to change their habit is slim to none in my lived experience if it is a married couple where both partners like to collect you are totally doomed sometimes it is just one partner and then there is a window of reason to work with the other one in this case neither of them mind living in a dump hell they are living their best lives from the sounds of it 

report it will that fix the issue maybe maybe not depending on where you live and if there are actual fines or consequences at least you will know you took action then wait for your trees to grow
based on the comments below you are now facing the consequences of expecting someone to always pour from their glass but never really being in a stable enough place that you could do the same 

she dumped you because you have notoriously bad relationship patterns and while she could cope with being supportive above and beyond normal friendship supportive when you were physically sick she doesnt have another one of your dramaboyfriend support cycles to go through with you

maybe unfair maybe this is the guy sometimes we burn people out though  it doesnt matter if this time is different you just have to accept thats where they are at i think its a low blow that she tells you to come back when the shit hits the fan as opposed to at the oneyear point when it turns you are now in your first stable relationship but shes coming from a place of total burn out 

not much you can do but in your heart thank her for what she has done for you respect her space and hope you two might meet again down the road
two things going on at once in her grief she couldnt express her needs and in your adhdness you didnt think to say out loud what you assumed was known for her to tell you what she needed and youd do it 

in all fairness even non adhders are not mind readers now if she had asked you to go with her and you flaked i think you should beat yourself up but this one is kind of a gray area 

send her some nice flowers or buy her a plant and ask her what you can do now to support her later when shes out of grief tell her you do much better with explicit instructions and you do want to support her
i mean shes 54  hanging out with these people they all sound exhausting
a teen soap opera because this guys friends circle never grew up
this problem just will not go away

the problem is your friends period even if you all loooove bob hes enabling a significant other who is a nightmare person hes complicit in this

also honestly from your description of events you hold your fiance as responsible for starting this an outside perspective is that the friend group sounds like a bunch of immature drunk frat guys and sorority girls who are too old to behave the way they do and they are ganging up on your fiance for seeing them for what they are

you are in your 30s you keep your friendship with bob separate and go out and make a new friend group with your wife  realize this is not an acceptable social combination moving forward your loyalty should be to your fiance and if an entire group of people is tacitly going along with bullying her by believing sarahs bullshit then you should be cutting those people out of your life too

edit rereading this youll throw sarah out if she causes problems she already ruined a pre wedding event throwing her out midwedding is drama i think you are way more of the problem than you realize youve been hanging out with toxic immature people so long you dont even know what normal behavior is
mmmhmm sipping a nightcap at the bedroom bartop table while the significant other takes his or her evening deposit charmed life
if shes drinking like an alcoholic you are doing her no favors by enabling her when you give someone an ultimatum like i will leave unless you quit drinking and they dont quit then you go otherwise you have removed any reason for them to change shell have to do that on her own 

talk to a lawyer and get your ducks lined up that debt is probably both of yours now but at least if you divorce now it will be capped at 20k in another 3 years it may grow exponentially 

as for her dying without you people are resourceful especially alcoholics trust me when i say shell survive
first of all get yourself some flavor onions are flavor are they sugar once sauteed for awhile sure but also good fiber and antioxidants 

secondly is this all you are eating chicken rice broccoli every day all meals 

while you can get enough nutrients from that meal mix it up for the love of life think of it this way one veg one protein small amount of healthy grain do a poached salmon for a few nights a week try an omlete or a small turkey burger at least change up your greens different vegetables are going to have different nutrient values and getting more colors in there red bell pepper some carrots bok choy or spinach would go a long way to making this a great and healthy way to meet your goals try some bulgar quinoa or millet a handful of berries a week isnt going to get you away from your goal and also supplies more needed antioxidants and vitamins 

only eating the exact same meal every day for weeks months sounds very close to getting yourself into disordered eating
my mom did that with one of their little mini tea roses and it also has flourished in her garden for something like 15 years now but tea roses really are outdoor plants
 i wear glasses and every time i go around a curve staring intently at the road it thinks i am not looking at the road something about the glasses or lighting or maybe my head doesnt move enough but on curvy mountain roads i have to remember to turn it off or it s hell every bend getting yelled at when you are paying attention
im confused if you were nonmonogamous when he slept with the last sex worker how is that infidelity i think you need to be fair here and not ascribe infidelity where there was none to be taken aback or unsure of how you feel that your partner paid for sex is totally understandable but he didnt cheat on you

it is uncool that he didnt reveal this much of history to you sooner that part can feel like a betrayal of trust for sure 

i think part of it may be that theres a loophole to paying for sex versus dating or hookups in that you can just order service without any of the rest of the work of dating so it can seem dehumanizing and even if you arent judgemental of sex workers themselves maybe you are judgemental of johns

i cant say how to overcome it but if you really love him and the relationship feels worth it then give the news some time to settle
getting married at 23 is actually very different than getting married at 29 you are staring down 30 and have finished your 20s she only just started hers and has been in a relationship with you since she was 18

if you two have never really spent more than a week apart shes not wrong that she should take time off my best guess is you have been in a caretaker role for most of this relationship she has told you she loves you but isnt in love with you that she feels like she has missed out on parts of life and you are telling her you do know how she feels better than she does if that sort of thing bleeds over into other parts of your dynamic whether you mean to or not you may have been controlling

let her go away for a month you dont want to marry an unwilling partner and you dont want to be convincing someone they are actually willing i cant say if itll end it likely it does and this is the slow ease on her end but if she does come back i think you both should seriously consider postponing the wedding
get her a proper diagnosis 

coping strategies can be learned including visual notes phone alarms looking at sorting tasks that play to her strong suits learning how to get some tools to help with executive functioning  including possible medication

otherwise you telling someone just think who has adhd no matter how loving or kindly doesnt fix their adhd 

now if it isnt adhd and shes just stressed  rushed thats different but rule out adhd first
id be very worried they tiled without putting a shower pan liner in first and you already have wood rot
thats chucko the barrelofmonkies monkey
finding a good therapist is really truly difficult i absolutely empathize with that but are you taking any other action to help yourself 

its a lot to place untreated mental illness on a significant other its different if there is a treatment plan in place and some tools being learned on your part how to communicate your needs clearly if you get snappy and moody that is not okay imagine wanting to help someone but not being able to predict their mood or how they will receive it eventually it leads to just walking on eggshells around them 

what specifically do you want him to do to help you seek outside help if you have some clear criteria like stay with you while you do a google search or make one call per week then ask specifically for that otherwise its this amorphous request for help while also taking your moods out on another person 

i would highly suggest getting a good enough for now therapist who specializes in generalized anxiety disorder maybe they arent a longterm therapeutic partner to explore deeper trauma with they arent the right age or you dont feel they get you completely but they have some sort of modality even cbt to help you get started on taking back some agency over this yourself
you are ok with having a child with someone youve known for a couple of months the dudes a relative stranger wait until you have a child and hes running to his friend before approving any life decisions 

im sorry theres close to no way this works out

tell her you are taking a break then do a temp block 

you dont need this right now what a clusterfuck of behavior reserve your emotional energy for where it matters
after that he told me many other things that he wasnt impressed with about me 

i am at a complete loss as to why you started dating again after that 

x200b

he clearly has way higher emotional support expectations

hes needy you can just say needy 

x200b

 i do not want to cut him off completely since hes going through some stuff

not your problem youve known this guy for a month a month

you all arent compatible in the least when you are dating someone at least the first month should be fun getting to know them this all sounds like work with a critical guy who demands care taking exhausting 

send a short text we arent compatible and this isnt working out
i lived briefly in an ideal fern climate lots of warm rain  high humidity people had porch ferns that looked like that

my home country is generally politically apathetic theres just not much to be involved in and everything is working 90 great

whered you come from because id like to move from the us to there

general distrust in government has been a part of us culture for generations but we are now living in a posttruthmyfacebookconspiracyisasgoodfact america and it is tiring
age gap in the comments you state that you previously told him clearly you are not into bsdm there was no prediscussion this time which in bsdm there should always be a discussion of what is okay and how to communicate to stop where he got permission 

none of this is okay the fact that it startled you into not reacting in the moment is exactly what hes testing for how far can he push nonconsensual behavior with you 

dont feel bad that you were too shocked to say or do anything just get out now
my trader joes plant experience 1 bring plant home settle it in plant lives forever grows into nice healthy plant

i find that it takes a fair amount of emotional energy to maintain text conversations with people i am dating

you are in grad school and working you might not have enough emotional energy in general to date toward the goal of a serious relationship you mention in college it was easier because you lived in a campus environment in real life you do have to commit a certain amount of time  energy to trying to meet people and unless you are in a cult or living on a commune itll be rare to ever have that kind of builtin social life again 

its pretty common for people to text as a way to build intimacy if thats really not your style tell people early on while you are dating that you tend to prefer inperson conversations and are not a great texter but also really consider if you have the space for a relationship right now too
separate accounts isnt the issue but given you are not earning the issue is 1 you have no real idea what his earnings are or this mysterious budget 2 you are reliant on someone who is keeping you in the dark

id tell him either 1 you get to know the full amount in his accounts even if your name isnt on it and that there is a decent and mature discussion about cost of living increasing to run the household and he stops asking if youve paid down your credit card with monopoly money or 2 you are looking to go back to work parttime in which case he can expect to pick up some of the household chores you currently take care of 

others mention its bordering on financial abuse for 2 earners 2 separate accounts and one joint account make sense to me for 1 earner to have 1 account the other is in the dark over is a messed up dynamic
kaiser is hit or miss my parents have it kaiser probably saved my mothers life meanwhile i am pretty sure the care there and a lot of neglect even when i have tried to advocate for him has likely shortened my dads life 

sutter health palo alto medical foundation takes my ppo and i think they take anthem if i do a lot of research on doctors you can get some really good ones there and it is affordable 

if you need a specialist at standford sutter health doc can refer you and then it should be covered by anthem
i mean you bring up fire exits the pandemic was also the same year the entire west coast was on fire for a few months there personally think we dont like to admit 20202021 was a mindfuck of massive proportions that changed the way a lot of people behave
honestly youd probably prefer to see shows at the wiltern i dont know how old you are but its been my lived experience that at a certain point in my life i no longer enjoyed any situation where i felt sardined into a crowd indoors places like the hollywood bowl always feel good because the outdoor nature and its well organized but even then the greek theater is better imo for a show because its just a nice size
worklife balance everywhere in the us is going to be tough but culturally texas imo is its own tough nut to crack i have only been through varying cities in texas a few times so i am not going to lie like i know the state but it always feels like being in its own country within even the us 

is she open to relocating within the us you could take time to do some traveling and find a better region that suits you both youll still work until you die but the us is huge with regions that really vary in terms of lifestyle and climate
a conversation in a respectful marriage should make this stop you should be able to say something like 

albert you never use my name myra and it hurts my feelings furthermore the bird whistle to call me is degrading either start using my name and asking for things nicely or ill be ignoring your bird calls if they continue but by all means you can find a blue jay to fly in and assist you 

then start actively ignoring the damn bird call he continues because it works hell when you hear it throw on a coat and go run an errand or take a walk 

hes trained you like a dog so reversetrain him like a dog also reflect on other aspects of your marriage where you husband is demeaning theres usually more than one facet
go back to therapy stop saying its a onetime thing your daughter is going to remember that afternoon  or at least have a deep emotional imprint of when daddy cried over cookies for years to come 

i told her that she has no idea how i feel because ive never seen her braking down like that and questioned whether she even misses her late husband 

and that is a very selfcentered view of grief and a low blow to a woman you credit as having helped you through the worst time in your life you ever think she was busy being strong for you that she had to learn how to quietly process her grief on her own

go back to therapy
p means park assist was probably on it beeps like hell
oh wow thats tough 

he either agrees to marriage counseling and he works hard at your marriage or divorce pretending that having a dating app while your wife is raising a newborn is a whoopise daisy is beyond bullshit its divorce worthy but i can see why you wouldnt want to go there first  he wants to fix this then he starts showing up 

i believe kids are better off the children of divorce with parents who can coparent well than growing up witnessing a loveless marriage
shes 25 so shes the youngest she might be a manipulating cow or she may be extremely insecure or maybe both whatever it is shes a social bully and shes picking on you stand up for yourself 

talk to her next time she corrects you simply say  teal is a shade of blue and it really makes me feel crappy when you nitpick on what i say it happens a lot could you please stop do it in front of everyone do it right when it happens stay calm formula her bad behavior  how it makes you feel 

whether shes doing it intentionally or not calling someone out calmly can make a person correct their behaviors the others probably havent even noticed it but shes not going to want to be seen as mean after that so shell work on it shell probably come up to you later gushing about how she didnt mean to blah blah blah just tell her its a pattern and it needs to stop 

next just talk to anna about how you are feeling if shes a longtime friend shell hear you without judgment 

whats the worse that can happen you already feel youve lost your friend group and are having anxiety taking action reduces anxiety if it turns out she has manipulated people into changing how they feel about you after all these years then its the painful process of having lost a friend group but you deserve better  you already feel like that maybe pushing back gets you back to where you want to be in your relationships and she becomes aware of her bad behavior towards you
so besides betraying your trust your bf is a drug addict

edit i see your comments below where you say its complicated

its not complicated hes an addict he will lie cheat and steal and you can either stay in it and watch it all go down and addicts take everyone down with them or leave now hes not quitting until he decides to and you cant make that happen
if you google genetic testing for antidepressants you will get more info but you can also look up genetic testing for adhd meds but the basics is that it cant state what drugs will 100 work for you not a golden bullet but it gives a good insight based on your dna how you metabolize drugs to know which may be better for you in terms of side effects and effectiveness

edit i dont know why i cant link to it but mayo clinic has a good breakdown of what it can and cant do and how
can you make your monthly payments and do you really like your new townhome then dont worry about it 

arms arent as bad as everyone is making out it really depends on the terms many have limits on how high interest rates can go over the lifetime of the loan  it is capped at how much it can increase every 6 months so depending on the initial rate they got there is some risk depending where we will be in 5 years but if the 1st 5 years are really low like 35 then it actually may all work out even in the wash  

lots of people are getting them right now esp if they plan to sell in 57 years and are gambling that they wont be underwater comps will hold in their area 

if you are fine with the mortgage you have then dont engage your cousin sometimes people are unsure of their choices so talking loudly about it makes them feel more sure just tell him thats great he got a good deal then change the topic
stop engaging her on this topic no i wont discuss this with you is a complete statement no follow ups no arguing with her why this is a bad idea just she starts you get up and leave over until it is clear 

your mom neglected and abused you if you havent tried therapy finding counseling to learn how to set boundaries with her and take care of yourself would go a long way you dont have to cut her off if thats not what you want but you do need preserve your own sanity when you are around her
are you in therapy because that sounds like a lot to deal with growing up and even though she lacks selfawareness for her special brand of crazy you can get help for yourself to learn how to set boundaries with her
well he either 1 agrees with the racist sentiments youve experienced 2 doesnt fully agree the comment about certain food items means we know he agrees a little but also deeply lacks any capacity for empathy 

both options make for a lousy partner
i love dates but they have more sugar in them than most cookies do they also have fiber and lovely nutritious value sure but they are sugar bombs
freeze grapes they taste like little mini popsicles
youre going to love your new home so much that youll find you have 20 good years left 
i think it is always worth trying different meds  getting genetic testing done if you have access and i fully believe medication is transformative for many people  they should have nonstigmatized access to it 

the flip side that people dont like to talk about medication doesnt work for everyone both antidepressants and adhd meds i am one of those people who has had to learn to cope without medication after decades of trying everything under the sun i also have nonadhd related medical issues that i am sure complicate the issue

we are still in the stone ages in terms of understanding brain chemistry
what a partner has to do bear minimum here is respect boundaries  if the boundary is too difficult for them then you can agree to break up

just because he respected one boundary giving up only fans does not mean he can disrespect consent and secretly film you without permission ever doing something against another persons consent like that ignoring a clear no during sex is sexual assault
i feel like you are both being ridiculous you a tiny little bit and her a bunch shes taking something that isnt personal your taste in food and equating it with love and then reacting like you are personally rejecting her its over the top 

at the same time you really cant find any asian food you like i think your compromise would go a lot further to smooth things over if she could on occasion pick at least one or two places to go out to eat that were asian and youd join her in the us there are so many heavily americanized recipes ramen or a bento box at a japanese restaurant fried rice or noodles at a chinese place and plenty of thai dishes that arent spicy like spring rolls or chicken skewers with peanut sauce on the side pretty easy on any palate 

bigger picture if you want marriage and kids you all just might not be compatible cooking and eating can be separated in a relationship but for many people it is a big part of their life  they dont want to live in a household where different meals have to be prepared kind of like a vegan and a meat eater trying to make it work not saying you cant but not everyone wants to try
ill never join a cult because i cant commit to one way of thinking
oh i read all the same articles selling was a calculated decision i dont regret but other peoples fomoattitudes and panic moving definitely made me triggershy to buy or relocate migration during a black swan event seemed like a recipe for disaster to me even if my caution made me mistime stuff in retrospect 

ive lived in other states while i dont think ca is paradise by any means and we have a myriad of problems growing up in a mild climate without humidity snow or long dark days has ruined me for other places in the us ha even someplace like spain looks better to me right now than trying to make a go of it elsewhere here 

anyway i know east coast prices have stayed really sticky but keep the faith your next better home is out there
im in a similar boat sold in 21 in a hcol area to unload a starter house i kind of hated and i made good money off of it so i cant complain about that but unable or unwilling to jump back in considering moving to a mcol area but also worried somewhat about the transition for me a mcol area could get me a wonderful home with a small mortgage based on my equity from my starter home but i also know how this country reacts to my kind moving in californian  need to really want to make the move currently dont 

anyway in ca no one older will ever want to sell given prop 13 made their tax evaluations stay  forever low in an area without that kind of stupid move people would likely way the pros cons for some older people the only way to make a move on a paid off home worthwhile would be if downsizing was necessary otherwise its still likely more costeffective to age in place  

the only thing i can see impacting supply would be job loss during a recession which i dont actively wish for because it is hard on everyone or regulations on short term rentals where the landlords dont see the value in long term rental tenants
untrue it very much depends on location but just as much on the era of construction 

century homes early 1900s1940s in the us often appreciate more in value during 2008 crash century homes did not depreciate as much as newer builds 

there are also midcentury homes that are wanted for the architectural style think frank llyod wright and go for millions even in the midwest then there are midcentury tract homes made out of cardboard and asbestos 

now if you are talking about newer builds compared to newer builds ie a new home development versus a development built in the 90s the newer ones are usually preferable in that they are less datedlooking but they will be dated in 30 years too some newer builds however are really well made better heat and cooling insulation better noise insulation etc
there are better locations for mobile homes than others i know someone who is renting a mobile home and it is profitable for the owner to do so its an arid climate so no mold which is the enemy of mobile homes they arent worth the cost to remediate mold once it takes over  a stunning natural location people want to live there to live in that area so it will be unlikely to go down in value 

otherwise mobile homes make sense if you are a retiree and you know you have a limited time left on earth because of the eventual decline of the building materials resale value isnt as important even then the risks are that you dont own the land so if a new company takes over the park your fees can increase dramatically 

think of them as condos built out of worse materials with less longterm value
can you get therapy on your own without her knowing because you are going to need help learning how to navigate life after growing up with a really controlling mom it may be coming from a place of love and anxiety from her but it is damaging not to learn at appropriate developmental ages that you are capable of handling things on your own

the good news is you can learn to handle things on your own and you can learn how to give your mom boundaries while you are under her roof i would not get hung up on the curfew right now so much as admit the bigger picture your mom created a dependent daughter so she could keep you under her control that is unhealthy your overall goal is to teach yourself independence it is to move out of your moms home and live a healthy life with good boundaries with her
you can be the one to file for divorce
you state in the comments you are at peace with it now and in the post that hes trying to make things right because of current guilt 

this is going to be like a storm system there will be calm and then a new storm system blows in prepare yourself for that eventuality that until you are through this and on the other side it there is no real trust between both of you there is a lot of money is at stake and things can get nasty from you or from him  

go to a fantastic lawyer asap and follow what they say including documentation of all major events 

make a promise to yourself now not to use your kids as pawns you both actually can get through this and eventually come to a place of agreement and resolve but if you try to damage each others relationship with your children it will be a wound that never heals 

good luck

go to an alanon meeting today they are held around the world and online 

the 12step program has serious issues but when someone like you is in total denial that they are in a codependent relationship with an abusive alcoholic its really helpful to find others and hear their stories it will help you understand both 1 yes you were in an abusive relationship 2 how you enabled it 3 start taking care of yourself
excuse me but the owner used to come up to me and whatever i was going to buy squid pasta a jar of pesto olive oil and point out the one that tastes best ive ended up trying even a can of smoked mackerel that was heaven due to his advice  hes too old now and just sits but that man is a national treasure you do not get that kind of service anywhere anymore

when the 30 day nc is over i think i need to stop being friends with him completely

good news you dont need to wait until the end of 30 days of no contact to make contact  explain that you want further no contact you can start right now block everywhere and think about what healing from this looks like start working on meeting new people
not legal advice but psychological you are dealing with bullies based on what theyve said so far they dont play well with others and they like the game of steamrolling over people figuratively but also possibly literally bullies dont care about laws moral behavior or being good neighbors they only care that they can strongarm people who they perceive as more intent on civility aka weaker into doing their bidding 

you push back immediately with bullies you dont fear escalation because they are going to do that anyway you get the upper hand 

i dont see why you wouldnt keep the temporary fence up indefinitely in fact id get my permits lined up and put up a solid fence between my home and these folks and around the rest of the property just in case 

id also issue a c  d dont follow up with a intent to remove the fence just that charges with be pressed for further trespassing and property destruction 

id further get some cameras and movement lights 

make sure all your ducks are legally in a row you have photo evidence  document everything 

option 4 feels like the worse option to me its passive and doesnt get on top of this situation 

speaking with them through lawyers for the remainder of your neighborly relations sounds good to me
i like the knot in the wood on top it makes it look like an image from a colonoscopy strong motif
 i feel like the only way i can successfully leave is if i completely disappear or he finds someone else

this isnt completely true npd will not want you to leave no matter what even if they leave first they will still need you to be destroyed before they go so no one else can every have you either way here you are getting something you wanted a path to him possibly leaving and you are upset  focusing on the wrong thing 

you do not owe her anything she can see what is going on and it is not for you to save her you save yourself

the only thing that matters in a mentally and physically abusive relationship is getting out you dont need to completely disappear you need a domestic abuse shelter some resources and to get out before he kills you recalibrate your inner compass to your survival and then later healing
how does a 16 year old force everyone to choose shes not paying shes not the adult ot parent shes not forcing you to do anything youre just not parenting 

you need to make executive decisions make sure she has food in the fridge she can cook for herself if she doesnt like your decisions she wont starve
i tell her its because shes earned it but its also because we always end up ordering from the place she wants as shes picky

even if you think you are hiding this fact you arent she knows you are catering to her at 16 finding out how much power you have is a pretty heady thing but also no 16 year old knows how to handle this

stop giving her so much control over everyone in the family if she cant make decisions that benefit everyone its one thing to have a special day because of doing well in school or her birthday but shes already a difficult eater soclearly food is an issue for her then you are asking her to make a choice for the whole family around eating

shes a teen she can have some food in the fridge she likes and make her own dinner if she doesnt like what everyone else is eating i kind of feel like youve created this problem and are now mad shes not mature enough to deal shes not selfcentered she just isnt the person who should be given the power to dictate where you all eat that should be you

edit from your replies in the comments she has adhd  you sound like you actually dont like your kid get her help with the adhd and get yourself some information for how to handle it better again she doesnt sound selfcentered it sounds like you want her to have executive functioning skills she hasnt developed yet and so you are mad and frustrated with her
i feel like im negotiating a business deal

nah you can get a better deal in business none of this is negotiation so far from what you write its his financial plan or nothing thats actually more like an ultimatum than a negotiation

he also gets upset and insists i dont fully trust him if im hesitant to go all in immediately

well i wouldnt trust him i actually believe couples should fully discuss financials before marriage and get as much on paper as possible but you are the only one in this scenario with anything to lose including your current home

youve known him less than one year he wants you to move to a new country  there are so many red flags and concerns in all of this a loving partner would be fine with you renting out your current home keeping your assets in your name only and moving there for a trial period the level of pressure in this makes me feel like hes a catfisher or something do not like
edit ah got it misread i stand corrected
so you were not as a couple prepared to adopt a cat  instead abused an animal you have now completely messed up a perfectly good loving cat into a neurotic depressed cat the good news is that placed in a better situation cats can decompress and return to its more loving nature

you are responsible for either finding that cat a better a home asap or breaking up and getting the cat out of there 

honestly after hearing you left a cone on a cat for a year and wont allow it to groom itself to enable a girlfriends cruelty i really dont care what you do with your relationship
youve spun out in multiple directions on this from possible school violence to your own future without children and to be fair none of that is really about your sister

you sound deeply anxious a 13yearold from a neglectful home is going to be a handful would your home be better than where she is now with a parent that sounds like she doesnt want her yeah it probably would but if you cant do it at the expense of your own struggles then you cant

if you move forward i suggest making sure you have mental health help first and foremost secondly look into what resources are available in your county from social workers to free afterschool tutoring its possible she may be eligible for several services including getting counseling herself 

you shouldnt be breaking your back doing her homework for her and shell need to learn to have respect you need to be able to be clear on what your boundaries are with her what punishments she gets if she breaks rules etc most of all though you have to take care of yourself if you cant do this now you will need to back out honestly the school violence issue isnt going to be enough to get you out of it
i wish we had a healthier 2year specialized vocational schooling system that was accredited beyond community colleges a college degree absolutely isnt always worth it but there are plenty of entrylevel positions or skilled positions that require one when 2 years or less would get people professional enough experience without the larger debt
eh if its financially feasible no or little loans spending 1822 learning stuff and learning independence isnt the worst thing in the world to do whats bad is going into serious debt without thinking about what to do with the degree afterward
you will
thats bullshit abusive behavior is she in therapy if not she needs to be

if you arent going to break up with her then at least tell her this youre drained her inability to communicate in an adult way makes you feel anxious  she needs to work on communication when shes upset or youre out then you keep to your ultimatum

if she feels a mood coming on she can use her words to tell you she needs a little time to herself 

she seemed sympathetic but instead of making a compromise of some kind suggests that maybe were not compatible

next time she says this agree with her and walk thats either some gradea manipulation or she actually does want to break up and cant do it herself
your dad cant repair what your mom broke but hes going to keep trying 

talk to your therapist  tell him or her youd like to come up with a few neutral noncommital statements to get out of hanging out with your mom 

its difficult being back home as an adult and your mom made her favoritism of your sister very clear you dont have to step up in any way for her now you just have to make being back at your parents house peaceful as possible
someone once told me its impossible to forgive someone when they are still a threat given your back at your parents house even if shes nicer now it probably feels like shes still a threat to you or at least the little kid part of you that she hurt frequently 

secondly she hasnt asked for forgiveness and hasnt taken responsibility for what she did to you as a kid 

id box up the need to forgive her and focus more on what do you need to do for yourself to make living at home right now okay how can you maintain a relationship with your mom right now that doesnt hurt you or bring out past resentment

one thing that might help is to think about how have you learned to be a better parent to yourself than she was  remind yourself of how you take care of yourself 

you can forgive her when shes on her deathbed if you want but really we dont have to go around forgiving everyone the main thing is to not seethe in resentment or hurt yourself with the bad memories  find ways to make that work
no good deed goes unpunished
hey at least we know the source of your mental health issues kidding aside depression and anxiety can make some emotional development get delayed long depressive episodes in adolescence can mean not emotionally developing during that period

but in your brothers  moms case they are misinterpreting complacency  peoplepleasing with emotional maturity in all likelihood you are exerting yourself more now is you being more emotionally mature  they are the ones who are stymied by their own dynamic
just finished watching the final season of you on netflix so 
i think you are getting offended by the analogy which it is still used to this day to dehumanize immigrants and has racist beginnings but the content or the argument statistically men are more physically dangerous to women than vice versa is factual 

the not all men thing does derail the conversation when i think you really needed to state that repurposing a racist analogy to deal with reasonable fears for women undermines her point
so whatever happened in that text thread she likely 1 had confessed private things about your marriage 2 encouraged sexting to get to that picture 2 neutrally went along with it  didnt shut it down or 3 actively pursued or started it

we know that or she wouldnt have deleted the text thread she would have shown it to you it  proven her innocence

youve repaired your marriage to the point that you stayed together but you clearly still feel some betrayal so your best bet to continue working past that is marriage counseling digging up the text thread without any safety net is just going to blow up what you currently have

im personally not on the all cheating means everything is over camp cheating happens on a spectrum from physical infidelity to workplace intrigues to inappropriate texts 17 years together does mean that people will in all likelihood emotionally fuck up or hurt each other at some point

if you go into counseling you have a fighting chance to see not if you can get past this but actually put it to rest if you cant put it to rest you have a solid foundation of how to end things
push back yourself asap 

theres a thing in these types of situations that are toxic bro environments you can either be liked or respected being respected means being a bitch so do that fearlessly you dont need the little chudheads to like you you need them to do their work

have a little meeting tell them for now its off the record that you understand their bet and it is laughable youd touch any of them however if they dont drop the bullshit and start doing their work you will do everything within your power to make sure they fail downward instead of upward at your company 

as for the one at the gym tell him under no uncertain terms  if he continues to stalk you in your private life you will perceive it not as friendly but a threat and you will look into sexual harassment litigation and that he also better improve his work

look for a female mentor above you in your company and ask her out to lunch start a network of your own support there good luck
you had the gall the gall to heal and move on from the loss of such a winning man how dare you not be a devastated mush ball forever forlorn at the absence that is his glory you were meant to put on a dirty burlap sack and go forever cry with the other unwanted divorcees in the forest of loneliness 

it sounds like intuitively you have figured out the grey rock technique  his response is the typical flareup that they can no longer get an emotional reaction out of you hell probably move on in a bit then from timetotime pull this shit on you again continue to keep it cold and professional  enjoy your new life
your mom has mental health issues and agoraphobia so that alone is enough to fuck a teen girl up then her boyfriend oded

she doesnt want to hear this but adoption would actually be in the babys best interest i think you need to stop focusing on trying to get a messed up traumatized 17yearold to suddenly function like an adult and get her some mental health counseling asap she has 3 months to realize that if she loves this baby its best chance of survival would be an open adoption with a loving and stable family
so everything you described about being the best girlfriend is not what anyone who wants a healthy relationship would ask of a partner giving pets wtf curfew wtf you werent a human to this guy but an accessory 

they always come back right when you are at the point that you have put yourself back together enough to start your new phase i swear not a believer in psychic ability but somehow they know when theyve finally almost lost all power over you the reach out is just to try and get that power back for themselves 

you want to prove to him that youve moved on block and ignore
dudes ten years older than you and hes an abusive little schmuck fyi if someone loves you this is how that conversation should go

person a please dont joke about that it really hurts my feelings

person b im sorry i didnt mean to hurt you ill stop 

hurting someones feelings disrespecting them if they ask you to stop then getting angry at them then silent treatment no

dont reach out or apologize for what and when or if he does let him know its over you can do so much better
tv show but big little lies portrayed the complexity of love in a violent domestic relationship pretty well
im sorry but your life goals sound completely incompatible  please dont throw away however many years it took you to finish that phd take the job
question how long are you staying for

she may have bitten off more than she can handle  is overwhelmed she may be a total control freak she may be a terrible hostess the two of you may never be close none of it really matters 

what matters is that your brother is happy if he is leave it be if he isnt maybe hell confide in you maybe he wont

i would handle it by being a good house guest dont tease or insult her ask if you can help in any way and be polite if she goes quiet just bring up a lighthearted topic unless shes acting out in anger or directly gets mad theres no point in reading too much into things
i have a pretty sick sense of gallows humor and even i cant get funny from this
cant you block and request to block all future accounts that person creates id also lock your account to private for at least 6 months

it sucks but unless you want to disable your account thats all you can do the good news is shell burn someone else out eventually and focus on that dead friendship
