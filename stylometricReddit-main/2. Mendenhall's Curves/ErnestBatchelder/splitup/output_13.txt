politically stable only because it is a semimonarchy i believe but in terms of human rights freedom of speech womens rights etc i could never qualify it as better than the us your mileage may vary as someone in an academic role but id still watch what you say i feel guilty because our invites are out and people whod be traveling out of state for this have already booked flights and hotels not a good reason to marry i also have put a lot of money down on deposits divorce after a few years is more costly than your deposits i am not saying break up for this incident but i am saying you will need to have a lot of discussions once he is sober over what has happened and if you have any doubts about how you feel over the next few weeks then putting a wedding on hold to sort those doubts is always smarter than getting married because of out of town guests and deposits i know this is a funny cute story and no one besides glasses got hurt but your bf should have warned you of potential issues and also done at least a few trial walks where he hung way back and watched how well the dog responded to your cues you are so lucky you didnt tear a rotator cuff or break a bone how would you like it if you were pooping on your neighbors roof and someone snapped a pic of you super dangerous paranoid accusation however you are responding like theres a rational solution to a delusional fear there isnt suggestion it comes up again simply reply we have not photographed you at any time let us contact the authorities now and speak to them brief simple concise i would for now try to open a police report although maybe others can chime in if thats wise she likely does need a check from cps for the kids safety but may escalate after that fair enough i havent worked in the restaurant industry in probably 2 decades so that may no longer be a thing the funny thing is in the 80s no one knew or cared where their children were then one generation later helicopter parenting became normalized see these public service announcements work x200b except for the 80s antidrug advertisements that just made kids want to do more drugs take a break from the dynamic and let him know you and your wife would really appreciate some privacy at this time and you will reach back out when you are ready thats a good leave us alone without a door slam if he doesnt respect your wishes then you know hes a fullon twat to be blocked if he does you have plenty of time to mull over if you want to continue the friendship to any degree while he was inappropriate and had no right to psychoanalyze your wife like hes some authority regardless of an unused degree what also sticks out to me is that the entire tenor of the dinner began with a weird reveal about their private lives i know we are all meant to be more honest about mental health but i have a very firm boundary now around people who disclose a lot when the relationship may be an old one but is not a current close intimate friendship in my lived experience these are people looking to trauma bond which is what happened with your wife i understand the resentment you feel towards him valid because it endangered your wife and the child shes carrying id refocus as much on keeping her feeling healthy try to not dwell on the friend and put him out of your mind your wife may want to later think about what should be the parameters for her disclosing her bipolar i diagnosis with people its fine for her to share with those she feels safe with but also set a boundary that it isnt conversation for things like a dinner party with old friends ignoring the hand jobs aspect here i assume can you get a job without a work visa is your real question most restaurant work pays in cash tips but you will still need to get a work visa for hire otherwise day laborers completely under the table but no hand jobs are really what a lot of undocumented workers do but it is often difficult manual labor with no work protections and i wouldnt plan on that for a summer vacay since the owner said they also had adhd you could take a risk and reach back out to them ask if they wouldnt mind being really specific with what they felt was wrong tell them as it was your first job youd like the opportunity to learn from the experience so you dont carry the behavior over into the next job and that you really did enjoy your time there i know that when i am trying to do several tasks at once or keep one task straight i can sound mean or short with people if they interrupt my flow im really not irritated by them im just trying to follow the order of things in my head and concentrate also just know that good bosses or managers actually will take the time to train you and to give you feedback or tell you at the end of the day if something went wrong instead of letting it pile up and then fire you after a couple of weeks interviewing and hiring people takes a lot of work so it is better for them to try and work with a new hire if these guys didnt bother to do that they are probably stressed and not running the greatest shop to begin with black mirrory looking set up nah if you want to have your windows open or enjoy your tiny yard you will still hear neighbors fighting kids screaming in those places that close together is almost as bad as shared walls how many homes sold last year were investor vacation rentals pine mountain is a lot like idyllwild one of those places where a lot of people have a second home from la that they use for vacations versus allyear residents get yourself to the office of students with disabilities and make sure you are receiving every accommodation you qualify for they dont help if you dont use them sometimes not always osd is run by very helpful people who have a pretty good idea of what professors believe in adhd and will follow accommodations and what professors arent great to work with they can even possibly help you choose your best classes consider an adhd coach qualified ones can be found online if things get too hard to stay on top of take advantage of the free college tutors on campus usually available in maths and english even if you just make appointments once a week when you are doing well in a course but you do homework with them for a standing weekly appointment it helps for accountability really helps at the end of the semester when everything is nuts to have that relationship already established i did graduate from a very hard university with unmedicated adhd but i failed the first few goarounds the biggest difference the last time around was that i advocated for myself got ahead of accommodations at the start of the semester not weeks after things were already going downhill and took advantage of every support system professors office hours tutoring librarians the university offered many people here would scoff at paying more for a jeep grand cherokee than a fully loaded lexus suv i was car shopping a few months ago people have been paying addon fees in the 1000s something like 50007000 above msrp just to get a new toyota rav4 or honda crv electric both dealerships calmly explained the fees and they were getting them edit to add i did go with a friend to lexus their fees were something like 2000 extra wait list i believe it is unsustainable too but my point is people will buy overpriced crap if it is all they can get people in your situation will no longer sell even if you wanted to move up making scarcity worse crazy market people go crazy im one of the people who sold at what i thought was the height and now pretty much cant get back in without compromising a great deal hey thanks he says its similar to the fact that he owns a gun he would only use it for self protection thats great it makes him feel safe but the issue is when someone goes from securityminded to paranoid perceives a nonthreat as a threat that makes them triggerhappy from your comments below you are both already in marriage counseling i think it is time to ask him to attend solo therapy as well it cant be okay going through life always believing in worsecase scenarios and it is no way to raise a kid together hes insecure in a survivalmode kind of thinking that he needs to get to the bottom of on his own you may also bring up in therapy what making a postnuptial would look like ie make a legal contract for what you would both agree to in a divorce it sounds counterintuitive but if you are both actively discussing how you would theoretically dissolve the marriage without hurting each other it might help the marriage you absolutely have your rights to how you feel about this the question is if you feel you need to defend yourself in this situation or can extend empathy while also looking out for yourself and your kid i really want to know if anyone has discovered any therapies that have worked as an adult for misophonia hyperacusis there is some cbt program thats meant to help but i havent had the faith or hope to start it during the pandemic my formerly quiet street became the main cutthrough road everyone starting speeding all day and night down 3 years later and now the sound of car engines and low bass beats hurts physically lifelong misophonia turned into severe hyperacusis and given this is a car culture country car sounds hurting is not great not great at all i still dont want to sink thousands of dollars to a specialist to get no results healthcare in italy is provided to anyone regardless of nationality while it might not be free it would be extremely affordable there to go to the doctor look for a clinic near you and go see a doctor for one thing if it is covid or even flu you really shouldnt be pushing yourself to travel until your fever has broken and you really shouldnt be on public transit while contagious move to the us for any number of reasons but moving here to save money right now is an odd choice forgetting the cost of such a large schlep childcare car and transit expenses in most us cities with kids both you working youll need two cars medical even with health insurance expect a level of outofpocket expenses and thats minus a major emergency the areas where you would get a 130k salary live near the coast are going to have a very high cost for 3 bedroom rentals i know it feels like doubling your salary is the payoff but the costs here likely might offset that if the move was for other reasons then go for it i really do hate how difficult it is to detach from your parents yeah it can be a lifelong process therapy is the best starting place if its a good match therapist for you theres sometimes a manageable middle road you can make that is in between being super caught up in
