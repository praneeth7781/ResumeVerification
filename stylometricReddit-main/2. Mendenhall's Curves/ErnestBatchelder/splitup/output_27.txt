southern ca have the family member ask their doctor make sure they tell them its for if and when it is terminal but that theyd like to know the process my friend chose this option when she had tried multiple treatments for bone cancer for 4 years she had options to do it at home but in the end they went to ucla she had a nice private room and she passed there the main thing i recall is that she had to take the medication herself no one could administer it to her it was not instantaneous though she went out of consciousness within an hour to be fair in the current market homebuying is the one situation where an emotional support animal makes sense look oregon trail millennials a microgeneration of millennials who would have been teens in the early 2000s for most of them there would be a computer at school the public library and maybe they had a friend who had one but the internet didnt impact an average teenagers daily life in any significant way tell him to shut up and get over

cousin but when you are bringing up an issue with someone or their significant other it is best to keep it to the stuff youve been subject to or observed otherwise you dont have as strong an argument

of what was culturally shifting the internet did not dominate peoples lives cell phones and car phones were huge edit huge as in they were physically big but not comon and people who had them were considered selfimportant or trying to show off doctors and drug dealers carried beepers answering machines could eat an important message you would never know who called mixed tapes still happened and were works of art it wasnt really into y2k that people outside of silicon valley and specific industries developed awareness of what we had just lived through and what the future would be like how

program i believe however double check it is up to a landlord to agree to accept housing vouchers or not the nice thing is doesnt it feel like whoa free shoes you were approved on paper at one rate then the rate changes and the buyer cant make the monthly payments as you get closer to closing escrow the mortgage lender can ask for more paperwork that screws things up buyer made a large purchase during escrow never got preapproval for the mortgage and then are denied issues with the home like easements or property lines discovered issues with the titledeed that arent discovered until escrow buyer got cold feet tons of reasons they can afford rent then they can rent from a different person this guy worked at a very specific laboratory for nasa and i wouldnt let him change the oil in my car replace your own lightbulbs or a dead battery yes please plumbing electrical or any form of maintenance that involves a power drill no thanks outback drives and feels like a sedan when you are in it forester definitely drives more like a truck from a seating and height perspective honestly could do with something in between a crosstrek and an outback in terms of a better quality interior crosstrek or a slightly smaller outback but given the size of every other car on the road where i am how people drive now id rather have the larger amount of steel between me and an suv or a truck in case of an accident bonus points for engineers they fix everything themselves downvote i bought a home from an engineer he fixed everything himself and while it was all functional until it wasnt every person who came to do a repair electrical plumbing etc would have a wtf moment trying to decipher what the hell he had done not to mention he spent a couple of decades doing his own interior design fixes like putting up his own crown molding and his own kitchen cabinets i spent a few years sinking screws and puttying calking and puttying and generally trying to make semistructurally sound improvements actually look decent i called all the wtfs neds after him why does the kitchen wall tile backsplash parallel the crooked floor instead of having been applied level oh thats just a ned me trying to decide which name sounds inherently dirtier for a tree dont respond go about your life silent treatment is passiveaggressive abusive bullshit people are allowed to say i am angry and i need some space but the cold shoulder and fuck off bs nope i have a flight home in four weeks to renew my visa when you get home take several days to feel how it feels not to be living in a tense house with a partner who gives you the silent treatment over petty things really feel if you physically feel different less stress in your body are you more relaxed if the answer is yes to that you may want to stay in your home country a little bit longer she keeps saying i love you and spending our lives together after 4 months and only just meeting up in person she is in a honeymoon phase and loves the idea of you add to that the heightened intensity of intimacy from texting talking for months but you dont even feel the honeymoon rush anymore so cut it out now break up asap or it will get worse for her everyone is different some people feel physical attraction from emotional intimacy some people need certain physical features in their partner to feel desire you now know you need the physical aspect to be a certain way to desire someone so dont do this longdistance thing again you both built up an entire world without meeting in person and it is always a risk to go that route can it work out sure especially for people who primarily feel attraction via emotional and intellectual stimulation and are less in need of a specific physical appearance being out in the public sphere in new orleans is a whole thing it is the only city in the world where complete strangers would call out how you doin baby with that no accent and id be like how you doin back totally charmed instead of wanting to hit them upside the head the rest of the south being friendly is bs everything is catty backtalk and bless your heart passiveaggressive bs but no does have real warmth to it despite all its issues flipside complete randos ending up telling me their entire life stories including inappropriate crazy ass details and while very interesting it got a bit emotionally draining i dont suck in my stomach but the not smiling is why i will never stop wearing masks in public spaces my rbf is private even if 50 is true they are awful together and they arent even in the same states as each other could also be too much betacarotene in the vitamins it can cause a yellowish discoloration of the skin one is benign and will reverse as soon as he stops taking the vitamins the other is lifeendangering so he needs to go to the doctor how to get him to listen no clue because the whole im going to starve myself to get healthy thing is already bananas unless a doctor was overseeing it evil psychopath who convinced people she was a genius her idea would never work she was told it would never work then she went into smoke and mirrors con artist mode she likely deluded herself but not an actual genius however i know that there are some things that my wife would not open up about to a therapist no you dont none of us are in other peoples heads just because shes never fully opened up to you doesnt mean she wouldnt open up to a therapist people are complicated and trauma can be very personal but often it feels safer to explain it to an expert than it does sometimes to share with a partner especially if you are talking about childhood trauma thats now impacted her view of her own body x200b would i be completely out of line yes dont try to start controlling her therapy before shes even started or set up a failure success dichotomy if you dont tell them x then you wont have success in therapy bad idea dont ask her what goes on during private sessions just tell her you support the idea that she wants to get help make sure she can get to therapy easily on the days she has it and be gentle and extra aware on those days to not overburden her stop engaging shes not pregnant shes creating drama and youre feeding it youre a fixation of hers right now any response especially this type of reaction i called her around 20 times is feeding the drama cycle of bs you are acting as unhinged as she is by responding to a nonsensical statement i have a belly button like that take the lessons learned and walk away no more contact individual counseling getting jumped and assaulted is trauma and you need to focus on your own recovery as much as it seems like a double letdown he both failed to protect you in the moment then later wanted to abandon you a second time because of that failure witness to violence is also a traumatic event just get some counseling for right now and heal you can decide the fate of your relationship when you have some tools under your belt to cope with the immediate aftermath of the incident best wishes hes almost 40 his best friend is a 27yearold who is emotionally immature even for that age and plays
