chief strategist who is more than a bit of a crackpot was also obsessed that the us should be getting into a war over islands in the south china seas very much a burn it all down guy who got fired before he was able to i think he now runs a school for fascists in italy or something bigger picture the chances of major war or climate catastrophe based on the cycles of history the current issues with the environment are quite high but i dont think we should be hoping for it i could never be with someone who refuses to ever laugh when i make a joke or who drags me when i am just trying to tell them something dude sounds like a soulcrushing clown the last time i had an issue as a guest i ran things up the chain and made the biggest professionalsounding stink i could and didnt drop it until i got a refund i was asking for a partial refund and got a full refund i am pretty sure they made a mistake in my favor but being persistent was the only way i got anything to happen i didnt sit around waiting for them to get back to me that said i no longer use the service it was a fantastic way to travel about 10 years ago if you are young you have zero things keeping you then trying it out cant hurt also its bullshit that neither sister invites you to christmas unless you had some grave falling out seems very callous i think as long as you dont view a move to a new country as a solution to fixing inner problems but making your outer life align more with what you want to see then its always great to try an adventure people are defending this and i dont get it i think your response is ethical and the fact that you as nonclinical staff find it offputting is understandable if they are talking with you about a session it is not because they expect you as administrative staff to have clinical insight that would help someone but because they want to gossip unload vent not your job to offer that to them they can vent with other therapists or their own therapist most clients would be devastated to know of this behavior it speaks poorly of the clinic you work at and i am guessing that is because it is run by someone who has these issues comes from the top next time a coworker dumps information on you that makes you uncomfortable i would just say as someone in an administrative role i am uncomfortable knowing this much about a patients private information as to what goes on in session and end the convo they will either respect that and clean up or ice you out but if they respond to a reasonable request like that in a petty way its more proof they are in the wrong field its a toxic work environment for you because this post isnt about providers speaking among themselves or making dark jokes its about them mocking patients laughing about them in front of administrative staff to the point that the staff in question ie op feels its questionable enough to post on here want to vent to another therapist about a patient without using names okay want to go to your own therapy session and complain about them understandable but mocking them in meetings where there should be some expectation of professionalism is offputting where i am in the us only 50 of cars on the road use their blinker regardless of brand using your blinker would be telling the enemy your plans and then the enemy could stymie those plans this actually varies state by state in ca you must stop at a red to turn right then if it is clear you can go i did it in louisiannastopped then turned on a red and i got a citation oh you can get a ticket for jaywalking in the us in plenty of states its just that it is a law that isnt enforced in any meaningful way after being illegal for years california recently changed the law making it legal if it doesnt cause a crash which is ambiguous at best sent a message hehehehehehehehehehe you are being way to polite with air bnbs response raise bloody hell with them and get more angry you should be escalating this until you get the platform to contribute to the cost of a higher airbnb will it work i dont know but i would try can a host cancel a reservation to make more money probably ways to go about it yes but to do so and taunt you is an ahole that should be banned from their server i would be agitating for a much bigger response and i would not stop beating home that the guy will cost you 1200 and mocked you send support a text message and screen shot his message i honestly dont want to go comfort her at this point you arent being too sensitive you are being insensitive but you can go alone if not please dont be annoyed about this someone took off a weekend shift and was really looking forward to getting to do something fun with her new husband and friends after not having any weekend fun i assume for awhile when you go to tell her your response is to request she shouldnt be annoyed you not feeling up to going is fine i dont even think its that big of a deal that you could tolerate tv but didnt want to risk a bar and i get being tired out even after a migraine has passed only all you had to say is hey i know you were really looking forward to this id love for you to go have fun i am sorry im not up for it i want to make this up to you when i am feeling better not try to get ahead of her reaction and tell her not to be annoyed forgetting procons list which you can write yourself for the things that matter to you i always think that you only have one life and to experience different things at different phases of it is a luxury some people never get some of my most comfortable treasured relationships are with people i can sit quietly beside to me its a form of really nice intimacy to be even on a road trip and not have to speak the entire time im from a vhcol area and there were articles and anecdotal stories starting ages ago before this current house market but back when rents were starting to shoot up in that city of couples who stayed in the same rental or home even after breaking up because of cost of housing give it 5 more years and well be getting think pieces on the subject i swear you two are fundamentally incompatible he should know you at a deep enough level to know his idea of work for you is not something youd consider failing that he should drop it immediately once he received a no finally say you did earn enough money for a deposit on a home off your bum pics whyd you want his lazy noncontributing ass on the title with you one flaw in the older downsize folks wont downsize anymore is that plenty of the boomers who bought suburban family homes in the early 80s never moved now have more equity in their homes than mortgages left for them to sell means a cash sale to buy their next downsized home mortgage rates dont matter in ca there are a lot of really nice 55 gated communities where prices on condos and homes are capped so if you went to sell your 4 bedroom suburban empty nest home for 15 2 mil cost of houses here you can easily get into a nice 2 bedroom in a gated community wit amenities for 750k cash again this is very location dependent i agree though that a lot of currently bought starter homes for this generation will become longerterm homes we used to see people postboomer gen more likely to sell and move up in 57 years i think that cycle is over i know thats sort of my sarcastic point people who are claiming that those will who bought with low mortgage rates will never sell are missing the fact that over time life happens it wont be everyone of course in the case of divorce for people who can refi at a higher rate and buy someone out it will be okay for a lot of other people job changes divorce death etc will make selling the reasonable option same for the subset of panic buys during the pandemic and crazy market when folks chose houses they really didnt like just to get in eventually in the next 510 yrs they probably will make the choice to sell if they can make the move and recessions are cyclical maybe the current cycle is a prolonged period of healthy employment numbers but it is unlikely looking to the future that is a foreverandever factor im sure many low mortgage rate folks will stay and enjoy their forever homes while i very much doubt a major housing crash i also dont think the current stalemate market low inventory is a permanent state maybe a decadelong one but not permanent everything is a casebycase scenario highly localized though divorcee duplexes this woman was friends with ops mom when she started sleeping with her married friends husband dont get me wrong ops father is 100 morally culpable for cheating on and leaving his wife but him being surprised his 2nd wife is a backstabby piece of work given how they met you make an agreement no politics at the birthday breakfast you break the agreement and make a little offhand comment then proceed to be upset that the other person is upset and doesnt defend his own kid because it is more important to have another man chime in and tell him he is correct even if that guy starts yelling at his kid you can tell he was dizzy with happiness that he got a backup person he takes zero responsibility for his own shitty behavior even when he is trying to paint himself as reasonable so the thing that would drive me crazy is if any extraneous noise from its generators carried i assume it isnt near the property at all and ten acres should mean when you are at the home you cant hear it but i would walk around and see how noticeable it is once you are in real quiet industrial sounds tend to stick out more unintended consequences post pandemic
