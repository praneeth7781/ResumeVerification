needs real sobriety not just white knuckling it then deciding he can have a few you need to really get enough distance to see how you are enabling him that his drunken outbursts are abuse yes but what i do is malapropism i just use the wrong word that sounds like the word i want there was a character in some 1700s comedy play mrs malaprop who was constantly mixing up words heres a video on it worse plan for four seasons jacket hoodie tshirt flip flops vendors i figure they fly through the air on bacteriahorses like little valkyries brandishing spears and shields post in the listing that it is to be rented unfurnished i would put that comment upfront some people search specifically for furnished rentals so while youd think it would be obvious its best to be clear my birthday was this past month and they made me a cake and threw me a really nice surprise party which ive never had before we also went to dinner which was also actually the first time ive had friends to go to dinner with for my birthday so heres the thing gossiping about someone instead of being direct with them is not cool but at the same time these people arent 100 horrible and dont hate you or they would not have made the cake and thrown you a surprise party you have quirks that frustrate and irritate them and they vent about you gossip behind your back not positive and not letting them off the hook but if they hated you theyd be icing you out never include you in anything and other behavior adhd can bring about a sensitivity to criticism sometimes people are bullies and are being really cruel other times they are just being average normal jerks who are immature and dont know how to fully communicate frustrations directly with someone my suggest sit with the hurt for a bit dont overplay what you heard in your head if you can help it when you are ready leave a note that youd like to have a pizza night with everyone get pizza and tell them something like the following i heard you guys talking the other night it really hurt id like to disclose something to you i have adhd its not an excuse for my behaviors but it is the reason when i make mistakes i am not intentionally trying to hurt anyone i had hoped we were all friends one thing that is helpful for me is direct communication if i am doing something that bothers you it really helps me to be told that in a kind way like hey op would you mind closing the cabinets when you are done and then i can try to improve as you know i am out at the end of this semester but id like to leave here on good terms good people will rise to the occasion with direct communication bad people will act fake or be put out you will at least get your answer you also will have taken responsibility for actions that annoy others while at the same time stood up for yourself that you deserve better communication its a really positive thing to do if that feels too overwhelming know you will be out soon and it is okay homemade saukraut yogurt this one crazy secret cure for adhd psychiatrists dont want you to know s lol no somewhat dependent in that if the inspection turns up a ton of issues needs roof foundation plumbing or electrical work then the house likely wont appraise by the lender for the selling price by waiving appraisal gap you are saying even if this home appraises for less and the bank wont give me the full loan i have cash in x amount to make up the gap but if you waive appraisal but do not waive inspection you have a builtin safety net negotiating tool and wont lose your earnest money say inspection turns up a ton of issues you have your inspection contingency in place and can tell the sellers either lower the price fix these things or im walking or their parents die young and leave them the house while the kids are still in their prime then the siblings can grow old together in some kind of grey gardens healthy dynamic not a helpful comment but if you are into fermentation pickling try making your own sauerkraut same as pickles just cabbage and water instead or yogurt super easy and much tastier than storebought just keep the pickles or sauerkraut away from the yogurt while they are fermenting apparently the two bacterias float around in the air during the process and the two camps of bacteria yogurt versus sauerkraut dislike each other you can keep your word but also alert your husband that his friend is having a hard time and encourage your husband to reach out to him more women emotionally abusing men is equal in the psychological damage it does when it is the reverse and can eventually become physical ask yourself if this friend was a woman would you feel more obligated to alert someone to get her help if so this one issue overrides the rule of keeping peoples secrets that is dont keep a secret when their lives are in danger personally i think this one comes out of the vault in order to get him real help he needs professional counseling and the strength to leave his wife and believes that because he made it then i can too so thats called a gross lack of empathy problematic amounts of solipsism the inability to view the world through the lens of what others may experience and instead view it solely on ones own experience and apply that to others there are any number of paths you can go down in terms of working without getting your degree or maybe one day if you feel ready going back parttime to get a degree etc but the bigger issue is being with someone who accepts you for who you are doesnt laugh at diagnosis and has the emotional capacity to support that sometimes when you come from childhood abuse your inner compass that points you towards what love and support are can get a little wonky getting help therapy for that can actually be the thing that leads you toward leaving toxic people which makes room for more external successes feeling ready to go back to school finding apprentice positions etc tldr edit dude sucks and hes bringing you down good luck i hope hes feeling better soon maybe others can chime in but go to an urgent care walk in clinic not the er and get it checked out not worth flying sick worstcase scenario and it ends up being something he has to go to the hospital for well he will end up with a bill in the us he may not be able to pay but as a uk citizen what are they going to do give him bad us credit yeah hes going to be unknowingly bringing fentanyl or meth back over the border its a turn of public opinion it happens with almost all things oversaturation lack of oversight housing crisis issues pandemic housing bubble sentiments change i bet if you look through the sub going back a few years the posts had a very different tenor i dont think airbnb is in its death throes but it may eventually get overtaken by a better platform for hosts and guests and people will jump ship usually takes a few years for that to happen your boyfriend is a sheisty little creep using his moral high ground to shame you into being submissive to him heres the thing its okay for him to not be comfortable with your sexual past the correct thing for him to do when you were both sharing that information early on is to let you know he wasnt comfortable and you two were incompatible then kindly break up instead he uses it as a manipulative tool ill stay with you but let you know occasionally that youre gross is not a healthy okay dynamic its totally possible you did miss something you were doing at the time or shes still as nutty now as she was when she was going through a divorce sometimes friendships also just outgrow their course its a really painful but not uncommon experience if you feel she still has the ongoing judgment of your relationship and unless you were previously the affair partner of your current spouse you did nothing ethically wrong then it sounds like it is not worth it or write her back your side of things tell her you are struggling to meet up when the premise is that you were hurtful to her by entering into a healthy marriage maybe she wants the friendship back but getting closure isnt a bad thing either mountain where hollywood sign can be hiked i expect this to be an all day event depending on what condition you are in the hike in griffith park all the way up to hollywood sign is a few hours not all day its worth it but while you are there you could drive after coming down from the sign and see some other parts of griffith park the observatory is great or head over to the autry museum avoid the zoo at all costs malls in la are not the most exciting you might as well drive out to rodeo drive window shop from a tourist perspective its unique to la and fun to recognize it from the movies for food do some googling ethiopian armenian mexican or thai makes more sense than jamaican not a lot of jamaican or pizza best chinese food would be getting dim sum way over in san gabriel valley and a schlep from the areas youve listed im sorry things feel really lonely right now and i get feeling so taken up by all the things that have to happen for big picture survival theres no time for the amount of energy it takes to make and keep social connections or maintain hobbies ive gone through long periods of dysthymia just mild longlasting blahs like not suicidal not dramatic not so depressed i cant go to work or do tasks i need to but meh one thing i try to do during those periods is look for little tiny pleasures and keep juggling the ability to find them and make them last a little longer each time it is an extra chore but a good chore daily walk even a short one bird watching stretching looking at art even if im not making it listen to a really great song try to be as present as i can for it again we are talking 15 minutes a day here just make sure before i go to bed at one point during the day i did some small thing that brought me a teeny tiny bit of joy and keep stringing that along until i can get back into hobbies or reconnect with people socially feel normal joy again ugh sorry i switched to blue shield covered california from anthem blue cross a bit like comparing rotten tomatoes to rotten apples but ive found blue shield incrementally better edit and the appointments i was finally able to make were all 68 weeks out it is bad out there ive stayed in many places and had a great time this owner has her son in law living out back and he made me uncomfortable by repeatedly trying to enter the home i was renting so i left the booking early the host was upset i found it unacceptable for a strange man who wasnt my host to enter my rental home without warning and has reviewed me poorly
