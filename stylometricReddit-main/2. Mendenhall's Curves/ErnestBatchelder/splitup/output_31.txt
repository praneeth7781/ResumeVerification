time id look at the potential rental income of both units versus the cost to build if you are thinking of selling it in the next year or two it isnt likely worth building an adu if you plan to rent it out for the next 710 years then it likely is and the last time i lived in an apartment was several years ago in undergrad worth reaching out to the property manager or landlord there and seeing if they have a record of you paying rent on time and leaving the place in ok condition so you can use them as a referral otherwise look for a room to rent initially in your new town and once youve worked for 6 months to a year you will have enough pay stubs to start looking for your own place plus a local reference you can see if anyone rents specifically to grad students if it is a college town that will get you a quieter type of home your bf isnt helping his friend hes being a white knight savior she needs clinical help which he cant provide thats great you set a reasonable and totally logical boundary down no she cannot live with both of you and that he complied but i dont really see this getting better as a whole unless he can come to terms with the part he plays in her addiction cycle codependent rescuer if he was a real friend hed be setting clear boundaries she needs longterm mental health care trauma therapy and addiction recovery likely in long term clean and sober living none of these he can actually provide she prefers going to him because it keeps someone in her life and allows her to continue making the crap choices that her addiction follows he likes her coming to him because being someones rock makes him feel good about himself ask him to attend alanon with you and see if he is willing its got issues but a lot of this kind of codependent bs cycles are addressed there you put down 20k in earnest money eeek your father is correct on this one and in a weird way so is your so you are not married he so is not contributing to the down payment he is not on the mortgage his loans do make him a liability for all intents purposes it is not his house so it makes sense his contribution should be viewed as rent and he should sign papers that he has no claim on the home edit in case of break up if you and your dad cant really make that work with him viewed solely as a tenant then youve bought too much house whispy willie thats something i wonder about the entirety of the maga cultist i am talking about the diehards that later got into qanon trumpism filled a social void in their lives especially the ones that used to travel around going to his rallies compulsively like the hateful dead for 65 and up its like the people who were completely lost after jerry garcia died ah i misunderstood that you are the tenant you are 100 in the right that is a shite fix and it will cause water damage down the road reword your email to sound professional you can still demand a proper fix and point out that you are paying market rent and have a right to expect market standards to be met in the apartment also point out the issues with longterm water damage and get what you want better if you first approach professionally escalate only after you get rebuffed dont come in swinging if you dont have one lined up get a proper property manager you mention in the comments you are out of state the other person who could go and check wont be back for a week you state he didnt return the keys but theres nobody there to see if the keys are there in an empty apartment if the place is truly clean or trashed does the previous lease state where the 30 days notice should go and was their a former contact he may have used if i just inherited a multiunit complex id want to get everyone on the same page know whats in all the leases plus avoid headaches thats too difficult to do out of state without a manager its weird but it is always so much easier to get a job when you have a job its like hiring committees are more invested in wooing those that would be harder to snag and hate actual availability you didnt ask for suggestions but a volunteer commitment once or twice a week outside of your home is helpful to regain that im a busy important person feeling that goes to help in interviews it also helps with the hopelessuseless feelings of unemployment and its also not a bad way to network a bit you mention wanting to change to a more communitybased field which means volunteering in something that is nearish to what interests you could really pay off i pay for takeout and groceries you pay for his meat products all groceries and you both split the cost of takeout hes got it made no wonder hes refusing to learn to cook simple meals it would mean hed next have to learn how to grocery shop and pay for his own food id go with an ultimatum any adult can watch youtube videos and learn how to prepare a few simple meals also stop making him special meat stuff he can go figure out the primal esoteric knowledge of meat hot coalsfire food plus you have good food haha thats my other joke that im coldblooded and need to sit on a sunny rock to recharge like a lizard i hate to tell you but your best bet as an israeli is getting through service getting a topnotch engineering or tech degree and getting out via a work visa otherwise it is likely a ton of and trying to go to college elsewhere but i have no clue what the illegalities are of leaving before serving isnt there a pacifist clause where you can do your military time in the idf in the kitchen or nonactive service i found some relief when i got really really into lighting in general turns out halogen bulbs and fluorescents what a lot of the older models of sun lamps were made from come with whats called higher cri they duplicate color that noon sun would show better leds just have this weird synthetic feel to me i know delicate snowflake that i am dark houses with old lighting are my bane i built a bunch of lights using halogen bulbs currently no longer available in the us but i bought a bunch on ebay and flooded my home with light yes that helped a great bit the sit in front of this light box for 1020 minutes every morning and youll feel better solution never worked for me not saying they dont work just not in my case as others mentioned also getting your vit d levels checked and taking a vit d supplement can also help with the depression who knows if this is placebo but iron and b12 also helped me a bit too as i run anemic i still say nothing hits like sitting in a room filled with natural sunlight nothing want to do tradesies i kid sort of grass always greener higher wages come with their own issues especially in higher costofliving areas where the work expectations are also intense i want it now and i want it done right is great when you are on the receiving end but sucks when you have adhd and are meant to be delivering it i can do it right or i can do it now but i cant do both first off you are alive they are alive and cars are replaceable thats all actually very good stuff i have developed over years of dissociative tendencies to form what i call life or death mindfulness do i suck in general at the concept of mindfulness yes do i hate meditation and other techniques mindfulness proponents swear are the secret keys to a better life sure do but life or death mindfulness goes like this is my current action capable of major injury to life or limb for me or someone else if yes hey brain this action is all that matters right now cooking or any flammable task driving carrying a knife climbing ladders even walking down steep stairs or hiking rickety areas i can remind myself now that i do have to be present for this action if not for me then for others i still have accidents every so many years especially when i fall out of the practice usually prior to those accidents i can look back and note there was an increase in dissociating or high levels of stress so this is in no way a guaranteed process its an improvement only those accidents however set me up to be better for the next several years after one car accident and a few broken bones have gotten me to stay relatively alive not killing anyone else for several decades on earth i used to teach english i will die on the hill that local dialects are just as good as formal english for communicating if not better because they add life nuance to language now for writing in formal settings it is always to the advantage of someone to learn basic grammar plus acceptable language and writing skills mainly because the world is filled with snobs like your girlfriend who will judge the crap out of you doesnt mean they are right just because there are many of them anyhoo you deserve to be with someone who sees you as worthy for your personal qualities not classist ideals i would bring it up she should know this hurts you and it is disrespectful to be badmouthing you to others or act ashamed of a partner badmouthing is very different than venting going from a year lease to monthtomonth is common it makes your life somewhat easier ifwhen you want to move as for the landlord considering selling it is not rude the next time you interact to ask him or her if they are looking to sell in the near future they only owe you a certain number of days notice 30 or 60 but its not offensive to casually inquire if they know what their longterm plans for the place are i have always joked i have an oldschool camera aperture in my brain that is constantly seeking more light dark homes dark climates i get severe sad and am less productive ive bought the sun lamps taken vit d but nothing works like actual exposure to real sunlight one day i hope to move to the mediterranean will i be more productive i doubt it but my daily mood will be fantastic i dont know why people are reading adhd into it in it he specifically says she was diagnosed at one point in childhood with autism he uses the word aspergers and depressed since childhood but never addressed it she doesnt speak with her family its pretty easy to presume chaotic or traumatic childhood autism since thats the given diagnosis and lifelong depression from both of those sure she can have both but the post indicates a severely depressed person to me with possible autism more than adhd we have no idea whats really going on in anyones marriage if shes refusing therapy then thats one thing if no one has ever tried to get her help including him thats a totally different thing the term weaponized incompetence hurts when you are genuinely doing everything in your damn power to
