if 3060 days wasnt what happened in a normal market anyway if underpriced in a decent area still getting a bidding war moving more sales do seem to drop out of escrow but overall i think ca has some new normals baked in we arent ever going back to 2019 minus a major global financial catastrophe and even then theyll go back up within a few years i lived in la for too many years that i couldnt bring myself to pay 12 for a flipped bungalow in glassell park i refuse to buy a 800k condo with high hoa fees that dont do much so my time there is done la in the height of the frenzy i saw a burnedout husk of a home literal fire damage go for 12 in south pas if the location is in a good school district they wont mind raising their asthmatic kid near a freeway flipper is going to gut and put it back on for 12 so unless you are on the deed it is not your house what you do next is up to you make a financial agreement to pay rent that is more equivalent to your financial situation instead of half you pay less if you do not earn equal amounts stop funding repairs projects hes your landlord or discuss with him that you want to own a home and need to start living your life in such a way that you can save your own money to do so or discuss with him if you two plan to get married and does it become joint property then or stay in his name only time to lay cards on the table youll either reach a decision you are both happy with in the house and your relationship or you will realize you arent on the same page but never enter into next phase of relationship steps without full honest conversations about financials i worded it poorly heres the quote from the cdc oral herpes caused by hsv1 can spread from the mouth to the genitals through oral sex this is why some cases of genital herpes are due to hsv1 so theres never a lot of training for teaching college except doing it on the fly in grad school when i first started i learned and made a lot of mistakes along the way one thing that helped me is there are a ton of books on teaching college per certain subjects i ended up buying a bunch online lots on the theory of pedagogy not as helpful and some with practical assignments how to organize yourself etc etc it also really helps to make friends with some people who have more experience than you and ask for mentorship plus sit in on others classes also 15 of teaching is having some decent confidence and stage presence unfortunately that makes students stay engaged fake it until you make it they probably wont let you go and if thats the case pick yourself up know that beginning teachers make mistakes and go find yourself some resources edit also look for some resources for the depression that will help a lot too i worded this poorly and am being downvoted so let me quote cdc oral herpes caused by hsv1 can spread from the mouth to the genitals through oral sex this is why some cases of genital herpes are due to hsv1 the most likely answer is he gave it to you talk to a gynecologist yeah i listen to way too many cult podcasts heard one on synanon and then would hear guests on other podcasts referencing their experiences at troubled teen schools again some still very much in existence and realized a lot of them seem founded on the same gross ineffective destructive methodologies poor kids did not know that fun fact though took me years to learn there are two types of people i interact with on a more personal bossesfriendsfamily level those that get frustrated angry or upset with me those that are really very patient and kind took me a few more years to realize the first type made me nervous to the point i was more likely to make mistakes around them drop and break things forget things interrupt them resulting in them getting angry whereas while i still made errors with the second group it wasnt really ever that big of a deal and lo and behold i made less of those types of errors around them because i wasnt goddamn walking on eggshells then i also started realizing half the time the first group was irritated or blowing up it was usually way above the pay grade for the mistake i made ie i didnt actively hurt them or do something cruel or unkind interrupting someone breaking something or forgetting something isnt really a good enough reason to yell at someone really there are no good reasons to yell at people imo tldr years of therapy helped me realize i tolerated abuse stemming from feeling inadequate due to adhd my upbringing and it helped me either institute boundaries or really drop most of that first group out of my life there are still schools like this in the us that are open although they may not be as severe the fight club bs comes from a cult in southern california in the 1970s that started as a way of helping junkies called the church of synanon run by a narcissistic leader the philosophy was a control method where theyd put a member on the hot seat and the group would yell all the horrible things they saw in the person to break their ego supposedly somehow even after synanon was shut down this idea moved into the troubled teen moneygrab system that was bigger in the 90s and 00s but is still around today same thing with policing anything the kids say to the parents just horrifying forprofit crap that destroys kids according to battlestar galactica abusing toasters is how we end up nuking earth low information diet dont discuss your job with her you cant get her to stop judging you cant create an argument that will win her over and the job is important to you both financially and it seems you like it shes going to always be negative about it so keep it to yourself and find other things you both share to discuss instead if she ever brings it up first tell her it isnt worth discussing since it upsets her and youd like to avoid that sometimes you just have to accept someone wont be happy for you and is too attached to their own ideas to let it go for one person sucks but it is the way it is and is especially with crunchy granola moms edit saw your replies below get some therapy if you havent already you are stuck in a cycle of being mad at people who hurt you while also probably still looking for their approval its never going to happen you can only change yourself and your reactions ha my first job in the bay area was at a local bakery where i made sandwiches handled deli slicers equipment and ovens i have fond memories of it but it was the late 80s so child exploitation was considered more runofthemill and i did always get my paycheck no because the longer he spent with roman the more chances of roman just doing something atrocious to him he was too precious to be destroyed by the roy family curse its a bit of a chicken and the egg situation is his complete lack of responsibility allowing him to avoid social situations and stay in a comfortable depression or does his depression prevent him from pursuing any responsibilities that would make him feel better hed probably do well to get counseling and medication you cant force that on him but you can begin to start the conversation he may also benefit from some career counseling testing to find out what hed be good at or consider certification at a local community college but all that is something that happens after a bit of therapy and potential medication so there are some coping skills put into place btw a lot of people entered reclusive states during the pandemic and never fully came back out of them its not uncommon but given hes lived a sheltered life while alive your parents may have enabled him hes really lacking life skills by inheriting the home you also inherited their problem you dont have to enable him but you can only tell him if the current situation is to work out longer term between you two you need to see him get help for social anxiety andor depression then start helping himself more if hes completely resistant then let him know maybe it is best to sell the house and split the proceeds without any life skills hell likely blow through his in a certain amount of time youll have to decide how much you want to help him in this life yeah a oneyear 13 drop when the peak was 30 increase over 2 year period is not that substantial of a drop it also seems very location condition specific while it is great people arent snatching up 900k11 mil teardowns like crazy people anymore any decent house in a decent location is still going to sell for over asking the only thing that will bring about an actual crash would be a real longerlasting recession longer period of higher mortgage rates even then house prices may stabilize at 2019 levels which were still fairly high i did the uk one via my mother laws changed for those born before a certain year to go back and include mothers just required gathering documents birth certificates forms and paying fees then swearing allegiance to the queen now the king i suppose at an embassy the last part is weird because they dont make naturalized citizens do that but small hoop to jump through after that i got a passport via more forms id be more inclined to find a lawyer or dual cpa to help with tax laws after emigrating but the citizenship part wasnt hard although i did it about 15 years ago so brexit may have complicated things but also the uk has gotten a better online system for bureaucracy since then id hit up the nearest embassies andor consulates with questions prior to going straight to lawyers op youve been just as selfish by taking items that were included in a sale you messed up on a contract deal get over yourself and fix it uh you removed several fixtures the dog did do damage the bathroom mirror one seems especially sneaky since you replaced it that is the kind of thing some shady sellers do with appliances sell with nice ones installed then switch them to cheaper ones id offer 1500 2000 and get this over with your realtor should have told you to leave everything that was bolted to the walls in place or if you wanted to take them you needed to put that in the contract your realtor absolutely should have advised you not to let people move in before funds were released either edit looking at your replies i highly suggest taking some time to breathe through this and stop making this personal fork over a little bit of money lesson learned move on you are seeing something as a personal attack when it is a business mistake on your end and your realtors i am actually prolandlords and believe it is a necessary service am looking to take over a family rental to become one but then i read posts like this and think damn tossing out good tenants youve had for years because you feel you arent making enough well at least i
