all pertinent content moved over to the my subaru app but i wish i didnt have to look at the greyedout icon in the car following to find out if theres a solution do not surgically alter yourself for someone youve known for 9 months honestly id say see ya because now i know how he feels by your 40s its time to be with other people who understand we age can still be into you not seeking out bikini models only ever get elective surgery if theres something thats bothered you never to appease someone elses standards you are going to get your bonsai some friends i know plenty of guys who are very liberalleaning nontoxic and into several of your hobbies id be pretty pissed off if the person i was in a relationship with judged me on my interests not my behaviors while there is nothing wrong with two people leading separate hobby lives plenty of couples who have separate interests the judgment on her part is not cool eh instant oats still have tons of fiber same nutritional value as regular oats even processed there only bad when you buy them with flavors and theres added corn syrup and sugars doable is better than perfect especially when it comes to trying to get breakfast done american teeth have gotten eerily white to the point of glowing but thats really only a thing since the 2000s weve been more obsessed with orthodonture and straight teeth though for the past 50 years divorce attorney can sue bears for spousal support how come it is always just the momma bear out there with the cubs dont bother explaining things that fall on deaf ears arent worth the emotional energy it takes it sucks when your own family chooses to believe the worst in you im guessing this is a lifelong pattern but when they do call you lazy if you can learn to control your reaction dont get defensive seek empathy or counterpoint they may move away from it some of it is the routine a family has where they decide on the role of one family member the messy one or the lazy one then pick on them getting a reaction is part of what keeps them doing it when you are without meds just say you are feeling under the weather or have a cold starting and leave it at that it sucks and i hope you do have supportive people in your life or a way to get some space from it it can be a very cultural attitude if you can and online dating makes it sort of possible try pursuing dating with the intention of learning call it practice dating ie dont approach every date like this is the one and im going to screw it up from lack of knowing how to do this but think what can i learn from this experience if goes badly what can you try differently the next time learn to get a thick skin people are choosing and not choosing each other all the time and get out there probably with everything in your life especially things like jobs or work you had a learning curve is your learning curve on love a bit behind others sure but the only way you will catch up is if you start somewhere so the worse thing in your breakfast imo is the kraft peanut butter it has trans fat hydrogenated oil included exchange that for a health food peanut butter thats just crushed peanuts with no added oils or corn syrup and it looks good to me esp if it keeps you full for the entire morning a little tablespoon of chocolate chips isnt terrible and they are good energy in the morning the peanut butter if healthier would be great longlasting protein and fat and oats are great fiber if he cheated and only him wants the divorce then it is perfectly possible you are owed by him to pay for your lawyer majority of lawyers will do a free initial consult get your ducks in a row asap and start consulting with attorneys find out if they can initiate he pays your fees no dragging feet on this or asking him to work with you do not tell him he isnt supportive no matter what he seems he cheated and wants you now gone take care of your own interests haha as a californian dealing with the changes in the past few decades here i have a very old grumpy irish relative in dublin and his complaint is that dublin isnt dublin anymore i think he mainly bemoans affordability nothing is what it once was just got to go to someplace that feels good enough for now i had them years ago once in echo park right outside my bedroom in a jacaranda tree then a different group i think years later liked some berry tree i had in my backyard in altadena that particular group were a bunch of seasonal regulars theyd nail my car every time with berry poop i can never look at solopet parrots the same i know they love their owners and all but in a party pack those guys are estatic yelling and laughing and screaming at each other i dont know what they are communicating but they dont stop authenticity without trauma dumping is very freeing and very attractive to the right person if this went nowhere then you know he wasnt the right person dating is a process of weeding out the people who arent going to work you currently have no idea why you were rejected sucks but it could be anything from he was already interested in someone else more isnt in a committing place total flake got hit by a car pick yourself up and go back out there there will be a lot of misses but that means you need a lot of swings only one real hit sorry i am not a baseball person so maybe that metaphor doesnt work thats how i got 3000 off not a wilderness but the caveat was the better price didnt show up in any aggregate website searches like cars or autotrader it showed up when i went to their dealership website and clicked online price it showed they were doing a deal on all outbacks in stock then i could take that to a closer place and negotiate a match i temporarily live in a hcol bubble right now so i did a dealership search about 100 miles out to mcollcol areas and got the better price from there i just got 3000 off msrp on a 2023 subaru touring xt not the newer wilderness but i think its very area dependent in most cases doesnt hurt to ask if you can find a dealership farther out from where you ar with some negotiation room then take that to a closer dealership sometimes theyll match gotcha i still say be careful of duplicating the realistic repetitive nature of patients notes because if it gets overly repetitive the reader who isnt a clinician will start to want to skim that section making it filler if the patients notes can occasionally be repetitive only where that informs the reader say highlights the difference in the journal experience while also adding information and moving things along it works well thats just my opinion ah i left the area a year ago when it was still sleepy honestly though good for them it deserves to make it hopefully it will die down into a steady stream i think its a twofer people often have some sort of freeze reaction in the moment when shocked so it seems like they are acquiescent even though someone by their goddamn 30s should understand consent porn consumption the internet has culturally shifted expectations and normalized a lot of behavior that actually deserves clear consent first i think all porn sites should be regulated to have a mandatory 1 minute or so public service announcement on what safe consent is but it will never happen will not sell housecars for the foreseeable future he needs to x200b multiple credit card debts around 10k not my personal usage my parents used it in my name going to need that paid off not to be brutal but if your father chooses to drop the ball on those payments you will live with the consequences for decades you are already working 3 jobs you will need to advocate for yourself i am really sorry for your loss it also sounds like you are being put in the drivers seat here and i wish you good luck because thats a lot car artisan chocolate manufactory cafe cant speak to plugs or wifi but the owner is an incredibly nice guy and the coffee pastries are amazing id bet hed be fine if you asked if it was a good place to work for a few hours even though it doesnt really have that vibe per say i had seen people working there before and it never felt crowded any time i went just not sure if it is a place to park 3 hours either edit hadnt been in over year since i left pasadena but apparently it is now a really busy place the croissants are now recognized for what they are amazing just because patients notes in real life tend to be repetitive if you are going to use this as a plot structure make sure any repetitiveness exists only in purpose to the story try to limit it or it would be somewhat a drag to read without any other kind of break or plot movement character development i could see it working really well if the main character is the patient but we get more insight into them from also interspersing the doctors lived experience one chapter of doctors pov in service of the main character interspersed with patients notes interesting concept i lived in new orleans for almost 4 years for schoolwork and hated much of it due to failing housing roaches the size of small babies sorry palmettos mosquitoes some southern attitudes loud drunks neighborhood shootings and an element of constant chaos thats just not my thing but you could be walking down a street of little colorful shotgun houses at dusk while the cicada started and everything smelled like nightblooming jasmine sorry confederate jasmine eye roll people would walk by and always say how you doing and it was a beautiful place despite much of the rot i assume these were her normal social media posts not some porn site photos in which case he violated your trust and he violated a normal boundary with her total twofer of ick behavior no advice other than obviously needs a long conversation about whats acceptable take whatever time you need to make sure you feel better about it my feeling has always been that we as humans cant always control our thoughts theres no shame in that but we have the power to control our actions related to her living situation and how she was worried if her dad passed away that she wouldnt have a place to live i feel lied to i think it is fair to wait until you see her in person and tell her something like i am so glad you are doing better i understand you have trust issues that amplified your anxiety and i think we can both agree i have tried very hard to be supportive the fact that you made up detailed lies about living with your dad and fakeworried about his death is a breach of trust for me i am not hurt that you didnt disclose where you are living but i am deeply hurt that you actively lied to me or something like that without a sincere apology and understanding of how violating
