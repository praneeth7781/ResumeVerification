be in crazy town but a moderately acceptable version of crazy town warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info the people stating ignore them i tend to disagree its the dog shit theory of coping if theres a neighborhood dog whose owner lets them poop right in the middle of your front yard and you leave it there ignore it all you get is more dog owners letting their dogs poop next to it your best bet is a large peaceful counterprotest next time lots of people who come out to equally display their right to freedom of speech in a happy fun way you can absolutely rid your town of nazis by overwhelming them with a large pleasant antinazi rally were talking w baked goods and music these little groups go away from areas that push back but intimidate in numbers not aggressive behaviors the next worse thing after the ignore method however is to have a small volatile counterprotest that acts antagonistic or allows for fights to break out that tends to give them what they really really want attention and victim status herpes is a disclosebeforesex thing but if this was your first time having sex together then it sounds like you were both getting into it to the point of no protection no discussion so you have some culpability here in not being responsible either then again the fact that she didnt disclose after until you brought an issue up is nooooot great cant say what to do in this situation but now you have a wonderful experience to remind you that 1 always use protection until a longer discussion on birth control exclusivity and stds has happened 2 always have a talk prior to sex the first time birth control expectations stds etc you are in your 30s well time enough to be an adult about this kind of stuff self esteem letting your children feel good about what they can do not completely praising for every poop they make but valuing them as capable little individuals i was great at art as a kid and all i heard was how i was good at it but cant make a living that way insert later money issues and charging my worth to overcome let children explore talents they enjoy without bringing up careers to begin with does your kid love trains let them explore that in childhood without talking about how they will become civil engineers allowing them some facets of agency in their lives they can say no or negotiate reasonably around expectations again not handing them total control of their lives but incremental and developmentally appropriate attempts at independence and allowing them to fail or succeed on their own as they get older open door policy they can always come talk to you about something or someone who is bothering them without fear of being punished or getting in trouble i think there is a concept of good enough parenting youll mess up on a lot of stuff but theres a foundation of trust between the parent and child versus gen x abandoned to figure the world on our own millenial helicopter parenting until they couldnt do anything for themselves something in between those two extremes im an overwriter i can communicate faster in writingtyping than speech and god i love a tangent heres where modern technology actually serves 1 you dont have to answer that text or email right away you just need to remember it needs a response 2 you can take a beat or even 12 hours to think about your response 3 you can write a wordvomit response that covers way too many details and exited little side stories 4 then editing magic 5 you can write a wordvomit response that covers way to many details and exited little side stories the main hurdle is impulse control learning to sit with what you want to say over time i have learned who i can word vomit on and they wont mind so i have some outlet and how to cultivate more professional interactions with the more i edit writing for texts or emails prior to sending the more i also internalize how to edit while composing its a process i dont know what to do if you live in their home and are of age move out none of this is your problem to solve get some therapy because having a mother who is trying to poison your father is not a normal family upbringing he got mad at me started rolling his eyes and eventually slammed the door on me he made me set up the camera for him a few times cause he guilted and threatened me into doing it seriously get some real distance from your family neither of your parents are okay people none of this mess is yours to fix the main reason i lean towards new cars right now is the savings on used is no longer great enough to feel like they are a deal used costs too much imo cpo are usually a safe bet but those are also the ones that really are priced the highest if i wanted used id look on auto trader then take it to a dealership to get checked prior to buying with new you always run a small risk of some lemon issued from the factory state of affairs in almost all car lines now with used even cpo you run the risk that someone drove it really hard during the first few thousand miles you do get the assurance now of seeing that someone got oil changes in at least since those are recorded best used option are fleet cars with under 10000 on them that way if someone was a bad driver they only had it for a day or two i did find one or two of those in my area but spent the extra for new in the end not sure wilderness end up in fleet car sales though how big of chips there are colormatch epoxies made to fill in chips professional companies can do resurface fixes if the chips are dimesized or less i would look into a fix before going through a full replacement and charge accordingly for that wear gloves and a mask or respirator when exposed to a ton of mouse poop and urine and moving it around in any way sweeping i know you were not expecting a cabinet of poop but that is the exact scenario of how you get hantavirus old sealedup mouse or rat droppings urine are suddenly disturbed or moved by being swept up and it is released into the air yes tell the landlord immediately they should do the proper thing and have the home recleaned and all openings under the building and in the attic sealed along with proper extermination i am kind of guessing they did have an infestation and maybe had an exterminator out there but did not properly clean the last tenants unit there should still be a check of your place that no small openings exist in those cabinets for mice they can squeeze through a hole 14 inch in size good luck so lovely damn i am impressed i was thinking howd they get a giant compass but you made your own it did work out well all of it is great howd you get the circle marked out so neatly talk to your landlord about the shed because thats your property in there let the neighbor broach the landlord about the fence yes those are things that should be fixed talk to your therapist or go back to therapy find some tools for anxious thinking cbt to test out validity of thoughts breathing calming techniques thinking about an abusive expartner still getting the remnants of toxicity out of your life is a process finding someone new you like is part of the process of healing sometimes before we are about to get really better there is a natural pull to backslide the long and the short of it is you can ask someone for exclusivity and still end up breaking up with them or deciding you werent really ready for more but you are here now so why not stay more in the moment of what you are doing and less in the past or potential problematic future the money thing is neither here nor there unless you make is something that just sounds like excuses edit to add the religious thing isnt really a red flag since shes moving past that you are making it one because your ex had a similar background red flags are behaviors like your ex manipulation putting you down being emotionally volatile the shitty thing with ptsd is we become avoidant and the only way to get through ptsd is to stop avoiding the thing that scares you safely with support but to still face it i long for something new well el salvador will certainly be different for you i would think costa rica chile argentina or mexico would all offer a higher quality of life than making your first choice el salvador but now i cant look at them with anything but disgust thats an extreme reaction look you are 17 i get it and you have a right to your feelings you get to feel however you feel how you act on those feelings however is what makes for emotional maturity falling for a friend happens theres nothing disingenuous or sneaky plotting about it we usually want to be friends with people we are attracted to not necessarily sexually attracted but who have characteristics or personalities we like try doing a thought experiment if you slowly over time fell for a friend of yours how would you want them to respond to you if it is not reciprocated id just let them know the feeling isnt mutual in the nicest way possible take a little break from your group and when you are feeling less ick show back up like nothing happened therapy you have childhood neglect issues financial and emotional enmeshment and you need to learn how to have healthy boundaries with someone who doesnt want that for you its doable but it takes a lot of work you dont mention your ages but you are probably in your early 20s young enough now to realize that what your mom wants to likely always live with you and depend on you may not be what you want for yourself you cannot change her but you can learn in time to change your reactions in order to handle her let me put it a different way if your dad died when you were 6 you may have often felt like you had to take care of your mom you dont thats not your job your mom can handle what she needs to handle even if this hurts her thats totally fair most people who end up in southern california from the uk are delighted with the weather change alone i spent my childhood in parts of england and i want a change now have a uk passport so its my easiest path trying to decide if i can go back to the rain though i cannot get myself to ask him to stop following me time to learn a new skill how to communicate with someone firmly and still kindly that they are out stop doing projects with him he is eligible for accommodations from his professors he can use tutoring centers request more time from the professors not you get copies of notes but hes not your personal burden you can have adhd and also be a jerk or just too immature and not ready yet for collegelevel work etc he has probably decided that since
