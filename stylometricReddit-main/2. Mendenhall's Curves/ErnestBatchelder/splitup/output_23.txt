his apartment first thing thats a person testing boundaries no one should be meeting internet strangers in their homes for the first time unless both parties are explicitly looking for hookups and have stated so outright if someone is testing boundaries right out the gate they arent going to improve over time 4 someone who is an untrustworthy stranger tells you that you give them ick dont ask them why dont take it any further with them trust the opinions of people who care about you not randos the proper response to that is telling them to go fuck themselves for being rude and leaving tldr never let a rando rate your selfworth next time get a quote bid from someone on what the costs to fix would be and then try to get the seller to come down by that amount then youd also know the scope of the work how long it will take to fix etc what youve never seen a production of the doughnut hole of being earnest it was a larger rule of thumb that prethis current bubble tended to be true now its really dependent on a ton of things heres a decent calculator and overview rentvsbuycalculator the only hard and fast rule that is still true is the best time to buy was 10 years ago sadly i dont know im not buying everything oop is selling in this post its constructed in such a way that she is such a blatant victim and the bad people are sooo so bad some of it reads like fantasy early on she writes i never had a doubt in my mind that i would not be alone in this world as long as i have him thats a pretty toxic idea of motherhood in and of itself you dont have kids so youll never be alone they arent little emotional support animals maybe im reading too much into it just assuming the dad was a master manipulator and oop may have dumped a lot on the sons head during the divorce doesnt make the son a good person but he sounds more to me like the product of a completely effed up environment by both parents depends on the costs of buying versus renting look at the monthly costs not the lump sum of the houseprice also depends on the rental market in the area you want to retire in it also really depends on what your longterm picture of retirement looks like to you are you planning on traveling a ton and eventually moving to a retirement community or do you want to focus on homebased projects in retirement gardening woodwork etc do you have kids and want to leave them the equity in the home one thing to consider is as you age moving gets exponentially more difficult for many people when you rent you are always at risk of a landlord selling a property look at is 55 communities if there are any near you in my state they are subsidized you buy the home pay the hoa but the homes are usually below market value when you go to sell they are capped on how high they can increase if i were going to travel a ton and was 55 or older thats where id look you get a house no one can take from you but less hassle than regular home ownership grounds maintained usually have a staff repair guy builtin community but privacy crepuscular is in between nocturnal and diurnal animals who become active at dusk but also dawn and dont stay awake all night but also take naps during the day ive never heard it used to describe sunlight its crusty having an attraction to someone is not really something anyone can control but she could control her actions and behaviors and she didnt also how is 18 any better really in this situation or even 20 the young woman is still really young in a professional situation where she had to be friendly and your wife was overtexting her and stalking her and showing her picture to coworkers even if she never overtly flirted or hit on the girl she took it far in her head if she was a guy wed all say she was grooming emma your wife has impulse control issues while she may not be a predator ahe showed predatory behavior no advice just your instinct to be put off is right i believe i am crepuscular grillmaster im going to get downvoted probably but 20 years ago sf wasnt the bestrun city even then it had swaths of wealth and old money butting up against really intense poverty but there was also a middleclass contingent then that lived and existed there in between tons of small businesses could exist and add to different neighborhoods it wasnt really a la or ny large important city in any way it was pretty over the past 20 years tech money badly run politics have done nothing to improve the city most of the middle class is gone small businesses cant last poverty up and incredibly bad solutions put forth but a tech ruling class for decades of ted talks about making the world a better place are just as shitty as the political ineffectuality and equally responsible for gutting a healthy middle class growing a poverty class well this sucks i feel so badly for the children in this situation because daddys a nutjob and mom is about to parrot his beliefs in order to hold things together so they dont have a snowballs chance in hell of a normal childhood you can have the boundary that you dont want him in your life abandonment and neglect are abuse and forcing inane ideas on children is bad however you are correct that you may completely lose your sister id reach out to her and tell her how you feel say you want to keep the connection between her and your nieces nephew open and be there for them but you do not want to see bruce ask her to work with you on this maybe you can set up a monthly visit between you her and the kids but let her know you cant stand to be around him after what he did no he wont have to walk out again because now he has the threat to hold over his wife op is right the wife will move closer to her husbands crazy positions in the future and accept the next layer of crazy that comes along in order to keep the family together doesnt mean op has to be around to witness it in altadena several years ago people began tying them to this tree at the beginning of the trailhead when there were garbage cans nearby it was just awful to see this poor disgusting poop tree humanity really is a bag of turds sometimes you are going to be losing a 22 mortgage rate so look at what your monthly will be on the new house at a 7 rate unless you find an arms 71 that starts at 5 lower property taxes wont mean much when youre monthly payments can go up significantly you dont say how long youve been in the new house but less than 5 years and you are also eating the closing costs on that place you can put in an offer with a home sale contingency offer is based on you selling your new home they may accept it but look at the current comps where you are have house sales slowed down even if the price hasnt things arent moving in a week anymore unless you are in the ne so the contingency may mean if your home doesnt sell within x amount of time the sale falls through mostly what strikes me is 1 you havent even seen the house yet 2 you want to do this partially for your wealthy parents so they have an inlaw on your property youd be screwing up your own finances to find a property to help them then i would pause button this whole thing work on your current home and make it something you like more despite the area have a discussion with your husband first and your parents second if you are all really that close and your husband is comfortable with the idea as well then maybe in a few years after youve been at your current home for 5 years they help with the purchase of a larger property so they can have the inlaw i hate my first home it is a thing that happens the best thing you can do is learn from that process and not rush back out and make similar mistakes im glad you got that moment of closure if it had a funky smell then that would be a no from me new carpets flooring can offgas but offgassing is a much different smell than funky its usually like scented chemicals funky implies rotted bo with an earthiness which makes me think exploded body rot a new carpet flooring rolled out over subflooring that wasnt replaced so it still has bodyrotjuice in it nooooope if they wanted to sell they should have industrialozone treated the whole place first my fear with funky smells is that in heat or summer or damp they just get funkier it was also a this american life episode about a guy whose job it was to go into homes and clean up after dead bodies honestly think cops should be required to complete a 2 year associates degree from community college before being allowed to enroll in the police academy if anything it would weed out a lot of lazier contenders for the salary and the responsibility there should be a few more hoops to jump through they can take some classes in social work community building deescalation how to talk to the public who pay their salaries etc basically any issues currently in their current training most firefighters if they want to rise up in their careers need a fire science either 2 year or 4 year degree not required but to get to captain or other positions its really needed you are probably out of luck legally because it seems like a grey area could fall under emergency maintenance besides that what are you going to do anyway sue over them entering to replace a fire alarm i agree though that it is an ineffectual inconvenient way for them to handle it id try one more tactic with your landlord let them know politely that in order to not disturb your working hours would the landlord please allow you to contact the outside company to directly so you can request from them a days alert before they are arriving in order to adjust your work schedule you can also let them know that you are concerned about reasonable privacy workers entering your unit without warning while you may be indisposed ask if they will have keys or be alerting tenants to their arrival la is pretty much city to city so while santa monica is starting to be proactive plenty of other parts of the county arent im interested to see if in a year or two there is any significant decline of airbnbs or not in the areas where ordinances have passed they are cheap have been for decades if that were the case it would have happened they are left as part of a golden visa program which grants citizenship if they are redeveloped there is still a part of the golden visa that says if you buy and renovate a neglected building in lisbon portos etc its a path to citizenship i have no idea how it plays into short term rentals but they can be rented out as long term rentals part of the issue
