you will ultimately pick up the slack every time he isnt going to find the help he needs to actually accomplish work tell him straight up that you can be his friend but can no longer work with him on group projects and that he needs to go to the office of students with disabilities and sort himself out with the state of the uk and the way things are goingi want something better for myself i say this as someone considering going to the uk from california for a variety of reasons and i love it here but if your issue is a highly divided political culture underfunding for the nhs medical care and pay the uk is likely a hair better than it is here california is dealing also with high costs of housing high homelessness which has a lot to do with underserved mental health addiction issues and a worsening fire season we also have more gun incidents than the uk to practice in ca you would need to get licensing will vary from state to state you want to practice in and may have to do whats called clinical hours work under supervision for less pay thought experiment you stay with him and eventually have a kid your child is diagnosed with adhd in school kid is struggling in class he sits your child down and tells them what hes said to you in that text how do you feel because id be angry what the fuck is wrong with people rhetorical question no one can tell you how you feel about this only you can decide probably the best thing you can do for yourself right now is separate and get into your own therapy to process the grief and get enough emotional distance to see the whole thing clearly i had that really intensely especially around dating and used to think that reaction was rsd but i am no longer so sure i had some terrible bullying growing up often by friends and pretty severe attachment issues from emotionally unpredictable parenting i did a lot of work in therapy on attachment issues and selfadvocating being clear in expressing needs and have found that those triggers are not hit as much now im also a lot more choosey however in who i let in i think it helped me to see the sort of people i gravitated towards giving a lot of myself were the kind who did let me down so being less involved in that helped im not saying rsd wasnt part of my issue just that i question if it stemmed in a biological way from adhd or an environmental way from old relationship patterns caused by adhd if that makes any sense it only matters for the reasons of how best to lessen it as a rule i think teasing or sarcasm toward others only works when it is a joke about someone that everyone knows is absolutely not true in any way so its ridiculous to suggest and everyone can laugh punching down aka making fun of someone struggling and laughing about something they are truly struggling with is not funny because there are so many hidden things you may struggle with as someone with adhd its a lot more likely that friendly banter is going to hit a sore spot so they may not intent to be teasing in a bad way but they are ask them kindly to stop and let them know it actually hurts friends will respect that if they dont not a friend well you see his depression will be cured if she acts like a housekeeperbarbierobotfuckmaid for 28 days he says that he needs my softer support and encouragement to get out of this and back to himself oh bullshit he can go to therapy and learn the root causes for his issues not have you as a cuddly submissive caretaker cooking cleaning and buying a grown man groceries what hes asking for isnt interesting it sounds like a total mind fuck to me what are you going to do praise him for sitting home all day while you cook dinner cuddle him and help him care for his home welcome to bangmaiddom to be honest its not my job to uphold your boundaries its on you it is not a partners job to uphold your boundaries but it is their job to respect them he doesnt hes also coercive manipulating you x200b i dont feel comfortable with him sexually currently listen to that your lack of comfort is important valid and you get to respect that even if he doesnt look him closely in the face you have blackheads on your nose just a factual observation time but gosh i think youre handsome clogged pores and all next time his shirt is off wow your back is really hairy and it forms a weird pattern just sharing a factual observation lets snuggle now no one should actually continue any behavior with you after you tell them it hurts you the simple fact that youve said this hurts me and he wants to continue the behavior then tell you that you are the one whose wrong for being hurt is a deep lack of empathy a selfaggrandized nature la gives and la takes i feel like i should tell her this once i confirm a diagnosis with my therapist nope no no no you should not you should respect the request to leave her alone something you are doing in this post is still making this about you while pretending it is to validate her experience she doesnt need you to validate her lived experience that you abused her but most importantly the why you did what you did that doesnt do shit all for people who have suffered abuse abuse hurts a victim whether it stems from malicious and calculated intent or because of mental health her experience isnt changed just because you have a diagnosis mental health may be the reason but it is never an excuse in fact the very fact that you are so focussed on reaching out to her indicates you have a long long ass way to go in therapy so keep going to therapy and ask your therapist to help you implement a control mechanism so when you have thoughts of reaching out to her you have tools to cope with them thats how you improve and she can do what she needs to heal edit spelling thats a lot of printer ink going to waste why are you trying to put chair out of a job in this economy no the twist is the person who made the post is in their 20s30s is the younger version of the guy who actually made the offensive art 3040 years earlier that version was trying to make a small homage to the 80s cultural ideas of inclusivity its been nearly a year have you ever sat down and actually discussed life goals and long term visions because that conversation in clear terms would basically confirm what everyone is saying you two have no longterm compatibility this isnt a there is this one little detail we arent on the same page about issue this is on an ideological level of how to live life we have nothing in common issue yes it is called being verbally abusive and waving a trash bag in your face is getting to the point of escalating to the threat of physical abusive shoving is actual physical abuse the 90 nice and i am doubting your percentages because we get a skewed reality when we are living with this crap doesnt make the 10 threat of or experience of abuse and assault okay being apologetic for something without ever really changing means nothing no you do not do online personality tests that have zero validity and besides its a rental not a job with the cia you take references contact past landlords can do a legal background search for any arrest records or issues there if someone is displaying online aggressive or annoying tendencies you block or ignore them because of the fair housing act you dont do anything that shows discriminatory behavior the deposit should be used to cover any structural issues with your unit id take pictures of the condition you left it in ask him to schedule a walkthrough with you after youve cleaned and emptied it to have him show you any issues he would like fixed and assume for the best if you were an annoying tenant to the landlord that may mean you are both happy you are moving on but its not an entitlement to your deposit do everything by the letter of the book and presume it will be fine the deck flooring is a different wood this looks like a shitty homemade job at some fencing edit railings but the question that matters is the structure of the flooring can you get under the house and look for termite damage and how the floorboards are constructed when you walk around on the deck is it spongey and has some give or fairly solid the fencing should have been screwed in he should fix it however i dont think it is get out of lease bad unless there are greater structural issues or the interior is not habitable it is however a lawsuit waiting to happen id rewrite a letter saying you have children nieces nephews whatever that visit you and loose railing exposed nails are a liability youd like to see properly fixed and see how that goes over really should have used screws and it depends on if the wood is solid or if there is termitewater rot while its shoddy and a lawsuit waiting to happen for the landlord im an adult so i can go and just never lean on the fencing of a deck what would concern me more is the wood and structural condition of the deck floor i hate to say this but age gap shes 10 years older than you at 37 she totally knows better and is not dissuading him and is also closer in age to him than you you will need to fess up to the snooping and state clearly that hes hit on your exes in the past you are not okay with their texting like this shell either agree or not and youll know its the rug its too close to matchymatchy with the couch a foresty green or sage green rug or even a teal and the couch walls would look great id also get a rug thats a bit smaller and doesnt go all the way to the windows and wall i like how the dog looks concerned with whats happening haha can you work the ot for a year tighten your belts and get your deposit up to 3040 that may significantly lower monthly mortgage depending on what interest rates do by next year i know theres this intense feeling that buy now or be priced out forever but there is always a way oh crap maybe not maybe thats why mine so frequently sprout because i lose them in there giant pillar no window for sure temporary wallpaper it something fun and find a way to grow plants up down it make it a living column in your place id be very suspicious mortgage lenders are getting hit by the higher interest rates so this feels more like shes relying on astrology than insider secret knowledge of what the fed is going to do it wasnt a random shooting though to be fairpeople got in an argument and were shooting at each other i always find this a funny way to low key downplay the experience i say this as an american who has been near or in the middle of 3 shootings in my late 40s lived in
