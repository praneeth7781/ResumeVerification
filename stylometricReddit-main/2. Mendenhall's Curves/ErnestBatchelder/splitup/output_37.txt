restore it gutted its still not worth double the value in 3 years though even if the land is worth a lot not 5 million for a half acre lot with a tear down on it wheres this this is torus trajectory in murakamis wind up bird chronicles im not in love with that book for many reasons but murakami does make it work and it is a beloved book by many id call him a passive protagonist its honestly a hard thing to pull off so i dont think theres really a term for it its also sort of the plot in candide but candide does have agency just all the worst things keep happening to everyone in that story turn cover inside out grasp corners of duvet to corners of cover one in each hand hold arms wide apart shimmy shimmy its heavy it hurts your rotator cuff get it all the way on realize you had the duvet in the wrong direction start over if my dad can feel this way about one group of people does he feel the same way about the community that im from that the woman he loved and married for that last 20 years is from the one his grandkids by my older sister his stepdaughter are apart of so heres the thing your dad is racist its very easy for racist people to dislike an entire group but have exceptions their neighbor their kids the people they know personally who they make an exception for or mentally to them dont fit into the hate they have for a certain group they simply bifurcate in their brain he also may be a bit of drunk who lets that part of him loose when he drinks its worth saying to him when hes sober why it hurts you and what you wrote above a lot of people who lack empathy can only get it when someone they know feels pain and explains it in personal terms so you tell him intellectually why it sucks that he feels comfortable yelling racial epithets he doesnt get it and calls you a democrat but you tell him why it hurts you personally he may have a bit of a moment for reflection hell still be racist in his heart but at least maybe not yell shit in front of you other people in comments who are saying leave nope you need to finish school it doesnt make you a bad person to stay with him for a few years and get through what you need to do to care for yourself great deal enjoy the new car congrats it took me a fair minute to realize it was a hat then all i could think about is how many tops of hats look like vaginas and ive never known from the bart gov

training and fair and impartial policing training warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info they may have been poor negotiators who knows the buyer may have gotten 15k in credits that went to closing costs fixes instead of the sale price personally did something when i bought my first home at the advice of my then crappy agent wouldnt do that again if you have the funds to buy a 1m house you can pay closing costs and i think now in retrospect it is better to make the sale price lower for the sake of the mortgage if you have an agent they can look at the mls and see if there are any notes im a big walker and used to walk in altadena to many things for short errands under 3 miles but our infrastructure does not make it pleasant in most of ca sidewalks arent maintained plenty of areas where it is more traffic and much less safe space to walk and the constant trying to make eye contact prove your humanity with drivers crossing at any intersection so you dont have to become road smoosh suck meh on the manic pixie dream girl or not like other girls stuff because it always places some kind of masculine ideal at the center then plays ideas or archetypes of feminity off of that i was super into it in my 20s and was friends with a lot of guys but then one day i realized its kinda bullshit and stopped pursuing situations where i could frame myself that way im a weirdo and i know it i dont relate to a ton of things that are normal in our culture that i should and ive learned to keep some of that info to myself in public at least but being in acceptance of my own eccentricities doesnt have to be gendered or pit me against individual women even if it does make me dislike the larger paradigm were all inside of dammit was this the modest dealership and howd you get the extra 300 i took the 3k off and didnt negotiate further other than refuse their weird safety addon same modesto yeah thats 3000 off msrp its what i think they call invoice pricing 45000 out the door is what i paid its pretty much the best you can do on a new xt from my several months of watching and trying to negotiate at varying dealers for lower than msrp the one thing i forgot to do is get a subaru loyalty coupon for an extra 500 off holy mackerel that is stunning i love william morris and the design and needlework is exquisite ah thank you for doing tnr and being a longterm foster parent may oleander have a nice life on someones lap or if it is not to be then living free in a barn dumbass truck likely lifted the suspension and put on wheel spacers to get that stupid aggressive truck look then didnt even bother to tighten the lug nuts asshole your living with a nightmare nothing youve listed here is normal and you keep saying how it is fine you respect these ridiculous expectations she has even taking 3 days off to help someone with wisdom teeth removal they can pop some vicodin eat ice cream and watch tv just fine its not like she cant get herself to the bathroom ridiculous no one needs a fulltime caretaker for wisdom teeth removal my god you are walking around on eggshells in your own home asking permission to have your boyfriend over its like she owns the place set reasonable rules tell her how its going to be or she can go out there and pay regular rent this friendship really is toxic shes not your best friend you are her caretaker servant shes got you convinced the sky is whatever color she says it is but to me getting yelled at due to the ed doesnt feel weird or out of line op your inner compass is severely offkilter if someone yelling at you when you are struggling with a mental health disorder feels normal just because it happened a lot in the past doesnt mean it was ever okay needs to continue happening or should be your future he doesnt start getting better and talk about what happened to him she will force him to go to therapy andor ground him those are 2 very different solutions and implementing neither for several months of this is kind of negligent esp for it to get this bad sorry but it that makes me judge his moms own judgement ill punish him or tell him to go someplace to heal are vastly different ways to address an issue and its not magically going back to the way it was without someone taking action simmering resentments rarely get better being left simmering you keep mentioning something happened was it the information about college or do you think there was an actual traumatic incident that shifted his behavior maybe hes mad at his own father and taking it out on you who knows thats why communication therapy and addressing the issue is better than wait a bit then ill start punishing him therapy now and meetings in family therapy after hes done some work to have a safe discussion teens dont completely change overnight at 17 unless something has been brewing for a long time that both of you were just unaware of or there is an incident that upsets them deeply the incident may not be completely rational maybe it is about paying for college but you cant just let it go on for months on end until he leaves the house if you suspected mental health like an undiagnosed disorder or a physical issue some kind of stroke that caused a personality change like impulsiveness that would be one reason to have empathy and intervene i cant advise you how because id have no clue other than to encourage him to see a doctor and get a full workup but without any evidence of that happening it means he made a clearheaded choice at some point to cheat on your mom and he is an adult i am sure this is horrible and traumatizing for all of you but when someone decides to blow up their life sometimes you let them i hope your mom has spoken to a lawyer and began proceedings regardless of if she chooses to help him if his new whatever she is has access to your fathers accounts it could destroy your moms financial stability honestly it could be a weird hardhit moment of nostalgia or a feeling about that time in her life without actually still wanting to be with him give it a bit and then discuss how it made you feel and what was going on for her youll get clarity nice work on the rescue cats can have two fathers for a single liter with that many kittens id say oleander had been busy she looks like a kid herself please take her to a lowcost spay clinic once theyre all weaned its 85 where i live and im in a hugely overpriced state for all things that should be negotiated down how much is printing out a sales contract and sending some forms to the dmv worth and echidnas you could post in rbayarea see if any other expats here have insight on what the transition was like for them my god
