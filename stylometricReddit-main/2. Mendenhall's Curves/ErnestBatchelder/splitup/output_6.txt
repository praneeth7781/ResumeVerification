thats just a little keep going write those thoughts down thing this is actually more adhd coaching than therapy but if her background is in social work she may be open to it this one works because you do the task in part not to let the other person down even if you are in such a low place you dont feel motivated to do it for yourself good luck the few occasions ive stuck with cbt type processes they can help it is trickier when the depressionanxiety is stemming from adhd for sure email send the email stating per my texts on list dates the following repairs need attention list the repairs ask if he would prefer you pay for fixes and take the cost off of next months rent its more formal and should get a reply as for the key as others said just go get a spare made colony but seriously others mention insecure crazy exgirlfriend which do a good job reflecting south los angeles and san gabriel valley respectively arrested development and party down are also two comedies that are fairly spot on to living in la though arrested development is more orange county i know that poor little quiet as a mouse child needs some vit d herzliya is right by tel aviv but nice because its a little quieter i cant say much as to what living there as an expat will be like or the bureaucracy you will run into but its an easy area for speaking english meeting other people from around the world plus the mediterranean is beautiful driving on the other hand is hell but im a nervous driver read point number 4 op states that servers are deluded that they think they are worth 3050 an hour its a shame because children are very good oyster shuckers its the tiny nimble hands theyre going to pay a lot in capital gains taxes plus the closing costs they paid when bought so really seems like a hassle for 50k ah i lived in la for decades la bay area are both very hustle culture heavy areas the good news is la is vast if you are back for family and committed to staying you can find your people in my experience la takes a few years to find the niches you want to be in wait people are either bragging about how much theyve traveled or they are not interested in foreign experiences you cant have both us is so regional youve kinda described the bay area though i suppose it could be like that in other cities i know that in ca in general people tend to find friendships through mutual interests as opposed to neighborhoods may want to look at some groups near you that involve an interest the friendly superficial thing is a generalization depending on your age making friends just gets harder and harder as you get older i find that the best friends ive made tend to be a handful of people i had to make an effort to get to know and sustain the relationship as for the jobmoneyschools talk thats definitely here in a more open and crass way ive found other cultures tend to do the classstatus stuff too just much more subtle or lowkey than we do in the us ok hes still a bit of a sociopathic water hoarder for when the water wars come but i still find him the least offensive i have zero sympathy for any of them they are wealthier than god and could have figured how to exit the family dynamic undergo a hundred years of therapy and go off and be happy planting roses and growing pluots traumatic childhoods aside as adults they have free will and access to more resources than 99 of the people on earth with traumatic childhoods money isnt happiness but it provides options the only characters i tend to like would be willa conner conner even if his political theories are narcissistic and thinly fleshed out and willa may not have the actual talent for her playwriting aspirations but they dont actively go about damaging others just live in their weird little fantasy wealth bubble romans sociopathy can be fun in moments to watch his abuse may have been more physical than the other two but he was always the kind of person whod torture children and animals some people me really cannot handle focussing on getting to know more than one person at a time i know some people can meet several different people in one week i think thats fine too i however would never push someone to be exclusive at the just texting or talking phase and who else they are dating or speaking with is their business until such time as weve actually established a reallife connection my point is could be love bombed or simply how they navigate online dating be clear in whatever your boundaries are hey if you want to stop chatting with others thats your choice i prefer to stay open when getting to know people until such time as weve been actually dating and agreed to exclusivity if they respect that you are fine if they give you pushback eff em handicapped spaces are important but anything aside from those if the imperative is to ensure equal access to the beaches for all californians then wed have jitneys set up that go around make stops at several inland locations in the early morning take people to the beach for the day then return in the early evening there used to be a service like that in the summers in la that went specifically from an area like altadena to santa monicamalibu to help people get to the ocean for the day dont think it has run in many years but getting that going leaving more outdoor spaces for people to enjoy the ocean makes more sense than building more car infrastructure my grandmother was born in the us alaska but went back to ireland as a teenager then married an englishman and settled in england she spent the majority of her 99 years in the uk being very proud of her american citizenship even had a american ladies club she attended went through ww2 in london raised two kids paid british taxes and eventually died in her home in the countryside but never dropped that she was a us citizen from her identity for some people i think the point is enjoying always being a foreigner the us for all its current and past problems is probably the one place in the world where the end goal for immigration is usually integration especially for the 1st gen kids born here its become more loudly mainstream nativist in the past 510 years but for decades even if we didnt quite live up to it we liked to describe the us as a successful melting pot some of the proudest americans are immigrants who eventually got citizenship probably because of the number of years it takes and hoops to jump through ironically they tend to know more basic american history than the average americanborn citizen in order to pass their citizenship exam they feel rejected in their home countries so are more bothered by not being accepted in a new country either i feel like the experience of not fully identifying with your home country or feeling accepted could set an individual up mentally to be better at handling the stranger in a strange land syndrome it depends if the person saw moving as a way to find acceptance vs taking the skill of experiencing things as an outsider and applying it to a positive outsider experience eh if they are just washing it in a colander and little bits are going down that shouldnt be breaking a garbage disposal still its normal to rinse rice ive done it long since before tiktok existed it does cook better and rice is really dirty like picking stones and rinsing dirt out of dried lentils i thought they were dumping bags of it in this all is likely to be the reset button and the disposal is really delicate so if the motor goes too hard on anything it sets itself off they might be running it for too long its plugged into an outlet that cant carry the electrical etc first thing they should do is learn to look under the sink see if the reset button has popped and push it back in second thing is buy one of those little sink strain things for the drain you take a broom handle and jam it in till you can turn the little rotator knifey bits then hit the reset button under the sink at least thats what my old landlord use to do also a little bit of cooked rice shouldnt break a garbage disposal unless they are putting gallons of it down and letting it swell or putting in uncooked been an ongoing problem here for several years the farther south slosanta barbara the more inured people are at fire season and the following mudslide season much of slo county is inland and is high brush higher heat more fires right near the coast the air quality is always much much better but depending on the fire season you still might get a few days or weeks of reddish air with high pollutants during the malibu fires several years ago the coastline in southern california was deep red for the longest ive ever seen it also right near the coast anywhere in ca will be premium rent and housing costs i agree with this 100 i think its one of those things thats low priority to some people high priority to others i come from one of the most carreliant cities in the us la that people dream of expatriating to and many expats that land there love it especially uk to la or anywhere in ca due to weather i lived there for 20 years and pretty much burned out part of my brain on commuting dealing with road rage people insane traffic at all hours of the day stopped going out in the evening if it meant drivingparking also as a dual citizen grew up spending a lot of time in the uk id always come back from visits feeling physically better mentally calmer then want to cry when i had to get back into my car for daily life in california i think its like 90k tjs pays its employees well and has great benefits they just dont want them to unionize oh thanks love a good new word this is hysterical reminds me when i was a kid i swore tina turner was singing whats love but a secondhand abortion when she sang whats love got to do with it she added an edit they have a kid together he either locked her down with a baby or she naively ignored the glaring warnings and still had a kid with him im finding myself freezing like a deer in headlights yeah thats a common trauma response fightflight or freeze x200b i found out he was on dating apps behind my back so hes projecting his cheating onto you he is a cheater even if he isnt actively doing so right now he still thinks like a cheater and therefore has decided everyone is like him so rather than change he is controlling you x200b we have a new baby oh god this is not a situation that is going to go away you have a baby with a controlling cheater i would absolutely let them know in a very polite professional manner while you were happy with their work while purchasing the ghosting and failed promise at the end means you will not be referring them to 3 new clients nor using them to purchase a
