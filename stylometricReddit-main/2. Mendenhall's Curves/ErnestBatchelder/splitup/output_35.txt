several metro areas one next door neighbors held at gunpoint but no guns discharged the fact that we have gotten to the point where we have levels for our shooting incidents gang fight neighbors domestic issue not a random mall shooting but two angry people shooting i think that itself is kind of indicative of how bad the issue is there were several shootings in my old neighborhood and even when they were going after specific targets la drivebys every so many years some kid would get shot by accident and it was harrowing and messed up just a magical gardener growing fridge potatoes it wont be double utilities if you are staying primarily in one home or the rental id keep it take your time moving and hopefully you have a smooth closing after keys in hand end lease early if you still want but if you do move by may or june you are only on the hook for the months they cant rent it out to someone else plus if you need to do something like paint or repairs you can do them before moving in your furniture i dont know about their fine print on the program but probably not given joint tenancy is a way for you to inherit their home when they die without it going into probate so you are in fact already part owner of a home first off going back on medication is not taking steps back if youve taken it in the past and it helps then its steps forward secondly putting aside the total ick factor of what he said if the idea of you as mentally ill is a turnon to this guy then understand he has a vested interest in you staying ill that actually is a major step backward in your mental health journey that he is going through his own stuff is no excuse the homeless crisis is bad absolutely but ive been from southern ca to northern and have never seen tents on beaches unless it is near an official campsite and its regular campers reframe your experience you were 25 when you met a 42yearold online and you had no previous sexual experience moved to a strange country then got trapped in what sounds like a loveless marriage being coerced into pleasureless sex stop taking it as a chore and say no you have agency over your body no matter what hes led you to believe every one of your replies you claim you arent failing your daughter because you fight with your wife and if you leave youd be failing your sons this is what your daughter will remember daddys new wife was a monster and daddy picked staying with her and raising his new family over me thats it thats the damage also trust me your two boys know you fight all the time so congrats theyre getting effed by this situation too there was a time and place when flippers were more like renovators and actually did a service by restoring inhabitable houses for resale that was probably about a decade or more ago then everyone became a house flipper now i always look sideeyed at any grey black white home assume they are a mess of cut corners and cheap buildersgrade lies just because you got someone pawned off on you doesnt mean you have to work with them unless you signed an exclusivity agreement fire her and interview more agents at various agencies drugged uncool poor apex predator cabinet looks nicer against the primer white than the color swatches what grey did you paint your cabinets if you know you can look it up online and plenty of paint blogs will tell you the specific undertones purple orange pink blue of that grey to me it looks like a warmer griegegrey so it would go great with any swiss coffee white from the major lines those whites tend to present as very bright and clean but have the tiniest bit of yellowcream to them colored kitchen grey cabinets is a tough thing to pull off but some softer light light blues or very pale yellows could work but it could also be a mess grey grey tends to go dingey and dark in a kitchen maybe in a living room with a fireplace and a darker feeling but kitchens imo should have a bit of cheer im getting lowerend marriot hotel foyer from them everything else looks really nice or has some personal touches but id say let the mirror eye wall go doctors visit for mental health check plus cognitive decline cut off her internet seriously pull the plug on the internet act like you all are doing everything you can to fix it and drag it out for as long as possible meanwhile someone drops by and suggests a small walk around the block shes likely trapped by facebook trash algorithms that are relentlessly showing her crime videos crimes are up in a lot of places but depending on where she lives most of it could be very low chances in her neck of the woods she needs to detox from the newsfeed of doom one document everything and then go to a higher up or hr to report a hostile work environment or take away their power this is the hardest path but i highly recommend it they are doing this because like all lowlife assholes who hate themselves they need to find sources of power outside of themselves to suck dry like emotional vampires right now picking on you seeing how it makes you feel bad gives them that power you take it back by 1 not giving a shit what they think of you no wanting to be friends no people pleasing only cold professional interactions 2 confront when it is to your face someone cracks a joke at your expense reply in a calm flatlined voice please explain why that is funny they stumble to explain or whatnot just reply huh sounds more like insecurity on your part than an actual joke you will be a fantastic nurse but nursing in the us and hospital settings in general are notorious for this kind of coworker pecking order there is a way to push back grey rock not having an emotional investment in these people they think youre stupid who gives a fuck what they think they dont set a schedule or grade you in your classes but it is lonely and can very much take a toll on you and i do think we are more vulnerable to being bullied good luck you got this eh i see things like this or a prenup as a decent step to make sure everyone is on the same page in case of break up if done well it should actually protect both parties i would try to move past the distaste and view it as a really good way to also protect your own interests negotiate moving into someone elses home especially one bought for them and possibly not fully owned by them is complicated and you should have a fair way to make sure youre going to be okay too are you planning on paying rent aka their mortgage if so whats the division and what rights do you have if you two break up 30 days to locate another place to live etc id go over it with a lawyer then come back to the table with whatever you dont agree with and what youd like included to protect you 20 years from now do you want to be 46 in your prime and sorting his 66yearolds heart medication for him while he degrades you no then goooooo now i bought some books think home buying for dummies but not under that specific umbrella for my market california they were probably already outdated given the changes during the pandemic boom but i think there was enough information to make it worth the time i have already bought and sold my first home cant get back into the market right now so a lot of what my current knowledge also comes from knowing what i dont want to do again after the first experience start brainpicking every one you can think of interview re agents dont just grab one someone else recommends ask what their home buying philosophy is and what they wish first time buyers knew get a feel for them find someone you think will bring more than just opening doors from a lockbox to the table speak with mortgage brokers in a few different areas big bank credit union solo mortgage brokerage just because you email or chat with someone doesnt mean you have to work with them but its a great opportunity to line up who you do want to work with and to learn more info i think the better armed you are with information while it can bog you down the better off you are to make good decisions for yourself later not have regrets you are acting already defeated in the comments i get it you are tired this guy and his friends have worn you down the campus you are on is poorly policed and a lot of situations where nothing was resolved youve lost friends from the relationship all of that are valid reasons for feeling defeated but thats exactly how he or any stalker wants you to feel defeated and trapped your only choice is to become untrapped and that means finding every damn resource you can to report this write down your concerns with his behavior every recent event with him popping up with dates and time estimates write it down so you have a paper copy and dont have to repeat the traumatic events over and over make copies and take them to health services and ask to speak to a mental health counselor to the campus police and to your local police to the dean of the college start with someone and ask for help they will either help refer you to someone who can help or you go to the next person you dont have any friends because he isolated you reach out to old friends say you want to get a coffee reconnect some might blow you off but youd be surprised who is happy to hear from you your stalker wants you defeated and trapped if you already feel defeated then hes gotten what he wants a way to drain you and force you to stay in his orbit dont give him the win get angry it will help you find the energy okay you dont list your age but im guessing your early 20s it all sounds like a drama circle and like it or not you were part of the dramaseeking behaviors maybe you dont have a great instinct for who is trustworthy because youve been getting caught up with people who seem exciting rather than good and reliable throw yourself into something volunteer a new hobby hiking a class find groups one thing about la its a city of 4 million people there are plenty of nonacting influencers existing outside of one social media bubble consider therapy if there are deeper issues at play i think it is overall stunning work i love the feeling of movement the pops of foilage and the viewpoint its painted from it feels very alive which is a difficult thing to achieve with a flat medium like gouache the main thing that throws me with the pink ground is how much of it is still present in the flowing water the water would reflect the surrounding trees but also the sky so my mind is processing sunset warm dusk lighting on the water but the sky is telling me grey afternoon light if that makes any sense i little bit more
