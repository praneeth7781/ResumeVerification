their narrativeworldview versus going nocontact lots of good wishes to you so your mom would rather you be a defective person than cope with the idea that she was a defective parent who didnt get you help and a diagnosis at a younger age when it could have really helped your best bet is to limit how much you share with them stop thinking theres a magical moment where they see you for who you are and support you in this dont share the little things like washing dishes it will be received with disbelief take it to a place with real support you can find that support in any other stable place therapy disabilities services at uni etc and dont seek comfort or normal parental support give yourself as much distance as you can for now its a tough one but as you learn to advocate for yourself you will need their acceptance less until she gets her untreated bipolar under control if that is what she has the dog is screwed in the name of a longterm friendship id offer to meet her in public sans all dogs and tell her your concerns for her mental health and that she needs help theres a form of bipolar bipolar ii that isnt as severe as type i problem is they can function they just cycle faster and not as dramatic as bipolar i so theres more of a chance they scrape by without having to get treatment while still having a lot of lifedamage she may take it worse than the dog being banned and nothing comes of it but its honestly a lastditch attempt if not to salvage the friendship but hell at least to save her dog from an owner who isnt well your friendship is at a breaking point and being totally upfront about this is one thing is something you could do to help her not to get further enmeshed but to encourage her to get a therapist and an actual diagnosis from a doctor as for the rest of it you are well within your rights to tell her she cant bring the dog to your house thats all fantastic until a wall falls or a poop tank explodes are you the aunt in question caretaking is no easy task often unfairly falls to one person in a family regardless limiting the elderly adults contact with other family members and isolating them is abuse i know this may sound outlandish but have you tried telling them to please call first no help but i assume you also love getting caught in the rain this is one of those rare bad situations where i would disclose adhd to human resources if you actually have not already because by law you are a little more protected from an unfair firing edit if in the us under the disabilities act i would then be sure to document it all so id back document the hrsupervisor convo and at least summarize what was said i would backdate and summarize the directorys secretary and i would absolutely mention the duning kruger effect comment it is very insulting because it means overestimating ones abilities because you are not smart enough to be aware of your limitations these people are being catty further note any of the times you have asked for feedback received none i know you probably dont want to sue but if things dont change for you after disclosing you have adhd and repeating again for better feedback even if it isnt as dramatic as a lawsuit you certainly may be able to protect yourself during any firing that may be coming after the busy season op i will say this has little to do with your work and more to do with very poor management for a supervisor to discuss an employee right next to them refuse to offer feedback and the general description of the office they really are the ones bad at their jobs even if a hire isnt skilled when hired a good workplace would put effort into training and mentorship to get them up to par not sit around having bitch sessions in a cubicle id stick with off whites creams that are very light and organic looking like natural white untreated fabrics the white you have there is very cool white i wouldnt go that way if you want splashes of color like pillows and a throw add in ochre and earthy greens there was an ikea curtain some time ago that was white with yellow and green botanical images on it which could be fun but may be discontinued my theory for wood paneling is not to make it feel like oppressive dark cabin but try to bring in some warm spring too much base color introduced colored curtains colored duvet could be fun but with old wood paneling could also really overdo the room so i personally dont see anything wrong with being married and living unconventionally in separate arrangements ive known one long term relationships without the marriage we are talking decades who both lived on two sides of one duplex quite happily financially though it works when you come into the relationship each with your own property and simply continue that way without merging those assets or you do something like purchase a duplex you have a very lowinterest rate and it doesnt really make sense to sell your current property and it is a lousy time to buy if you could turn your current home more into a duplex or place with a separate entrance kitchenbath apartment that may be one solution otherwise its obviously not a good financial stretch but if it means you get to both stay happy in your marriage then the cost may be worth that if it means you are currently in a strained marriage and this is a lastditch effort to save it maybe the costs arent worth it have either one of you tried living separately for a month or two to see what it does to your marriage if it helps or makes things more strained id definitely knock out a prenup first make sure that if the marriage dissolves there will be an understanding of who owns what so keep it as professional as possible with her but also build yourself a little invisible shield when you do interact with her i mean completely imaginary in your mind you have a shield around you does she hate you no probably not is it possible she is biased against you yeah it totally happens toxic coworkers are a thing your absolute best bet is to stop caring about winning her over being friendly with her or really worrying too much about her otherwise she is an energy suck in your daily life do not seek her approval or people please because it isnt coming do what she does keep everything short super polite but to the point cut down good morning how are you today to good morning with no extra questions or engagement she cuts in and takes over let her speak and try to reengage your point after they are done the more you are trying to find an in with her the more she will reject you i cant explain it but people like this only deescalate when you stop having this inner desire for their approval its very hard to get to that place internally where you dont care but the faster you do the better it will be for you honestly wouldnt trust an inspection paid for by the seller though id assume even with certified theyd be looking for the easiest going inspector i paid for an inspection when i bought that was detailed when i went to sell we went with asis and disclose everything so we paid another inspector to do a report to give sellers i was shocked that they were much less detailed than the original report anyway dont budge on your refusal to waive inspections it is the one contingency that i hate buyers have folded on it does make everything worse to go into a bigticket purchase blind like that sky and the building feel empty id do a little bit of soft detailing no need to fill all blank space but some clouds or sky the way youve done plants or some brick or texture for the building but honestly very charming and delightful scene warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info gerri has helped cover up was general counsel and enabler to logan roy and pretty much helped float the waystar empire which is toxic from the top down dont get me wrong i love her but shes not exactly a good person southern california lasbsd best tacos northern california san jose or sf best large burrito size of small baby i will die on this hill you wont find the best in the east bay go to the mission in sf to taquera el farolito and order a burrito adorable i think there are no dumb questions so heres my answer as far as abortion rights and the overturning of roe v wade plenty of western countries have or had restrictions on abortion for decades now it wasnt legal in places like ireland until 2018 sucks for women but thats a general way of plenty of parts of the world gay rights are also pretty horrific in plenty of parts of the world there are regions where being caught in a samesex relationship will result in jail or death so while i would absolutely say the us is backsliding we still are not on par with some of the worst dictatorships or even semidemocracies just last year farright wins in italy and sweden happened with many of the same issues are coming up italy is trying to diminish parental rights of same sex marriages refugee status is really left for people suffering from genocide or political persecution to the point that their lives are threatened for who they are in their home country people fleeing afghanistan under the taliban wouldnt be viewed the same as someone dealing with increasingly oppressive laws or rolling back of their rights here in the us the good thing about the us is there are states where rights are protected and making a move between states while costly isnt impossible as for the shootings i got nothing weve become ridiculous on that front but if you look at the number of deaths from mass shootings per year per capita how many people live in the us it is still nowhere near gun deaths like el salvador venezuela or other places south of here that being said we have way more gun deaths not just mass shootings but overall gun deaths per year per 100000 citizens than in europe australia africa or the middle east in the coming decades if we stay on this trajectory who knows we still wont be eligible for refugee status but it will be a sad state of affairs can anyone explain why logan roy had a clear scottish accent and ewan roy has a very distinct bornnraised american accent it throws me off every time she doesnt want to get married but she wants you to do the breaking up the way shes going about this is a particular brand of fucked up that you do not need in your life so do it break it off to provide a best and final offer dont do this while it is done i have no idea the legality of it its also just messed up to ask for a bidding war on a rental they arent bidding to buy a home take down the ad repost at the proper rent and reach out to those that youve offered a
