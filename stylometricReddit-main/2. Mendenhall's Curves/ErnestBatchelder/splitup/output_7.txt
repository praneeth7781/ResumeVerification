second property you cant report it once everythings signed and hes gotten the keys in your hands his job is technically over but a good realtor will keep in touch and continue to offer some reasonable support to a client because half their business is generating leads dude should learn from unprofessional behavior as long as you didnt waive inspections then it is probably what you need to do right now to be competitive if you can afford the monthly payments property taxes then you stayed within your budget and if they take your offer then you can always negotiate down for any issues found during inspections make sure your home inspector has good reviews and id also do my due diligence on sewer line and roof inspection separate from a general home inspection paying over asking and buying a lemon sucks paying over asking and getting the home you want general state of things now my therapist discounted that i could have had trauma or anything like it caused by masking because as she said my trauma caused my adhd not the other way around if you like this therapist then it is worth bringing up this sentence in therapy next session and explaining why it upsets you your therapist may have crackpot theories she may have failed to explain herself well you may have misinterpreted her in session part of therapy esp for people with cptsd is learning we can speak up to people who we think see us wrong and they will still be there for us if she is a good therapist and the right one for you you should be able to resolve this in therapy now she may double down or further invalidate you in which case i am sorry but maybe shes not the right therapist for trauma work for you but you still will have spoken up for yourself and how you view your own bodymind diagnosis you are looking at this incident in the context of larger behavioral patterns asking people to judge the incident outside of any context i dont think you can get a fair take on that incident alone id say it deserved a discussion where both parents agree the creek is off limits for now or a walk down there to as a family to assess the poison oak situation if it was only in certain areas and obvious then you can tell the kids where they could play they go into it at that point it was on them is it everywhere okay off limits both parents act like a team in your situation you are trying to get her to parent for you you have to make a unilateral decision and that system is failing the kids know you both arent on the same page arent a team their own emotional development isnt going great because mom is checked out they have learned to play one parent off the other id highly suggest you look into individual therapy for yourself if your wife wont seek help or go to couples counseling heres why you are the enabler of a dysfunctional family unit right now even though you are doing what you can to keep everything together but taking on that role youve also allowed your wife to stay comfortable in neglecting her own mental illness and neglecting the kids 1 it may help if she sees you take that initiative for yourself she may be more open to help 2 at the very least it will help you decide if this situation is sustainable feel less like you have to bring things to reddit as you learn to understand better whats happening to you and your own reactions in these situations edited to add good luck it is a lot are you quoting the film chinatown la is a medditerean climate joshua tree mojave and those areas well outside of la county are desert climates in plenty of parts la has much better native plants restoration than the bay area esp individual homes that have given up green lawns for natives in the past 10 years as for parks they arent green spaces like golden gate ie manmade or cultivated while there are some invasive species in the areas i listed most of those park areas are chaparral griffith park or santa monica mts for example are a wide expansive set of trails through public lands we do have too many golf courses though read through the comments got to several of your replies that are way more illuminating than your original post your wife has depression she is completely checked out right now you are not sure she even likes being a mom you have to remind her to be kind to her own kids at the same time you have one neurodivergent kid the oldest you describe as emotionally immature who doesnt feel responsible towards younger siblings acting like mom a middle child out in the world trying to prove how tough he is middle child stuff trying to prove he doesnt need a mom your wifes mental health is impacting your kids couples counseling for communication and she needs individual therapy doctors visits get to the bottom of the depression if it has been going on for years she has clinical depression which will not magically go poof away on its own is it hormonal or chemical imbalance has your wife been tested for adhd asd adhd and asd are genetic and frequently kids who are diagnosed with it help a parent realize they too are neurodivergent or that they had a parent who was women with it often go undiagnosed especially if they are smart enough to do well or okay in school and years of living with it without any support or education can lead to clinical depression it turned to crap in the last year because you got married in her mind now you wont leave her and she can let who she wants to be out she could have any number of mental health problems unless she wants to get help she wont change in the meantime shes grooming you to start walking on eggshells cede to her version of reality and to tolerate the same kind of abuse you grew up with id ultimatum this she either agrees she has a rage problem and she needs gets help or you need to leave edit read your other comments she says this is just who she is complete crap she likes taking her emotions out on you and wont change get out because theyve been sold a bag of lies by the wedding industry that marriage is supposed to start with a bended knee proposal in an idyllic setting that someone who takes professional photos nearby just so happens to capture the moment then it goes from there people cant talk about the nuts and bolts of their relationships 5year plans financials housing goals marriage timelines kid timelines but they want an entire lifelong committed relationship to be birthed from unicorn farts and fairy dust i know this situation is at least half my own fault nope completely skewed power dynamic she was inappropriately building intimacy with you and her dumping her divorce stuff on you was also bs no offense but no 18yearold kid gives good advice about a marriage falling apart she was using you as an emotional crutch and then set up a scenario to seduce you i am guessing afterwards she feels ashamed enough to not continue the pattern while this is a terrible thing for you to have to experience you do need to remove yourself from the situation but it should not negatively impact your career aspirations back off of her for a while start looking for internships or other opportunities in this field to make contacts then reach out very professionally via email and ask her for a letter of recommendation she may or may not do it but she should after you have that letter put her out of your mind if you are still feeling emotional fall out do not be afraid to speak to a counselor you were taken advantage of and it can impact a lot of facets of your life without your realizing it but you did not destroy anything alright if you really cant get out of there and need to finish up school then deny him a huge drama scene or hashing it out tell him you need some time he sleeps on the couch then carry on with life he brings it up you need some time etc etc it absolutely will not work for 3 months but it may buy you about a month of reprieve if you need to find a 3rd place outside of schoolwork and home to do your studying like a library or cafe basically grey rock his cheating ass la county is huge lots of concrete throughout but some neighborhoods are tree lined pasadena comes to mind and there is access to huge swaths of hiking and green spaces griffith park san gabriels mts hacienda hills santa monica mts the difference is you have to drive to them buy in spring because thats when neighborhoods are at their peak noisy go to the areablock you are looking at at varying times of day and night plus weekends and walk around walking is different than being in your car you see more stuff and get a better feel when ready to buy do a little googling to see if you can find out who owns the neighbor houses are the owneroccupied for a long time or rentals air bnb rentals means having a high turnover of neighbors so you may get along with someone and then the next family in is noisy air bnbs are a nogo ultimately you can never predict the future and people near you can sell to whoever so you have to go on faith look for homes with good windows solid insulation older windows more noise homes above street level by a bit are better than homes below street level for how sounds carry i am noise sensitive while there are definitely neighborhoods that have a culture of quiet they tend to skew older and wealthier at the end of the day assume you will be hearing life around you in a much different way than when you live on an acreage think leaf blowers and construction etc and look into playing calming music and other things in the home to mask hello child your inability to hide your emotional reactions around me due to my shitty parenting makes me uncomfortable perhaps youd like a pill for that 1 take some time off for just you and your partner just because they paid for the vacation doesnt mean you have to be around them 247 go off on your own for a bit or book a dinner just the two of you 2 theres a little box where any hurtful comments from parents go into you do not respond in real time to the hurtful comment other to shut it down and not engage or take the bait said box can be emptied at a later point postvacay when safe to do so 3 enjoy the good parts looks like free museum day is over this year but check out this list of museums in la it is representing so many varied interests cars tv art difficult cultures science etc sorry but screenshot all the deleted texts and save them to a cloud server only you have the password for and contact a lawyer maybe you want to make it work and i wouldnt judge you for that if thats your ultimate decision but you should also protect yourself in case it is heading to divorce proceedings that book he mentions the four turnings is beloved by steve bannon trumps former white house
