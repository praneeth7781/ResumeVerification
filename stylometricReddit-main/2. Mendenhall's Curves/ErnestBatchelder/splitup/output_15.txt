tour to and explain the ad had the incorrect rent in it tell them if they are still interested you will provide the tour 3 cant you just use a vpn and watch english tv and streaming you cant go to the cinema but you still can access almost everything youd want to watch online french food tasty but sadistic start looking for a new place but also stop being a doormat to a ridiculous request in house share situation and give her a boundary hey i pay rent so i can come and go as i need to for my daily life and i cant accommodate you using your the home as a rehearsal space or updating you to my whereabouts every week if that was something you needed it should have been clearly stated at the time i signed the lease so i could decide then im happy to stick to my room for a brief period if i happen to be here while you rehearse but i can no longer give you updates on my schedule shes being ridiculous and also shes not an actress its probably porn if she actually was an actress then she should learn to appreciate having an audience he was her emotional doormat up until the great betrayal he would always act as her emotional fluffer during her schemes even when he was hankering to get in a little on the power and watched her instead push him out its the dynamics of a dysfunctional relationship everyone has a role to play that keeps the power balance in this case shiv stepping all over toms aspirations and constantly making sure he knew his place was beneath her once he did something in his own selfinterest side with logan he tossed their dynamic out the window cant come back from that i dont know why people root for this marriage its just kinda sad from all angles also tom is a morally ambiguous abuser ahole in his own right but it is a credit to the writers that he still comes across as worthy of being sympathetic for him at times heres the thing she has been blowing up her life and cheating since you first knew her you probably feel a little culpable because youve always supported her while you are not responsible for her actions you have been an enabler of sorts its okay to break off any relationship but i think ghosting should really be saved for people who are so toxic the dynamic could become abusive if you were to tell them the nicest thing to do with a longterm friendship thats gone belly up is to remove yourself but leave a door open for the chance that the person does grow or change i really have great memories of our friendship over the years id like to step back from it for a while now however because i really cannot support you through your cheating it bothers me a great deal and it is part of a larger pattern i cant ignore if down the road you get professional help and resolve this behavior please reach out to me its not like the label would make a difference in our relationship only it would make a difference you would know if you two were exclusive if hes seeing other people right now or if you are on the same page at all instead of trying to glean whats happening based on texts just wait until you get back then explain youd like to date exclusively and hes either on board or hes not 5 months is plenty of time to know that by the worst thing about california is we have direct democracy through propositions no one understands due to wording and large blocks can advertise for or against further confusing people renters voted against their own interests in the last election i forget which proposition it was but it offered better protections for renters i think it may have covered shfs which arent currently under the same rent raise laws as apartments who advertised against it real estate corps i was a homeowner at the time and even i voted for it when i spoke with renter friends they had misunderstood the prop and voted against it youve been together since you were both 16 do you know if this is the person you want to marry and have kids with or is this the only guy youve ever dated and thats a hard thing to think about letting go of you are both really young still instead of taking his varying plans travel then one kid by 30 or whatever hes coming up with what do you want your adulthood to look like career marriage and how many kids and when think about it for awhile and sit with it if it feels very strongly to you that there is a path you want then you can see if hes the one who wants to be on it with you try one more time with clarity to explain the problem and give a tangible solution hey you know you are one of my favorite people but we are really different people i am an introvert and i absolutely need some alone time when i am home its not personal but it is the only way i can recharge so heres what i am going to do when i am having me time and you are engaging i am going to tell you im not available right now or think of a simple sentence that communicates not available that means i wont be engaging or responding to anything said after that point when i am recharged available again to chat i will let you know as far as him joining if you have a friend over i think you have to suck that one up if you are going to hang out in communal spaces in a shared living arrangement you cant exactly expect a housemate to stay out of those spaces fixerupper can mean a lot of things from a total tear down to a house with decent infrastructure plumbing electrical roof foundation in older but working condition with older appliances nearing the end of their shelf life and a dated interior is one thing even with a good inspection expect to have unexpected issues but under those conditions you can move in and slowly chip away at repairs replace a water heater or furnace paint or fix lighting fixtures and flooring new kitchen appliances etc while living in the dated decor older kitchenbathroom until such time you can do full renovations but you better love the location and want to be in that area for some time and plan for the absolute time suck of what repairs mean also second but the chances of a dated interior but solid infrastructure are really difficult unicorn to find heres why usually those are the homes that elderly people who are downsizing sell that means in the last ten years they probably let a lot of things go my first home was sort of in that scenario while i made decent progress on its known issues in the 5 years there focussed on making the interior really lovely there was still a laundry list of issues that it needed the only reason i benefitted was the ridiculous nature of my local market in 21 when i went to sell while my realtor and i decided to make it pretty we would sell as is and disclose everything i did well on it only because it was a stupid competitive market i definitely feel like i unburdened myself of a total money pit lemon that had surface charm but after 5 years i was fed up with living in something that needed band aids and fixes at every turn in se england its closer to 1 in 3 is this true of areas like folkstone i read that part of kent gets more sun i love it glanced at it quickly while scrolling and immediately knew what it was really magical feel to it if you say yes all you are signing up to do is a make your workplace eventually a miserable place to be b get yourself hurt when people tell you what they want who they are believe them theres no magical future where they suddenly change to be the fantasy version of themselves that youve created in your mind i wouldnt let someone act like being easily amused by monuments is a fault get away with that what a bore of person i have ibs and caveat even chelated magnesium hits hard during an uh episode best ive found for me is long epsom salts baths with a huge amount of epsom salts it does absorb through the skin theres also a magnesium cream but its texture is terrible still hits pretty hard the next day but not as bad as drinking magnesium powder or taking the pills that sucks i called a few times over the years plus used 311 for certain issues and never had any problems getting through i guess it has also lost dispatchers there is a nonemergency line for the police and if people are that illinformed that they dont know to use the nonemergency line for nonemergencies then we need better civic education to cover the basics wibta if i asked her if she was okay yes thats a fine thing to do if you are actually ready to listen to her or want to get involved and told her to take a chill pill and to just move on from the failure yes because anyone going through any kind of life crisis always gets much better after being told to suck it up im being sarcastic obviously but dont say that to her if you want to engage you can ask her if shes okay she may or may not respond but thats only if you want to engage not to tell her to get over it you are well within your roommate rights to tell her the yelling on the phone can be heard in your room and its really getting to you if you look on psychology todays find a therapist tool and filter for sliding scale thats a start otherwise there are several lowcost slidingscale clinics in sf listed here you may need to show proof of income how to be open not worrying about judging its good to make sure you feel comfortable with the therapist ideally this would mean being able to interview them even a 15minute phone call to start often offered gratis but if you are looking at sliding scale or going to a clinic you usually dont get that option you will tell someone at intake what your concerns are in a general sense and they should put you with someone they think will be a good fit if you dont like the clinician you can ask to be placed with someone else but its worth giving them a try i will say i had one of my best therapists from a lowcost clinic years ago who helped me a lot good luck i mean its a transferrable skill to set building for film studio photography so you could maybe expand your job search well it is just delightful whimsy i love it im of the school of thought when you have an interaction with a nutter who has no boundaries your best option is to put as much space between you and the nutter as you can it sounds like there are already plenty of public reviews online describing her behavior so adding to those wont do much the bbb is unlikely to take any action since they are more about protecting people from being fleeced for money its okay to just walk away from this talk to your
