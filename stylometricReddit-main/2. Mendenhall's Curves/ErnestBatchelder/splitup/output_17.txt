together you can also tell her that her way of expressing her distress the cold shut down freaked you out at the end of the day people can give ultimatums they just have to accept the fall out people who receive ultimatums should decide if they really can abide by the requests and not agree to them if they cant its never stated explicitly but i always got the sense that logan married conners mother then abused a likely fragile person to the point of mental breakdown thus her institutionalization he would have married caroline for her pedigree as an aristocrat narcissists love owning things that give them prestige but the issue there is caroline was too much of an overt narcissist for them to work marcia was a good match likely a covert narcissist but she offered social prestige in how she presented was class and ageappropriate she understood she was meant to be a buffer she made logan look classy and she was to protect him from emotional fallout in return she was securing power for her bioson i think her long game was to sit out each of the roy kids failing and eventually get her son in somewhere important she was fine with affairs as long as they werent with important powerful women so the rhea affair broke the rules one of her most disarming power moves was to say the things you arent meant to say out loud in a charming unbothered way she totally recognized willa for what willa was because i am pretty sure during some of her early socialclimbing years she had been likely a paid escort of sorts a bunch of people replying to you acting like the rioters didnt want to kill senators and congressmen it wasnt a genuine attempt at a coup even if it was a disorganized hot mess some of those rioters went in with tactile gear on zip ties etc and mobs managed to kill 5 capital police officers from injuries several gop were completely on board and involved their secondary plan was to deny election results they didnt want to certify electoral votes wanted the coup to steal those videos show that rep loudermilk was giving hourslong tour the day before to showing a tour group the tunnels and several offices there were several republican representatives and senators that were hoping for an attack or dogwhistling for one on the capitol later denied election results they were 100 wanting a coup the real difference between italy or germanys fascist takeover history is lets be real both mussolini and hitler were better organized and better at the strong man stuff i think it was kind of the teacher told us we could ransack the classroom whyd we get in trouble mentality aka people who have no clue how anything actually functions this is so funny because while ive never been to miami i always had this assumption it was kinda las spiritual sister city in the us but with more humidity including the problems no i went out of town and left her to show the house sell it it was during the crazy peak of the market so i left to visit a friend and it was sold within the week edit we had a buyer within the week escrow was about a month id try putting a french drain and install a sump pump in my own basement before trying them he still makes little comments or tries to get me to watch videos or talk me into believing in a god or heaven so he is pushing his views on you because if hes really going to commit to this line of thinking then you are going to hell and he likely cant handle that so you would also need to convert honestly i am still trying to get over that his initial belief was the universe is created by aliens because i mean who created the aliens then why is that easier to accept than the big bang theory anyhoo you likely have to have a serious talk either he has his newfound faith and respects your boundaries that you dont want to share it with him or he finds himself a nice christian girl and you all go your separate ways wait did your dad cheat on your mom because thats info your mother deserves to know also cmon think about the seriously awkward future family events that staying in this relationship entails it wasnt a fun secret on her part it was her trying to avoid openly dating the son of the guy she had an affair with i lucked out so well when i went to sell my realtor was a really nice helpful one who also had adhd that lady helped me actually pack at one point i hadnt finished what i needed to get put away i left town for her to show and she called me like wtf and i started to cry she ended up finishing putting the last of the stuff away too i know i made her work so hard for that commission i like to think hope we are still friends because i really did like her as a person anyway your realtor is making serious commission off the sale of your house tell her or him to come over early before the open houses and hold your hand for a bit open houses are just as much for the realtor to get new clients as it is for them to help sell your home they can put some elbow grease in this cant be the first stupid thing he thinksbelieves or has said to you my advice is this learn the signs early so you dont waste a year on someone these comments made me insecure how do you have blonde hair if youre not even white when you are with someone and feel insecure because of the comments they make to you take note sometimes you can feel insecure because of your own baggage but if you are feeling good about yourself and the guy you are dating keeps saying stupid stuff that suddenly makes you feel selfconscious or bad about yourself speak up and tell them to knock it off if they dont then that means you are likely dating a jerk the also showed how much he enjoyed abusing greg the way he was abused by the company he chose to work for having money is not a prerequisite for being statushungry or moneygrubbing plenty of people will voluntarily social climb and toss aside less useful friends along the way the sugar in juice spike your glucose levels much faster than eating the sugars in whole fruit which are slowed down by fiber thats why if a diabetic is in a hypoglycemic state drinking a glass of orange juice is the easiest way to quickly get their blood sugar levels back up that being said a glass of juice fruit or vegetable isnt unhealthy imo it has need vitamins and minerals can be filling enough to stop you from snacking on unhealthy things or reaching for a soda and is fine in moderation love the skin on the second layer its phenomenal but i actually like the rougher look of the hair texture in the first pic go to kelly blue book online and put in all the details for the model mileage and youll see what they are selling for used in your area edit i would also have a mechanic check it out before buying we all grieve death in our own ways its poorly worded like english as a second language maybe i think the phrasing rise of toxic masculinity makes it the second interpretation because if they were looking for a country where women are subservient it wouldnt be a rising or new thing happening recently plenty of parts of the world have simply been that way for centuries tom has long been statushungry and moneygrubbing so i doubt his early friendships were deep emotional connections that being said he did so very wrong by the fly guys it is a very delightful frog pot i swear the oh thats so fabulous you should sell those is the kiss of death for all creative inspiration academic setting do you have accommodations or are in a country where you are eligible because if you do use them and if you dont apply asap i finally survived college started doing really well once i got my accommodations recorded all lectures got copies of notes and was eligible to take tests in a quiet room during lectures i sat in the very front because i found less distraction helped a bit if your school has an office of students with disabilities make an appointment asap is your mom in treatment because she may need med changes esp if shes bipolar schitzophrenic that being said none of her emergencies are emergencies even your uncle could have called a medic van if need be or plan ahead if he knew he was going to the hospital she wasnt supposed to know where i lived how did she find out and has she threatened you in the past because this is a bigger issue if your safety is at risk otherwise give her a breakdown during a nonmomemergency time when shes not calling you yelling mom i will not be helping you when i am at work you will need to come up with an alternative solution for any emergencies that arise when i am working during work hours i will be blocking your number you may not show up at my home during work hours come up with a short phrase if she does drop bys mom i can not help you i am working now if she has a psychiatrist you can tell her she needs to check in with them for a med check if your mom escalates to threats against you or herself you need to be prepared to 5150 her if you arent in it get therapy for being raised by an unstable parent it does a number on your ability to enforce boundaries good luck dont say no right out the gate sit her down and listen to the podcast together stop it when misogynistic crap comes up ask your daughter what she thinks about what was said ask questions and be inquisitive she might answer its funny or its cool so ask follow ups like how explain to me the joke she may hear it herself as she tries to explain share with her a bit why you see it as hurtful to women whats likely going on is some desire on her part for attention or to fit in theres a whole steaming pile of toxic shit out there right now that she doesnt need to step in but she also needs to get why she should be avoiding it ultimately yeah put your foot down that crap can bite her in the ass as shes getting ready to go to college because people can google her and find it but the bigger more important thing is to help her learn to hearsee what misogyny sounds and looks like to spot it please tell a trusted friend family member or someone in your life you know is safe whats going on try contacting a trained person at rainn who knows domestic abuse doesnt matter if he hasnt physically hurt you yet they can advise you on a safe exit yes you are in danger youve been forced into a relationship since you were a teen the dynamic is coercive you are punished for trying to leave your perception of normal is very skewed by that this is not normal and threats of violence lead to actions of violence get help getting out and staying safe nothing helps social anxiety like getting lectured
