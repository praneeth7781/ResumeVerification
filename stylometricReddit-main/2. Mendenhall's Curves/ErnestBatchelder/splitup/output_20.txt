to start a painting project in the apartment then lets schedule a weekend day where we get supplies and another day to complete it if you dont want to have this kind of dynamic be the taskfinisher police and you want a selfmotivated person who is a project finisher it doesnt sound like thats the person you are dating so you have to decide you may be somewhere on the aromantic spectrum id look it up and see if some of the descriptors fit your lived experience whatever you do you should be compassionate but honest with her it does take some people longer to find feelings for others but also sometimes you know right away and are just hiding the truth from yourself meanwhile she is growing feelings you are not you work together so you have invited in some serious potential drama to your life you were compatible over things like marriage and children wanting them but not what that actual scenario looked like real estate is very image oriented career path its not just that she wanted to travel and enjoy nice things her industry is about projecting that kind of lifestyle to appeal to clientele people are saying you are picking social work and a path to lower income but if you wanted to become a private practice therapist you can eventually make a stable middle class income while saving some slots for lower pay its not the same thing as being a social worker or working for the county sounds like she didnt want to wait for that to happen it takes time of grad school getting your clinical hours in and then building clients is several years you are looking at mid to late 30s before your income evens out she is already 5 years older and probably didnt want to wait until her 40s for a financially stable partner or to spend the last of her 30s with a grad student its not personal so much as incompatibilty in lifestyles getting out after several months because of seeing a glaring issue coming down the road is kind of a no harm no foul situation none of this makes you undatable but you do need to look for compatibility beyond more than just wants marriage wants kids and explore what potential partners wants their short term versus long term life to look like when you are ready you can put yourself back out there just start adding 20 minutes onto when you want to meet you want to meet at 8 tell her 820830 shes not going to stop this habit the compulsively early people are like the compulsively late people especially when it is anxiety fueled can they get better for a bit sometimes but it will creep back in just wait until you travel together and need to go to an airport you will be leaving 4 hours ahead of schedule its one of those things you can either relax and accept or its a deal breaker uh if your girlfriend thinks having your neck grabbed or face punched is good fun is okay with her friend doing that to you plus wants to live with this person you have a really really lousy girlfriend who doesnt give two craps about your health or safety solid like a rock clear direct communication ultimatum hey i know you are struggling but your constant dissatisfaction with me and your need to use me to vent all time are taking a toll on my mental health either you get help up help work on taking notice of how frequently you are criticizing me or using me to dump on or we have to break up sometimes a kick in the ass gets someone to realize how they are impacting others sometimes they dont want to change you can only find out by clear direct communication eh i have friends in 1015 year age gap relationships that are 100 from what i see and i admire their relationships but they were all grown up when they met each other a 42yearold and a 56yearold or even a 28yearold with a 38yearold whatever they are all adults if they have a healthy relationship good for them anyone who is still a teen dating someone in their midtwenties i am going to look a little askance at if there are clear issues in the relationship plus age gap then yeah theres usually a power dynamic issue someone in their 20s dating a 40 something ehhhh the good healthy agegap relationship people arent posting on reddit for another thing unless you are breeding to eat or you plan on keeping the rabbits for the duration of their lifetime there are not enough longterm homes for pet rabbits currently and county shelters are overflowing with older rabbits specifically because people breed them by longterm i mean their lifetime not a year and dumped at the pound there is no need to be raising domesticated rabbits to breed again outside of for food sources spay and neuter your pets you say you have a good therapist now so this is the perfect thing to discuss with him or her what is it that would make things right from your parents would an acknowledgment that what went on there was scarring for you even if the end result was what they wanted be enough rather than try to tell them about it ask your therapist to help you write a letter detailing some of what you went through it can be retraumatizing to revisit these things so important to have the therapist on board at the end of the letter tell them what you are looking for apology understanding etc the truth is they probably were at the end of their ropes with you and the boarding school told them a lot of what they wanted to hear so even if they have their suspicions about what you went through they are coping by being in denial for the record i went through something different but very similar over 30 years ago yup it is effing scarring but recovery is possible one thing that helps you get to forgiveness with others is knowing that you dont have to fear them anymore if the fear is this is something they did once it can happen again it is very hard to feel at peace with them some repairs may happen down the road when you are independent and no longer reliant on their decisions over your life you were 19 when a 25yearold woman was interested in you while you both clearly have physical and mental health issues that need support and work your relationship sounds toxic codependent and yeah abusive i could only read half of this then it just got too painful look a grown woman 6 years older than you is not your responsibility you need to find housing on your own and break up someone looping nonstop on childhood trauma isnt your job to fix and you couldnt fix her even if you wanted to all you are doing right now is enabling a deeply unhealthy person while not learning how to care for yourself dont spend the rest of your 20s like this plus the cuffed pants are illfitting and too short the whole look is awkward the stylist needs to be fired i love him as an actor but he is standing like he crapped his pants and his arms are trying to run away from the ensuing mess nah i agree with you i think we were meant to view logan in his prime as a strategic genius who was already losing it when the show starts the whole point is how that the type of person logan was machiavellian and a tyrant can create one thing a business empire but only by destroying another his kids most of his wives the children and other bit players are all malformed by logans legacy of abuse any wins are usually just them failing upwards and also tend to be shortlived logan was a king lear character his character flaw was his own lack of selfknowledge and inability to be loved or accept love so he demanded complete unquestioning allegiance instead i think a larger theme of the show is that logan may have successfully built an empire but he destroyed his family by doing so so his tragedy is that he has no one to leave the empire to the natural conclusion is where we are at the kids floundering and his legacy likely being destroyed kendall just had a small win last episode if i am correct he will blow it by next episode your father solved the garbage issue for you he took himself out of your and your sons life sounds by his behavior that is the most mature decision hes likely made in life i wouldnt sweat what hes telling others anyone who believes a oneyearold grandchild is out there breaking up marriages is another adult you also dont want to deal with enjoy your mom as a grandmother who knows she may have been looking for an out for years and this was the motivation she needed ugh thanks i had to edit that it could have been worsebetter and been pubic organism i think the fact that last season he was floating face down in the pool versus the final scene showing him floating face up is meant to illuminate his core issues havent changed but his position has improved yeah probably its the gross selfcentered behavior of that oeuvre its incredibly rude to the other concertgoers and to the performers i dont know why but i get absurdly pissed off at people who behave badly during any live performance performers put so much work into recitals and training the audience pays good money for seats and one asshole who thinks the world revolves around them needs to get loudly fingered yay for her public organism orgasm but do it quietly like a normal perv yeah i did the math they lost 6750 suck but wont kill them in the long run its the difference between acting in the us versus say if he were acting in the uk or in the theater here if you ever watch inside the actors studio plenty of a list actors talk like he did about craft i think he got skewed because hes not at their level and he doesnt fall into the friendly easy teen crushtype personalities most upandcoming tv actors who want success in the us now tend to follow its even built into the way people go about fandom now with a stronger sense of parasocial relationship and ownership people want a cute blank slate to project their ideas onto is he a bit pretentious absolutely but does it help him do a great job at the character hes playing sure so no reason to mock it i like the shakespearean nods in the show it reminds me of how deadwood approached storytelling no collars so unless they got out of their collars and jumped out of the back of a truck going slow enough for that to happen this was likely dumping even if they did get out of their collars they shouldnt have been riding in the back of a pickup on the freeway for this exact reason and its still pretty shitty ownership first youll need to set up your downline list any friends you think would want in on this exciting opportunity just kidding obviously the wrong sub but i do like the parallels since both involve reaming someone metaphorically speaking any shelter right now is overflowing with rabbits if you can make the drive the san jose animal care has hundreds some are young and some are incredibly friendly i was considering going back to school to get a masters in art history or any art
