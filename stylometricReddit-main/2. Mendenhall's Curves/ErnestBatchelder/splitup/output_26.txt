counseling to deal with any emotional fallout but whatever your gut instincts tell you you need to do you can trust your insticts are right you are in seattle but in ca it is like this landlord must accept first qualified applicant the 2012 fair housing handbook of california says on page 24 the landlord should take the time to check out the information and make a selection based on the first qualified applicants although there is no statute to support this its recommended but not law basically even if it is seattle law its got no real way of being enforced while they are only taking zillow applications they can also claim someone was there before you and gave them an inperson application and you have no real way of disputing it if they didnt receive the credit report they can use that reason so i would resolve the issue with experian or get pdf from experian or transunion since those are more official than credit karma edit if your main concern is how long to reach back out check in by end of day today and ask if the credit report still qualifies you or if theyd like to receive something from the other two if they only take messages through zillow they should be checking it once a day at least being too eager but polite isnt a crime first off i am sorry for your loss but you are going to have to forgive yourself and in a way you owe the friend an apology for putting her in this situation if one dog is aggressive reactive to the point of fighting that dog needs training just keeping two dogs who live in the same household separated was never a tenable longterm situation at the very least have them housesat separately when away because an untrained reactive dog left without its owner that was the moment it was going to happen forward the email to the pm cc all parties on the lease write at the top pm is handling this unit for legal purposes please keep all communication with the correct party i will not be responding to any future correspondence block and live your life you are paying the pm to deal in the future with asshole people never be generous because its never enough if you are in therapy talk to your therapist if you are not in therapy get into therapy someone taking no action to change the cycle or help themselves is difficult to observe someone taking even babysteps to get out of where they are at makes it much easier for a partner to cope can you rectify the situation yes with the right person you can it will take some active listening and being vulnerable and honest without dumping on them i know ive been hard to live with and youve taken the brunt of where i am at right now can i do something small or can we plan something fun and not heacy to help us both have some relief i am working on looking to get myself help problem is thats hard to do when youre depressed so that is why you need to be seeking outside help to get yourself there that poor monstera has already seen some things if you are with someone who puts you down and makes you feel bad about yourself for something as innate as how you speak you are with a bad person relationships should in theory be with people who lift us up you deserve better edit for nonuk dwellers he is basically telling her she sounds workingclass or lowerclass dudes a little twat i vote its fake but wellwritten revenge fantasy does sally has no shame i said enough is enough my parents need to see what kind of person maya is oop meant to write what kind of person sally is but lost track of the character list id say thats just a mixup but given how much resentment the entire saga is about how horrific sally is kinda weird to suddenly forget sallys name there as someone who has lived in both the us is still probably much faster paced than the grinding slowness of the uk but know that some systems are pretty effed here postpandemic while its not the bureaucratic or the oldtimey some things still only exist in a paper trail call your solicitor slowness there supply chain issues have caused a lot of issues in almost all industries from construction appliances cars to even restaurants and pretty much universally hearing that from the cheapy hmos to even higherend private medical care there is a burnout factor medical professionals in certain fields seem less careoriented getting appointments has become difficult and everywhere is understaffed from the great resignation also much higher increase across the country in car accidents and fatalities americans completely forgot how to even pretend like they care when driving still what we dont have in easy access to great produce and meat delightfully named cookies biscuits we make up in 24 hour grocers with 1015 types of frozen pizzas if the suicidal thoughts continue call or text someone at the hotline your life is easily worth more than 5000 and you have a kid so thats the number one priority number two priority if you had a therapist call them or go to a meeting get some help for staying sober if you have friends or family that you trust who are a good support system tell them what is going on your financial messup isnt the worst by a long shot get your mental health squared away first so some community colleges have a program where you can study abroad for a semester its not the same as enrolling in a european university but with a 23 gpa thats really your only path but a better focus would be to keep going to the community college you are at start attending the tutoring center for assistance in the classes you are struggling in then transfer to a decent 4 year school that has a study abroad program until you deal with whats causing the low grades distractions time management learning issues an overseas trip isnt going to make you a better student unacceptable especially pic 2 and 3 they did such a crap job id be worried if they know how to do it right send pics to the owner if he or she had a crew ask for different people to come back to fix it when say put your foot down do you mean floor it like push down fast and all the way to the floor with the gas pedal because i basically have avoided that after the first few lurches if i press down smoothly not too fast i have no problem with smooth acceleration look up subaru throttle calibration on the subaru outback forums theres some calibration you can do at home or the second thing is you can have the dealer reset the adaptive memory when it comes to shifting and the car learning how aggressivesubdued the driver is from my basic understanding the first 1000 miles is you kinda training the car to handle various driving situations so its good to avoid flooring it during that period again just trying to learn the nuances myself hubs really wants to move to a cheaper state where we will have no income tax make sure he looks into the cost of property taxes in the new state lots of ca residents moved to cheaper regions only to realize property taxes are much higher even if cost of housing is lower anyway as for the rest of it sounds like the new home ticks all your boxes and ca housing is never that hard hit even in a recession what drops comes back fairly quickly so if you plan on this to be a forever home or even your next 57 year home you will make it back in equity increased property values down the road still trying to figure it out so take with a grain of salt i have the xt if i am already at 2000 rpm and then trying to get up to higher speed everything goes very smoothly if i am oh trying to run through a yellow light has happened a few times and floored it last minute to get through then there was a weird pause almost like the car is thinking about which gear it wants then a high lurch forward basically if i am very smooth on the throttle and never lead foot the gas pedal all the way to floor there is a fairly smooth response in getting up to speed anytime i am running around in traffic then suddenly want an immediate speed up bad response i know what does he expect tenants with ibs to do hold it seconded for michael sealy i forgot about him he got me through some rough sleep periods you may be able to make enough of a stink pardon the pun to get out of your lease if its a big concern for you you are having physical symptoms you can avoid the 750 fee and find online labs that will send you a few petri dishes you leave out in various rooms then mail back to their lab for an assessment for about 100 is it the most reliable sensitive nope but if there really is enough mold to be making that kind of smell something will likely show in the

need a boyfriend she needs a treatment center to dry out in 30 days sober with meetings and a support group and to want to do that on her own you cant make her unless you actually do leave because without help shes going to be drinking again you are going to keep moving the goalposts and are currently her enabler go to alanon and learn about codependency eh at some point especially in your 20s you realize some friend groups arent meant to last forever the selling you out for clout part bugged me not 100 even sure what that means but it sounds like they put you down to make them look better thats just shitty behavior focus on the new people in your life if theres someone in the group you especially like or felt really close to in the past you can have a oneonone with them and tell them how you feel but focus on new people near where you live explore your interests and expand your circles never make more effort for people than they are showing you they want to make for you yeah i have adhd was a hot mess at 25 but held down a job and i sure as hell didnt have a kid but if i was away from my pet rabbit that i loved i thought about him all the time out of sight out of mind is an
