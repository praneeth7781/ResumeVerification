as a result i would respond with facts only keep it short and sweet the more calm and clear you are in your response the more you appear totally reasonable in dealing with an unreasonable host it sounds like she is still upset in some ways with me even though i dont think i did anything wrong she is still taking my decisions for my life personally other than a very notable lack of succinct apology are you reading between the lines or was that explicit in the letter she may want to apologize in person or she may not feel she does owe you an apology if you need an apology to let her back in then this is probably worth letting go of because you cant know what will happen sometimes people are in terrible dark places and unfairly project their lived reality onto others in unfair ways and they fail to be happy for others when they are miserable or maybe you were being more thoughtless towards her than you realized in the time up to your marriage maybe a little of both i would write back to her what you said in your post i love my stepkids and my husband and am not interested in hearing any judgment or negativity about my family if we can speak without that occurring then lets catch up you can create any boundary you want invite her back into your life as long as she can agree to that boundary then it is on her if she wishes to do so if she really wants to rehash why she believes you failed her by entering a loving marriage as a stepmom which is clearly ridiculous that boundary would pretty much weed her out i could maybe see some hotel cyprus having nondrinkable tap water ive stayed in a few hotels in the uk in the last decade and they were all pretty americanized at this point i was almost sad that everything felt like a midtier standardized marriot or hilton so i am wondering where the dirty beds and undrinkable water are not saying they dont exist within the euro zone or eu as a whole but curious they wanted us to agree to a complete appraisal fallout as well as non refundable earnest they knew from the beginning the amount of work the house needed they are sellers convinced that their neighbor sold last year a house in better condition with better mortgage rates for x amount of money and they deserve to make the samemore walk if they come to their senses on a counter still be very realistic with yourselves that there will be more repairs you will discover as you go along even the best inspection will miss them would you be happier longterm in a semiless special spot but with much fewer headaches curious if you are in eastern europe not used to seeing nonpotable water in most western european countries he needs a good talk maybe hell change his behavior and understand me you both need to have a real discussion that goes both ways this is one of those things that shouldnt be one persons way over the others it should be are we fundamentally compatible or fundamentally incompatible on this issue if the latter its better to part ways sooner rather than later for the record i never had or wanted children but it is such a huge decision that both people need to be really honest about it if he really wants kids sooner rather than later he needs to admit as much and make plans with a partner that feels that way too otherwise it just breeds pardon the pun deep resentments its not fair to him or you for him to be with you pretending hes okay with the given timeline and secretly just hoping youll one day wake up and change your mind which sounds like what is happening or it was a blip and he was having an off day soft scrub with bleach mix it into a looser paste with water sponge scrub it all over the tub let it sit for an hour rinse repeat if still needed but probably wont someone offered higher and better but their inspection turned up several major problems roofing foundation electrical plumbingsewer line someone waived contingencies so their offer looked better but then the house didnt appraise or they still did their inspection and were willing to walk and lose earnest money so to smooth the sale over the seller lowered someone made a lower offer but it was all cash or a huge deposit and in the interest of a quicker sale less risk a loan could go wrong the sellers took it how you cant raise livestock in your apartment and you also have to send your daughters to school by law honestly shocked early 2000s italy under berlusconi was taking that brave a stance on womens rights went through the same thing with the medical groups then i just went through my insurers list and made an appointment with a doctor covered by my insurance but not with any medical group your insurer has to provide you with a list of all doctors in your area that take their insurance so even if their online system is effed call them and they should email you a complete list good luck it sucks pawhd in pet psychology i know thats why i used the past tense actively avoided the hollywood area aside from the arclight inversely id walk to the hollywood sign all the time it was a fun hike heres a breakdown of what the fair housing act covers race color national origin religion sex including gender identity and sexual orientation familial status disability familial status usually means you cant refuse to rent to a pregnant woman or people trying to adopt i have no clue what the agent is thinking i would say you are within your rights to say that all tenants living in the unit over 18 are subject to a background check i dont know what to believe but you do know your body is telling you walking on eggshells is what a human under duress fight or flight or freeze mode does to try and keep the person safe you have internalized some of his manipulations as to why this is okay he has earlier trauma his work is stressful the bruises are from accidents even though throwing things is an intentional action not an accident hes laid down the emotionally manipulative groundwork im the love of his life for you to keep upping your tolerance to be his wastebasket when he wants to toss anger into something but you know listen to your gut which is telling you none of this is okay and the inbetween good times are just reprieve moments from the next emotional bomb session my feelings on airbnb which i had used for 10 years as a guest in the us several countries are that 1 oversaturation fastpaced growth have done it a great disservice 2 a lot of newer people who jumped into the game have zero experience with hospitality and arent cut out for it in earlier years the only people that gravitated towards it had more inclination with hospitality i used craigslist for years to buy and sell stuff i saw the same shift there most of the time you would be dealing with the best of humanity in pleasant interactions and all would be good it was fun to swing by a strangers garage have a short convo and pick up a very niche item then move on the occasional bad interaction or weirdo would be really sheisty though then there was a shift where just more clearly scamoriented postings than good ones my current theory is that any online platform has a window where only people truly interested in that thing are involved and as it gets larger it just becomes more unwieldy used to be about a decadelong shelf life now seems to cycle within 57 years its a stimulant that helps make up for the perpetual lack of natural vitamin d so my whole life i am the weirdo who is only attracted to people based on personality not looks their physical attraction grows along with my fondness for them and getting to be witness to their actions that endear me conventionally hot people i can appreciate them but unless they have a personality to back up their looks i dont feel attraction you are pretty young and being concerned with how others perceive you is pretty common insecurity especially during the phase of life when you are still figuring out who you are and how you want others to perceive you i suggest you start noting when you are out things he does that you love small stuff make yourself more present to really see him in the world what you will probably see is the wonderful person you care for so start telling yourself in those moments how lucky you are to be with someone like that the internal shift towards yourself and your bf will help shut up the insecurities about the external world the more you also acknowledge how great he is the more you shift how other people perceive you as a couple the out of his or her league stuff is bullshit that has no place in mature love and respect stop giving it headspace the official term is democratic backsliding or autocratization while the article focuses on wealth inequity the shift in our supreme court the granting of corporations the same rights as people increase in the wealth gap are all more on par with an oligarchy than a democracy add bullying threats now common for smaller elections school boards county positions county election offices goes along with that plus our last election was the eradication of a standard democratic norm the peaceful transition of power so we are a few stages into backsliding now cash out refinance and use it for investmentrental property i wish people would stop watching youtube gurus on how to get rich quick schemes because being a landlord isnt passive easy income it should be viewed as a real pt job that is supplying a needed service you tap into the 300k for a heloc at 78 for a downpayment to buy an apartment or small rental in a crazyhigh market place needs some work got to cover mortgage and property taxes property management costs enough money set aside for any major repairs you arent recouping a large profit on that enjoy your home and be happy to get

sell my paranoid brain thinks but what if there is a fire and im already asleep with carbon monoxide poisoning someone rescuer tries the door then cant open it and moves on i feel like too many organizations in the us at least tend to use cultish tactics or have very strong tendency to use cult of personality to get people to identify with them even if they arent really cults i have done my informal education and wont ever fall for it lol i even left a meditation retreat early once because i was like nope day 23 theyre suddenly feeding us less cult nope sold a house in a gentrifying part of la county i never loved in 21 for double what i paid thinking it was the peak and id get back in in a year have been tracking ever since both in socal and a few spots in northern ca if priced at
