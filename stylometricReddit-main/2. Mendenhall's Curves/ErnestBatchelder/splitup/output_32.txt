get through the day but some people also truly give up having depression adhd or autism means you deserve support and help only we do have to at some point in life meet people halfway and get outside help not rely on a single friend parent or spouse as your only source of caretaking or support you had a terrible realtor if the inspection contingency was not waived then no need to forfeit your earnest money also you 100 made the right choice manufactured homes are the one area where repairs often cost more than the value the original building materials are worth and once water is in walls for a long time you are looking at mold conditions your daughter is 100 correct also as long as you are talking to her every night then you arent really seeing who else is out there that is actually available and actually interested in dating you id go so far as to guess you might be in love with her because shes not available it is a convenient way for you to feel like you have somebody while not risking a real relationship go really date some women who want to be dating and are officially single yeah that agent wants to buy it or a friend of his wants it or he wants to do a quick sale without having to market it for them unless it is in really poor condition theres no benefit for them to have fewer eyes on the house if they havent signed a seller agreement with him thats so shady that i would cut him loose a properly wired habitable unit should be able to handle a coffee maker and microwave or have the right amount of outlets on separate breakers thats not extreme use its called pharmacogenomic testing i linked you to a mayo clinic page describing the process op said he was taking effexor its primarily used for antidepressants and i know it has been used somewhat for adhd meds it doesnt say what meds will work but narrows down metabolizing issues to let a psychiatrist at least see what is more likely to work better have fewer side effect issues any words of advice for how i might respond since hes gone unilateral in his decisionmaking putting his foot down you go unilateral in yours i will be quitting the restaurant and continuing to expand my business you can either support me or we can talk with lawyers a partnership consists of compromises and two people supporting each other youve compromised for years now he wont do either in return also waitressing has a shelf life its physically exhausting work not that 35 is old by any means but a lifetime career of being a waitress is asking for physical impairments as you get into your 40s ask me how i know if you are priced below market you will get extra attention at market not so much zillow i believe has a system where renters can fill out a form once and then blanket apply to as many apartments as they want so it is a noharmnofoul situation for people to apply to as many places as theyd like clearly list your requirements in the post but expect to have applicants ignore the requirements by those same measures just ignore any applicants who dont qualify pretty sure he had to fork over your social security number to do this and any money hes made off of you would have been issued 1099 reports to the irs as you were falsely made an independent contractor you can report this for identity theft possibly tax fraud quite frankly thats i would do or you can speak to him that you need every piece of paper on this your name removed from the whole shindig or you will be reporting him he wont want to do that because it will take away his downline hes created but you need to get this done asap id also temporarily freeze my credit get a credit report and make sure he hasnt opened any lines of credit for himself in your name sorry your dad is sleazy i get why people feel rejected by others but the truth is what causes you to be rejected by someone has nothing intrinsically to do with you it has to do with their projection onto you and the combination both of you make together in each other you have no idea if both women are the love of his sexytime life paid escorts after he went full mra if his life is filled with nostrings sex fests or lonely at his core maybe he discovered viagra maybe he dropped acid and had an epiphany or maybe its all false surface level changes we never know what truly is happening behind closed doors married now and ive got two children and wouldnt trade them or my wonderful husband for the world then put your money where your mouth is do not contact plan something wonderful to do with your family and enjoy appreciate the life you do have not the past one that is no longer there if you are still ruminating on this months from now get therapy my friend is the only person i allow to come over when it looks this way and she knows that except you were asking a favor for another issue you have beeping smoke alarm so i am pretty sure under the emergency circumstances she prioritized helping you in a way most convenient for her you could have texted hey place is a mess can you just run up and help me while he waits in the car friend is not a mind reader she helped you the best she was able i think its best for you to be grateful you have a friend who comes over to help and let the rest go with the intent to communicate with better clarity next time i like it its one of those got to do the whole place or paint it over the disjointed feeling is in part that you havent completed it yet probably if you painted the cabinets on the vanity and the little side cabinet in the same taupe once youre done or painted them both the same white that would help the main clash right now is that each cabinet is different you have the quartz countertop to contend with wall design i feel like hes completely lost interest in me i am willing to bet if you got wife 13 into a room together theyd all have a similar tale to tell moves quickly loving and present gets married loses all interest should i make a last ditch effort and pay for marriage counseling you can certainly broach it but if his response is that you should pay for it in its entirety instead of splitting the cost that tells you how much effort he will put in to the work needed to salvage things it just sounds like you married a serial monogamist who is in love with love but not in love with actual people i love old vintage salton sea postcards it absolutely was once was a charming vacation destination instead of a manmade cancer cluster and algae bloom mess we have been seeing a counselor for nearly a year i am a big believer in marriage counseling but sometimes counseling is helpful to get people to the point of realizing whats broken isnt getting fixed and walking away as amicably as possible what is it you are looking for when you complete a task a thank you you could tell her you need to hear some appreciation criticisms commentary are fine you missed a spot but they are heard better after a positive reaffirming statement thank you so much for your hard work theres a corner that needs some help ill fix it etc etc and the information hits differently tone goes a long way if this is someplace youve both been before and it keeps happening anyway even after honest communication about both your needs you may be getting your answer question have you looked at what current homes in your area comps in okay condition are going for now that you know the varying issues on the home you will legally have to disclose those to new buyers markets are slowing in some areas where mortgage rates are impacting if its still in fixer upper status no one waves inspections it may be a tough sell unless it is priced below comps yeah sewer lining feels like one of those bs things a yearly roter rooter does the same or better to just keep roots out of your line and move on unless part of the entire sewage system has collapsed on one hand its only been 4 months some people take longer to integrate a partner into their family on the other hand sounds like his family are in his daily life and hes locking you in a bedroom to keep you from his dad wtf just be blunt and honest it really feels at this point like you want to keep me away from your family i feel like you are ashamed of me given you are deeply tied to family your behavior around this i dont see us going anywhere longterm can you confirm this or explain whats going on for you sell it to carvana process is quick and pay off what you owe salton sea is likely beyond repair its a much younger lake from the early 1900s colorado river run off into a sink and it will never see those levels again in southern california everyone reliant on the colorado river including new mexico and arizona are likely going to run out of access its also the most polluted lake in california i think with problematic saline levels about 100 years of chemical runoff from all the farms down there once that dried up as it lost water levels over the past few decades even the air makes people sick rip ask your doctor to do genetic testing for meds it will give you both an idea of how quickly you metabolize various medications that may help point you both in the right direction why dont you try solo therapy first so you can maybe get to the root of what it is thats upsetting you about him yup the longer you look at listings the better you get at seeing the photoshop and computer mockups whole house glows with a bright white light yet theres no sun spots from the window falling shadows andor overhead lights are on its a dark place and they just amped the photo brightness every room gets weird and elongated towards the front stretch filter feature that can make a twin bed look like a warped full or a toilet bowl thats super long computer simulation ones nothing in real life sits with those lines and usually the shadows have a funky feel to them mostly because there is zero light source to even indicate where theyd come from but also the furniture always seems a little like its hovering in space theyre offering to pay for part of an overall improvement on your place the issue between current fixtures and recessed can be that normal ceiling overheads can leave a place feeling dark depending on how much light it gets during the day so its a longterm improvement for the apartment id be inclined to keep a good tenant who wants to make improvements over the unit is taking care of it happy especially if costs of the improvement are reasonable and you already have a 3 year history but thats me i mean i do does it work nah but feels good location dependent of course but if we ever got even close to 2019 wed still
