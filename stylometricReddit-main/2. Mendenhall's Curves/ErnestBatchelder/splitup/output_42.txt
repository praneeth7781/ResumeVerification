around them what specifically do you want him to do to help you seek outside help if you have some clear criteria like stay with you while you do a google search or make one call per week then ask specifically for that otherwise its this amorphous request for help while also taking your moods out on another person i would highly suggest getting a good enough for now therapist who specializes in generalized anxiety disorder maybe they arent a longterm therapeutic partner to explore deeper trauma with they arent the right age or you dont feel they get you completely but they have some sort of modality even cbt to help you get started on taking back some agency over this yourself you are ok with having a child with someone youve known for a couple of months the dudes a relative stranger wait until you have a child and hes running to his friend before approving any life decisions im sorry theres close to no way this works out id take this over to rrealestate given some mortgage lenders hang out there maybe here too your next best is looking at arms do with that what you will or trying credit unions if you are parallel parking then you are going park assist will freak out and beeeeeeeeep as long as anything is in the red zone including a high enough curb look at your rearview camera next time its in reverse rab is on the left and p for park assist is on the right turn p off and no beeps tell her you are taking a break then do a temp block you dont need this right now what a clusterfuck of behavior reserve your emotional energy for where it matters after that he told me many other things that he wasnt impressed with about me i am at a complete loss as to why you started dating again after that x200b he clearly has way higher emotional support expectations hes needy you can just say needy x200b i do not want to cut him off completely since hes going through some stuff not your problem youve known this guy for a month a month you all arent compatible in the least when you are dating someone at least the first month should be fun getting to know them this all sounds like work with a critical guy who demands care taking exhausting send a short text we arent compatible and this isnt working out i lived briefly in an ideal fern climate lots of warm rain high humidity people had porch ferns that looked like that even there under ideal conditions i kill ferns my home country is generally politically apathetic theres just not much to be involved in and everything is working 90 great whered you come from because id like to move from the us to there general distrust in government has been a part of us culture for generations but we are now living in a posttruthmyfacebookconspiracyisasgoodfact america and it is tiring age gap in the comments you state that you previously told him clearly you are not into bsdm there was no prediscussion this time which in bsdm there should always be a discussion of what is okay and how to communicate to stop where he got permission none of this is okay the fact that it startled you into not reacting in the moment is exactly what hes testing for how far can he push nonconsensual behavior with you dont feel bad that you were too shocked to say or do anything just get out now my trader joes plant experience 1 bring plant home settle it in plant lives forever grows into nice healthy plant 2 bring plant home settle it in dies within 2 weeks of seemingly nothing i find that it takes a fair amount of emotional energy to maintain text conversations with people i am dating you are in grad school and working you might not have enough emotional energy in general to date toward the goal of a serious relationship you mention in college it was easier because you lived in a campus environment in real life you do have to commit a certain amount of time energy to trying to meet people and unless you are in a cult or living on a commune itll be rare to ever have that kind of builtin social life again its pretty common for people to text as a way to build intimacy if thats really not your style tell people early on while you are dating that you tend to prefer inperson conversations and are not a great texter but also really consider if you have the space for a relationship right now too separate accounts isnt the issue but given you are not earning the issue is 1 you have no real idea what his earnings are or this mysterious budget 2 you are reliant on someone who is keeping you in the dark id tell him either 1 you get to know the full amount in his accounts even if your name isnt on it and that there is a decent and mature discussion about cost of living increasing to run the household and he stops asking if youve paid down your credit card with monopoly money or 2 you are looking to go back to work parttime in which case he can expect to pick up some of the household chores you currently take care of others mention its bordering on financial abuse for 2 earners 2 separate accounts and one joint account make sense to me for 1 earner to have 1 account the other is in the dark over is a messed up dynamic kaiser is hit or miss my parents have it kaiser probably saved my mothers life meanwhile i am pretty sure the care there and a lot of neglect even when i have tried to advocate for him has likely shortened my dads life sutter health palo alto medical foundation takes my ppo and i think they take anthem if i do a lot of research on doctors you can get some really good ones there and it is affordable if you need a specialist at standford sutter health doc can refer you and then it should be covered by anthem i mean you bring up fire exits the pandemic was also the same year the entire west coast was on fire for a few months there personally think we dont like to admit 20202021 was a mindfuck of massive proportions that changed the way a lot of people behave honestly youd probably prefer to see shows at the wiltern i dont know how old you are but its been my lived experience that at a certain point in my life i no longer enjoyed any situation where i felt sardined into a crowd indoors places like the hollywood bowl always feel good because the outdoor nature and its well organized but even then the greek theater is better imo for a show because its just a nice size worklife balance everywhere in the us is going to be tough but culturally texas imo is its own tough nut to crack i have only been through varying cities in texas a few times so i am not going to lie like i know the state but it always feels like being in its own country within even the us is she open to relocating within the us you could take time to do some traveling and find a better region that suits you both youll still work until you die but the us is huge with regions that really vary in terms of lifestyle and climate a conversation in a respectful marriage should make this stop you should be able to say something like albert you never use my name myra and it hurts my feelings furthermore the bird whistle to call me is degrading either start using my name and asking for things nicely or ill be ignoring your bird calls if they continue but by all means you can find a blue jay to fly in and assist you then start actively ignoring the damn bird call he continues because it works hell when you hear it throw on a coat and go run an errand or take a walk hes trained you like a dog so reversetrain him like a dog also reflect on other aspects of your marriage where you husband is demeaning theres usually more than one facet go back to therapy stop saying its a onetime thing your daughter is going to remember that afternoon or at least have a deep emotional imprint of when daddy cried over cookies for years to come i told her that she has no idea how i feel because ive never seen her braking down like that and questioned whether she even misses her late husband and that is a very selfcentered view of grief and a low blow to a woman you credit as having helped you through the worst time in your life you ever think she was busy being strong for you that she had to learn how to quietly process her grief on her own go back to therapy p means park assist was probably on it beeps like hell oh wow thats tough he either agrees to marriage counseling and he works hard at your marriage or divorce pretending that having a dating app while your wife is raising a newborn is a whoopise daisy is beyond bullshit its divorce worthy but i can see why you wouldnt want to go there first he wants to fix this then he starts showing up i believe kids are better off the children of divorce with parents who can coparent well than growing up witnessing a loveless marriage shes 25 so shes the youngest she might be a manipulating cow or she may be extremely insecure or maybe both whatever it is shes a social bully and shes picking on you stand up for yourself talk to her next time she corrects you simply say teal is a shade of blue and it really makes me feel crappy when you nitpick on what i say it happens a lot could you please stop do it in front of everyone do it right when it happens stay calm formula her bad behavior how it makes you feel whether shes doing it intentionally or not calling someone out calmly can make a person correct their behaviors the others probably havent even noticed it but shes not going to want to be seen as mean after that so shell work on it shell probably come up to you later gushing about how she didnt mean to blah blah blah just tell her its a pattern and it needs to stop next just talk to anna about how you are feeling if shes a longtime friend shell hear you without judgment whats the worse that can happen you already feel youve lost your friend group and are having anxiety taking action reduces anxiety if it turns out she has manipulated people into changing how they feel about you after all these years then its the painful process of having lost a friend group but you deserve better you already feel like that maybe pushing back gets you back to where you want to be in your relationships and she becomes aware of her bad behavior towards you so besides betraying your trust your bf is a drug addict edit i see your comments below where you say its complicated its not complicated hes an addict he will lie cheat and steal and you can either stay in it and watch it all go down and addicts take everyone down with them or leave now hes not quitting until he decides to and you cant make that happen
