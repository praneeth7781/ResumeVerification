you now shes just going to blame you next time the blue in the shade is almost a rich more interesting gray ive always had grey or neutral cars though so i wasnt daring enough its my second subaru but my first outback the xt so far has been really fun to drive enjoy i just got the same but in the java brown interior with grey outside whenever i see the blue in the shade i really like it congrats shes a 22yearold woman who does great work for you and is allowed a life outside of her job if your daughters saw her pictures and thought princess that tells me these are likely normal bikini vacation pictures dont bring it up but if it ever comes back up then shut the neighbor down much more in defense of sofia tell her shes a fantastic nanny and her hours outside of work are not owned by you or your husband but if it offends her or her husbands sensibilities they can certainly block sofia on any social media he leaves for a long time to smoke rude gets pissy you talk with someone else while he left you alone possessiveinsecure leaves you there rude and insecure is already drunk alcoholic next he proceeds to break down about an ex from 5 years ago an abortion and his depression on a first date so you make out with him the guy was screaming i am an emotionally stunted unstable alcoholic with serious issues the 3rd date weirdness was telegraphed to you from moment one im not trying to be mean i am just saying this guy was an arse from the get go and each step of the way that he becomes a bigger arse you keep following him in i stand by my point recalibrate how you believe you should be treated i mean yes marriage kids and i love you by date 2 could qualify as love bombing i guess but the whole thing reads more like hes a terrible drunk and batshit crazy so just why why continue after the first drama bullshit behavior on the 1st date friend even your standards for what you think would qualify as love bombing are low like that first date was yikes 2nd one was yikes 3rd one was holy hell god wtf please recalibrate how you believe you should be treated any addictive medicine is only good to use during highly stressful extreme situations imo as a daily tool to cope with physical or mental stress no bueno welcome to getting hooked i feel the same way about xanax ativan ambian do i loooove them yes yes i do do they eventually make everything worse in my lived experience yes yes they do epsom salt baths magnesium to tolerance or potassium and look into drug interactions if you take medication but most of all take a daily walk and then stretch or do some simple yoga it is not easy by any means but its the only thing i have found that will be successful over the long term otherwise im staring down the barrel of physical dependence please dont have a child with an abusive rageaholic who used to hit you with objects please its not your job to help him and dont think for one minute that once you are pregnant this all goes away it all gets very much worse he just prefers to make the money and buy it whenever we can thats cute whens that going to be he was in love with the idea of finding a house together and doesnt feel like getting it from my dad satisfies this dream again great dream and exactly how much money is saved for a downpayment towards this dream what monthly mortgage can you afford have you looked at current mortgage rates and what homes are selling for sorry but your partner 1 is being an ass 2 should not get a say regarding an inheritance between you and your dad you arent married and have no legal financial ties with a boyfriend do not cut your nose off to spite his face it sounds like his ego at wanting to be a provider is making him insert himself into something that he has no right to control he can move in with you to your property and pay you rent if this is really the hill he wants to die on if this is in the us the current housing market is a disaster most people who get into first homes now actually do benefit from inheritance unless your dad was abusive coercive with money or a monster to forgo that opportunity over ego would make me question the long term viability of the relationship in other words hes being a very stupid dumbass the only advice is block him hes in a frat there is likely a collection of girls pics being shared the only reason hes charming and pursuing you is getting pics from a girl who initially refuses is probably worth double points also you have great boundaries you stick to them thats fantastic but you need better instincts to cut out boundary stompers earlier and faster everything you describe about this guy is fake charm insisting on sex insisting on pictures sending you unwanted pictures calling you a tease stating you need to pay back a favor this is sexually coercive behavior you know very clearly he does not actually respect boundaries yet you are hanging on like this behavior is changeable there are redeemable qualities here its not there isnt i am a woman who is hetero but goddamn i love big noses on women look up rossy de palma or anjelica huston actresses in the 70s and 80s could still have noses with real definition before it became law everyone had to get them fixed and have the same little nocharacter schnoz i miss big interesting noses in film and tv they add visual interest to faces i find it so nice to see all types of faces in the world instead of the narrow definition of attractive we currently lean toward fixed teeth small nose straight hair smoothedout skin the point i am trying to make is you deserve someone who adores you for your nose and whole face not despite it those people exist its great this one gave himself away after 5 dates so you can cut him loose dont even tell him why hell backtrack accept nothing less than enthusiastic appreciation of who you are i dont think its manipulation depending on the attitude behind it but you both need a set of ground rules for living together have a clear explicit conversation state one last time you want a committed relationship and dont want to be hooking up anymore if she really does not want that with you then you need to respect her wishes in other words not im rejecting you sexually to punish you for hurting my feelings but hey i need to protect myself here so were changing our dynamic you both need to really decide what is best for raising a child together get a legal agreement in order with both parents rights stated and if separate homes is the way to go no offense but the whole thing is really messy at least put the kid first from here on out including working on your communication with each other to coparent decently it looks like a pretty small space so id stay with a warm white or match the tile but a few shades lighter a warm greigey taupe but very light there are lots of fun colors that would complement the tile especially in the earthy green ranges but as you can see with the busy shower curtain already more feels like a lot with those tiles better to get some continuity on the walls and open it up well sometimes having someone recognize how much they hurt you helps apologies are great but not if they dont include a complete understanding of the pain theyve caused think of it this way currently you are struggling in the friendship you are worried if you bring it up you will be put down or theyll minimize it but what if they realize it was really bad for you and acknowledge that so you can feel trust again say nothing friendship is struggling in its current state say something and it blows up well at least you got your answer as to how good of friends they are say something and clear the air friendship is made whole again the other thing is sometimes friendships just run their course but its always worth trying communication first before deciding that next time he does it in front of others calmly respond im sick of feeling like shit around you every time you insult me about how i look it isnt a joke theres nothing funny in it its just mean and spiteful please stop do it in front of others people go along to get along until someone stops it if you stay calm and speak clearly without sounding upset it really drives the point home basically a little public shaming is needed also you are defending him in the comments as decent 90 of the time but hes really not hes a misogynist that saw you as someone who could potentially fuck and now that thats off the table his instinct is to deride you not really a friend and actually not a decent person the post actually makes more sense if they were all living in a zoo i think you have a drinking problem picks her up by just her collar so shes hanging off her body weight yes it is an abusive relationship and please for the love of all things decent keep this horrible person away from your dog redwoods root system dry up and shrink in the drought then the tree suddenly fills up with water too quickly from these rains making it really heavy plus add in the high winds several have come down in and around santa cruz mountains not all age gaps abusive dynamic but shes young like really young hasnt graduated college yet young the difference in life experience between 22 and almost 40 are pretty huge developmental gaps id give it some time because the crush part may fade if you have longer to realize her youth be friends for now but also respect the boundaries of the group people are picking and not picking each other every day you hardly know her so its not like you can really take it that personally that shes rejected you just move on with your life blocking is for exes stalkers and toxic people this is such a nonoccurrence if you are really lonely expand your idea of what friends may look like maybe not an influencer for one thing depends on the state or county but usually theres some county department that if it is so dirty its a health concern like rats or drums of oil public nuisance theyll send someone out to speak with the homeowners plus possible fines if they dont clean up hard to know if they are just a junky house based on ops post or it really gets into health hazard territory most counties definitely have restrictions on front yards so if it is spilled over to the front that would be an issue if it is some kind of fire hazard is another issue edit op writes standing water brush and weeds but most of it sounds nonhazardous just gross and you are a rude asshole who can screw off feels punchier imo in most urbansuburban areas in ca we have a lot of coyotes they are all over la i consider myself lucky that ive had a few fox even a few
