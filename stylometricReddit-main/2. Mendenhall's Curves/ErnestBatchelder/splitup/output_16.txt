employment about not letting people who call outside of family have your info it sucks that we live in the times we do but probably best not to wear a shirt advertising your work or give out too many private details to strangers until you build a certain amount of trust dust yourself off and know that 9 times out of 10 most interactions you will have in a shop will be pleasant this was that one off 10th time i went once about 10 years ago there was a soloelephant exhibiting stress behaviors rocking itself not stop because elephants are not meant to be single creatures a single koala sat in a tree and every time you stood near its cage it would turn so its back was to you and also had that depressed look to it the whole place kinda broke my heart and i never went back it has a deeply depressing vibe there that i think they tried to put some into awhile back to make the park look more festive but sounds like that didnt work my guess is that san diego zoo is so much more famous that it draws bigger crowds more the la zoo should really be closed and remaining animals sold to better institutions all that being said the nearby gene autry is a great little museum i think the public beating this girl took sent a message and this girl would not have continued bullying her maybe maybe not some turds refuse to be flushed in this life if the girl got up in your sisters face just a few days ago then there is no reason for your sister to apologize at this time the original bully still has learned zero lessons is your sister becoming a mean girl maybe or she may be learning the horrible lessons of high school show no weakness either way i think your focus on empathy for the original bully is a bit off if you have a good relationship with your sister older or younger cant tell from this post id start by talking with her and asking her how she feels about becoming the person she once loathed i would not suggest apologizing because that just gives bullies more power even beaten down ones but discuss with her ways to neutralize the situation neutralizing means she agrees to start ignoring the other girl not go out of her way to bump into her and places her focus elsewhere if the girl is really whipped then she wont reengage with your sister otherwise if you are in high school too this is really not your problem to solve going to a trusted adult with your concerns is a fine option its okay we discussed focussing on the leaves la to its credit has very good museums highend restaurants music taco trucks food from every part of the world many cultural events but its not an easy city to navigate with traffic and the level of encampments in the past 510 years have taken over entire areas then worsened even more with the pandemic i had friends from other countries visit and while they love la the dichotomy of nice living extreme poverty is jarring for them i almost just got used to it living there but its a messed up thing to exist with as normal san diego definitely lacks culture but it does have a nice walkable downtown area santa barbara is probably the happy medium but it takes real money to live nicely there its more independent living for seniors but this place in altadena la santa barbara or san diego are the closest climatewise but the cost of living housing is insane in all three you will likely be very cardependent it seriously doesnt matter the breed or how friendly the dog is any breed can run up to an otherwise okaybehaving leashed dog that is leash reactive get itself killed i just showed it to my tiny monstera to give it inspiration im not really concerned with trump so much as the template and infrastructure he left in place for a stronger person than him to succeed in overturning an election next time i am also more concerned with reports from small towns around the country shasta county ca sequim wa where small coups against sitting county council members have succeeded or any of the school boards where sitting members were terrorized into quitting also decent election administrators of either party who received enough death threats in 2020 that they quit its contentiousness thats simmering in lots of pockets of the country that trump started though i highly doubt hes in any condition to finish uh look up your state and boundary by acquiescence laws you may be giving him the legal right to not only now own your land but when you go to sell down the road you will have changed property lines that wont match your deed and you will have been paying taxes on land hes enjoying who gives if he is putting in a nicer fence while that is normally an expense that two neighbors should agree upon and share he could do that along the exact fenceline where it currently stands not a nice guy your neighbor is literally stealing land from you that you are paying property taxes on sorry but hes got you marked as a fool if i were to proceed with this i would have him buy the square footage outright from you and have the property line changed he wont want to do that logan also goes to hit kendalls son his grandson in season 1 where its implied the kid is probably autistic roman is socially awkward and doesnt present as normally as shiv and kendall logan hates deviations from any norms that arent smooth edges being gay having a weird kink for older women showing any sensitivities are all weaknesses in his book i mean some of the issues in the us are very real tangible problems but many are going to be location dependent if you were a woman living in an antiabortion state who wanted kids knowing you cant get needed medical attention for failed pregnancies is certainly a fact of life to take into consideration the whole shootings thing isnt great if you are living in a highcostofliving area housing not wonderful cardependent culture in some areas the last several years have been politically fraught the pandemic wasnt pretty but careers pay more money here than say europe then you also have high medical costs and low vacation time lots of people from around the world still want to immigrate to the us what makes life qualitatively better for one person than another is rather subjective i have dual uk citizenship and spent a lot of time there as a kid i am currently thinking of leaving the us for the uk mainly because i could buy a house outright with no mortgage in a decent part of england for what i made selling a ca shack here after decades of freeway commutes i wouldnt mind having a decent even if it has issues train system im sick of fires again ca i have medical insurance and still cant get in to see a doctor for 36 months out is the overworked underfunded nhs going to be a downgrade from that i also formerly lived in a part of ca where i have never seen so many uk expats settle and be happy probably due to mild climate and sunshine if the show is good enough and i like the characters its okay ill end up rewatching the entirety of it years later its like a little gift because i had forgotten most of it if you are spun out enough to be posting on reddit when you got ghosted after three texts that you are still thinking about someone then you are kidding yourself that sleeping with him later is going to get him out of your system one of the most disappointing realizations i had by young adulthood is how many adults at least here in the us behave think like children well into middleage quanon works so well here on at least a percentage of the electorate because it was bolstered by several propaganda channels and a president plus it feeds into magical thinking theyre still stuck in still not an excuse or a reprieve but from my perspective they truly believed that their tinpot dictator was on the right side of history an election was stolen from them and theyd be received as heroes once he was reinstalled there were enough gop members running interference tweeting bullshit taking several groups on tours the day before to show them the tunnels denying election results their little brains were spun into a massive mind fuck then about a year into our relationship after proposal something just switched yeah he thought he had you on lockdown for marriage so he could show his true colors abuse is meant to make the victims selfesteem plummet so they wont leave and will accept further abusive tactics you getting fit is a threat to that he says i should just learn to accept his sense of humor ask him next time point bank why tearing you down is funny and can he explain the joke actually dont just know life is too short to tie yourself to someone who makes you feel like shit a will saying shes leaving all her money to me but if i dont come see her shes taking me out of the will so we know she hasnt changed if shes using manipulation to try and get you to see her true change would be respecting your wishes and leaving you an inheritance as some small way to make things up to you with zero expectations or hoops for you to jump through i hope youve received therapy for the abuse you went through what you do should be whatever you believe is best for your mental health you are under no obligation to smooth out your mothers sins at the end of her life if you need the money you are also free to use the hell out of her at this point just know whatever action you take there may actually be no money or you may never see it because abusers arent people who keep their word weve been together for four months a pretty strong bond of love has formed with my girlfriend yeah i am of the school of thought that you cannot really know a person enough in 4 months to have a strong bond of love you can be excited by them intrigued enjoy their company into sex with them but ya just dont really know a person in that short of time im also of theory that masks or any issues usually start around 3 or 4 months thats great that shes done so much therapy shes an open communicator except she isnt because rather than state clearly 4 months ago she doesnt like close malefemale friendships she just got snippy so now youve bonded with someone and you are seeing how they handle being upset when they feel threatened they shut down go cold lots of therapy is in my book a good thing but it doesnt mean a person doesnt still have problematic ways of expressing themselves while i think it is fine for her to have her boundaries you get to decide if her boundaries are ones you can accept you can certainly ask her to meet the friend i think respecting that you wont cook meals together isnt unreasonable and you can tell your gf youd like to be able to reach out once a month to your friend or whatever feels good to you or youd really like it if you can all grab drinks
