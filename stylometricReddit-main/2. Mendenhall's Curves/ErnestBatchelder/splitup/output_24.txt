even here in the us isnt just the housing shortage its that communities with a high number of transient lodgers arent great for neighborhoods they arent locking the out but capping them due to oversaturation so grandfathered in ones are ok but no new ones i think it is smart because neighborhoods oversaturated in airbnbs and str do change for the worse also foreign owners pocketing tourist money does nothing for the country i wish the us would limit the amount of housing nonus citizens who live elsewhere could buy our housing shortage issue is a mix of zoning law issues underbuilding new developments str corporate ibuyers and foreign money buying us property as investment often to park money as a tax haven outside of their own country like do i even want my masters even though ill make a lot more money yes you do same way you dont expect him at a year to pay more than half the rent or take on your finances then neither you nor he shouldnt expect you at the oneyear point to give up on significant career goals is it being enforced though every city in ca that passed ordinances to try and curb str and airbnbs doesnt seem to enforce them and airbnb does zero enforcement so illegal ones are still doing business yes but some countries are trying to do something about it due to housing crises portugal just passed laws to ban any more new str properties in urban centers in the us some counties have passed ordinances but in places like southern california no one enforces them so its all toothless okay so heres how a letter could maybe help their realtor isnt actually going to show them the letter in order to protect their client from discrimination accusations but if the letter sways their realtor that you are a highly committed buyer who isnt going to back out of escrow because you are willing to sacrifice your firstborn baby for this house blah blah blah the realtor may explain to the client you are a strong contender even with a slightly lower offer also a smart seller wont look at the largest offer but the strongest in terms of downpayment financing buyers supposed commitment to not getting cold feet etc i personally hate the entire loveletter thing imo its a business transaction and its another bs hoop to jump through but if you love the house just do it put another way it cant hurt and honestly if you dont get the place keep the letter as a template for your next bid something is bullshit one needing to pass on your genes is just weird its one thing to want a baby its another thing to think your superior genetics must be floating around in the world for you to sleep well at night secondly no one in their right mind would be donating sperm or eggs all of a sudden without discussing it with a partner he either sold sperm to make some money and is embarrassed or he cheated and got someone preggers if he wants there to be any chance at reconciliation he needs to explain this way better i cant speak to the intellipure i know i researched read reviews etc several years back my austin air got me through several miserable fire seasons in california i also had a high end blue air that was incredible at whisking away all kitchen smells almost instantly but they now seem to put more into their lowend models than the really nice ones they made 5 years ago the austin is nothing fancy and it is noisy on high but i think it may have the most carbon hepa other filters inside for its size and price range i also liked that due to the amount of filtration inside it the need to replace filters is less frequent good luck congrats on the house sounds like they were trained to expand their business by pestering former clients in order to get referrals thing is no one likes this level of intensity get rid of them clearly and do them a favor and let them know their business technique is backfiring hey you were a great realtor at the time we bought this house but your current tactic of dropping by unannounced or not taking a hint when i dont respond to calls is turning into harassment please refrain from future contact and let us enjoy our home in peace sending you a christmas card once a year really should be the only contact a year after a sale is complete get a highend air purifier like austin air and run it for several days on high also replace carbon monoxide alarm it could be the cleaners used the fungi carbon monoxide poisoning any one of those things i get a headache after being in bed bath and beyond for more than 15 minutes from the intense potpourri scent everywhere so it could be as simple as you are sensitive to chemical fragrance smells and once the scented cleaning agents have faded you will be fine despite their drafters calculations for the span that the porch and the redone footings indicating sufficient support for the heavier sliding door was this a designbuild company sounds like they made a booboo in their calculations and are now trying to scare you into letting them cut corners in order to let their error slide pardon the door pun id rethink the door choice you are stuck with them since you already paid but if i had a building attached to the side of my home i wanted to safely enjoy that already had a sinking issue then no i wouldnt let contractors cut official corners nevermind that if a neighbor decides they dislike you and reports it to the citycounty an inspector comes out you will end up paying for permits and any redo to the foundation needed down the road warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info first off he may feel this way because his depressive brain is telling him this not because of anything you are actually doing or saying but it cant hurt to ask him what makes him feel appreciated or part of it may be as simple as joining you in a task or just having a moment when he gets home to talk for a bit about your days etc i think it can only strengthen your relationship to both get to feel appreciated integral explore what makes you feel that way with a new baby it is easy for partners to forget each other over the emotional work the baby requires thanks now throughout the day i am probably going to have assless chaps in a singsong voice popping up or looping in my brain i also get a new filler word every so often its usually an adverb phrase at the start of any thought for a long time it was well technically speaking in emails and writing i can see it and edit it out but when conversating it will start driving me up a wall but i need it to start my thought i would repeat what you heard her say and then ask her to clarify sometimes we hear things weird some times therapists put things badly very badly in this case and some times therapists are just completely wrong had a bad moment and effed up how they respond tells you a lot about how good they are at their job to continue working with i would address the two issues with her statement if that is what she meant she should not be telling you what to do in the future in terms of who to date and what she said reflects back onto you and makes you feel like people shouldnt be dating you because of your diagnosis if you otherwise really like this therapist it is worth bringing up in session at the very least moments like this have helped me get through conflict resolution with someone and the discussion may further reveal that maybe shes not a great therapist for adhd issues id talk to some doctors who have been working in the specific field of medicine you are interested in informational interviews and really ask whats changed in their fields quality of life issues etc also even with fi can you afford the cost of medical school without loans is there a niche field close to medicine that would fufill the same desire starting a nonprofit that helped with medical issues would use your background better but also move you closer into the field that interested you without 10 years of student attending etc going back to school as an adult is never a waste imo if you can financially swing it but i think there are some fields going through intense burnout right now nursing medicine in general teaching for really good reasons if i were in your shoes id switch careers and pursue something that interested me but id also weigh the amount of schooling and years in training needed first off dont sell your place if you really want to move ahead with cohabitation can you rent your place out if you sell now there is a possibility of not being able to get back into the housing market think of it this way you are 41 now if living together with someone youve had a shaky relationship with doesnt work out do you want to go back to renting at 50 also by 50 even if we as women eat well exercise most of us will get hit during menopause with some weight gain unless you are genetically built to be skinny or one of those people willing to never eat bread and do 5 hours of pilates a day its just a fact of life one that shouldnt be something you have to fear will cause you to lose a partner youre going to have to bring up the list you werent snooping and he kept it this whole time if you dont have a brutally honest discussion it will impact things also highly suggest thinking about why you are doing all the lifecompromising in this move if she did not explicitly ask you then no you should not go while everyone gets a reprieve for how they communicate when grieving and she may have been handling her stepdads decline when she was busy before his death right now isnt the time to ask her for clarity the clarity is in the fact that shes not reaching out you already sent condolences so send flowers and work on your own stuff it sounds like you two have broken up so shes raising him to be a narcissist when hes old enough to disappoint her that hes not jesus then shell begin to abuse him when could you see yourself considering it or being open to talking seriously about marriage after a year two years 5 id tell her you feel like you are both compatible and you would be open to discussing it in amount of time just share your schedule and be honest tell her as much as you feel you are both heading that way the jokes are starting to give you anxiety because you are not quite at that point but want to revisit it with her she may want to end things as is her right if your timelines really dont match up but in your 30s you both should be able to handle a serious conversation about what your goals are sooo you are a better person than your coworkers ng gave up a good thing because she cant handle peer pressure is too insecure to stand up to them and the rest of
