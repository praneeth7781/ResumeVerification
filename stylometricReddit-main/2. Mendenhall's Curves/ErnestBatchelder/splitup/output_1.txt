i wonder if a very blue state in the us is likely the closest to semilow racism or homophobia one can kind of get to still serious systemic racism in california but in the bigger picture of things there are certainly large pockets of overt liberalism even if it gets more performative at times than substantial i know there are parts of europe while not being as overtly racisthomophobic as say a deep red state can still be subtly so likely your best bets where you wont run into it too much would be major cities like amsterdam lisbon london berlin ive hear that norwegians are superficially very polite but can still hold racist attitudes its just the culture of civility means it wont be in your face in italy now the current government is far right and trying to illegalize gay couples from adopting dont know enough about travel to south america but the largest blacklatino populations would be in columbia brazil and haiti theres a complex history in parts of south america of colorism left over from colonialism could be less racist than the us europe though i dont know but i would worry about safety around homophobia but i also think you shouldnt let that stop you from exploring and you may find something in your industry elsewhere that does feel less biased id start planning to travel make some trips and see what you find i would recontact air bnb and tell them what the host is doing is illegal according to hud i would also contact the host and tell them what they are doing is illegal they know and you want a full refund to keep you from reporting them to nyc housing department hud get your money back from them then call nyc housing departmenthud and report the hell out of them that is so skeevy btw if you google it its apparently happened a few times over the years and been reported in the news totally against the by laws of public housing i think thats the exact conflict you didnt express initially to him that you needed to i would hate to lose you to distance but you are really unhappy here and i cant be the one who encourages you to stay if that makes you miserable because ill feel guilty those are complete ideas that express your conflicted emotions whatever happens happens is the verbal equivalent of a shrug it sounds like not feeling like your authentic self by being closeted is keeping you closed off you are currently struggling professionally and with your family so one way to look at it is no matter what further realistic discrimination issues barring safety there is also a possibility that some of these facets of your life improve with you transitioning its a tough choice with no real easy path but like ujilltro mentions are there any areas in your community to meet other trans and lgbtq people growing that network in a safe way may help you learn more ask your therapist if they can help you resource maybe group therapy for those who identify as trans that might be the best first step we started seeing a couples therapist 5 years ago who also became mine and his individual therapist yes you are correct this is highly inappropriate and she should never have suggested that my therapist strongly feels my partner and i are not compatible this is not her place a good therapist will help you believe in yourself to make the best decisions for you not make suggestions or try to influence you to do what they think is right for you thats what a meddling mom would do she often interrupts him while he speaks and she talks a lot not cool x200b she talks quite openly about her own children and their relationships she has called me out of the blue to ask me to run an errand for her when she couldnt leave her house and has invited my husband and me over to watch a zoom lecture on a saturday morning so you pay her to have an audience and take care of her wtf shes got zero boundaries and isnt your therapist at this point id worry shes trying to be your cult leader thank her because you did grow some at the beginning of this but leave therapy with her shes a nut job and while id normally encourage someone to have a last session and tell a therapist why they are ending in this case just get out if and when you are ready you can both go look for separate individual therapists that meet your individual needs id worry about weird tik tok influencers and drug dealer neighbors the high price makes it more transient in some situations because theyll rent to anyone willing to sign with cash upfront if i was going to go up 1000 per month in rent in apartment living id look for another small building but one that gave me garden access but thats me the best builds in la are 30s era when walls are still built with plaster and lathe stay cool but if it has original windows those are paper thin the 1950s 70s builds the dingbats in la are made out of paper mache and spit held together with asbestos two different areas no visible lgbtq communities but i doubt you would run into problems if i were you all id look at some of the foothill communities sierra madre montrose or pasadena proper somewhat less pricey than san marino cute downtowns lots of opportunities for social cadaverings very quiet neighbors unless one of the dead is an angry ghost personally i have no issue with it low heat low and slow youre less likely to hit the burn point too fast mom became a christian as an adult from what she told us after some things happened and someone passed and she turned to it and said her life before it wasnt good so many people in this country need therapy for traumatic childhoods due to an authoritarian parental figure but instead decide to seek out more authoritarianism and repeat the cycle on their kids im trying not to be a high maintenance client wrong attitude figure out what 23 of the house value is and realize your realtor works for you and is making a decent amount here dropping the ball can happen with realtors after the sale looks nearly done but you still need them so call them thats not high maintenance its the very least they should be doing have a talk with her not about specific past behaviors because after the moment has passed its all confusing the next day she wont get why that joke after dinner last night went on too long made others uncomfortable and it feels like getting punished for having bad intent when in her mind if shes even thinking about it last nights dinner was fun and now shes reframing it like she was bad instead talk to her about how people have different sensibilities and sensitivities and while home is definitely her primary safe space having visitors means accommodating them have a discussion with her to come up with a kind and short phrase something you wont say in anger that means she needs to take a breather and redirect her energies while her niece visits something as simple as new topic time for a gross joke thats going on too long or lets all play 5minute silence and gather our thoughts then come back to this topic if her hyper energy is dominating the conversation always frame these discussions starting out with why you love her sense of humor or enthusiasm and end them on a positive note the sandwich cookie of criticism technique make sure the discussion wraps up with her feeling empowered to add some social skills in not crushed and like a loser shes emotionally immature her feelings are hurt and rather than cope with that shes hoping to manipulate you into begging her to eat come back and cook with you etc shes 63 she isnt going to starve herself to death leave her be breath and do whatever you need to do to take care of yourself when you feel triggered but do not escalate or engage for now tell your kids grandmas having alone time dont worry too much about them if you dont get upset they wont you are the one they are looking to to model their emotional regulation on eventually when shes reengaged and during a period when things are going smoothly you can tell her how it used to upset you greatly when you were a kid that shed refuse to speak to you but as an adult it just makes you sad for her she still cant calmly talk about her feelings the whole family is creepy 26yearold son brings home a teenager and everyone including parents are like cool lets get drunk karaoke theyve known each other for 4 months are getting married they may not even make it to the actual wedding date but if they do its kind of one of those 5050 things that it works out id be politenice but really stop taking inventory of how she bugs you stop caring if she includes you or is snubbing you just dgaf be incredibly polite nice and shrug everything else off dont make complicated plans with them if you are going to be irritated that they are flakey a good hvac installer should handle the permitting for you if you need it he has no right to get angry about this though you do understand that hes stealing strongarming money from you that you want saved for your kid to get himself out of a bad financial situation he got himself into he should be mad at himself you shouldnt be so scared of your partners emotional behavior you do something that is not in your childs best interest this is not a healthy dynamic i assume you two arent married youre saving it for your child thats your kids money a boyfriend doesnt get to make unilateral decisions with your money so learn how to say no or really examine how messed up this relationship is tell him no and move it into a 529 college savings with your child as a beneficiary this week a 529 college

caveat 12 step programs have their issues but theres some support there listen to some peoples stories of what their life was like marrying and living with a drunk listen to how they eventually had their entire lives revolving around watching their spouse hoping it would be an okay night trying to avoid violence and emotional abuse when it was a bad night sunk cost fallacy and the years wasted
