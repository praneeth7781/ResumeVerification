kind request then you do have a bigger issue i am guessing it is a crush which he can fully get over however if he shows he cant you do need to cut him off first off herpes psa 1 in 6 people in the us have genital herpes you will need to disclose that info before sleeping with new partners which can be scary but its the right thing to do you can also take an antiviral med that suppresses future outbreaks or llysine helps so talk to your doctor sometimes people have one outbreak and thats it you are only contagious right before the outbreak happens and if you get another one you may notice what that prebreakout feels like itching or tingling and know to abstain do not touch any sores or wash your hands well if you do as for the boyfriend hell no hes a lying cheater who claims you are hurting his mental health because he gave you herpes you deserve so much better do not let the herpes diagnosis keep you in a shitty worthless relationship its the 2020s if you are not vetting for flat earthers and vaccine truthers at a bare minimum within the first few dates you are probably doing it wrong i found out a few years ago that a friend i have known for 15 years believes the moon landing is faked ive had two friends let out their antisemitic beliefs over the past few years like i had no idea they solidly believed jews control all the global money and the media i am jewish you are enabling a gambling addict this doesnt improve unless they get help housing is the least of your problems im crying because i feel like he settled for me friend you are settling for him hes negging you and undermining your confidence selfesteem a cruddy personality is a poor quality in a partner want better for yourself let him know he may be an 8 in looks according to his own personal scale but a 0 in personality animals dont read parenting books so why should we hes going to be a great father male lions will kick out male cubs from the pride due to competition and prairie dog females will eat eachs young we should totally adopt those techniques youre dating a nitwit who doesnt respect your field dont send articles to nitwits their entire thing is being right even when they are wrong and its like bashing your head on a rock and waiting for the rock to start bleeding two things first you can only help or mentor someone who directly asks for it if they dont ask for help then anything you say or do will be perceived as you attacking them secondly whenif she asks directly for help the best method of constructive criticism is to tell someone something good about them then the issue then the positive place they will get to when they take steps ie the better version of themselves they are capable of achieving the one thing you do have a total right to speak up about if you are living with someone is if they have terrible table manners that are offputting or their hygiene is bad and they stink for table manners you can start with being direct but kind i love having my little sister here and i love sharing meals with you but when you talk during the meal with your mouth full of food its really hard or when you sit at the table on your phone and dont join in talking with us it sucks for my boyfriend and me and feels like a missed opportunity to catch up about our days as for the rest of it id wait until she comes to you directly with the issue then you can involve yourself for interviews if shes bummed she didnt get it then you can say something like you are really smart and clearly a good candidate do you want some tips for how to win over an interviewer and make yourself stand out more ie dont frame it initially as you did it wrong but ask her if she wants to hear how to improve also it seems like you are hovering over her waiting for her to fail give her a little space to fail and pick herself back up and come to you if you answer no it actually could go either way you overpaid or you underpaid hes a 38yearold man acting like a 16yearold you are making an awful lot of excuses for him in the comments but by his age being emotionally mature enough to listen to a partner and then respect their wishes during sex should be a given not something he needs to be trained to understand he heard you in your conversation he just chose to disregard you in his actions the other thing that stands out to me is that what youve described him doing without real discussion with you first has a degrading element to it if that is not your thing it is fine to break it off for lack of real sexual compatibility i do think porn has done more damage to peoples expectations for sex but my god moving between the anus and vagina without discussion and preparation is 1 way for women to get reoccurring bacterial vaginosis again okay if someone is in their 20s and still learning about sex and being a good partner but wtf by your 40s question did you have an inspection when you bought it because the lifespan of most of those items would be apparent during inspection my first house was an older house and everything was in functional condition but kind of on its last legs your best bet is to get several opinions on anything have a couple of roofers come out and give you bids if they all say the same thing then you know you have immediate issues usually one guy will be complete doom and gloom one will be more middle of the road otherwise make yourself a list of bigger ticket items that are on their last legs and replace them slowly one major fix per year or two and youll eventually have newer components under a 10year warranty roof or any basement leak issues if in real disrepair should be number one and move slowly inwards from there i mean every coastal city in the 80s90s besides san diego and monterey both more military were kind of hippie surfer enclaves with artists and environmentalists housing prices for a 2 bedroom bungalow werent starting at 1 mil back then wait was the black lexus shooting at the white truck and in order to alert other drivers and execute a safe road rage shooting black lexus turned on their emergency blinkers i mean other than being known for gumbo hospitality it has the best jazz high of shootings combo in the country uh get your legal ducks in a row in terms of him moving in name not on deed or mortgage and clear communication on splitting costs but really why do you want to cohabitate with someone who isnt jazzed for you for getting to a huge life milestone dont take the tenants property to sell even if its within the lease or you feel used by them give them until saturday if they dont come saturday have it hauled off how much can you make off a used trampoline 100 not worth dealing with them coming around trying to sue or dealing with them being messy youve listed why you are upset with this tenant but most of that was on you dont keep working with people who are bad tenants dont cut deals with them and dont cover expenses if they are at fault as far as the trampoline goes consider the value of the cost versus having a clean break from them california absolutely has better produce than many other states we grow close to most of it for the country what we dont ship to mexico due to nafta plenty of farming in the middle of the country is corn and soy while every market in the us is going to have vegetables outside of areas that are food deserts fresh fruit veg versus the stuff that has been on trucks for weeks is a big difference in quality warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info i am not so sure i want this to happen oh you 100 know you do not want it to happen speak clearly and say no it was too much falling on you to be housebound with her as a caretaker the first time his answer was that she and the other elderly neighbor could hang out while we worked what happens when that neighbor falls or gets hurt or goes into a home shes settled somewhere now dont take her out of her routine because he feels guilty but not guilty enough to change his work schedule and be the primary caretaker tell him you can both up your visits from the home or have her stay for overnights but she isnt moving back in with you telling him depends on what state you live in if in the us and what kind of end you two ended on do you feel 100 confident he will respect and support your decision as for financial assistance if you are in the us in a state that has planned parenthood start there a 22yearold started dating you when you were 15 you were a child a creepy college age dude was scouring high schools for a teen to molest ffs you arent wifey material because you aged out for the pedo who wanted a teen bang maid theres nothing you could have done differently when you are in a relationship with a misogynistic creep you are still incredibly young please go out and experience a good relationship for the first time find out what it is to be loved respected and to be treated like an equal you deserve that if shes still competent enough ask her how she feels about writing up a trust for herself shell be the one creating the trust with your and a lawyers help so she isnt giving up total independence but shes in control of creating a foolproof system of safety for herself the trust can give her a monthly stipend and grow her assets if she asks for a large lump sum the trust has to approve so if she contacts her trustee for an amazon scam they are given permission to deny funds you can help her set up an account to have draft limits unless something is set on autopay so her bills will all be autopay but she cant withdraw thousands of dollars i dont know just spitballing i dont mean to pathologize everything but this is the internet so why not but that all sounds a lot like executive dysfunction its common with adhd but also with a host of other things one thing that helps people with executive dysfunction is learning their own coping skills but they have to want to change ie admit they have a problem and also be personally frustrated with their inability to finish things some people just dont care or cant get to the first part admit there is a problem another thing that can help is calm patient help if you want her to pick something out instead of sending her away to go find the thing make it a task you do together lets set a timer and look at tables now for the next hour and a half then pick one out and decide on it projects okay if you want
