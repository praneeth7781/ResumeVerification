up in any way for her now you just have to make being back at your parents house peaceful as possible someone once told me its impossible to forgive someone when they are still a threat given your back at your parents house even if shes nicer now it probably feels like shes still a threat to you or at least the little kid part of you that she hurt frequently secondly she hasnt asked for forgiveness and hasnt taken responsibility for what she did to you as a kid id box up the need to forgive her and focus more on what do you need to do for yourself to make living at home right now okay how can you maintain a relationship with your mom right now that doesnt hurt you or bring out past resentment one thing that might help is to think about how have you learned to be a better parent to yourself than she was remind yourself of how you take care of yourself you can forgive her when shes on her deathbed if you want but really we dont have to go around forgiving everyone the main thing is to not seethe in resentment or hurt yourself with the bad memories find ways to make that work no good deed goes unpunished hey at least we know the source of your mental health issues kidding aside depression and anxiety can make some emotional development get delayed long depressive episodes in adolescence can mean not emotionally developing during that period but in your brothers moms case they are misinterpreting complacency peoplepleasing with emotional maturity in all likelihood you are exerting yourself more now is you being more emotionally mature they are the ones who are stymied by their own dynamic just finished watching the final season of you on netflix so i think you are getting offended by the analogy which it is still used to this day to dehumanize immigrants and has racist beginnings but the content or the argument statistically men are more physically dangerous to women than vice versa is factual the not all men thing does derail the conversation when i think you really needed to state that repurposing a racist analogy to deal with reasonable fears for women undermines her point so whatever happened in that text thread she likely 1 had confessed private things about your marriage 2 encouraged sexting to get to that picture 2 neutrally went along with it didnt shut it down or 3 actively pursued or started it we know that or she wouldnt have deleted the text thread she would have shown it to you it proven her innocence youve repaired your marriage to the point that you stayed together but you clearly still feel some betrayal so your best bet to continue working past that is marriage counseling digging up the text thread without any safety net is just going to blow up what you currently have im personally not on the all cheating means everything is over camp cheating happens on a spectrum from physical infidelity to workplace intrigues to inappropriate texts 17 years together does mean that people will in all likelihood emotionally fuck up or hurt each other at some point if you go into counseling you have a fighting chance to see not if you can get past this but actually put it to rest if you cant put it to rest you have a solid foundation of how to end things push back yourself asap theres a thing in these types of situations that are toxic bro environments you can either be liked or respected being respected means being a bitch so do that fearlessly you dont need the little chudheads to like you you need them to do their work have a little meeting tell them for now its off the record that you understand their bet and it is laughable youd touch any of them however if they dont drop the bullshit and start doing their work you will do everything within your power to make sure they fail downward instead of upward at your company as for the one at the gym tell him under no uncertain terms if he continues to stalk you in your private life you will perceive it not as friendly but a threat and you will look into sexual harassment litigation and that he also better improve his work look for a female mentor above you in your company and ask her out to lunch start a network of your own support there good luck you had the gall the gall to heal and move on from the loss of such a winning man how dare you not be a devastated mush ball forever forlorn at the absence that is his glory you were meant to put on a dirty burlap sack and go forever cry with the other unwanted divorcees in the forest of loneliness it sounds like intuitively you have figured out the grey rock technique his response is the typical flareup that they can no longer get an emotional reaction out of you hell probably move on in a bit then from timetotime pull this shit on you again continue to keep it cold and professional enjoy your new life your mom has mental health issues and agoraphobia so that alone is enough to fuck a teen girl up then her boyfriend oded she doesnt want to hear this but adoption would actually be in the babys best interest i think you need to stop focusing on trying to get a messed up traumatized 17yearold to suddenly function like an adult and get her some mental health counseling asap she has 3 months to realize that if she loves this baby its best chance of survival would be an open adoption with a loving and stable family so everything you described about being the best girlfriend is not what anyone who wants a healthy relationship would ask of a partner giving pets wtf curfew wtf you werent a human to this guy but an accessory they always come back right when you are at the point that you have put yourself back together enough to start your new phase i swear not a believer in psychic ability but somehow they know when theyve finally almost lost all power over you the reach out is just to try and get that power back for themselves you want to prove to him that youve moved on block and ignore dudes ten years older than you and hes an abusive little schmuck fyi if someone loves you this is how that conversation should go person a please dont joke about that it really hurts my feelings person b im sorry i didnt mean to hurt you ill stop hurting someones feelings disrespecting them if they ask you to stop then getting angry at them then silent treatment no dont reach out or apologize for what and when or if he does let him know its over you can do so much better tv show but big little lies portrayed the complexity of love in a violent domestic relationship pretty well im sorry but your life goals sound completely incompatible please dont throw away however many years it took you to finish that phd take the job question how long are you staying for she may have bitten off more than she can handle is overwhelmed she may be a total control freak she may be a terrible hostess the two of you may never be close none of it really matters what matters is that your brother is happy if he is leave it be if he isnt maybe hell confide in you maybe he wont i would handle it by being a good house guest dont tease or insult her ask if you can help in any way and be polite if she goes quiet just bring up a lighthearted topic unless shes acting out in anger or directly gets mad theres no point in reading too much into things i have a pretty sick sense of gallows humor and even i cant get funny from this cant you block and request to block all future accounts that person creates id also lock your account to private for at least 6 months it sucks but unless you want to disable your account thats all you can do the good news is shell burn someone else out eventually and focus on that dead friendship
