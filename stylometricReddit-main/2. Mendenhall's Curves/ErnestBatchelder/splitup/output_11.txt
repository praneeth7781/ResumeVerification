their shit and let the moving company know that there is an unstable roommate in the house it will be about 4 hours of torture then done i think it is more emotionally underdeveloped than that more about them witnessing the positive changes in him as he matured and wanting him to stay at their level so they have their friend back they are crabs in a bucket op crawled out of that lifestyle so they disregard his explicit instructions and who he clearly had become and created a setup to drag him back into their bucket im sure they used the excuse that they were soooo drunk i looked at places over there in 2015 that were going for 500k that i thought were overpriced thats a tripling in 8 years i agree the barrier in the us is especially high for most visas green cards or eventual citizenship i think we also still have a lottery thats also a snowballs chance in hell my point that maybe i didnt make clear is that theres no reason for op to take that personally i was in southern louisiana i dont know the actual numbers the nazis being nazis is both 1 true and problematic 2 happening with greater frequency in many counties x200b also the whooole green card process like they dont want us there to be fair most countries put up some barriers to immigration the us is an extremely diverse place because of the history of immigration here even if a subsection of our population doesnt like it many are really happy on a daytoday basis to have different cultures around as for the rest of it its all very valid part of my reason for my expatriating plan because i am getting older and therefore more tired and it can take a lot to be here its also true that the us is so very vast and regional that you really will find almost different cultures in different parts not everything is like it is on tv although outside of several metro areas car culture is an inevitable id refrain from reading too much online for a bit and wait to spend your time here and see for yourself it may not be your forever place but the absolute best time to try an adventure is right out of college its just a matter of courtesy tell him he can start being the courteous one and text you when he needs home alone time to masturbate to porn have an affair or hide the bodies not quite an answer to your question but some people i know who sold a home in a hcol to buy a nice piece of farmland to raise kids on are now in their 50s and shes saying no way can she retire there too much physical labor needed to maintain in old old age even if it isnt an active farm on a hike a proctologist named ben dover a dog named roll dover i forget the rest of them chonky newish build at a ridiculous 3000 square feet it could be something to do with your location brand association since i think the most subaru sales are in southern california colorado and the rural northeast i lived in the south for several years and now that i think about it i rarely saw any subaru drivers visited a friend in vermont and it was definitely the most popular car on the road next to older trucks every current car on the market seems to have associated issues so i gave up trying to find one that would be the best new build toyota and honda were best known for reliability but have also had issues in recent years go test drive some outbacks under various road conditions and see how you feel driving it thats your best indicator reading solely for pleasure should be a thing we allow ourselves without further condemnation hell i am jealous still trying to get through a 300 pg scifi novel years after grad school burnout killed my ability to pleasure read my theory about any reading for knowledge is that people should skim skip and approach it with no rules for read 1 then if they really need retention and understanding go back in for read 2 so you are getting much practice in step one of my made up theory also i can think of 1000 worse for your attention span than skipping around as a reader like being on reddit ha if you really like any of those books you get the joy of rereading at a later date and discovering all the things you missed or forgot from the first read if there are stats i stand corrected i knew several my age gen x to younger 20s voters who simply didnt vote after sanders lost the nomination rather than vote for clinton were very vocal about it so perhaps i am mixing up my own semirelated anecdotal experience with the stats he told me im ditching him because i think he has bad intentions and how i shouldnt think that so yeah you should absolutely presume he has bad intentions is predatory and proceed by protecting yourself go back into work and behave as professionally as possible while being a firm cold no to any impropriety while the hospitality industry is rife with inappropriate behavior in plenty of places doesnt make it okay if you are not in a country with human resources or any higher ups to share concerns with yeah time to look around for other jobs and play it cool at work try to find someone to go with you when you go home after your shift not to be too scary but if you really feel unsafe trust your gut a job is not worth stalking or assault from a nutjob you are allowed to quit for any reason i think based on the previous episode that its been many nights of sleep deprivation stress coke to keep going on sleep deprivation and also hes a shit human edit to add before someone comes at me i am firmly in the camp they are all shit humans to various degrees i bet its charming less to heat with the 8foot ceilings because everything really is a tradeoff fuck the system types met with a heavy dose of misogyny well a trump presidency wont hurt me and maybe hell tear it all down weirdly the idea of getting better social safety nets in place probably would have happened with the woman who did try to start universal health care in the 90s she later pivoted due to the backlash she received but a lot of her comments on single payer were taken so far out of context by the leftleft to demonize her so bring in trump who would burn it all down then theyd rebuild im not 100 sure the logic but the conspiracy on the left of voter suppression around why bernie who i did originally vote for in the primaries didnt get the nom would later be echoed by the magas who still believe to this day that 2020 was rigged horseshoe theory at play also a lot of online propaganda that is better curated and then targeted a specific audience open to receive it now more than ever in our history edit to add it wasnt old white men as much as it was younger voting demographic she said but yes oh my god do better from here on out not just once a year but do better daily theres no way in hell that she hasnt communicated over the prior 15 years for being disappointed that as the mother to two boys she also has to do the work to plan her own celebration ostensibly celebrating her for the work she does ffs homes built after the 1940s are a bit better than earlier although i love us turn of the century up to 1920s because by the 40s they give you real closets my first home was a 1920s cottage 850 square feet and it did drive even solo me up a wall i had no place to put my limited stuff and would have killed for my friends 1940s closets im only making things worse given i sold and cant likely buy in my choice state ca been really considering taking the profits from the sale and buying in my other country uk cash no mortgage and making the great schelp although for what i could purchase everything i look at online the edwardians were even worse for zero closet space somehow the high ceilings make it okay will learn to live without stuff the long answer we have subsidized large farms for decades so many small farms with varying crops and crop rotation were bought up by larger corporate farms which then found corn and soy the most profitable with government subsidies a lot of soybeans get turned into oil which is much different than the taste of olive oil or bought by china corn gets made into high fructose corn syrup which is then sold as a sweetener for everything it hits differently than cane sugar most restaurants across the us buy up a lot of their bulk food from the same 3 chain food suppliers i think sysco or tyson is the biggest so there is always a sameness to chicken in every restaurant unless you are fine dining many smaller fine dining establishments in places like california oregon vermont maine etc will try to buy from local farming and in ca especially you have more access to local produce but for a lot of states they are reliant on import only short answer we let corporations and big ag fuck up our food supplies micheal pollen wrote about this a lot in the 2000s so depression unsupportive family life likely some trauma there untreated adhd is a big ugly cosmic soup to be swimming in the great news is that you have a grasp of what is really going on in your brain even if those who are meant to support you most have chosen ignorance if you are in the us please speak with the office of students with disabilities and find out what accommodations you are eligible for and also what kind of community support systems may be available at your college ask your school therapist if they can refer you to any community therapy clinics that do low costfree counseling for a weekly session even if the school therapist is great you may need more support find out about any tutoring centers on campus or other networks you may hate school right now but between the fire and the fryingpan home or school its your best chance at getting some real support as for your family get used to learning how to protect yourself around them and make the slow painful journey to eventually being less enmeshed dont look for the kind of parental understanding you long for there but start to find that feeling elsewhere whatever that looks like to you anytime you go to them hoping it will be different and you can somehow prove you have a neurobehavioral condition you will only set yourself back being your best advocate means learning where its worth advocating for yourself i have eaten pastries and baguettes in london and paris and while they are both very good they are not the same its the same with things like chocolate british chocolate is better than us chocolate even when it is the same brand congratulations you have a gourmand child and yes ops husband is up to totally suspicious behavior look i love stuff and i come from a family that bordered on a hoarders love of stuff but most of that square footage over 15001700 for a family of 4 is only
