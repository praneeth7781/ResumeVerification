be a parade in his honor i no longer live near there but romas was one of my favorite relics of a longgone era the strip mall mom pop shop filled with delights the other great italian place is bulgarini gelato vino cucina in altadena completely weird ambiance beyond slow service an eccentric owner but fantastic food both those places are more italian experiences than eataly gah do you want your deposit back and are you okay with an eviction on your record ie bad idea stupid even given the landlord is on the property if he or she is being flexible with you to sublease dont throw their goodwill out the door go to an alanon meeting today they are held around the world and online the 12step program has serious issues but when someone like you is in total denial that they are in a codependent relationship with an abusive alcoholic its really helpful to find others and hear their stories it will help you understand both 1 yes you were in an abusive relationship 2 how you enabled it 3 start taking care of yourself excuse me but the owner used to come up to me and whatever i was going to buy squid pasta a jar of pesto olive oil and point out the one that tastes best ive ended up trying even a can of smoked mackerel that was heaven due to his advice hes too old now and just sits but that man is a national treasure you do not get that kind of service anywhere anymore that plus the sandwich is heaven in pink paper wrapper eataly is costco crap by comparison emotionally it reads chucky the doll or a tomato person but if you werent going for a flattering painting of miley cyrus its technically good and an interesting take on celebrity unless every unit in the building is treated there is no future in that apartment building you can poison spray stuff holes and they will continue to breed in another unit and crawl into yours its possible the last tenant was bad with food being left out but im guessing there are a few units there that are cockroach pits and the tenants just live like that id document take pictures back out of the lease legally and take all your stuff to get silkwood showered its asking for a wardrobe malfunction of the least polite kind in front a bfs family when the 30 day nc is over i think i need to stop being friends with him completely good news you dont need to wait until the end of 30 days of no contact to make contact explain that you want further no contact you can start right now block everywhere and think about what healing from this looks like start working on meeting new people not legal advice but psychological you are dealing with bullies based on what theyve said so far they dont play well with others and they like the game of steamrolling over people figuratively but also possibly literally bullies dont care about laws moral behavior or being good neighbors they only care that they can strongarm people who they perceive as more intent on civility aka weaker into doing their bidding you push back immediately with bullies you dont fear escalation because they are going to do that anyway you get the upper hand i dont see why you wouldnt keep the temporary fence up indefinitely in fact id get my permits lined up and put up a solid fence between my home and these folks and around the rest of the property just in case id also issue a c d dont follow up with a intent to remove the fence just that charges with be pressed for further trespassing and property destruction id further get some cameras and movement lights make sure all your ducks are legally in a row you have photo evidence document everything option 4 feels like the worse option to me its passive and doesnt get on top of this situation speaking with them through lawyers for the remainder of your neighborly relations sounds good to me i like the knot in the wood on top it makes it look like an image from a colonoscopy strong motif i feel like the only way i can successfully leave is if i completely disappear or he finds someone else this isnt completely true npd will not want you to leave no matter what even if they leave first they will still need you to be destroyed before they go so no one else can every have you either way here you are getting something you wanted a path to him possibly leaving and you are upset focusing on the wrong thing you do not owe her anything she can see what is going on and it is not for you to save her you save yourself the only thing that matters in a mentally and physically abusive relationship is getting out you dont need to completely disappear you need a domestic abuse shelter some resources and to get out before he kills you recalibrate your inner compass to your survival and then later healing how does a 16 year old force everyone to choose shes not paying shes not the adult ot parent shes not forcing you to do anything youre just not parenting you need to make executive decisions make sure she has food in the fridge she can cook for herself if she doesnt like your decisions she wont starve i tell her its because shes earned it but its also because we always end up ordering from the place she wants as shes picky even if you think you are hiding this fact you arent she knows you are catering to her at 16 finding out how much power you have is a pretty heady thing but also no 16 year old knows how to handle this stop giving her so much control over everyone in the family if she cant make decisions that benefit everyone its one thing to have a special day because of doing well in school or her birthday but shes already a difficult eater soclearly food is an issue for her then you are asking her to make a choice for the whole family around eating shes a teen she can have some food in the fridge she likes and make her own dinner if she doesnt like what everyone else is eating i kind of feel like youve created this problem and are now mad shes not mature enough to deal shes not selfcentered she just isnt the person who should be given the power to dictate where you all eat that should be you edit from your replies in the comments she has adhd you sound like you actually dont like your kid get her help with the adhd and get yourself some information for how to handle it better again she doesnt sound selfcentered it sounds like you want her to have executive functioning skills she hasnt developed yet and so you are mad and frustrated with her i feel like im negotiating a business deal nah you can get a better deal in business none of this is negotiation so far from what you write its his financial plan or nothing thats actually more like an ultimatum than a negotiation he also gets upset and insists i dont fully trust him if im hesitant to go all in immediately well i wouldnt trust him i actually believe couples should fully discuss financials before marriage and get as much on paper as possible but you are the only one in this scenario with anything to lose including your current home youve known him less than one year he wants you to move to a new country there are so many red flags and concerns in all of this a loving partner would be fine with you renting out your current home keeping your assets in your name only and moving there for a trial period the level of pressure in this makes me feel like hes a catfisher or something do not like edit ah got it misread i stand corrected so you were not as a couple prepared to adopt a cat instead abused an animal you have now completely messed up a perfectly good loving cat into a neurotic depressed cat the good news is that placed in a better situation cats can decompress and return to its more loving nature you are responsible for either finding that cat a better a home asap or breaking up and getting the cat out of there honestly after hearing you left a cone on a cat for a year and wont allow it to groom itself to enable a girlfriends cruelty i really dont care what you do with your relationship youve spun out in multiple directions on this from possible school violence to your own future without children and to be fair none of that is really about your sister you sound deeply anxious a 13yearold from a neglectful home is going to be a handful would your home be better than where she is now with a parent that sounds like she doesnt want her yeah it probably would but if you cant do it at the expense of your own struggles then you cant if you move forward i suggest making sure you have mental health help first and foremost secondly look into what resources are available in your county from social workers to free afterschool tutoring its possible she may be eligible for several services including getting counseling herself you shouldnt be breaking your back doing her homework for her and shell need to learn to have respect you need to be able to be clear on what your boundaries are with her what punishments she gets if she breaks rules etc most of all though you have to take care of yourself if you cant do this now you will need to back out honestly the school violence issue isnt going to be enough to get you out of it i wish we had a healthier 2year specialized vocational schooling system that was accredited beyond community colleges a college degree absolutely isnt always worth it but there are plenty of entrylevel positions or skilled positions that require one when 2 years or less would get people professional enough experience without the larger debt eh if its financially feasible no or little loans spending 1822 learning stuff and learning independence isnt the worst thing in the world to do whats bad is going into serious debt without thinking about what to do with the degree afterward you will thats bullshit abusive behavior is she in therapy if not she needs to be if you arent going to break up with her then at least tell her this youre drained her inability to communicate in an adult way makes you feel anxious she needs to work on communication when shes upset or youre out then you keep to your ultimatum if she feels a mood coming on she can use her words to tell you she needs a little time to herself she seemed sympathetic but instead of making a compromise of some kind suggests that maybe were not compatible next time she says this agree with her and walk thats either some gradea manipulation or she actually does want to break up and cant do it herself your dad cant repair what your mom broke but hes going to keep trying talk to your therapist tell him or her youd like to come up with a few neutral noncommital statements to get out of hanging out with your mom its difficult being back home as an adult and your mom made her favoritism of your sister very clear you dont have to step
