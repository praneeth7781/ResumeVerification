owl sightings but they are definitely shyer their behaviors at their age are what sounds exhausting drama sloppy drunks no boundaries if some woman told me my bf was allowed to finger her while he was dry humping from behind in public yeah i would expect them to be about 24 years old x200b these sound not that bad no they actually sound worse than you realize it sounds exhausting and demoralizing youve just grown inured to being nitpicked to death real housewives of peoria il look im not a doctor or a nutritionist but eating the same thing wont shock your system though your system will adapt to the expectation of the same meal every day and autopilot on that if it makes any sense you have been doing great i would fill my fridge with any healthy vegetable i wanted then keep the chicken and rice part if you get so restrictive its boring and miserable to eat you are setting yourself up for an eating disorder or failure on your diet dont restrict varying vegetables at least have a salad with chicken one day it is healthy and good the calories in the calories being good fuel for your body is what matters there are carbs in onions fructose which is a healthy carb its also a prebiotic which means it helps process probiotics in your gut eating some sauteed onion is in no way going to derail you from your goals hes basically placing the burden to break up on you otherwise hes telling you you are a placeholder its an incredibly weakwilled way to go he never should have met your parents if he knew this was how he felt be glad you are getting this info now be glad to break up even without the religious issue he has pretty big character flaws including being unable to stand up to his family warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info henry bowser or frankie the chances of talking to hoarders directly that gets them to change their habit is slim to none in my lived experience if it is a married couple where both partners like to collect you are totally doomed sometimes it is just one partner and then there is a window of reason to work with the other one in this case neither of them mind living in a dump hell they are living their best lives from the sounds of it report it will that fix the issue maybe maybe not depending on where you live and if there are actual fines or consequences at least you will know you took action then wait for your trees to grow based on the comments below you are now facing the consequences of expecting someone to always pour from their glass but never really being in a stable enough place that you could do the same she dumped you because you have notoriously bad relationship patterns and while she could cope with being supportive above and beyond normal friendship supportive when you were physically sick she doesnt have another one of your dramaboyfriend support cycles to go through with you maybe unfair maybe this is the guy sometimes we burn people out though it doesnt matter if this time is different you just have to accept thats where they are at i think its a low blow that she tells you to come back when the shit hits the fan as opposed to at the oneyear point when it turns you are now in your first stable relationship but shes coming from a place of total burn out not much you can do but in your heart thank her for what she has done for you respect her space and hope you two might meet again down the road two things going on at once in her grief she couldnt express her needs and in your adhdness you didnt think to say out loud what you assumed was known for her to tell you what she needed and youd do it in all fairness even non adhders are not mind readers now if she had asked you to go with her and you flaked i think you should beat yourself up but this one is kind of a gray area send her some nice flowers or buy her a plant and ask her what you can do now to support her later when shes out of grief tell her you do much better with explicit instructions and you do want to support her i mean shes 54 hanging out with these people they all sound exhausting a teen soap opera because this guys friends circle never grew up this problem just will not go away the problem is your friends period even if you all loooove bob hes enabling a significant other who is a nightmare person hes complicit in this also honestly from your description of events you hold your fiance as responsible for starting this an outside perspective is that the friend group sounds like a bunch of immature drunk frat guys and sorority girls who are too old to behave the way they do and they are ganging up on your fiance for seeing them for what they are you are in your 30s you keep your friendship with bob separate and go out and make a new friend group with your wife realize this is not an acceptable social combination moving forward your loyalty should be to your fiance and if an entire group of people is tacitly going along with bullying her by believing sarahs bullshit then you should be cutting those people out of your life too edit rereading this youll throw sarah out if she causes problems she already ruined a pre wedding event throwing her out midwedding is drama i think you are way more of the problem than you realize youve been hanging out with toxic immature people so long you dont even know what normal behavior is mmmhmm sipping a nightcap at the bedroom bartop table while the significant other takes his or her evening deposit charmed life if shes drinking like an alcoholic you are doing her no favors by enabling her when you give someone an ultimatum like i will leave unless you quit drinking and they dont quit then you go otherwise you have removed any reason for them to change shell have to do that on her own talk to a lawyer and get your ducks lined up that debt is probably both of yours now but at least if you divorce now it will be capped at 20k in another 3 years it may grow exponentially as for her dying without you people are resourceful especially alcoholics trust me when i say shell survive first of all get yourself some flavor onions are flavor are they sugar once sauteed for awhile sure but also good fiber and antioxidants secondly is this all you are eating chicken rice broccoli every day all meals while you can get enough nutrients from that meal mix it up for the love of life think of it this way one veg one protein small amount of healthy grain do a poached salmon for a few nights a week try an omlete or a small turkey burger at least change up your greens different vegetables are going to have different nutrient values and getting more colors in there red bell pepper some carrots bok choy or spinach would go a long way to making this a great and healthy way to meet your goals try some bulgar quinoa or millet a handful of berries a week isnt going to get you away from your goal and also supplies more needed antioxidants and vitamins only eating the exact same meal every day for weeks months sounds very close to getting yourself into disordered eating my mom did that with one of their little mini tea roses and it also has flourished in her garden for something like 15 years now but tea roses really are outdoor plants i wear glasses and every time i go around a curve staring intently at the road it thinks i am not looking at the road something about the glasses or lighting or maybe my head doesnt move enough but on curvy mountain roads i have to remember to turn it off or it s hell every bend getting yelled at when you are paying attention im confused if you were nonmonogamous when he slept with the last sex worker how is that infidelity i think you need to be fair here and not ascribe infidelity where there was none to be taken aback or unsure of how you feel that your partner paid for sex is totally understandable but he didnt cheat on you it is uncool that he didnt reveal this much of history to you sooner that part can feel like a betrayal of trust for sure i think part of it may be that theres a loophole to paying for sex versus dating or hookups in that you can just order service without any of the rest of the work of dating so it can seem dehumanizing and even if you arent judgemental of sex workers themselves maybe you are judgemental of johns i cant say how to overcome it but if you really love him and the relationship feels worth it then give the news some time to settle getting married at 23 is actually very different than getting married at 29 you are staring down 30 and have finished your 20s she only just started hers and has been in a relationship with you since she was 18 if you two have never really spent more than a week apart shes not wrong that she should take time off my best guess is you have been in a caretaker role for most of this relationship she has told you she loves you but isnt in love with you that she feels like she has missed out on parts of life and you are telling her you do know how she feels better than she does if that sort of thing bleeds over into other parts of your dynamic whether you mean to or not you may have been controlling let her go away for a month you dont want to marry an unwilling partner and you dont want to be convincing someone they are actually willing i cant say if itll end it likely it does and this is the slow ease on her end but if she does come back i think you both should seriously consider postponing the wedding get her a proper diagnosis coping strategies can be learned including visual notes phone alarms looking at sorting tasks that play to her strong suits learning how to get some tools to help with executive functioning including possible medication otherwise you telling someone just think who has adhd no matter how loving or kindly doesnt fix their adhd now if it isnt adhd and shes just stressed rushed thats different but rule out adhd first id be very worried they tiled without putting a shower pan liner in first and you already have wood rot thats chucko the barrelofmonkies monkey finding a good therapist is really truly difficult i absolutely empathize with that but are you taking any other action to help yourself its a lot to place untreated mental illness on a significant other its different if there is a treatment plan in place and some tools being learned on your part how to communicate your needs clearly if you get snappy and moody that is not okay imagine wanting to help someone but not being able to predict their mood or how they will receive it eventually it leads to just walking on eggshells
