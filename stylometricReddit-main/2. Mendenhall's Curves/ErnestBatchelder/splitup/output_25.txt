them sound like turds we dont actually know what your coworkers told ng just that shes either thoughtless enough or cruel to say that stuff to you ask other women out outside of your job youll find better keep your private life private and away from your work world while it will likely blow over in time now you know the type of people they are immature and insecure high schoollevel gossips who can only feel good about themselves by putting others down sorry that happened op but i bet youll find a better partner soon first off congratulation on getting out its tough and youre brave i imagine you care what other people think because so much of what he did in gaslighting you was make you question what you thought and that his behavior was okay and you deserved it keep going to therapy a real one not a church therapist or counselor eventually with the right therapist believing you it can be enough to validate your lived experience so you can believe it meanwhile make friends outside of the church where he is a pastor those people are conditioned to believe hes good youre bad because they need that to believe theyre in a good church work on your own sense of self find support away from that circle if you hear murmurs or rumors you are bad or to blame you can respond no one ever knows what goes on behind closed doors so they should refrain from commenting this way you dont have to reveal details you feel wont be believed and it shuts it down friend your 30s are not the time to start dating broke musicians thats what your 20s were for i dont really think you messed up a fan should be able to be run for an hour without the motor blowing double pane windows should be sealed properly and you have the right to a reasonable expectation of privacy when showering although window curtains open window is private and gets some steam out so once a double pane window gasket springs a leak its likely impossible to repair its not like its something you broke either thats just an old window or cheap one theres a sealant in there that over time breaks down try to find a clear link that describes the problem do this in writing not verbally explain the seal on the window has deteriorated the mold is inside the double pane to be fair the bathroom should have a strong enough ceiling fan and vent that you dont need a window and door open to take a normallength shower if someone is emotionally unavailable but wanted to win someones favor back by doing zero work on themselves buying a box of stuff would be a great start obviously sending it back is expensive take the gifts send him a nice thank you but also let him know youd prefer not to receive any presents in the future where a nice card would do no point in reopening the door fyi whenever you break up with someone and finally start moving on feeling good or hopeful again 9 times out of 10 thats the exact moment the ex will pop up again in some way i swear its a test hes 7 years older than you he gets drunk and acts like a rude disrespectful asshole then he spins it around that hes pissed with you that you dont like his rude disrespectful behavior if you are going to date someone older do it because you get along and they are emotionally mature emotionally intelligent humans not two 12yearolds wearing a trench coat neither of us wanted a relationship but we maybe established that we were exclusive whaaat my guy has never even taken me out for coffee so you are exclusively having sex only no romance no dates with some guy as a fwb thingie but not dating and not in a relationship so you are exclusive fwb just dont do that that sounds miserable you are either exclusively dating someone as in you go out together and do normal partner stuff they are your only sexual partner or you are just sleeping with someone in a fwb situation where they have no say over who else you see you can try calling county mental health hotline and see if they will connect you to a caseworker who may come out and see if hes open to shelters etc probably not with the meth thing going on you could get motion sensor sprinklers to go off when someone walks on your front lawn area heres a list of resources you will see there are some nonpolice numbers for mental health and mobile response teams some county and some nonprofit first off id call la county health and open a case on him to start the ball rolling for la countys access crisis hotline 247 mobile crisis response team access operates 24 hoursday 7 daysweek as the entry point for mental health services in los angeles county services include deployment of crisis evaluation teams information and referrals gatekeeping of acute inpatient psychiatric beds interpreter services and patient transport request psychiatric mobile response team team is made up of two dmh clinicians law enforcement will be involved only if requested by clinicians based on danger assessment 1 800 8547771 press 1 for crisis services you say he is not aggressive and always goes away when you ask so hes really not a violent threat so he cant be taken away so to speak away from your neighborhood without his permission to go to a shelter or temp housing or treatment it doesnt mean if meth is involved that he wont get a bit stabby but i think your best bet is call the la county mental health and try to get to a caseworker if a caseworker makes contact with him it is a loooong process but housing or treatment can be offered and sometimes they can get them off the streets second best is temporarily make your front porch as noninviting as possible no chairs cap spigot motion sensor sprinklers unfortunately once your home is chosen it is very difficult to getting unchosen without investing a front yard fence and locked gate while there are plenty of small towns in northern california where things can get weird the fact that the lady and the dog had little to no reaction makes me think it was sound bouncing or echoing against something so when you and your sister heard it across the street you both heard it as warped wipe him down with a warm washcloth to get the oil off him so he doesnt lick it clean try mixing the kitten wet food with the kitten milk to see if that helps him get some down there is a way to safely wash stray kittens but no need to overstress him right now vet asap to get rid of wormsfleas such a good grump face add it to salad dressings make tzatziki blend with fresh or frozen fruit then freeze to make popsicles the people in this thread including op rationalizing what she did are really gross at one party investigators said oconnor gave a boy a condom and pushed him into a bedroom where a girl was slipping in and out of consciousness the girl was so scared that she locked herself in a bathroom to get away from the boy another girl said she cried as she was sexually assaulted by a boy and oconnor reacted by laughing some of the sexual encounters between teens happened in oconnors hot tube while the mom was also in the hot tube one 14yearold girl said she almost drowned because she was dangerously intoxicated oconnor was always the only adult present at the parties hanks wrote oconnor told all minors who attended parties at her residence or were given alcohol not to tell anyone about the parties she stated if anyone was told she could go to jail hanks wrote oconnor believed jane doe 5 age 14 was breaking this rule she imposed as a result oconnor threatened to spread rumors about jane doe 5 she threatened a 14 year old girl to spread rumors if she reported what happened multiple teen girls from age 1315 came forward to collaborate the woman is a child sex predator if you think this is some mom wanting to have fun please never have kids dude she got girls drunk then when they were passed out she brought the boys into where they were passed encouraged them to rape them what the fuck are you trying to defend you weird sicko none of this is like a parent giving kids booze and condoms she didnt encourage drunk kids to have sex she got teenager girls drunk to the point they were in and out of consciousness then encouraged her son and friends to rape them she then fled the state why minimize rape is a violent crime btw and yeah kids party and have sex parents have bought teens booze to drink not a big deal in my opinion but being the consigliere to help assist in sexual assault is completely abhorrent predatory behavior has been caught alone with my toddler in her room several times has been caught alone with my toddler in her bathroom several times while indecent i would have called the police or still call and start a paper trail in case she escalates her behavior you need a restraining order this is a disturbed individual and you definitely never should have let her be in your home after the first incident i am a push over and let ppl take advantage of me bc i dont like confrontation my friend therapy lear to speak up this was beyond being a doormat or a pushover you endangered your kid with an unhinged individual in your home be polite firm and cut ties wanting flowers from your garden that you paid for now own is a huge overstep so these are the types to view themselves as still entitled to a home they sold i had similar with the first house i bought i put up with it somewhat because i wanted to be able to address any questions but the guy actually did not give me good info over time felt like he still had some connection to the home older invasive personality type i should have shut it down lesson learned any questions after i buy go i will go back to my agent and ask them to follow up with the seller agent even a few months down the road the agent made decent money off the sale and wants referrals from me so they can field a few emails for me as a buffer if a few months have passed by then its on me to do the legwork and figure out any previous work im convinced that all home warranty companies only outsource to 1star repair companies intentionally so they never have to pay to fix like they scour google looking for repair people who have all bad reviews this way the insured person will get fed up after 1 or 2 goarounds and pay for it themselves as you are you are better off going through the original warranty on the appliance or replacing it if its out of warranty look i am someone who strongly believes that a fetus is not a human and early termination is 100 okay thing to have to happen its not okay to repetitively use abortion instead of practicing safe sex and birth control but thats not what happened here know that when you are making the right choice for you you are making the right choice for what is currently part of your body seek normal counseling be very careful about prolife centers offering fake
