the rocks and trees would also break it up and make it easier to visually move around the painting may be as simple as eliminating the pink in the water with more highlights and lowlights in white and a browngreyblue any way around paywall id love to see where they are falling out west because where i am in the west id say a haircut off the top in a correction but hardly a fall as of now theres a historical 5 year drought cycle in ca its just that the past decade or so theyve become significantly drier dry years hotter summers if we got 23 years of rain then the 5 year drought wed actually function in terms of water although not in terms of current infrastructure real question is if this summer gets hotter more current lush green spaces dry up worse fire season because that shit is not sustainable here its not as darksuperearlygrayformonthsdailydrizzle though storm moves in several days of sun 5560 degrees out then another storm moves in pacific north west is still a whole nextlevel commitment to constant gray wet dark for months go look at carvana carmax and the other online car buyers you will likely get even a bit more for your tradein from one of those places than any brickandmortar car dealership why dont you pause your normal classes for one semester and take a writing class find out how much you can do and what you feel about doing it with more focus most community classes will have writing classes but if you are in the us look at things like the uc extension programs a bit pricey but one class to dip your toe in wont hurt prior to shifting and entire major life focus i know this is a painful thing to go through if they are actually puppies and still very young while i realize you love them deeply they can go to a rescue and will be adopted if it is a good rescue then the families who adopt are vetted and the rescue commits to the life of the dog to always take those dogs back in you could also see if any rescues would take them as short term fosters get a room and stabilizing should be your first priority i wish you luck they can suddenly read very well when they realize a tenant understands their rights and will push back otherwise slumlords conveniently dont read true sometimes when you lose patience with someone or get fed up with them while you still need to watch your own behaviors its a sign you may need a little break anyone selfdiagnosing or online diagnosing themselves with did from tik tok is making a huge leap the bigger issue may be having a friend who has very real mental health issues but is still at a stage where creating added drama feels rewarding to them i mean youre teens not to be condescending but thats bound to happen youre allowed to step away in kindness if its getting too much so let him have his period of ignoring you most cases hell reach out again down the road trainer or classes can help you push through nothing like other people around to make you step up im not a competitive person but sometimes i pretend im in a competition with someone else around me at the gym it helps me work harder even if they are clearly in better shape i dont stare at them or watch their workouts i just make up a game in my head that i have to beat soandso when really i am just pushing myself to beat my own level im at stay a little longer on cardio or do more reps i was just making banter but my bf told me that i was masculine and made him unattracted to me hes a total misogynist plenty of people enjoy outgoing personalities this guy is a dud who just wanted arm candy that didnt speak nothing about being able to hold your own in conversation is masculine thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard email mail a hard copy registered mail dear slumlord as per my text and emails on dates list all dates and times you contacted them alerting you that we have no hot water and requesting a timeline of the fix i am reaching out one last time to let you know we will be withholding rent on the 1st until the issue is fixed we will put rent aside and prorate it for when the fix occurs the other option can be for us to replace the hot water heater and deduct the cost from aprils rent in which case we supply you with all receipts with our remaining rent payment as you know by california law all tenants have a right to live in a habitable property this means there must be running water both hot and cold please let us know how youd like to proceed double check la county law if you choose to go withholding rent you may need to open up an escrow account and put it in there you dont want to withhold rent and end up evicted paper trail everything good luck its called info dumping honestly an info dumper needs to learn the time and place i say that as an info dumper otherwise it is its own form of rudeness maybe you can find some audiobooks or bookbooks on the art of conservation and active listening tell him youd love it if his mindset could expand in those directions or just say hey i miss our conversations more and more lately i feel like you are lecturing me and it makes me feel really diminished can we work on the oldtime art of conversating with some give and take they should be mandated teardowns even with remediation thats a cancer cluster waiting to happen firm boundaries and the chips fall where they may mental health childhood trauma may be the reason for asshole behavior but its not an excuse your mom has chosen a path of enabling you have chosen to break free your wedding is symbolic of you truly starting your own family and furthering yourself from a chaotic childhood dont compromise on that nah she cant cover the cost of the biggest loss the memory of ops wedding being ruined by an asshole please love him and get him neutered to stop the lineage of strays in louisianna nondisclosure state lived in a place where someone odd in the bathtub it was a former meth lab with an explosion but the new owners had gutted and down a really nice reno jobby on it beautiful views of the bayou too i only learned the storied history from all the neighbors in other homes and apartment buildings around it unless you properly remediate meth chemicals from walls they are toxic and really bad to live with everyone in that building went nuts and i moved out because the immediate neighbors in my building drove me up a wall but it also just had bad vibes and i seriously couldnt take baths in the od tub i am going to go with meth walls made everyone nuts but maybe it was the junkie ghosts who knows id negotiate for 6 months up front cash then for the lease to state month to month after the first 6 months that gives you half a year to get a job but also a way out if things dont pan out place the other 7500 in a high yield savings or cd make sure the contract lease is very clear and no loopholes that could come back to bite you in the ass from all of your comments below you come up with some reasonable solutions or accommodations and your wife is shooting them down she sounds like she has some form of untreated ppd likely anxiety right now you are letting the person with dysfunction set all the rules for your family and the rules shes making keep her in her cycle of episodes and keep you running around trying to accommodate thing is even if shes the greatest mom on earth this is impacting the mental health of your children too witnessing their mother having episodes is fucking with their development little kids blame themselves and babies very much need calm anchors to turn to she needs medical treatment and support in the home period you cannot continue to accommodate her refusal for treatment or her refusal to let you hire people come into the home to help the discussion needs to be with her during a good period and it needs to be framed with the childrens needs and the impact on them not as much about you tell her that you will be there for treatment and look for doctors and therapists who are experts in endocrinology and mental health but at the end of the day your children deserve to have a mom who is willing to take care of herself to be there for her kids so current owner is really just a buyer who cant finish their sale until a sucker pays them over what they are in contract to pay this sucks for the original seller and the next buyer i am guessing its one of those we buy dumps for cash flyer groups stockton im betting this is in stockton we have a conversation he apologizes swears hell do better even lists off how he plans to do better and then never follows through for more than a day option 1 one last ditch effort to get him to really see what you are verbally telling him get out a poster board and place it somewhere highly visible kitchen whatever write down one item of his plan to do better a commitment to every day complete x task then make m t w th f s su boxes underneath and for every day he completes x task he will check the box for that day this either externalizes things to the point that he actually can functionally do stuff adhd technique or if the depression is so bad its blocking even lowlevel functioning there is an external piece of evidence where he has to acknowledge the reality of how bad it is sometimes with adhd depression there can be a very high level of denial as to how bad its gotten as a coping mechanism to acknowledge how bad it is to see the very tall mountain he needs to climb and seeing that with no tools or skills for handling adhd is paralyzing so the cycle of nothing happening continues option 2 ultimatum he either gets treatment or you are separating problem with ultimatums is you have to really be willing to follow through thanks eh nothing is bringing home values back down in los feliz i think recent murder no almost 100yearold murder house frame only intact full renovation new electricityplumbingroof the chances of it feeling bad inside are very low now if it was kept as some creepy shrine that would be different and gross it is california law that any death in a home must be disclosed at sale and possibly to renters not sure about that which is better than louisianna where i briefly lived for a few years and definitely ended up renting some murder homes neighbors would tell me stories of what happened after i moved in just bad vibes all around and i hated it from the pictures of the last time it was on the market gutted its actually got good bones those old 1920s villas are stunning large foyers high ceilings old growth frames albeit some of the bedrooms are usually pokey with no closets west coast is always tearing old stuff down would be nice to see someone
