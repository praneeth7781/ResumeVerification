it is to be detaillied to as opposed to lie of ommission i would have a hard time trusting this person or wanting to be a support system for them the aspect of the lie that would most upset me is it isnt really about safety she could have just never mentioned where she was living since you two never met in person anymore its that she lied in a way that was seeking empathy how do you continue giving so much of yourself to someone who needs a lot of support when you can no longer trust what is real and whats possibly attentionseeking if she can acknowledge it was fucked up thats another thing i guess where maybe you can rebuild trust it sounds overall that you put a lot into this friendship do you get any love and support back yes yellow boots he texted a 14yearold to kill herself he sounds like when he was a kid hed torture animals for looking at him wrong dolores i hope you have or can get therapy thats a lifetime of hurt in that relationship nothing in your text was wrong it was the truth and also you dont have to love your mother you mention you do love her a lot in your post because shes your mom but her mental health is no excuse for her behavior it is not the behavior of someone worth loving you do not have to make up with her before she dies shes never apologized or atoned not everyone deserves forgiveness in this life either its a hard truth people want others to act like things are okay to make their own refusal to say the truth feel better not your job to do so what you do need to do is take care of yourself get therapy to sort out the deeper hurts and live your best life you need to consult with a child therapist and lawyer if you dont want to coparent with him because of his behavior fair enough but find out your legal rights he did not sign away parental rights could sue you may be better off getting mediation and an agreement of rights signed edit i would not go off any verbal agreements between you two without a serious understanding of your legal rights first also whenif this all comes out you are going to need help explaining to your kids the whole thing child therapist consult do you need a house is homeownership something you want can you make the payments with current mortgage rates do you have enough of a savings that after the 100k youd still have money for house emergencies because there usually is one are you looking to stay in that locations for 5 years if so house is a good deal only because it is a thing and it does keep you warm even with a crash if it is a decent area then the house will go back up enough in 57 year cycle that its not terrible no one can time the market so its more about what your current needs are than anything else you could buy total crash comes and prices go down but at the same time banks will tighten up on loans so you are still waiting out a cycle wait coastal where im in ca coastal is 1 mil for a crapbox smokings gross think about not hocking up phlegm every 10 minutes keep going you got this and also i still miss it decades later because drug dealers dealing in large sums weekly launder their money through business fronts first mom closet money is a onetime thing ooh one thing i was told by my very upfront honest real estate agent who truly believed there was a bubble even 2 years ago when i sold with her until the word recession is officially spoken everything is in crazy land once a recession gets official then house prices especially condos or townhomes because those always lose value first drop in a market where 4050 of buyers are cash you will not see interest rates shift much only a recession job loss etc but rents do not necessarily go down in a housing market downturn or a recession they may dip for about 6 months but then you usually have more people renting during recessions than normal markets and rents stabilize and continue to increase take that info as you will if you are not ready to buy i would apply the same hunt mentality to rentals to look for a better deal if you can grab one as an american exsmoker part of me thinks if i make it to 70 im going to pick one of these smoking countries and spend my last 10 years on earth growing cancer and yellowing my teeth while drinking espresso and chain smoking i mean i get it its gross as hell but sometimes i miss that feeling ambiverts are a thing but also being an extrovert just means you get energy from being around people and being an introvert means you get energy from alone time how good you are with people how talkative or entertaining isnt really the defining quality you could be awkward and not very verbal but still need to be around people and be an extrovert you could be engaging and chatty with stragners but need alone time to energize so introvert im great in front of groups can be very entertaining used to give lectures while i get energy during those situations as soon as they are over im exhausted and need to just sit and decompress by staring at a doorknob for 6 hours because she doesnt love you and may even be bordering on sociopathic levels of zero empathy my friend from your comments below i didnt tolerate it i spoke to him i just dont understand i feel embarrassed i dont know if its my looks or my personality or something else op do you even see how you are thinking about yourself in response to gross disrespect from your husband rather than realize my husband is disrespecting me hes pursuing a form of intimacy with his ex and pretending i dont exist hes acting a bit like a high school mean girl you are listing all the things wrong with yourself to be disinvited thereby indicating some part of you believes you deserve to be treated like this this isnt about you not being good enough in any sense its about your husband treating you like an afterthought and with disrespect instead of viewing him as possibly cheating lying to you andor being a dick why are you focused on how if you were different it wouldnt have happened hes the one who should be different question does your husband pick on you cut you down in small ways or compare you to make you feel less than others or are you with him because you already had very low selfesteem and believe you deserve to be treated like this friend think and want better for yourself you arent in the schoolyard waiting to be picked for kickball found wanting youre married to an ass no landscaping or fence was going to mitigate grease air and people blasting music waiting in the drivethrough at 1 am you are 19 you should go live life just have some street smarts make sure your friends will all have each others backs and dont drink until you are stupid drunk eh if you arent homeless you have options in sf to avoid public bathrooms or at least use a good one i havent lived there in eons mind you but i would always go into one of any number of fancy hotels and use their bathroom certain neighborhoods yes you are out of luck no fancy hotel but if you are friendly you can usually pop into a corner bar and ask nicely and theyd let you your boyfriend tolerates this which is not okay its on him to tell them to back off and he hasnt but also next time they ask for a freebie say no cant do that its for your own good i wouldnt want to sully your pure soul with my corporate blood money she has a drinking problem and i dont mean like an alcoholic oh no shes absolutely an alcoholic you are misunderstanding that just because she doesnt drink every day she cant be a fullblown alcoholic anyone who drinks the way you are describing who frequently experiences blackouts is a bingedrinking alcoholic twice shes also blaming being drugged and maybe she was roofied but she also just as easily could be falling into blackouts with less alcohol than she thought because her tolerance is shot long story short you are an enabler you dont mean to be but you watch out for her hope shell be okay let her get so drunk shes unruly then wait for her to pass out to get her home you are caretaking a drunk as long as you continue to enable her shes not going to change she needs way more than to cut down or quit on her own she needs therapy a program of some sort for alcoholism and a lifelong commitment to stop drinking shell likely never be a just one drink person it can hold for a week or two then shell be back to blackout drinking i always recommend alanon to people in your shoes with the caveat that 12step programs have issues but it is free and available online or in person anywhere in the world i highly recommend you think about attending a meeting and hearing from others who have been through this if you did choose to break up you would be well within your rights to do so it may well be the best thing for you know that might be good for her in the end too because you staying as an enabler isnt helping first off congrats on the career change teacher burn out is real and i can imagine how amazing it is to find a new trajectory that interests you and that you are good at x200b i have been walking on egg shells trying to be a good wife but its never enough secondly stop doing that do a reasonable share of chores your son is old enough to contribute and your husband knows how to wash the dishes or go to the store he has begin to signal divorce lol does he think a 50yearold divorcee who is unsupportive is going to do well out there let him signal away he can divorce you and learn how to buy his own cereal you are taking meds for anxiety but what about treatment or therapy to learn some helpful coping skills basically if you ran all those thoughts through some cognitive behavior practice theyd come out for what they are anxiety it sounds like shes a tad flakey and the onus on getting together is on you thats more a sign of who she is in this dynamic than leaping to wants out of the friendship those are also things that when you are secure you can just bring up to a friend or when you have several people to hang out with it puts less pressure on the one but when you overthink things to the point of worst case scenario you can sometimes create the issue you are scared of therapy would help if you arent in it already its really great to work with someone who specializes in anxiety and get a better grasp on the root causes i would not accept this given youve decided to stay i dont know if this falls on deaf ears but i would mandate couples therapy and her taking full responsibility or i walk completely otherwise if she blames
