mind games he enjoys or hed be setting the boundaries and x200b he says she is too emotionally unstable to be in a relationship with so if she gets her mental health together hed be dating her you are a placeholder after 3 months of being given second place during the honeymoon phase where you both should be having fun you are mainly an invited audience member to watch their drama unfold you shouldnt have to be explaining half of this to someone who just lost a previous relationship over the same issue walk away friend i like it a lot but its skulls there are not a lot of ways to despooky the exposed head bones of dead animals on a black background if it was a larger still life of more objects skulls hat flowers wine etc on a light background like a southwestern blue sky it would be less spooky but with the way youve centered the skulls on a dark background i mostly want you to paint a moon above that is the light source for them which is only going to spookify it more i say embrace the tone thats created here so the thing that doesnt make sense the wife had an old prescription for seroquel meaning at one time she was prescribed antipsychotic medication and must have had at least one psychotic episode herself yet in the update post shes described as confused and didnt know what was going on him wouldnt the wife know what a psychotic episode looks like you can at least ask what theyd be asking and tell them what you were thinking yes meant to be implied in the order of the sentence but probably should have used then tell them let owners go first looks like monterey ca very beautiful he makes major life decisions on a whim like buying a house so yeah why wouldnt he flip on other major life decisions like a longterm plan to move hes 7 years older than you and likes how he has his life arranged if you want something different moving to sf then plan for it on your own if you want to stay in the current situation no real intent to change your relationship dynamic then stay i dont know if it is a bad photo but that just looks like the slight damage from having a dresser against a wall aka normal wear and tear try a magic eraser melamine foam on it hi you know we love this house and our time here over the past 8 years and you have been stellar landlords as we eventually start our plans to buy our own first home we thought it worth asking if youd ever consider selling to us just keep it vague and polite and start a conversation they can always say no they may say yes its a no harm no foul situation if you make a polite inquiry id have comps ready know how much home you can buy and what sort of mortgage youd be looking at so if they do say yes you can at least ask what theyd be asking and tell them what you were thinking in terms of a solid offer you are way too invested in someone who has porous boundaries as do you you secretly hope youll get back together and she is using you as a safe person she told you to leave her alone believe her and respect that stay professional at work shell probably reach back out when she needs another standin as a partner you should move on and not reengage although based on your behaviors in the post you likely will maybe dont do that there are stories that use a lot of references to brands or companies think american psycho it is a stylistic choice so its constant throughout while google is part of our daily lexicon it wont really be a word until the company itself has collapsed may happen or is replaced by stronger competition and people still use it to mean searched online i would use looked or searched online op wont get their commission unless their clients pay over asking on one of the current crapboxes available so suck it up homebuyers they imply this is meant to be a public service announcement but if they have multiple clients pulling out of sales at the last minute i question how great of a realtor they are both in making sure the homes their clients are bidding on match the clients needs they are transparent on the process of closing sounds like a combo platter of things older population older buildings thin floors less insulation and a possible sprinkling of very real xenophobia especially as you feel it is coming from an older generation in general start your search for a topstory apartment youve found coping mechanisms for now headphones maybe also find peaceful areas to work a few hours a day outside of your home to get a reprieve if you can then take your time and do a really long apartment search until you find something that covers everything you want maybe looking at smaller buildings top floor etc as a noisesensitive person i can tell you sounds coming through the floorboards never hit as badly as when there is banging over your head good luck i dont know id prefer a tenant who wants to be cautious of what they are signing and take the time to read things thoroughly over one who signs a lease without reading it you could ask them what their specific questions and concerns are explain that you prefer to give the lease to those that apply and qualify first but id understand not wanting to pay an application fee if the lease has problematic clauses in it my god this would horrify me its not even the food waste though it is that its the pure decadence of it in search of fame likes followers i get liking to cook but a huge part of what makes cooking feel good to most nonsociopaths is the act of enjoying eating it sharing it or at least seeing someone else enjoy it even the most megalomaniac chefs in highend restaurants want their art to be enjoyed theres even been a movement in highend food photography to promote less waste so it can be eaten after a photo shoot rather than get tossed if his instagram thing was making overthetop food and having people over to enjoy it id be okay with the charcuterie or the lobster or the thanksgiving spread but this is like a psychopathic level of removal from reality nice very lush beautiful up there ooooh what island or island groups may i ask id show her the box and ask her also check the box to see the manufacturing date just in case she really hasnt cleaned her car in years i like the term and will continue using it maybe not on this sub for whatever reasons but quite frankly it is a much better descriptor i mean fuck it im not normal edited to add and theres no inherent shame in that he then said that any other women can do the exact same thing and that im nothing special i was speechless i know hes right friend hes not right when someone loves and respects you you arent interchangeable with a bunch of other people because they love you he sees women as interchangeable objects for transactional exchanges hell help you out but you are nothing to him big picture because hes incapable of it you deserve so much better even being on your own and struggling a bit is 1000 better than being with this hot bag of garbage ah yes thank you someone please explain rvncl7w to me because im stumped warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info cat arrested way to blame the victim i like it slightly bigger rug under the couch sitting area and then another rug by the stairway maybe tape off the floor and really see how large of rugs youd want that could ground the space more yeah all of mine prospered very well for at least a few years until one day they didnt it was like im alive im alive im alive oops i died what section of the country well at least we all know yes she likely was an awful parent based on that response and yes a lot of your struggles were her fault not your adhd but her lack of empathetic response her need to make everything about her and her shitty emotional skills keep up the therapy eventually you will get to a place where you can see your mom for the flawed person she is and wont need her support because youve learned how to support yourself and you have learned you deserve safe people in your life its doable what part of the country is this east coast that looks like a crapfest out there im on west coast where we are supposedly having a decline in prices and it just seems like a locking pattern not a lot on the market whats on it is either in bad condition sits or in decent condition area still sells quickly over very little inventory because i think a lot of people have decided not to sell under current conditions minus death or life moves thanks for the input what part of the uk are you in if you dont mind saying are you still going back to the uk frequently if so i have a question is the uk on the same path but a little less than the us i grew up in the us primarily but have a british passport and a us passport and have been thinking about moving to the uk i havent really spent any real time there since 2010 though most of my family there grandmother uncle have all passed now or moved away postbrexit i am wondering if the uk is that much better off on social issues than the us i feel like the overturning of roe v wade our higher amount of guns per capita school shootings high costs of medical care failing infrastructure are all getting to me and ive had to deal with gun violence here us a few times in my work and old neighborhood but then i hear about the nhs getting defunded nazis in the labor party and ukipers in the right housing issues gross inequity i worry is the uk just a lesser degree of dystopia now i had a horrible emotional crash on focalin and ritalin it made me extremely sad every evening when it wore off tell your prescribing doctor whats happening and ask them if you should continue or if they want to try a different medication is your dog crate trained thats the best way to stop him or her from barking when you are not home the dog may not bark a lot when you are there but could have anxiety when you leave most of the time 1020 minutes of nonstop barks will get a neighbor to report you id contact the office and let them know you are getting a camera to monitor the situation inside your home and are working on training to make sure the dog barks less this way they know you take them seriously but also that you will have a record of the dogs barking if they go further get out see if it has a collar with a phone number on it call animal control be a fucking semidecent human ooof thats the worst got it thanks ah thank you i was trying rotating and couldnt make it work you can certainly ask you
