better understand the general disdain for landlords give them notice to remove the dog i mean in a twisted way narcissists like having people indebted to them and logan uses the murder to shame kendall plenty i think it more plays into the idea that logan mocks kendall for not being a killer in early seasons to take over the company tells him he needs to be a killer kendall doesnt really become a logan replacement until after his mothers wedding when he drops the weight of guilt for being a murderer once he can disavow himself of any moral compass internalized guilt and shame hes finally grown into his lovely daddys shoes i would offer 6 months paid up front last months rent paid proof of savings and after 6 months see if landlord would accept a monthtomonth lease try also getting a letter of recommendation from a previous landlord that states you are a good tenant this way if they wanted you out they have a loophole after 6 months landlords are replying theyd all say no but you just need one to okay the offer depending on how competitive the market is in plenty of areas in the us rent has increased well beyond yearly incomes making the 3x income requirement harder and harder to fill realistically people are just paying more of their income to rent or mortgages now eventually the market has to catch up to realize this or units will just sit empty by this logic though people lose good jobs all the time an employed tenant can also be out of work after a year op your husband sucks on multiple levels he should be proud of you defend you and if his friends didnt snap out of it the first time he defended you he should have left the friend circle they are bullies and horrible people tell your husband this is nonnegotiable you will not subject yourself to people who disrespect you and call you names and that he cant see why thats offensive is telling on him so it is a monthtomonth lease in ca i believe monthtomonth leases can give landlords the ability to raise rents but only twice per year they must give written notice there is a cap if it is a standalone home then it is outside of any rent control and yes the landlord can raise rents at any time id ask if they can put into wording on the lease only once per year and capped by a say 35 if shes talking about her property taxes then that is a one time yearly increase for her otherwise shes able to come to you with any kind of unreasonable charges i wouldnt sign it masochistic zillowing it happened to a friend of mine they got bedbugs in the place and the host had the gall to accuse them of bringing them in its always a possibility even in hotels although they tend to do better pest control but i check beds everywhere now i mean did he do anything special in those 5 days to make you feel romantic some people feel desire all the time some people feel it because the other person initiates intimacy with them and that makes them experience desire also when you are new things are different anyway the way you can talk about things is to start the conversation why dont you during regular meal times cook together watch a cooking video on a simple good meal and delegate tasks i get being irritated or thinking someone is using weaponized incompetence but it seems he is willing to do the chore you just dont like what he makes that hes asking you questions but if instead of asking him to take over when you are busy if you made normal meal times a shared fun job at least a couple times a week hed learn as he goes fyi bedbugs bite in 2s and 3s in a line they call it breakfast lunch and dinner those are likely bed bug bites next time pull up all the bedding and look for small black or brown stains around the seams of any mattress id bag up my suitcase and toss all clothes in a high dryer id reply to the host saying after first night brother woke up to about 20 bites a bug in the bed host was unconcerned said it as mosquitoes brother slept on the couch for remainder of stay got no more bites just keep it to the facts and be unemotional as to what exactly happened dont be afraid to give bad reviews for hosts either you dont have to be in this relationship you dont need him to start individual therapy and you certainly dont need a biased therapist to give you the approval to leave two negatives make a positive not in the forest as it upsets the trees and rabbits probably best into a pillow or in the car i was there for over 15 years in the middle of that period i went away for about 3 yrs to another part of the country the south men in this area would chat you up if you were out on a saturday night then ask for your number then call you on a wednesday to plan a dinner date for the following weekend while i never found love in that state either i would be mind blown every time a guy just acted like a decent interested human instead of texting you up at 2 am five weeks after asking for your number ha fyi in this post your replies it seems you are trying to present yourself as the reasonable one who wants to be classy genuine sincere and that your exs mom is the true shitstirrer while she may be one you come across as just as problematic the classy way to handle a breakup is to be polite when you see your ex but dont go poking around in petty emotional wounds or reinserting yourself into their life or familys life if the mother is so histrionic that your leaving without saying goodbye made her clutch pearls and faint then there is no apology that could salve that wound because the whole issue is stupid to begin with oh no now i looked its heartbreaking op needs some therapy for selfesteem issues why shes so afraid to just be alone for a bit shes also in la from experience its a tough town to date in look there are a ton of other hateful people online i guess im okay warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info he has acknowledged that his reactions are misogynistic and inappropriate but its the reality and he cant get through it why would you want to help someone cope with their own internalized misogyny when they have expressed zero interest in changing and instead are claiming this is normal this isnt on you to fix but it is on you to feel empowered enough to know you dont deserve this either he works on himself or for your own sense of self you leave you dont have to retraumatize yourself by putting up with someone dehumanizing you again in king lear cordelia was actually good none of his kids are it could just as easily be based on richard iii but that would be an argument that tom swoops in macbeth or julius caesar and roman knives him in the final scene i mean its loosely shakespearean in that ken wins but it also destroys him which is really more traditional greek tragedy now that i write it out the patio plant panopticon room wait shes your ex and you knew she was drama when you chose to be roommates okay this one is on you you arent going to get her to stop dating like another commenter suggested but you dont have to be the frontline audience to her drama i adore having you as a friend and as a roomie but since youve gotten back into dating i dont have the bandwidth to keep cycling through your emotional ups and downs with guys when i am at home sometimes i just need to relax we can discuss anything else tell me about your day at work tv show plots blah blah shared interest but i am putting a moratorium on the saga of your love life discussions she may not take it well but all you have to do is continue being nice but shut down the guy talk the moment it happens i used to work at a university tutoring center and most of the students that used it were foreign language students who needed help checking their english in final papers i never laughed at any of them why would i but i often delighted in how foreign language speakers would translate their own idioms into english or their use of adjectives and verbs were technically correct but so different from how native speakers construct sentences i delighted in it because it often created a poetic use of english we native speakers cant access i found it to be really engaging and spoke to how we are all trying to explain our world i get why it comes across more as patronizing but i think it is helpful to have a sense of humor about our own struggles with language there is a study that says one reason children are better at learning a second language is not that they arent selfconscious yet about making mistakes so theyll practice anywhere without editing themselves i dont understand why hes so against my diagnosis because rather than support you and learn hed rather have you think you are just a deficient human he can chastise he goes through the dsm5 criteria and just pulls out everything and says see you dont meet this or that says because i was diagnosed within one visit it must be wrong holy hell wtf ah it must be nice for him to be an unlicensed psychiatry psychology expert i wonder what other forms of unearned expertise he has under his belt and yes some types of adhd can hyper focus be quite attentive suggestion tell him under no uncertain terms to get on board with supporting you or to eff off you will no longer be discussing this issue with you you are both young so he isnt an authoritativedaddysmartsuperdoctor man hes just being a trash young guy who is diminishing his wife as you are getting help for adhd look into some counseling you may grow as you learn about your diagnosis hell either grow with you or try to hold you back if it is the latter you will need to know you can and do deserve better its kendall because thats also the shakespearean ending the poison drips through is the line that speaks to the entire series cbt is pretty much all about homework as others have said next session let her know that the adhd side of you is making doing assignments feel like another task to fail at and you are feeling overwhelmed can the two of you brainstorm solutions few 2 things that i can think of off the top of my head 1 video or voice record instead of writing down much easier just to pop open a voice record memo state datetimethought 2 2 other option may be voice to text should be available via google docs in the uk ive found voice to text notes in one document make it easier for me to get something down rather than trying to do the writing 3 asking her to up praisereward or check ins if shes open to it would she text or email you something every few days
