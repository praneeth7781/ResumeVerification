necessary because americans love stuff you can easily have 3 bedrooms a masters suite in 1700 square feet and live like kings queens imo proud pure all the immigration welfare queen stuff was a step beyond dog whistling they did a good job of writing that speech but oy too close to home ill admit the character of roman was always reprehensible to me for the amount of stuff he did that seemed like an online incel troll come to life but i still had some empathy for him based on how he was the kid who was clearly the most physically abused degraded of the 3 and the character had these occasionally sympathetic moments then last nights episode i felt kinda sick at having thought that for an ideologically vapid nazi good writing again fyi i believe the golden visa with purchase of property ended for porto i think portugal is investment path to a golden visa only now i would look up the various visas you may qualify for id figure out a way to visit first too regardless of what your godmother says nothing beats standing in a place to actually see yourself living there i got one from a landlord whom i had rented for 5 years had a good relationship with they wrote something similar but also added was a good communicator always worked with us to schedule any repairs make op sound like a betterthanaverage tenant if they were its not a bad idea to ask you dont need one its in no way required because a new place will run a credit check call you previous landlord but if you are looking to move to a competitive rental market having a letter that states you are a good tenant to add to your application certainly cant hurt uk trains that actually take you around the country ferries to other nearby countries high walkability everywhere the brits love their walking paths and i love walking everywhere unfortunately the weather is going to suck this is growing pains eh the growing pains phase has been going on since the us became a country for any historical progress there is always a major blowback but i agree that for homogeneous countries to judge the us as more racist is disingenuous given we have every community from around the world living here when people do immigrate here there is also frequently a much faster level of integration within one generation and a path to maintaining practicing heritage other countries with immigrant communities can end up isolating them i hope you havent already sent your drivers license or social security credit info edit if so you may want to check your credit and do a freeze that is a sure scam no lease signed means you hand over no money ever also ca has no state housing department we have a department of housing and community development that is specifically for getting housing for homeless people

skills start out at them after theyve finished up residency then move on to where they can build their own practice on the other hand as someone else pointed out a lot of specialists stay look hes a barnacle not a friend friends dont make other friends miss classes or dump suicidal ideation on a love interest as a way to trap them into caretaking it is not your job to be a mental health counselor to him you are not responsible for his inappropriate behaviors or reactions because heres the thing you were never going to fix or help him he just wants you in his orbit if he cant have you romantically then hell eeyore his way into you keeping him around because you feel sorry for him being a good friend is a twoway street i can no longer support you you need mental health support from a trained professional which you can find at the university health center if you are feeling suicidal please call 988 for the sake of my grades this semester and my own mental health i need a break please leave me alone seriously it seems cruel but his low selfesteem is for him to fix not you meanwhile start looking at your own behaviors college is always an okay time to learn about our personal behaviors that dont help us in life people pleasing caretaking trying to fix people and overenmeshment can lead you into dynamics like this which you do have a part in you are allowed to tell people no and not dive in right when you meet someone to try and fix them yta cat etiquette step 1 do not make direct eye contact either the human blinks or looks off to the side if cat does not respond in a similar fashion you are not approved and should abort the mission to pet if cat does respond in a similar fashion blinks back or looks off to side move on to step 2 step 2 hold out hand palm down allow several inches of distance between your hand and cats face and move slowly introduce to yourself dont just wave your hand in cats face while screaming kitty that is rude and susceptible to a swipe or scratching if cat ignores hand and looks away abort mission to pet if cat leans in to sniff and then do a chin rub move on to step 3 step 3 youve arrived you may pet the cat please go in the direction of the fur stay in the safety zones under chin and back of cat never too much in the area above tail unless invited stomach rubs are at the sole discretion of the cat im sorry i need to stop talking i ruin everything yeah its manipulative you fucked you so you apologized thats great taking ownership for messing up and apologizing is a good thing then in the next breath you went straight to putting yourself down which undercuts the apology its fishing for the other person to comfort you a good formula is apologize acknowledge the persons hurt feelings then offer a solution i am sorry for doing i hear that it upsets you and i will work on not doing that anymore her family has 2 dogs that dont get attention nor have they been on a walk in the last who knows how many years ill never understand this unless you live on a farm and have a working dog why have a pet you are going to dump in a yard ignore thats neglect and animal neglect is abuse she comes from a family of people who treat animals like crap i dont know i couldnt love anyone who got angry over properly caring for and petting a dog ffs after which he snaps crutches out of my hands so i was standing on one leg i slapped him and he grabbed me by the neck and arms do not kid yourself that this cant escalate beyond everything you wrote neglect and psychological abuse someone ripping the crutches away from a person who just had knee surgery is a sadist furnished finder is geared towards nurses to the us likely though other countries may have a different answer hospitality visas here are only for manageriallevel positions and require a college degree one thing to look at is nannying or au pair visa if you got some experience first you would need to work with an agency or get a family to sponsor you there is some bias in favor of women in childcare but a male nanny is not unheard of is it possible to simply rock up to a country and figure it out as you go illegally yes most illegal immigration is someone overstaying a tourist visa simply trying to disappear from any immigration authority rather stressful though without a support infrastructure in your chosen place to assist with housing and work and still stressful even then in the us alone there are estimated 50000 irish citizens living and working illegally but there are multigenerational irish communities within several cities here ive never heard anything bad about ikea meatballs a few years ago they were recalled because of containing horse meat give it 35 days when the ingrown hairs start forming a nice smattering of cysts you need to ask your wife to pop them so you can sit down he answered hed try to understand why im angry i call bullshit on this and the apology if it were a sincere apology hed simply agree he fucked up and if you had done the same to him it would make him upset because it would upset any normal person to be shoved pushed or elbowed by a partner regardless of whether that person was in a foul mood you say i have a cat do you share the cat or is it solely yours solely yours then i suppose you may go ahead and exploit for the likes any way you please shared ownership then i think you both should have discussed things like dressing up pet for likes prior and had an understanding do i think it is animal cruelty no not really i do think most dogs love the attention and cats are really something like 3070 on being okay being dressed up or putting things on them if it was acting stressed during or ran and hid after then you are an arse but for your behavior towards the cat not the fight with the gf put the issue with your girlfriend in a little box for right now put the lid on it and keep it closed focus on your mom and your grief and saying a proper goodbye to her you will regret it if you let the gfs bomb dropping take from these last moments with your mom you can deal with the reality of the end of the relationship down the road when you are ready sorry for all you are going through hello given we are coworkers i hope i can expect a given level of professionalism in your correspondence in the future so that i do not need to contact hr or just go straight to hr report it dont brush it away because the pos will think it is acceptable to bully coworkers and he deserves to know hes crap fyi this is all personal opinion but when i think of masculine looking women or handsome women i think of mariska hagarity and connie britton who have larger features than conventional pretty standards and they are both stunners imo dont let these fools tear down your selfesteem i got headhunted for an academic teaching position in qatar several years ago that also looked financially quite good on paper i think they look for people on linked in who graduated from certain respected us universities job backgrounds as a woman i did not pursue it even the pictures online of the university that was reaching out to me showed only men as students in the photos i am also jewish though not apparent by my name so that felt like a double mark against me politically i believe the us is moving towards a bifurcated two different realities and very contentious place that it wont be coming back from in the next decade gun violence will also not be resolved in any collective way as with everything problems living in the us are locationspecific qatar may be more
