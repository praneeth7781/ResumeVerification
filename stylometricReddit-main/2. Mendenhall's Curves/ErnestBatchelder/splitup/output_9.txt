have a safe person to speak with bigger picture youve been through abuse for a long period of time and it takes time to undo that i hope you can or have had access to therapy and support i am definitely going to hurt her feelings and it might have a long term effect her feelings are not your responsibility and if a reasonable boundary and request from you causes her to remain resentful for years thats on her she might spend a long time questioning me and bringing up things to make me feel guilty for making this choice you and your husband come up with one or two sentences 3 max that describe your boundary and decision succinctly kindly and firmly begin it with a positive 1 we love that you are excited about our child 2 then the reason they cant come keep it short advised by a medical professional it will be too much stress 3 the offer youre making instead she throws stuff at you repeat the statement drags out to long you get off the phone by saying this i hear that you sound frustrated i am going to get off the phone to let you process i hope you consider our offer stop fearing your mom will dump you or she controls this situation she wants to be in her grandchilds life she will need to learn how to respect your boundaries as a parent the moment she sends shitty youtube videos state these are not helpful i will be deleting them she gives bad advice say i use my doctor for advice on vaccines one sentence answers then stop engaging on the topic she goes off longer get off the phone you need to learn how to give them clearly and politely and hold onto boundaries without fearing her reactions but you actually have the power in this situation good luck so no dont contact him congratulations on learning a painful life lesson at an ageappropriate moment in life sometimes people say a bunch of crap they dont really mean planning a year head to your anniversary after only dating 4 months bringing up living together dropping hints about wanting you to get along with his parents all fantasy horseshit he was making future plans as a way to play games not because the intention was to follow through you were in the early stages of getting to know each other my personal theory is it is usually around the 3 or 4 month part when someone starts to reveal who they are without trying to be on their bestest behavior all the time now you know who he is mourn for a bit feel shitty then take the lesson and apply it to the next guy oh i discovered geoguesser one weekend played compulsively and was pretty decent at it but then never played again it was fun to zoom around different cities though he gave you 33 days notice what he did was legal what you are trying to do isnt 30 days notice to quit means just that they are quitting after the 30 days is up edit correction 34 days given may has 31 days in it i had a former annoying neighbor that was both invasive everything was his business and a bit of a hoarder and crazy one day i smelled a seriously high kerosene fuel burning for about 3 hours smoke everywhere i figured the nutjob wanted to grill some steak and didnt know not to use a bottle of lighter fluid nope that asshole was smoking out a beehive on his property so all these poor colony collapse bees came into my yard to die 1000s of bees flopped on my lawn sadly buzzing and moving in confused circles for several days before they shriveled up i got to go outside and look helplessly at the slowmoving bee massacre that was my yard i had a neighbor reroof his house himself during the pandemic instead of 35 days of a crew getting in getting out it was about 3 months of that dude and his nail gun slooooowly placing every goddamn roof shingle and poppoppopping it down for about 3 or 4 hours a day like a form of goddamn torture it was i looked online and he hadnt gotten it permitted and i felt so petty and going crazy at month 2 that i called the county then it stopped for a month victory only to start back up for another month crushing sadness at first i was thinking maybe your father abused your mom or there are details you are missing doesnt matter a parent should never put your brother in the position your mom has chosen she has no right to manipulate him into cutting you out and it makes me assume there are other things shes manipulated him on over the years even his girlfriend is spinning out over these demands your mom has a whole host of people shes managing to keep in her orbit and try to control reach out and tell him you love him and you will always be available to him but that you are not following a request to control who or who isnt in your life from a parent you have no connection to id add if his mom loved him she would not be placing the burden of her resentments onto him suggest he look into therapy because he should not have to take on this much of your mothers resentments and be so controlled by her true it doesnt work in all areas though you can get a gist of things pretty much all of new orleans can get noisy if theres any festival in town but the french quarter is especially bad if you like to sleep and not listen to revelers street vomiting under your charming balcony ah the collective you not the individual you i lived in a liberalleaning part of la for years that bordered on a very red county we had are trump voters trump flag people so very familiar with the incorrect perception that la is solely some liberal paradise i think the misperception is true of california in general anyhoo i have edited it to remove my snark and apologize for misreading tone im so neurotic that prior to booking i open up google maps and hone in on the small area air bnb shows without exact address before booking and you can google street maps view to see if it is a meh part of town same goes for real estate postings that do this i now have a biased assumption all the brightened and whitened closeups of a bowl of lemons on the kitchen counter with a soft focus background are just an attempt to hide some moldy neglected grout my husband announced to me yesterday that he wants to renounce his us citizenship hes had since birth and claim danish citizenship wait does it even work that way or was he already a dual citizen and feels he needs to make a political statement to unamerican himself anyway i am not sure how much this sub can help because this sounds more like a marriage issue than an emigration one like a partner stating they want to make a unilateral decision that impacts the entire family rather than open up a discussion is never a healthy thing are there no hotels around you for 200 per night so he can have a hotel room i will get downvoted into oblivion because this sub is mostly people who run airbnbs but airbnb has changed over the years and it really lost its charm with me as a traveler 12 years ago i used it to travel around the world and had great experiences i would now either look to hotels with small kitchenettes a real b b or if i want to pay airbnb prices go straight to a corporaterun vacation rental company in my chosen destination many of the airbnbs posted now are run by a corporate property management company anyway the listings can make it difficult to tell id rather use a company that has its own website and contact numbers than try to resolve issues through airbnbs platform it sucks because i am sure there are still some great ones but with even critical reviews being removed a huge oversaturation of people doing it too many wild cards you kind of have to brace yourself now and think this may be great or it may be terrible buy a trash house and get a new hobby house repairs buy something with good plumbing electrical and roof learn how to fix interior bleh this may be contrarian advice on this sub but if you can find a home that means your mortgage property taxes will be the equivalent of your rent you plan to stay in the home for 57 years and you can learn to be handy and sink a lot of free time plus money into repairs you would be better off with a shitty starter home in a good area now than trying to get in in 5 years i italicized in a good area because for the intent of one day selling and moving up a shitty house in a shitty area may very well drop in value over time markets are unknown edit i see others addressing this but my advice here is skewed because you live in st louis and it really is one of the cheapest cities in the us your incomes deposit amount more than cover you for a 250k house i last lived here la is still a huge area of about 10 million people county at least i think that reflects a wider spectrum of viewpoints represented on the sub dear friend i addressed your concerns thus my point the la sub is more split this is what we call reading comprehension in true blood hes at least a loveable asshole green tea gen mai matcha and a turkey sandwich is my go to ltryptophan in turkey ltheanine in the green tea is a perfect combo for calm but active and focused brain most of the time that grass thats where a sidewalk should be is owned by the county and is for public access even without a paved sidewalk on it he likely doesnt own it but its his responsibility to maintain it next time you can tell him to call the cops and youll wait while they explain to him not to make dumb calls to the police or just cross the road to avoid him old people get weird as a former angelino who is now in the bay area and on both subs bay area subs in general suck its very complainy las sub is partly bad news crime jokes about meth on the subway but also nice things about the city and lostfound pets i wouldnt say its all astroturfed its also a subset of residents in the bay area definitely a more conservativelibertarian bubble now than when i last lived here la is still a huge area of about 10 million people county at least i think that reflects a wider spectrum of viewpoints represented on the sub people are going on about your bf being a git for wanting bigger boobs but what gets me is his friend disrespected sexualized you and from his reaction trying to hide it this was an ongoing discussion or joke between them who cares about him finding you sexually attractive at this point hes a disrespectful twat i swear i learned so much when i went into nordstroms and had the ladies in the lingerie department actually do a proper fitting on me they make you try on a bunch of bras in a certain range then look at how they fit and actually teach you your
