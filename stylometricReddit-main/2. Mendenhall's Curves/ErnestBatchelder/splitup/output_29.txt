may get farther if you ask for a reduced fee and cite that no furniture will be moved in if that is truly the case its a condo board however and they like their fees if it is in the ccr rules regulations and covenants then you dont have any right to a discount but it cant hurt to try now theyre asking for another year problem is you are dealing with thin edge of the wedge types who keep pushing the goalposts normally id suggest having tenants pay a percentage of back rent owed with each rent payment once they are back on their feet to prevent later problems but for now just move forward with your goal talk to a re lawyer in your area and find out what the absolute proper steps are for evictions are and proceed from there you gave them a year youve been more than flexible and you dont want to be doing this so youve acted above and beyond as far as recouping losses down the road sure small claims court but if people have no money its a lot of work for unlikely pay sometimes you just take a financial loss to learn a lesson i wouldnt worry about that until the situation arises i probably shouldnt have brought it up as well as selling plasma not a solid longterm plan you can only safely do that about once a month and getting sick at any point in the year would make it more difficult unasked for financial advice fafsa to cover cost of school or textbooks okay but dont take out student loans to live beyond your means you decide you dont like the program or drop out you are on the line for those loans always try for the least amount of student loans possible look for a roomtorent or small inlaw situation based on your gi monthly housing allowance you will have it a lot easier as a tenant in a private home than getting an apartment depending on cost of living in the area thats already been reduced by a forfeit of the security deposit just to prepare you this is moving into eviction territory and you need to prepare yourself that the place will be trashed since they no longer have a security deposit on the line you are in your 30s time to start wanting better for yourself i see all your excuses in the comments dude has a platonic love affair with another woman he shows her more respect than he shows you he shows his friends more respect than he shows you hell never date her because hes a friends ex keeps convincing you are the one who is out of line the thing is we get to have boundaries but if someone doesnt like our boundaries we get to see they arent right for us you have given him several chances to institute less intimacy with her and each time he gets mad at you andor calls you crazy you sound so insecure in this post you arent sure if you are wrong for feeling this way etc etc you are allowing someone to shout at you in public yelling and calling you crazy is an unacceptable response berating someone in private or public is unacceptable behavior your feelings are valid how you and your partner handle them is what matters youve gotten so brow beaten by this dynamic you are internalizing that wanting respect you are in the wrong okay so what qualifies as lowincome renter in the bill because if this is for people who qualify for section 8 i can just see the unintended consequences of less section 8 housing being offered if this is about income qualifications then the same but it would be less clear cut ie tenant moves in with a certain income then faces unemployment im in the south bay and dealing with a neglected rental property trying to fix it up to better standards for an elderly family member id love some good resources for making sure everything is on the up and up before i put it back up for rent please also was just thinking that we tend to be on semihigher alert when out in public especially when you are a woman but you want to be able to just relax by the time you make it into your apartment shut the door and lock it also no one wants to be looking at their neighbors in their building and thinking is this one going to go full shooter on us i suppose more will come out later but i really hope it wasnt a neighbor feud that went south several bullet holes were in the victims front door the rounds appeared to have been fired from the apartment located across the hall from the victims yee gods if it was a neighbor going postal somehow thats so much worse than your usual mugging or home invasion for a builtin bidet make sure you have a seal on the back of the seat using your arse and your knees clenched creating a total wall to block any spray the secret is to try and use as low of pressure as you can at first make sure youre aiming at the correct parts never go full force out the gate legally i have no idea what your recourse is but id be looking at tenant rights groups in the area they often have a lawyer you can at least consult with for no fees or email if you are paying full rent they should be providing you with comparable housing ie another unit thats similar not a hotel asbestos mitigation can be anything from containment of a few air ducts to a full hazmat suit type jobby and it takes time i looked up your address and unfortunately your building was built during the heyday of asbestos in everything from ceilings to floors id be asking questions to find out if there even is a reasonable timeline for a fix if they were waiting on the citycounty to do a check that makes sense that it took two weeks because the county moves slow but its kind of weird most of the asbestos from that period is in linoleum flooring or ceiling popcorn its technically not a hazard unless disturbed so unless a bunch of major leaks popped up in units and the ceilings are falling apart i would be wondering if they are kicking tenants out to do a major remodel and up rents that seems like a lot of mishagas to go through friend you need therapy if those two raised you bullying harassing your grown child into dating someone is not normal also you are so beat down from their controlling nature that you question your own gut instincts your gut instincts tell you the guy they want you to date has some core ideologies you disagree with homophobic thinks misogynists have some good points critical of your work in a way that is unnecessary parents start berating you you learn to stand up to them that doesnt work then you put them on information diets give nonanswers etc until you can leave guys can be nice enough and also not the right romantic partner no one manipulates or pushes you into dating someone if you are questioning how you feel then you have every right to say no if you are emotionally numb its not just your past romantic experiences its also the family home you are in oh he totally married his mother thats why they hate each other but she doesnt want me seeing my family even my siblings which havent done anything are lumped into the same pot the other day she told my daughter that my mother is not nice and later that same day called her a fing bh in front of the kids honestly thats not your wifes call to make and the way shes bringing the kids onto her side is gross on multiple levels i dont know what your mom did you dont really say so she may be a real piece of work but between how your wife is handling it and the vague cheating you bring in at the end id say right now you have more of a wife problem than a parent problem how you move past it is some serious counseling with your wife about boundaries and supporting each other that goes for her to support you as well also you may have just married your mother which would explain a lot this is how adults argue oh look the 36 year old man is telling the woman 10 years younger than him how adult he is except adults and emotionally mature people actually regulate their emotions so that they can express frustration or even anger without yelling or being abusive hes taking his bullshit out on you and its damaging to you its damaging to your central nervous system physical and psychological wellbeing develop a zero tolerance for tantrumthrowing adults its the best policy i would have left the drip system on a timer and then put in the lease that it is the tenants responsibility to maintain the yard in good alive condition however the landlord will be by twice quarterly or bimonthly to do any larger maintenance projects ya never know what someone else is going through she may have deleted her entire account she may be in her own downward shame spiral and unable to socialize but feels like she has to keep trying or she may secretly have hated you for years unlikely you seriously cant know anything other than this person dropped the ball on you you made a goodfaith effort to be in touch and whatever is going on the most likely scenario is it has nothing to do with you best path forward wish her well in your heart and if she does touch base be open to it im sick of walking on eggshells if you are an adult and you feel you are walking on eggshells with your mom you have problems in the relationship therapy could really help you basically need to get your own phone line the insane deal is bullshit and you instead are asking her permission what you mom is doing is very controlling youve been conditioned to just accept this quirk and call it overprotective but it is detrimental to your own sense of individualism and independence setting boundaries with a controlling person even someone who does love you takes a lot of growth again either put your foot down and get your own phone line now or go to therapy until you have the skill set to do so once my business closes there will be no landing place for me here in this city again honestly you can never say never you are only 27 young and will have an acupuncture license when the next phase is through i think you are convincing yourself it is over in order to close the door on this period albeit cost of living and other things you are likely correct but you still never know 100 you are making a really smart choice in terms of paying for school so keep that the focus you are also choosing a path that will be less hard on your body so those two points alone make it a smart move it will make the current moment less stressful if you convince yourself of something different maybe ill be back here someday with a different career maybe i wont meanwhile spend a little time going around to your favorite parts of the city you are in and have a little goodbye ceremony time honestly looking at your comments there is nothing a new different house is going to fix in this relationship that couldnt
