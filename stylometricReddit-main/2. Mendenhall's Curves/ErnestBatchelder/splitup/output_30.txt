be fixed in your current situation if he wanted to make it work you keep saying you are thwarted in the home because its his house so theres this feeling like a new different home in both your names would give you equal say if the relationship was working it would work now through reasonable compromises where you are he has a home hes not invested in buying a new home with you hes making that clear i suggest you start looking based on your own income at townhouses condos and smaller places if you dont want your life on hold then move it ahead if you do buy together talk to a lawyer because you are setting yourself up without some sort of agreement in place if the relationship doesnt work out long term and you arent married i have gotten hints that she might not attend and honestly that would be a breaking point in our relationship for me i hate to say it but shes not coming to your wedding no one goes through 3 years of being a shutin to decide their first foray into the world will be airplane travel and attending a large party sorry while it sounds like a combo of agoraphobia mixing with realworld events i dont think this is your problem to fix you have to move into acceptance while hoping she decides this is something she herself wants to fix i think a lot of people discovered that they preferred the quiet and the lack of social pressures during lockdown some of it can be mental health but some of it can be that this is actually a preferred lifestyle for her covid is the excuse to keep it going but thats for her to fix in therapy and first she has to want to fix it its always going to be a slight game of russian roulette most people will be fine miserably sick for a few weeks to a month but otherwise fine her friends fear of long covid is a valid enough concern in that she isnt wrong that it is a possibility we dont have enough data to know why some people get it and some dont though the two people i know with long term symptoms got it back before vaccines so i wish there was more information made public on how well vaccines prevent it beautiful did you use a stencil or freehand he uses it and then 3 minutes later he uses it again thats absolutely not normal and indicates a urinary track issue he needs to be checked by a vet like im some culinary assassin uh you are not the assassin here hes the one who may have killed you the best times to negotiate on rents are situations like early days of the pandemic or during a bad economic downturn like 2008 if the landlord can easily get what he or she wants to raise the rent to from a new tenant you do not have a ton of power unless you are a good longterm tenant with a known track record with them read up on what is and isnt covered under rent control in california edit oh i see it is a house i would not try to negotiate rent increase on a freestanding home in ca unfortunately for you free standing homes are not under rent control which means the owner can actually yonk your rent up to whatever amount they want with no caps 8 is common amount for a rent control unit during high inflation so theyd stayed within the realm of decent a visa gift card can be used anywhere so that makes the most sense to me i work from home and enjoy an empty house then you really shouldnt really be subleasing to a roommate if you want to control the times of day they are in the home i dont know why any of that sounds not on the up and up so unless mysterious russian men are dropping off large packages at weird hours or a parole officer is making unannounced visits you have a clean courteous tenant who pays rent on time not to victim blame that counter but a wood countertop in a rental is kinda asking for it look when i clear a level in 2 dots and it responds with brilliant or genius i say thank you out loud i currently have positive accountability with someone texting on a daily goal and receiving positive short replies but i like this almost better ill see if it keeps working nicely done i am of the school of thought that no one should ever presume common sense sorry op and that one of the issues with running a shortterm rental is you will get a high number of people coming through therefore you need to clearly and concisely reiterate any caretaking you want them to do while they stay this includes how to operate any large appliances that arent common there should have been either a sign by the tub or instructions in the place for use and care every public hot tub or sauna ive gone to has some sort of instruction and disclaimers posted personally that much damage from a storm i think they are yanking your chain most of that sounds like yearly maintenance they should be on the hook for unless a gaint hairball the size of a small baby flew into a tub during the storm id push back and escalate it through airbnb you could always offer to pay half but i dont think you should i will only accept the advert that defines adhd types incorrectly by animals even then my type is a monkey who plays a constant tambourine but will stop suddenly to pet a dog can hyperorganize a friends spice rack by usage and country while stopstarting a new craft and that one is sadly missing you can still reach out to them via email that you will be using them as a reference and put their info plus dates of when you lived there down for any application and it is up to the new landlord to contact them any schoolwork employment or mentors you can use as a character reference even a babysitting job the reason i say start by looking for shared housing or someone renting out a room is they are more likely to run on meeting you and liking you than a paper trail of references id look for facebook or reddit groups for the town you are moving to and post a few questions how people find shared housing there also worth asking the company where you are starting what they recommend perfectly fair inquiry as a new employee who is relocating edit and be very wary of scammers or people wanting to secure housing via facetime in person only finally realises all he wants is me took him 14 years to get there x200b he did resent me but no longer does amazing no therapy no reflection on his behavior all it took was you really taking measures to separate and now his resentments aka excuses for being abusive all went poof so if you choose to go back in and stay trust that all those resentments will be coming back they only disappear if he thinks hes losing you x200b unfortunately we have to live in the same house and he has been smothering me with apology texts and looking for cheat hugs if this were me id use this short vacation away to put some effort into having breathing room and a lot of effort into figuring how to get out of the home the next few months will be him on best behavior with reoccurring lapses like the air tag he wants you to stay you will either be tempted to because you will get worn down or you will continue to try and separate being in a home with an abusive partner who you are trying to leave is an unsafe place to be first off you had a traumatic incident that has shifted how safe you feel in the world therapy can really help process that and i highly recommend looking into it i dont think you ever have to go back to trusting total strangers with open doors but it may help skew the negativity around people you now feel more focused on secondly for all his talk about values your boyfriend lacks empathy where it matters to you theres something off about seeing himself as this generous welcoming person to strangers when he cant be bothered to give that same empathy to his own significant other hes putting his personal ideology over your physical sense of safety so yeah you maybe dont have values that align but his are in no way superior despite how it sounds like hes viewing himself its disrespectful to you and disrespectful to her he sees the value in women as objects also the fact that his friend group accepts thats a cool way to speak about another woman and to treat you is pretty gross too as a curly hair the daily brushing oooof way to create a nonstop cycle of frizzzzzy if she voices she doesnt like it and his response is to ignore her own input into her own appearance and act put out hes acting rather manipulatively you can suggest things you personally like to a so but you dont get to make it about your feelings when it is their appearance just an fyi curly or wavey hair hates daily brushing hates it you are really causing more frizz brushing it out especially dry every day wide tooth comb while damp is the way to go but consult with a hair stylist who specializes in curly hair and youll get proper advice for your hair type otherwise i think the issue you are having is that you feel fetishized or it certainly sounds like hes fetishizing your hair you do need to work on your own insecurities and are likely seeing your own face through a slightly warped lens based on how you talk about yourself however i have never heard of someone building more confidence because their so calls them stupid i dont care how sweetly hes saying it or takes over control of how they look for me personally someone invested in my grooming as a romantic gesture occasionally could be a nice experience but id get completely overwhelmed irritated by someone controlling how i looked daily or assigning themselves that responsibility tldr there is dressing or grooming a way that a so likes versus a so taking control over your appearance and refusing to listen to your valid concerns i get that hes your first proper love but look at this objectively as an outsider hes 7 years older than you now has two kids from two different mothers and he lied early on in the relationship to the point id be questioning everything the fact that he didnt want you traveling and hooking up with others while he himself did just that is another bad sign sometimes you have to take the loss at 23 you have plenty of options to take the good and bad lessons from this relationship and find yourself a partner without this much baggage and questionable maturity edit and your comment below he says he wants to prioritise his daughter he did raise from birth as well as our relationship yay hes also a deadbeat dad with no sense of responsibility for life you are not bagging a winner here you are talking about two different things the homes value versus rental income value not every homebuyer wants to be a landlord so an adu may not add to the homes value if you intend to rent out the house and keep it for some
