go that far is also on you idk if that will look too aggressive or not thats not aggressive thats a polite update you need someone looking out for your interests and trying to reach out to show you homes not you chasing an agent around worrying you are being too aggressive they are set to make a commission off a large purchase youre about to make they should be holding your hand and walking you through this process fire them and find someone better interview a few no they can be set up to impact descendants its a way to ensure a parent wont do anything that would negatively affect their kids portion of the inheritance problem is it assumes the parent cares your boyfriend raped you and then denied it and tried to blame you contact rainn at 800656hope 4673 to be put in touch with a confidential trained sexual abuse counselor near you please make an appointment to have a checkup for the bleeding ask the doctor to document any bruising know that if you want to press charges that you have a medical record of the assault if that sounds too overwhelming right now at least get the checkup for your own medical health and so you have a track record of it is it valid for me to be hurt by his comment your feelings are always valid sometimes what we do with feelings or how we express them isnt okay but if you have a feeling thats your feeling in this case your bf attacked you for something he very well may be the issue with what an asshole does he have a point no while some ssris can make people take longer to orgasm that stops once you stop them and even if they do a loving partner would be happy their partner is doing well mentally and put in the effort to work with them where they are at also for many women in their 20s it can take some time to reach orgasms or learn what works for them and for a lot of guys in their 20s who grew up on porn they have no clue what they are doing kind of a combo thing maybe the ssri you are on maybe the natural path your body personal development is on maybe your boyfriend is a shitty lover so you are growing up in a dysfunctional household first off your moms trauma isnt yours to fix your parents marriage isnt something you can control not all men are your father and not all women are your mother secondly your only job right now is to finish school and pursue what makes you happy and what you want for yourself when your mom brings up what kind of marriage you should have dont engage with her further than okay mom not arguing about it or asking her questions will neutralize the discussion its a toxic belief she has you dont need to correct that in her or take it on yourself box it up and toss it on a garbage heap what you will want to put away for a rainy day is considering therapy at some point growing up with a parent with mental illness and two parents in a bad marriage is a lot to carry one of the best ways to not repeat mistakes you are fully aware of from growing up around them is to have some time to learn about yourself to learn some healthy coping skills therapy can help with that good luck have her read this its for all of ca not la county and it is for tenants but the more she understands tenants rights the more she can combat what a tenant requests that is unreasonable eviction if they are paying rent is tough the one thing is if one of your moms kids wanted to live in the house for a period of time might be two years she can move in a relative and that would evict them talking to a lawyer is your best bet but the more your mom is informed on the reasonable things expected of her the more she may be able to shrug off how unreasonable her current tenants are her tenant is a bully the best way to deal with bullies is to push back firmly and calmly the woman is carrying on like this because it is working for her for now i dont think of the bay area as northern california i think of it as located in northern california northern california is one of two things in my mind the top entire half of the state starting at the central coast but if you call it norcal then it is an area located at the very very top that covers everything above chico its a book based on a popular tv series could easily be an oversight or they left quickly and didnt care about it and even if it was intentional on the tenants part id let it go and not worry about it so if you are looking for a term for this behavior its called being an ungrateful twat you cant change peoples behavior but you can change your reactions which will sometimes impact them if you have already told her all this stuff and she claims it doesnt happen then the best way to help someone realize they are being an ungrateful twat is to tell them how their exact behavior makes you feel in the moment right when its happening doing it later wont work because theyve already changed what happened in their memory you have to point it out as they are doing it specific words and actions and how you feel around it you pull into the restaurant parking lot looking forward to a nice lunch with your sister at a place she claims to love and she starts sighing about how sick of it she is you say hey that makes me feel really bad i thought you loved this place based on all you ig stories about it and i wanted to show you a nice afternoon im not going to make you eat somewhere you are sick of so lets cancel next time when i initiate a plan to go somewhere you dont want to please suggest where youd prefer you get her a gift in a color she asks for and she opens it and complains hey that makes me feel really bad i was trying to do something to make you happy and asked you specifically what you wanted rejecting my gift feels shitty the good news is theres a receipt so you can return it as for you always paying dont make any plans without specifying you are going dutch once you get to the place ask the waitress if you can have separate bills is he worth this every discussion turning into an argument with someone who always needs to be right sounds exhausting to me yelling or shouting at someone is abuse imo i dont think raising your voice is to the point of yelling or shouting though whats really abusive is calling you stupid and also gaslighting you the denying he turned a light off when he did type stuff intentionally pushing someones buttons until they explode so he can call you out on exploding is highly manipulative life is too short to spend it with people who crap on your joy while i asked why he was so upset he couldnt give me an answer either he thinks it reflects back on him as not as goodlooking as he liked to consider himself worried that you arent as into his looks as hed like a significant other or he thinks it reflects badly back onto you and youre not as much of a prize as he wanted if youve settled in the past either way its vanity and superficial insecurity on his part tell him to think it over and get to a place where he can articulate the issue i think once he says it out loud if he is a semidecent guy hell realize how superficial hes being such as seperate sleeping arrangements with her getting the king double in the bedroom and me on the couch for 4 nights of the week she knows i hate this but sacrifices we have to make day to day i guess anyone else relate to this no this is not a good relationship really reconsider all the times youve sacrificed your own comfort or decisions you wanted then think about the number of times shes compromised im guessing its about zero good luck with that in life friend four years you got a lemon there there was really just under a decade of la being a functional place and kinda getting its shit together in a lot of areas before backsliding the early aughts to about 2010 fewer gang wars homeless population bad but not bad like it is now lapd relatively not corruptly run postrampart scandal firings housing still affordable in areas it was a nice run i read the title since it was posted 4 hours ago right after the incident happened according to op am makes more sense shrugs 1140 am as in the late morning we do need to be able to go into public on occasion you know whoever lashed out online at a dying man seeking advice phew check your humanity his final update got me in the feels sounds like he actually had a pretty decent head on his shoulders when he was alive and i hope he had good people around him when he passed i get that writing this book is part of his own healing journey and i respect that you actually dont owe him any respect he hasnt shown you any as his kids you had a right to be informed give permission before he started this project that he would be sharing your personal mental health information with the world its pretty funny hes framing it as his healing journey because its really a big admission of his own fuck ups as a father anyone can write a memoir but they arent allowed a free pass at what that ultimately does to their personal relationships i tend to be more forgiving of people exposing the ugly side of abuse theyve endured but putting your own kids privacy on blast is just punching down while looking for accolades look how great i am at overcoming my childrens struggles gross you have every right to tell him hes violated your trust and you are not sure he deserves it your father is selfcentered edit this actually made me angry for you hes potentially screwing you over if hes well known enough that this info about your family impacts your future negatively if hes shared actual private medical diagnosis you have legal the right to get him to take those parts out dont fear or think in terms of what he wants be clear about what you want 1 be a little wary of all men 12 years older than you when you are under 25 same goes for guys under 25 with women 12 years older than them are all age gaps bad no but when something is wrong age gap its just so much worse 2 you did nothing wrong and his behavior has zero to do with you you are both strangers to each other anyone who wants to hook up then suddenly tells you that you make them feel icky is an asshole there are a 1000 things you can tell a person i am tired lets call it a night etc that arent intentionally hurtful rude ways to reject them 3 start listening to your earlier instincts a bit more you felt something off because he wanted to meet at
