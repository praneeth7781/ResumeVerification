that you arent performing socially well s take it up with your therapist what do you want your social interactions to look like break down into small steps things you can do to speak up for yourself join in a convo or bring a little of your athome self into the public sphere but do it safely and on your own terms honestly as your work in therapy progresses and you learn more about your own personal emotional reality standing up for yourself or being more true happens organically you may always have a bit of an indooroutdoor split too and thats okay im pretty sure it is not uncommon to think in moments excitedly that youve found your answers therefore everyones answers then have to eventually roll that back the worst is realizing like grief its a fluid process with a thousand different offramps onramps along the way recognizing being wrong or coming to terms that absolutes never help is one of the best onramps back in i have adhd too in my late 20s i got into exercise clean diet amino acids all lifelong problems solved poof thank god there wasnt a ton of social media yet because i would have been insufferable i actually wanted to write a book hahaha little did i know i would not be able to maintain that lifestyle and chronic illness can really set a person back i dont do well with adhd meds but i will support anyone who benefits on our second date i made it clear that i was looking for something more serious making it clear you were in general looking for something more serious or did you state i really like you and id like us to be exclusive while we are dating then she agrees to exclusivity because if it was the former and it sounds like it was she did absolutely nothing wrong you seem to grasp that but cant get over the emotional sense of being cheated on even if it wasnt a technical cheating you have a right to your feelings but what you do with them matters if it is something you cant get over then you owe it to you and her to break up plenty of people date the way she was trying not to get attached or overly focus on one person until they know that person is really in it if you cant get over it but want to try start focussing more on the present like literally take note when you are with her why shes a good partner and why you enjoy each others company make an effort you are basically trying to get your brain to stop dwelling and to refocus my family would also happily accept me back home but it would be so humiliating to tell them it didnt work after i did all this if you have a loving supportive family get over your embarrassment get the cat and go one thing controlling people do is isolate the person they want to control dont help him by further dumping on yourself that those that love you will judge you you are really young a few years of being ground down has already made you doubt yourself and start drinking you can get out now and have all the time to start again not to be harsh but you were his sugar momma not his gf you fixed his problems and gave him a soft place to land and in any codependent relationship you had to be getting something from that its not surprising he turned on you when you were sick someone who sees an older person as their caretaker doesnt want to stick around to caretake someone who viewed you as a soft landing doesnt want to financially contribute take care of your physical health right now its your number one priority when you are ready reflect on the glaring issues that were likely there from the start so you can see the whole thing in its entirety clearly be grateful that its over i have no idea what cocaine in the uk costs but once high he could be spending on drinks gambling any number of things all with the coke he may be addicted to debt and spending as much as the coke right now he will make a grand gesture tell you he will quit then unless real steps are taken on his part not yours has to come from him he will do the exact same thing over and over if big if he was willing to go to a treatment center for a month get 30 days sober and some actual tools for quitting there may be a path out of it or attend meetings or find counseling to help otherwise you are now in a cycle with someone and its one that can get really bad including losing everything you own i suggest you look at al anon uk its got issues like all 12 step programs but if you replace alcohol with coke and at least listen to a few meetings you will get a lot more insight into the lengths addicts go to lie and hide their disease when he is in the grips of addiction he is counting somewhat on your naivete to hide so you really need to educate yourself now the worse thing you can do is become his enabler and at least al anon will give you some tools to see those pitfalls good luck google codependency you like being needed as much as she needs someone to dump one you both are in a toxic dynamic and you are way too invested in her life and life choices your friendship with her will never have some magical healing power for her it wont ever not a thing you can do or say for someone who likes blowing their own life up you are primarily just an audience to her for her dysfunction most important thing is for you to learn what is being a good friend versus codependent relationships so you dont have this dynamic again as for the rest of it start being honest i am not a trained therapist and this is taking a toll on my mental health i highly suggest you look into talking with a professional repeat until it gets across or move out please go to therapy with someone who specializes in trauma recovery i realize in your first post you probably have remaining trauma from previous institutionalizations as a teen and medical trauma from psychiatry is real but no matter how much positivity you have or feel healed there are a lot of really tough things in your past and your recent relationship that create unresolved trauma cycles the good news is you are an adult now with your own agency you can interview therapists and you get to choose someone who you feel good about my friend what you are looking for is courier services there are professional companies that will do this for likely less than 500 and it doesnt have to feel like a shady drug delivery deal posted on craiglist google courier services i mean if the shop will toss that item in a box for you you can just call fedex or dhl to do a pickup you even may be able to get them to pack it moving around a lot career and job change is an adhd thing i think i know thats been my life but it was also compounded by a certain amount of ptsd so i dont know which is what getting paralysis and being too overwhelmed to take first steps staying too long at a miserable party is also an adhd thing and can be ptsd instead of looking at the statement essay or even job postings give yourself a tiny doable task that you can try to make fun do some journaling or freewriting nonjudgemental writing about what your ideal day at a job would look like or just make bullet lists of things you would want to do make it fantasy dont get caught up in the this isnt possible part trying to refind joy after being ground down is so hard but its the small space that if you can grow it change can get some momentum to get you unstuck i actually think connor is the best off of all the siblings say what you will about his relationship with willa they are both honest with each other that she is marrying for money but they also both support each other and their individual delusions in a sweet way he paid for her play even though it was a total mess and she doesnt have a problem with his ridiculous run for president except for maybe they have the most honest relationship in the show ask your wife pointed questions about what tools she was recommended for this situation encourage her to ask her therapist for tactics or techniques i honestly dont think op should involve himself at all the tool the wife is likely getting right now is a safe space to talk in and a better recognition of how she feels in her day to day life the therapist likely gave her assignments early on to get her through the initial process she has those tools and is now applying them to life but still needs an outlet for support ie talk therapy its not on op to interfere if the wifes mental health issues seem to worsen then he can bring up adjunct therapies meditation or medication or whatever but a spouse shouldnt be standing outside a door and then later being like what have you learned can you ask to learn more tools in therapy please yes your expectations are way off one a therapist shouldnt be offering insights all the time they arent a partner or a parent who is there to guide and tell the patient what to do the goal is for the therapist to gently lead the patient to their own insights and for the patient to better learn to understand their emotions some therapies like cognitive behavioral or mindfulness may have assignments emdr may have trauma processing but talk therapy is really about having one safe space in your life to talk to feel safe with one person who wont judge or direct you in how to behave and through that process of support get a better understanding of how you are interacting with the world what you probably arent hearing is when the therapist is occasionally redirecting her to ask how those peopleevents are making her feel heres why talking to you isnt the same you are her husband you are always going to have needs and opinions the therapist is one person whose needs and feelings she doesnt have to take into consideration or worry what their opinions are and again if they are doing even an okay job they are helping her understand how all the aspects so and so did this i said this are causing an emotional reaction in her this helps someone learn how to regulate their emotional responses maybe its not the greatest therapist maybe she needs further interventions if her anxiety is still high but honestly thats none of your business if your wife is getting something out of this process and wants to continue thats for her to do sort of the premise of justified which came before ozarks and was a much better show imo even if it was kind of a crime procedural put security cameras in the hallways and public spaces hey you know i enjoy our friendship so much but could you cut out the love stuff please even with the platonic declarations im married and it makes me uncomfortable now lets discuss insert artsy topic here if he doesnt respect that blunt but
