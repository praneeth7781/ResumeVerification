background while this sounds delightful to me and like a dream thing to do it is in no way going to secure you better work opportunities that graphic design isnt currently university positions are hard to come by in any country and only a foreigner who was top of their field and wrote an award winning book would likely get a visiting scholar visa it would get you a student visa for a few years though youd have better luck getting certified to teach english as a second language your best bet is to look at the countries you are thinking of emigrating to and what skilled labor they give work visas for or look at us companies that have an overseas division and apply to them for jobs i cant move out for a long time why not you are 23 not 16 you know how to travel and stay in hostels then you can find a room share somewhere start saving money now your mother has no intention of giving up control over you and no intention of respecting your boundaries i know this may be some cultural stuff but it is also the behavior of a mentally unwell person who doesnt intend to get help write in a diary online and learn how to use twofactor authentication on everything stop sharing anything with her become boring get rid of as much stuff as you can so your room is bland go find friends to play music with outside of the house dont share anything you are doing be vague and make a plan get therapy currently they are much better i should have included the word historically i am talking about under castro when gay men or any men who even looked suspiciously effeminate were routinely rounded up in the streets and placed in concentration camps because he believed any sexual deviation incompatible with the revolution during that period gay men did flee cuba seeking asylum op is hinting on that kind of government taking over in the us while i think us laws can target certain groups extremely unfairly i dont think we are on the brink of creating federally run concentration camps for sexuality the worst thing we have are private christian conversion camps which are psychologically extremely damaging but as far as i know the government and laws are not involved with them its still not castro having police rounding up people in the streets level of persecution to require asylum based on his reaction to you getting cold feet if you hadnt agreed to it in the first place he was still going to go look for other people to sleep with he was just hoping he could get you to sign off on it first people are making fun of you in this thread but being gay or queer certainly can get you beat up attacked or harassed in plenty of parts of the us and it does suck to have a major political party make criminalizing forms of gender expression a big part of their current platform however i dont see any threat from the us government like what gay people in cuba or parts of africa and the mid east face parts of the world where yeah actual jail time or capital punishment doesnt mean you should live in an area where you feel fear what you will find is plenty of parts of the us where it is not only highly normalized to be queer but there are large communities of queer people the issue is you will find it in higher costofliving areas like most major us metros or more liberal states that are also higher cost of living you arent going to get asylum and by your own admission you arent a highly skilled worker there are syrian refugees who fled death living on islands in greece that will never get off of that island they are living in refugee camps on focus on acquiring skills working in a restaurant or hospitality industry carpentry doesnt matter go to a local community college and see what certifications they have something to save some money up and pick a larger city or liberal state to head towards with some job skills and make your exit from ohio you may feel a lot better just leaving your current area seeking out a bigger community if i were the exfriend and this ever got out to me i would definitely feel ick its not kind of sexualizing your ex it totally is one thing about roleplaying or fantasy is you can basically make up a scenario without having to involve someone in your mutual circle it would be one thing if the person wasnt part of any current social circle but this is someone in your daily life now id ask her during a nonsexy time where this is coming from and given it makes you uncomfortable share that email the department head for your program directly if the personal reason is really good enough ie medical but a semester is only about 3 and a half months long so you cant miss almost a third of that and have enough hours to qualify and you are welcome good luck if it is a monthtomonth lease then yes they can raise the rents twice a year some colleges start the fall semester in late august some midseptember you need to contact the university asap and find out what they recommend no way missing an entire month of a semester would be doable so you may want to delay enrollment until spring honestly if someone lost their crap over something so insignificant that they felt entitled to berate me my child i doubt id be able to move past it even a sincere thoughtful apology yelling during an ongoing fight or during a highstress situation still needs an apology but its at least an understandable human reaction yelling insulting people because you cant play your video game like a 12 year old brat no thank you the post is a troll but replacing the driveway would start at 10k in the bay area professional help therapy counseling whatever figure out why you think you deserve to be in an abusive dynamic and why even any part of you would bring a child into such an equation a realtor making a double commission benefits the seller but works out doubly badly for the buyer its in this realtors best interest for you to pay the maximum in this case normally with a buyer agent sure theyd make more if the sale is higher but in the bigger picture of referrals it works to their benefit to at least make their client feel like theyre getting a good deal this agent has zero incentive to help you in this sale and you are going to pay them for the pleasure of getting screwed edit if you had a buyers agent they should be present for the inspection noting what the inspector is saying and looking for ways to protect you in further negotiations if anything is discovered this one is on vacay if you eliminate the need to get something out of relationships and naturally overflow with joy you can have fabulous relationships with all sorts of people im sorry but this is why imo a ton of eastern philosophy and western new agey stuff doesnt actually translate to better mental health none of us naturally overflow with joy all day every day and we get to have reasonable expectations of others what is important is to realize when your expectations are reasonable versus you are overthinking things so and so doesnt text back instantly they hate me versus so and so has blown me off 3 times in a row maybe they have life events going on right now but also maybe they are a shitty friend long story short see how you feel around people relationships are gives and takes no one will make us feel happy and seen all the time but the goal is to surround yourself with people you are comfortable with and have a shared sense of interests and care for each other you arent going to make yourself some 247 spiritual robot who exudes joy all the time and never has any personal needs i dont care how many books you read or years of yoga meditation i assume a lot of these types of businesses are franchises my inclination with any work on the home is to get 3 bids i dont always go with the cheapest i go often with the person i have the best communication with and who explains the work theyll do really well to me if someone brought up the incans to explain a drainage system theyd be out solely because dude does not apply to the current situation yeah i think it has its roots as a post1950s us economic boom thing when we suddenly had a growing collegeeducated middle class for the first time people became class stratified by their careers and anyone could move up the chain more i dont know about south america or the middle east or other cultures but in europe the idea of class still feels like a thing people are born into at least it used to be declasse to talk about money or status although where you had your education is certainly something the british will discuss but you will know more about their class and upbringing based on accent than anything else california on the other hand has a lot of new money and people coming here seeking economic wealth networking and categorizing acquaintances by where they are in their careers makes social sense hi all how nice you are making a special plan to surprise brothers name and i am sure your efforts will delight him as you may know we are twins so your party date also falls on my birthday i have solo plans with girlfriends name this year and will be unable to attend my brothers party then leave the group chat and plan the best date you and your girlfriend could ever want book a reservation at a nice restaurant make a day trip whatever do not let them suddenly tag you into the event go make your own memories not your brothers fault but whoo boy cruddy oversight of that friend group it was a reasonable fee they were timely i would politely ask when i got locked out by the broken bottom lock i needed to let the dogs out of their crates asap so i went with a timely locksmith however i was able to locate one who did the job for a reasonable cost of 129 id like to submit the receipt to you for reimbursement please let me know where to send it also will the front door lock be fixed while i am staying here if so let me know when you schedule it and i will make sure to have the dogs crated when your locksmith arrives honestly for 3500 per month you should be able to lock and unlock a front door without the deadbolt its a reasonable expectation its not common in europe but ive found that conversation in almost any city in the us its certainly an la new york thing as well gah dementia is horrible this starts off sad then gets a secondary layer of sadtragic she needs therapy but honestly so do you youve enabled her to the point of isolating yourself what you are doing isnt helping her and it is hurting you tell her she needs therapy and possibly medication also go talk to a therapist different one yourself about codependency setting healthy boundaries and how to mend the divide with your other two kids letting one child alienate you from two other children is not okay and allowing it to
