if you google genetic testing for antidepressants you will get more info but you can also look up genetic testing for adhd meds but the basics is that it cant state what drugs will 100 work for you not a golden bullet but it gives a good insight based on your dna how you metabolize drugs to know which may be better for you in terms of side effects and effectiveness edit i dont know why i cant link to it but mayo clinic has a good breakdown of what it can and cant do and how can you make your monthly payments and do you really like your new townhome then dont worry about it arms arent as bad as everyone is making out it really depends on the terms many have limits on how high interest rates can go over the lifetime of the loan it is capped at how much it can increase every 6 months so depending on the initial rate they got there is some risk depending where we will be in 5 years but if the 1st 5 years are really low like 35 then it actually may all work out even in the wash lots of people are getting them right now esp if they plan to sell in 57 years and are gambling that they wont be underwater comps will hold in their area if you are fine with the mortgage you have then dont engage your cousin sometimes people are unsure of their choices so talking loudly about it makes them feel more sure just tell him thats great he got a good deal then change the topic stop engaging her on this topic no i wont discuss this with you is a complete statement no follow ups no arguing with her why this is a bad idea just she starts you get up and leave over until it is clear your mom neglected and abused you if you havent tried therapy finding counseling to learn how to set boundaries with her and take care of yourself would go a long way you dont have to cut her off if thats not what you want but you do need preserve your own sanity when you are around her are you in therapy because that sounds like a lot to deal with growing up and even though she lacks selfawareness for her special brand of crazy you can get help for yourself to learn how to set boundaries with her well he either 1 agrees with the racist sentiments youve experienced 2 doesnt fully agree the comment about certain food items means we know he agrees a little but also deeply lacks any capacity for empathy both options make for a lousy partner i love dates but they have more sugar in them than most cookies do they also have fiber and lovely nutritious value sure but they are sugar bombs freeze grapes they taste like little mini popsicles youre going to love your new home so much that youll find you have 20 good years left i think it is always worth trying different meds getting genetic testing done if you have access and i fully believe medication is transformative for many people they should have nonstigmatized access to it the flip side that people dont like to talk about medication doesnt work for everyone both antidepressants and adhd meds i am one of those people who has had to learn to cope without medication after decades of trying everything under the sun i also have nonadhd related medical issues that i am sure complicate the issue we are still in the stone ages in terms of understanding brain chemistry what a partner has to do bear minimum here is respect boundaries if the boundary is too difficult for them then you can agree to break up just because he respected one boundary giving up only fans does not mean he can disrespect consent and secretly film you without permission ever doing something against another persons consent like that ignoring a clear no during sex is sexual assault i feel like you are both being ridiculous you a tiny little bit and her a bunch shes taking something that isnt personal your taste in food and equating it with love and then reacting like you are personally rejecting her its over the top at the same time you really cant find any asian food you like i think your compromise would go a lot further to smooth things over if she could on occasion pick at least one or two places to go out to eat that were asian and youd join her in the us there are so many heavily americanized recipes ramen or a bento box at a japanese restaurant fried rice or noodles at a chinese place and plenty of thai dishes that arent spicy like spring rolls or chicken skewers with peanut sauce on the side pretty easy on any palate bigger picture if you want marriage and kids you all just might not be compatible cooking and eating can be separated in a relationship but for many people it is a big part of their life they dont want to live in a household where different meals have to be prepared kind of like a vegan and a meat eater trying to make it work not saying you cant but not everyone wants to try ill never join a cult because i cant commit to one way of thinking oh i read all the same articles selling was a calculated decision i dont regret but other peoples fomoattitudes and panic moving definitely made me triggershy to buy or relocate migration during a black swan event seemed like a recipe for disaster to me even if my caution made me mistime stuff in retrospect ive lived in other states while i dont think ca is paradise by any means and we have a myriad of problems growing up in a mild climate without humidity snow or long dark days has ruined me for other places in the us ha even someplace like spain looks better to me right now than trying to make a go of it elsewhere here anyway i know east coast prices have stayed really sticky but keep the faith your next better home is out there im in a similar boat sold in 21 in a hcol area to unload a starter house i kind of hated and i made good money off of it so i cant complain about that but unable or unwilling to jump back in considering moving to a mcol area but also worried somewhat about the transition for me a mcol area could get me a wonderful home with a small mortgage based on my equity from my starter home but i also know how this country reacts to my kind moving in californian need to really want to make the move currently dont anyway in ca no one older will ever want to sell given prop 13 made their tax evaluations stay forever low in an area without that kind of stupid move people would likely way the pros cons for some older people the only way to make a move on a paid off home worthwhile would be if downsizing was necessary otherwise its still likely more costeffective to age in place the only thing i can see impacting supply would be job loss during a recession which i dont actively wish for because it is hard on everyone or regulations on short term rentals where the landlords dont see the value in long term rental tenants untrue it very much depends on location but just as much on the era of construction century homes early 1900s1940s in the us often appreciate more in value during 2008 crash century homes did not depreciate as much as newer builds there are also midcentury homes that are wanted for the architectural style think frank llyod wright and go for millions even in the midwest then there are midcentury tract homes made out of cardboard and asbestos now if you are talking about newer builds compared to newer builds ie a new home development versus a development built in the 90s the newer ones are usually preferable in that they are less datedlooking but they will be dated in 30 years too some newer builds however are really well made better heat and cooling insulation better noise insulation etc there are better locations for mobile homes than others i know someone who is renting a mobile home and it is profitable for the owner to do so its an arid climate so no mold which is the enemy of mobile homes they arent worth the cost to remediate mold once it takes over a stunning natural location people want to live there to live in that area so it will be unlikely to go down in value otherwise mobile homes make sense if you are a retiree and you know you have a limited time left on earth because of the eventual decline of the building materials resale value isnt as important even then the risks are that you dont own the land so if a new company takes over the park your fees can increase dramatically think of them as condos built out of worse materials with less longterm value can you get therapy on your own without her knowing because you are going to need help learning how to navigate life after growing up with a really controlling mom it may be coming from a place of love and anxiety from her but it is damaging not to learn at appropriate developmental ages that you are capable of handling things on your own the good news is you can learn to handle things on your own and you can learn how to give your mom boundaries while you are under her roof i would not get hung up on the curfew right now so much as admit the bigger picture your mom created a dependent daughter so she could keep you under her control that is unhealthy your overall goal is to teach yourself independence it is to move out of your moms home and live a healthy life with good boundaries with her you can be the one to file for divorce you state in the comments you are at peace with it now and in the post that hes trying to make things right because of current guilt this is going to be like a storm system there will be calm and then a new storm system blows in prepare yourself for that eventuality that until you are through this and on the other side it there is no real trust between both of you there is a lot of money is at stake and things can get nasty from you or from him go to a fantastic lawyer asap and follow what they say including documentation of all major events make a promise to yourself now not to use your kids as pawns you both actually can get through this and eventually come to a place of agreement and resolve but if you try to damage each others relationship with your children it will be a wound that never heals good luck just wave next time if he waves back then you know he sees you if he doesnt that answers your question ugh actually i found school reports from teachers all saying there were probably learning disability issues my mom just ignored them i sold a starter house that i hated for 5 years at the peak and did very well but i refuse now to pay more for the same kind of starter house looks like it may be the cover for your cabin air filter he should be wrapped in bubble wrap until that day when it does come there should
