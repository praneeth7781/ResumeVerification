proper size apparently most of us wear band sizes that are too big should go down in band size but up in cup size its all very confusing there actually is its complicated but the smaller the band size then the smaller the cup size even if the letter stays the same a 36b could also likely fit a 34c nonetheless ops boyfriend is a git i feel like wine is totally appropriate if the house is in wine country go for it people visiting are clearly there for wine usually and something local is nice otherwise not everyone drinks and even people who drink dont always drink wine a neater host gift is something that represents the area local honey or something some of these were discussed and shed read them and made a post with ever detail about him and me saying that our kids should be taken away and that neither of us are fit parents the mother based the accusations directly from texts between her daughter and the husband and people are reacting strongly so i assume there was so highly problematic behavior no made up accusations although it may have been from the past no longer relevant andor taken out of context i am glad youve had a positive experience the mild weather is its own special benefit too i will certainly miss it when i go similar to in new orleans where the question is how you doing and the correct answer is how you doing back nobody actually knows how anyone is doing but the question has been properly asked thanks for the thoughtful reply i agree but i feel like bay area and south bay are a super separate microcosm within the us even when it comes to suburban diversity i think almost 40 of an area like santa clara are immigrants 2nd gen or people here on visas so the diversity of cultures living within same neighborhoods here is much higher than even other metros i find friendliness throughout the south bay to be very hitormiss since ive been back but i am not really tied into my current neighborhood warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info i lived in the south 3 years and even there i still think its really regional still atlanta not so much new orleans almost every person who crosses your path ive been in small towns in texas mississippi and would call them extremely unfriendly to outsiders dont try to hold her accountable but do tell her youd like to help her find help and its a topic you wont discuss with her id frame it this way i feel you are making selfdestructive choices id like to help you find a therapist you can speak with i know your dad and is marriagedivorce troubles may have impacted you growing up wasnt the greatest example so i would love to see you find a healthy way to love thats my offer to help you find help but i wont listen to you discuss your choice in a partner or any issues you are having when you tell me they are married none of this is about love or sex even though she may frame it that way she likes the power of being chosen over someone else she doesnt know how to be a friend to herself or others if shes not ready to get help thats on her but you dont need to be part of her drama cycle and bear witness to her blowing up others lives will never do meth again oh be careful friend you know how gross it made you feel but its a highly highly addictive drug for a reason put that on a postit on your mirror block the guys number and grindr profile because you may get out of this totally fine but only if you really never do it again pretty much any smaller region with a huge wealth gap and inequality in living standards is going to have crime silicon valley has the top 1 of households holding 48 times more of the total wealth than the bottom 50 there was a very healthy middle class here about 20 years ago thats now hanging on by a thread johanneseburg would be an example of this on steroids given it is a postapartheid apartheid city with intense wealth divide and high violent crime coming out of a recent enough history of total oppression violence that certainly went well beyond even us redlining laws or racial covenants of which ca historically had many crime has for the most part been on the increase globally in metro areas since the pandemic along with higher incidents of car accidents at the same time there is a global housing crisis in many major metro areas that intensified from 2020 on i dont think the issue is solely a bay area one and there are more mitigating factors here as well its just whatever cracks were there pre2020 have gotten amplified since in many places the one thing we have that some other countries dont have necessarily is a lot more guns which also doesnt help ar7e you m0cking me imo people dont have common sense and its all about me me me independence is awesome but it seems like everyone wants to be better than everyone else here and has no respect for anyone else its funny because the very thing you hate about here you dislike the inverse in japan social pressure to conform not rise above ones station it also bums you out one thing i am a firm believer in there are cultures and places that are better intrinsic matches for us based on how we like to navigate the world but also that any move will never fix issues that are more internal i am currently stuck in the south bay for family issues lived in la for 20 years now back here probably for at least another year but planning on my exodus because i do have duel citizenship elsewhere i am trying to also use this time to learn how to feel positive about the things that i know i do like love about ca so that i dont take that frustration and irritation with me when i leave i take a nature walk every day or at least walk around the neighborhood and i make an effort to note the things that are pretty here once a month try to see the ocean there is a lot you can find thats lovely and i appreciate that even though it is no longer my place or thing it is still an area that people from around the world would love to live in so i must be able to find a few good things the weather is nice i am grateful for the kind of produce that is reasonably local to ca i focus on the friendly people i meet and try to ignore some of the ruder ones thats all the advice ive got edit spelling offer to celebrate her birthday with her on another night or during a different part of the day and plan to do something special for her if its been 4 months and she wants to keep you out of this party for social reasons that will make it less stressful for her thats her business you not caring isnt the issue its what she wants i assume that means the price increase in value is capped so not the best way to build starter home equity moreover while i dont think most people need half the sq footage they have to raise a family 2 bedrooms 1 bath at 1000 square feet is only comfortably doable if you have one young small child that doesnt move around a lot you dont have 2 wfh adults condos would be a better option here but so many come with prohibitive hoas and not much to show for the yearly costs most of it i think is just to get a rise out of people and fight with people which he enjoys my husband has bluntly said i dont care about that its boring so the issue isnt politics its that you married a man who is the living embodiment of a nihilistic online troll who enjoys fighting with people there are ultimately a 1000 things people can discuss in this world the social dynamics of meerkats planetary solar systems fashion music etc politics is often an undercurrent in most daily things but there are topics where they arent omnipresent the issue isnt you both have nothing to talk about it is that he is actively showing you he doesnt want to engage with you i mean i would have a get it together become a better partner conversation with him or explain given you dont want to cohabitate with a phonescrolling lump for the remainder of your days that you will be packing up its a sort of oldtimey mentality that can really be as innocent as wanting to be generous with nothing more implied does he earn more than you i know some people feel very put off taking from others that they know arent as well off if you are worried its about him having feelings but hes never crossed a line in any other manner then thats really on him to sort through i do know that if it was someones birthday and i knew they were like this i would have excused myself to go to the bathroom and instead snuck my credit card to the waitress to pay the bill thats the most too late ive treated you way to do it with people like this rather than offer when the bill arrives knowing they will refuse edit seeing your comments regarding offering to pay dont insist or wait for the bill again hand off your card and have it already taken care of just tell him when the paid bill comes for you to sign that you want to repay him balance can be important in a dynamic clicked on richmond one and any house for sale at 400k with no interior photos is a teardown even in richmond its also 800 sq feet edit and now looked at the one in oakland now i think you are being sarcastic that doesnt need sweat equity it needs to be burned to the ground for carrying diseases the one on manila street is nice though includes op that one pesky office mime who has to chat maybe they are mimes who have to make their own bookings for mime events so phone privileges are exempt from coming out of their invisible boxes of total silence back in the day i used to walk into the fairmont like i was a guest and go straight to their lobby bathrooms i think they are across from the tea room nice stalls good marble countertops 10 out of 10 toilet well mimes for one scorched marketplace i assume it was at the very least a nod to kristallnacht the night germans and austrians rampaged and destroyed thousands of jewish businesses set fire to 100s of synagogues i briefly lived across from the bayou in new orleans and even in my short time there someone drove themselves right in what would convince you that they are not psychotic what hire a moving company that will come pack everything and move it for you make sure the company sends 4 guys even a totally unstable person isnt going to try and mess with 4 burly movers you dont owe them an explanation or to try and be reasonable when they are not reasonable do plan that the day the movers come you may have to call the police again if they completely lose
