scrambled eggs on the stove at the same time yes just dive right in dude did you sleep under a bridge into the shower with you before we go anywhere and youre not putting those clothes back on as a guy i would say that to a guy dont make it awkward or weird just be direct and matter of fact sometimes people just need to hear it straight if he gets offended about his ripeness continue to give it to him straight we are not hanging out with you smelling like that your call if you want to fix it or dip info how bad are the mosquitos where youre planning to deploy this great article in that article is link to a painting called supper at emmaus painted in 1525 and the descriptive text below the painting says following the council of trent 1545 1563 the eye of god seen above replaced the threefaced head of the trinity so it seems like the allseeing eye image came out of that council or at least the prescription for its use in art did i know that but the law already exists to address the issues in two person relationships my point was that the law is not capable of addressing those same issues in 2 person relationships i dont think the law would legally recognize more than 2 parents in an adoption for example he probably wasnt aware of the circumstances at first and now he is when the drama settles down hell likely reach out and apologize op you are the greatest of all time at being ushutupfruitcup would be dude you realize the far right has already resorted to violence right this isnt a hypothetical conversation jan 6 is the obvious exhibit a but theres the boogaloo murders charlottesville any number of recent shootings perpetrated by far right ideologues garcia being but the latest example the violence ship has sailed looks like he has his undeveloped twin curled up in there that would be a no from me nta you can only afford what you can afford sounds like you did what you could from a distance nta sometimes people need help setting healthy boundaries however more concerning is that not 1 not 2 but all 3 adult kids dont seem to want to have much more than a transactional relationship with your husband might be worth looking at why that is in his shoes it would certainly make me reflect on my own contribution to this dynamic might be too late to repair things but maybe not if your husband has a guilty conscience about not being the best dad that could be driving some of this behavior does he feel like he has something to atone for mannigan or madigan would be better if you hit it big and people need to ask a bookstore if they have a book by sean morrigan it could easily be confused for morgan this was ghost in the shell no that character was major lucy is a different movie i think we agree the only point i was trying to make is that i inferred from ops question that they were merely asking if it should legal or not and that my comment was there were many legal ramifications other than thumbs up or thumbs down that would need to be considered family law in general would have to be reviewed and modified in multiple areas because of its inherent assumptions thats kind of my point though in a polycule would there need to be a change in law to allow for more than two of the partners to be legal parents warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info adoption sperm donors surrogacy families can have many origin stories so in a polygamy relationship we would still know who the parents of a child is and the rights and duties in connection with the child would stay with the two actual parents how would that work in cases of adoption and before the middles ages you have boudicca who rampaged across britain during the roman occupation dont forget about and just leave it give enough context leading up to the moment that it could be anything paying the mortgage getting the important papers from the secret hiding place me to get that mole on your back checked out to call about test results to read that letter you havent read where i describe finding the child you thought was dead but just end it there so the reader like the fictional recipient of that message just starts mentally cartwheeling through all the possibilities a bit maddening for the reader but fun to set up in this life karma can play out over multiple lifetimes so maybe maybe not someone responsible for genocide may require thousandsmillions of lifetimes to get what they deserve i personally dislike being fussed over so while others might revel in being pampered i prefer my service to be more selfserve for example several years ago i connected through bahrain from london on gulf air it seemed like every 2030 minutes they were coming up the aisle with hot hand towels fresh dates etc no pressure no hovering just availability if you wanted it and it was always some small wellconsidered nicetohave at regular intervals i loved that experience my point was that laws around marriage take as their starting point that its a two party arrangement making polyamory legal as op said would likely require a prenupmedical powerofattorney for all participants so that it would be clear how things would shake out when disagreements arise on parenting medical care inheritance issues child custody how liabilities are handled in traditional marriage one spouse is incapacitated other spouse is not so who gets to decide medically is pretty clear in a poly situation who gets to to decide absent any legal directives isnt clear at all there are many ramifications to the term legal for example if one spouse is in a hospital incapacitated the other spouse can make the call on extraordinary medical measures if someone has multiple spouses and they disagree on what should be done how would that work if there are children in the relationship and the adults disagree on vaccination for example how does that work if there are children and one party wants to leave how does physical custody legal custody child support work youre just talking about the relationship between the adults but what about other family members what if one person receives an inheritance becomes financially liable in lawsuit or accidentally kills someone in a crash how would relationship assets work in the event of liabilities i wasnt harping on gmo generally there have been regular genetic selection methods employed to get us where we are my larger point was that in the quest for better durability and shelf life flavor was secondary in importance and an heirloom variety from say the 1930s would already be on the trajectory of compromise thats why i set my time window to 100200 years ago nta but she didnt do this in a vacuum i didnt feel comfortable attending a wedding when i knew she was the reason some children lost their father why in your eyes does the guy get a pass this is his doing as well he was not a virtuous husband and father who was somehow led astray by your friend if youre objecting on moral grounds why arent you objecting to supporting a wedding where both parties broke up a family call the small claims court clerk ask if hearings are online or if you need to do them in person if online you should be able to do this by mail forms to file are likely online youll need to hire a local process server the court could likely recommend some in a factory farming world any commercially available fruit or vegetable has been tweaked so it travels better has a better shelf life i think of paw paws that are generally only available in the areas where theyre grown because they dont travel well id like to try any and all apples oranges pears cherries berries nuts and common garden vegetables from 100200 years ago same with breads made from nongmo wheat rye etc can you imagine how much better the cornbread must have been back then even just regular old corn on the cob it would be nice to know what the ancestors tasted kiss army representing desantis deserves this hes single handedly made florida a shit hole but it isnt singlehanded though hes had the crucial assistance of a complicit legislature and toadies throughout the state apparatus its a fascist cabal not a lone actor like he was on his deathbed and struggling to breathe but ignited with passion and anger he said he didnt want to be the reason i was missing things love your dad as george w bush famously said to those of you who are graduating this afternoon with high honors awards and distinctions i say well done and as i like to tell the c students you too can be president i really liked the initiate trilogy by cyril scott which is a great narrative form introduction to some of the concepts also the inner life by the theosophist charles leadbeater which is pretty dry and repeats itself a bit since its a collection of lectures but has good information i also really like ramon stevens whatever happened to divine grace which to me is a good laymans guide to understanding how the universe works stripped of specifics theos bernards heaven lies within us is the first book that helped me overcome monkey mind in meditation i wonder if she thought the most damaging thing she could do to him in response was out him as a scumbag to all the people closest to him in one shot dudes entire family was there there were definitely aftershocks for him probably had to go hide can you imagine going back into work hey how was the weddinghoneymoon or worse no one asks because the word is out and no one is talking to him yes let him pick up some potato salad from the grocery store save the good stuff for your family starts it already started i recommend books by geoffrey hodson the brotherhood of men and angels is a good place to start never i always have one ear tuned to whats happening on the stove while i bustle around clearly the person who removed that was righthanded looks great nice job maybe old friend had an interest in you and sister wasnt sure about your relationship and said she should try and get in touch to see whats up that question is an indirect way of asking if youre in a relationship talk to sister first and figure out which way the wind is blowing if friend is interested in seeing you go from there if sister was trying to pass the buck to you you can say the wedding is a year away you imagine youll take whoever your so is at that time to the wedding okay semantically and technically i agree with you mining itself is inflationary slowly at this point but other factors are counterbalancing that with the aggregate effect being that the circulating supply has leveled off in recent years i guess given the sub were in the real question should be is bitcoin a good investment i dont think so but what ops assertion is is that its fake money i think op was trying to make the point that bitcoin is fake money and since it is fake money its therefore a bad investment i agree with the conclusion but not the rest of it it has features that make it a
