position that it was very important for there to be menonly spaces and that certain kinds of conversations would only happen in the company of men he wasnt specific but he had been in war zones and at the time it was unheard of to have women in combat zones i hadnt considered that male veterans commiserating with other male veterans might go through some raw emotions that they wouldnt be comfortable displaying with women around likewise there are certainly conversations among women that they probably wouldnt be comfortable having in front of men i think what used to be genderspecific discourse is more widely discussed between the genders now and even between generations than was done in the past still i think theres still some merit to having single gender spaces in order to have certain kinds of discussions just as its a good thing to have things like support group spaces for example to discuss things such as struggles with substance abuse belonging to a group of fellow
