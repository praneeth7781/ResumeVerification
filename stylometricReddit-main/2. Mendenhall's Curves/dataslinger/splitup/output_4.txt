useful medium of exchange privacy is not one of them btw something like monero would be better for that dollar transactions have no privacy at all unless youre transacting with cash in person which elevates risk your example with bitcoin being immediately exchanged for other currencies shows precisely that it is useless just because its not fiat doesnt mean that its useless its a feature not a bug as the saying goes its lack of centralized authority means that it cant be taken from you by another entity unlike with the us seizing russias foreign reserves cutting them off from swift etc fiat currencies move within the worlds banking systems which are subject to the control of the worlds financial powers and so can be taken from you for any reason if you want to conveniently send dollarseurosetc to a counterparty elsewhere in the world you have no choice but to involve a financial institution if you are one of the millions of unbanked who pay steep prices to use the likes of western union to do remittances bitcoin and the lighting network are a way better and frankly less predatory option to move money around the world i dont know what your definition is but to me thats not useless circling back to your first statement im not arguing that bitcoin should be treated as an investment or a store of value people saw the rapid price appreciation some years back wanted in on that and the speculators piled in totally a speculative frenzy you and i are in agreement on that but just like tulip bulbs had utility in that they could also grow flowers bitcoinlightning has genuine utility beyond being a target of speculators that utility is often missed by people who only see bitcoin as a shit investment its true that more will be minted into the next century but the velocity is slowing way down more than 19 million of the total 21 million have already been mined so while the remaining time to mine makes dilution seem like a problem were only talking about 10 of the total so not much dilution and it will be very slow dilution this will also be counterbalanced by circulating supply loss there are many stories of people who junked their computers and lost their wallets or lost custody by some other means sent a transaction into the void with the result being that a substantial amount of bitcoin is out of circulation either permanently or for a very long time i dont think dilution is a significant consideration eh im not following your reasoning there are plenty of currencies out there that have volatility yet are still convertible to other currencies while bitcoin is being invested in by speculators seeing it as a store value it is intended to be a medium of exchange it does that its somewhat volatile but it does that people buy things with it if you quickly move from your currency into bitcoin pay for something with it then the recipient converts it into their currency the speed of those conversions should protect you from volatility risk you seem to be arguing that its a poor store of value and im with you there but youre also arguing that its fake money while it is literally being used as money right now your ponzi scheme argument doesnt hold up how is a public blockchain ledger that everyone can see hiding a ponzi scheme the total number of bitcoins is finite so theres no dilution or money printing unlike with say the us dollar or other crypto silver lining mom probably wont trot that story out at parties any more nta i would take her up on her offer of not coming around when shes in attendance she sounds incredibly toxic watch your mental health improve in her absence you can visit relatives when you know shes not there a win looks like russia leaving ukraine agreed if youre including crimea it also includes the repatriation of all the children russia has taken russia has blown a demographic hole in their own population and they want those kids to help them recover from that geez op youre polite and considerate to a fault maybe flip the perspective around and see how this sounds is it terrible for a company to make you spend a lot of time in these interviews string you a long and then give you a lowball offer this is your time being spent if the offer isnt good enough decline and dont lose sleep over it sometimes things dont work out you are not responsible for their emotional state if theyre mad that you dont take a subpar offer if that was her idea of negging she sucks at it dont forget to let all the guests and vendors know so they can make alternate plans some guests may be taking time off that they could use elsewhere wow creepy as hell souls of the damned vibe but i like it nta but someone needs to look in on the son she said some damaging unforgivable shit to him hows he coping someone needs to let him know that theyre glad hes on this earth maintenance would fix it soon enough the suffering would be that long but it would be such a flex to let him know that he froze his ass off all week when op could have easily fixed it if he wanted to lets him know the wages of a being a dick never start work without the customer signing the estimate especially if its a new customer if its someone youve worked with a lot and trust then you can be more lax i wasnt there so this is a second hand story and took place shortly after the wedding but at the reception no one could find the groom until they found him out in the limo having sex with one of the bridesmaids the bride went back into the reception stopped the band took the microphone and told everyone there what just happened naming the bridesmaid and said the wedding would be annulled and all gifts would be returned she totally took charge of the situation but damn lansing art attack bahaha that would have been perfect this is actually a great one security issues come out like rain these days bookmark the cve web site when boss asks pull up the site and say this new cve just popped up and im looking into our potential exposure boss whats a cve you starts to explain boss glazing over itching to exit the conversation i have to run to a meeting but keep me posted my experience is that the tone is set at the top and they tend to hire for and allow behavior that matches theirs thats true in companies of all sizes not just small ones op do you really want whoever committed crimes with it getting out of prison and looking you up because you got their car and its contents the smart play is to let the cops sell it who knows what might be hidden in it if all else fails have the face to face then send a confirming email afterwards just confirming the details of our meeting today where you said x y z let me know if i misunderstood anything if they dont respond thats a tacit admission that you understood correctly great design simple yet evocative would love for someone gifted at osint to tell him where he banks at who his accountant is where his kids go to school his home address the car he drives his license plate number court cases hes been involved in etc op it would be a good experiment to try w bf to track how often she calls him when hes available versus how often she calls him when hes with you having proof that shes actively trying to pull him away from you could lead to a step in right direction or not something to try if youre reluctant to give up the relationship just yet red ross i put his dads health at risk over nothing perhaps if you had witnessed the interaction you would realize it wasnt nothing because dallas and fort worth are wellknown ukrainian cities and the longhorn is a wellknown ukrainian mascot isabella has nextlevel powers of deduction the only thing that makes sense then is that sister had it in her head that since she was the oldest she should have the first grandchild and you beat her to the finish line its stupid but seems to fit the facts guessing he hears squirrelschipmunksmice in the attic and is tracking the noise and there is no ring so have your dad put the condo in your name only thats not pressuring your bf only reflecting the current circumstances these events need not be linked your bf is where he is your dads terms are what they are let the events play out butdont be surprised if the condo going under your name only upsets your bf or dont be surprised if he suddenly wants to propose when that happens and if thats the case your bf is in this transactionally and not for you do with that information what you will as others have said boss has already figured it out but assuming you signed the 2 year contract the terms would likely be that if you left youd have to reimburse boss for the cost of the course that he paid for so assuming there are no other restrictions like a noncompete just sign the contract boss pays for the course you leave as planned next year pay boss back for the course and off you go plus changing the name would be discarding the goodwill that the current company name has bonehead move from a branding standpoint assuming the current reputation is good what he stole was the companys goodwill which has value third picture also shows 2 maybe 3 replacement bits that are blackgray i was always second to her in lots of things especially when it came to boys but none the less here i was engaged to the love of my life and so happy shes not just jealous shes angry that op isnt sticking to her designated role as second best to her sorry op this likely was never much of a friendship if the ground rules were that you had to be the designated second place in order to make her look good she always wanted the spotlight she announced her pregnancy at your event her nonefforts throughout the wedding planning were acts of slowmotion sabotage and causing stress for you you are well rid of her put your energy into relationships with people who want to lift you up not hold you back other countries are warning their citizens about coming here because of whats been happening in texas jason statham presumably this tea mug is fabricated from low thermal expansion glass and should be good to go up to 100c thickness is not an indicator of borosilicate glass and the mug may actually be soda lime silicate glass not borosilicate you can read up on it here if they make a bad offer you can talk about offering it to other developers or even the general public and see what they might pay for it maybe the developers in your area are friendly with each other or maybe another developer would love an opportunity to be a bump in the road for this one so assuming op is being honest that hes done nothing to warrant this and assuming that its highly unlikely that the gf would accept disparaging testimony from a rando the only conclusion is that leah and david backstabbed him for some reason they are not your friends op who else knew what was about to
