this history and no other information the best assessment we can make is who knows what the journalist in question may or may not have been up to maybe a hide scraping knife similar to this the illinois railway museum is fantastic but its a shame its so hard to get to the georgia state railroad museum in savannah is reachable via amtrak it has a nice operating turntable i would just start adjusting if the picture gets better leave it if it gets worse adjust back youre not going to hurt anything i only ever adjusted the original plus and classic and you couldnt make those adjustments with the case on so this is a different arrangement and its been years but i seem to recall it was the hex shaped tool so if i were you id try the pair on the top right first great clean look love the aesthetic i dont understand why people would wear a watch there if you bend your hand back the knob digs in why not wear it below the wrist bone get a hand held ultrasonic dog repeller theres an anime called children who chase lost voices that features a cat whisker radio receiver similar to yours that was just caitlin clark passing by hard to pick one favorite places are areas around page az horseshoe bend floatingpaddling down the river to lees ferry the antelope canyons painted desert farther out and then up into utah especially zion but grand staircaseescalante as well lots of stunning scenery to be had on route 1 along the california coast especially the big sur area yosemite is something to see antrim coast of ireland belfast up to the giants causeway glens of antrim scottish highlands also 1 for iceland she ungrounded our daughter without my say so rleopardsatemyface op what do you expect you go off with this unilateral behavior then are annoyed when others do the same thing work on your communication because you treat your family members like underlings instead of family yta hard to explain it to her if she doesnt get it but maybe you could have a general conversation about unilateral decisionmaking ask her how she would fell if you decided to move the household to another state without consulting her took in a relative without consulting her booked a vacation for the two of you that may or may not be where shed want to go somewhere without consulting her at bottom these are all about taking away your partners agency in the relationship which is also what she proposed thats being a shitty partner and if she cant see that as wrong then you dont have much to work with in terms of shared values wow what museum is this in info how old was the niece if niece was at a young age and not able to process ambiguity well my answer would be different than if she was older nta but why didnt you step up sooner during the visit i had none it was a good experience ive done other types of work so i came in with a good handle on intent and what i wanted to work on and a spirit of collaboration my experience was pretty dialogy in that aya and i were discussing a lot as we went along this was internal dialog i wasnt speaking out loud as to the why we all have stuff we could improve on right i wanted to work on various things that hadnt been susceptible to improvement by other means the doritos were a nice touch universitystate surplus stores are also good sources for cheap laptops holy shit driver was way too close and lucky they didnt run someone over buffalo cauliflower tacos at lyfe kitchen can be a bit hit or miss depending on whos in the kitchen but when theyre on their game amazing gun violence in particular innocent kids getting shot in schools and small children finding guns at home and shooting each other the us is a shithole country missouri politicians are bombing themselves back into the stone age lets make our state a really unattractive place to live so no one comes here and all young people leave missouri is going to be a statewide old folks home in 20 years interesting bit interviews with six people across senior levels of wall streets biggest banks revealed an intense desire for a gop candidate who could deny trump the nomination while the finance industry appreciated trumps tax cuts partially designed by former goldman sachs executive gary cohn during his time in trumps white house they grew to loathe his protectionist trade policies penchant for attacking individual companies and firing off marketshaking tweets desantis has this same penchant for attacking individual companies and thats going to be a headwind for him just looks like a chopped up older coin with a new handle on it construction looks very modern op you are the embodiment of this quote never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed its the only thing that ever does props for being stubborn shades of the classic that was stupid commercial my goto is always robert plant warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info bear spray requires some proximityaim why not get a handheld ultrasonic dog repeller yes it would be an expense but likely a safer option to use could also use it to train the dog to stay out of your yard and its worse if you have a pet who sleeps next to your legs keeping you warm any pets in the bed op nice super crisp what material was the cylinder seal made of part of ops concern is financial 90 minute uberlyfttaxi wouldnt be cheap clicking the tongs twice before using them definitely maybe wasnt expecting much but the plot kept me guessing great post op you have a flair for story telling no christies appeal back in the day was that he seemed to be good at owning the libs and for the time had a big personality he has been far exceeded in that capacity by both trump and desantis so hes a nonfactor now hes not pugnacious enough for the modern gop fun fact people who say they dont care actually do same the hands seem too large as does the spine of the book with that width of spine shed be hugging a dictionary and the set of her arms would be different holding up that much weight she wouldnt be able to carry the weight by pressing the book to her chest it would slide down she would have to put the heel of her hand under the base of the spine to hold it up otherwise i like the composition given that the light source is from the left should be more shadow on her neck under her hair i am tempted to find a new job what would you do i would give in to that temptation i saw on a post a couple of weeks ago that another redditor got rid of a problem manager by referring them to a recruiter maybe put recruiters onto both the snitch and the boss and after you fire her buy some pizzas for the crew to make it up to them for this going on so long toss it in your car drive it down to a lock smith and theyll probably have it open in 5 minutes something similar happened to tua against the bengals watch what happens with his hands after the hit if during this altercation he took a blow to the head either directly or after falling that could result in what was described take a look at this list of involuntary movements after a tbi i went and got a drink with the guy who has that job now and the guy who had the job before him the current guy said he was screwed out of a raise he took the promotion when it was implied one was coming and it never came and the guy before him he was making less than i am currently in the role and kept getting his requests for raises rejected props do op for doing the due diligence bullet deftly dodged husband is a problem but the way op handled the offer was perfect question based on what op has written about his reaction to her reasonable requests do you think the bf views op as an equal you might check in with some of the physical facilities that nonprofits tend to use it will be a good connection point from which to network to other groups two that i can think of are allen neighborhood center and the fledge there are also the passiton lansing and hannah community centers that might be worth looking into any time i see age gap relationships like this i always think the elder person feels like they have a higher status in the relationship and the energy when being called to account for their shortcomings is how dare you lecture me there are obviously exceptions but when op describes his reactions this doesnt sound like one of those exceptions op he sees you as lessthan him not on his level statuswise not an equal partner and he is therefore offended when you call him out on legitimate grievances you are not equal partners your feelings matter less to him than his own feelings and wants have a look here when i ask why they cant get a loan from a bank they get angry and accuse me of not trusting them couldnt be plainer than that lots of interest bearing accounts to be found these days or head over to rbogleheads and learn about putting it in index funds you should also read the what to do with a windfall post in rpersonalfinance first item dont tell anyone about the windfall 1 do not tell anyone well you can tell your spouse and any financial advisors but its best to not share with other family friends or anyone else especially for a larger windfall even if people already suspect or believe you are receiving a windfall they do not need to know the size or any details quadrupling our time together i dont know that this is a realistic concern during your residency and actually if they want to burn cycles on that instead of causing genuine harm im okay with that let them be occupied with theater doubt that will help with the next general election pioneering antifa was going to suggest an airtag in her backpack or pockets totally fair point to make i may have this wrong but iirc the stanford prison experiment was originally intended to be run in both the us and in germany to see if there was some cultural difference between the two countries that facilitated the rise of nazism after the results at stanford it was decided not to run the experiment in germany the conclusion being that it could just as easily happen in the us from the file name i would guess its this op im amazed you agreed to stay overnight with your father having not seen him in years that could have gone much worse impressed with the coordinated knee socks mine involved getting married in the next 23 years his did not he said he hadnt given any concrete thought to marriage and liked how we are now it is what it is you two dont have matching life plans dentist is the standard excuse that way when you need to go to a follow up interview its time to get a cavity filled that they found on the last appointment ive been struggling at work for a long time
