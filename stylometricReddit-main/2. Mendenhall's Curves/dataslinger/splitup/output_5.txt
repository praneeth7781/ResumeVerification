go down and could tell the gf something that she would accept without question its the only explanation first get the story out of someone gfs parents sound promising as sources you have been slandered you have suffered harm do you want your gf back after this if so time to go on the offensive get a lawyer involved let leah and david know that ruining someones life has consequences then leave the kids with me for a few weeks once everyone was settled in this is insane theyve never even met you i agree with admirabletrees theory that shes scrounging for free child care for some reason guessing the reason for dumping her kids is not compelling or she would have mentioned it i have brain cancer and will be down for 3 weeks can you help out vs i want to go on a cruise and dont want to bring the kids step up for your estranged sister if your wife cares for these kids she will make your home a safe place for them instead of an interrogation room cant upvote this enough like the freedom for developers to build in flood zones and leaving others holding the bag not the new hires fault but unfortunately you are too busy with your own tasks to take time to help him that looks like a lear sigler adm3a wang trust your feelings hers were not the actions of a person who loves you unambiguous articles for promotion would fit anything can be promoted including a person i thought he was going for renegotiate your bf is mistaken you are out of his league shithole country cant keep the lights on killing their women heavily armed shooting each other at the drop of a hat these are the same descriptors they would probably use for a describing what they would term a banana republic should the deceased have minded his own buisness of should the killer be charged with second degree murder sort of the person who potentially might have minded his own business was the killer not the killed its not a strong question much more pertinent is what the altercation was about were they arguing about baseball teams or was one of them trying to prevent the other from beating a child to death context matters certainly when youre talking about whether a murder charge is justified or not you seem to think that race is the only context that matters but youre mistaken these are great op thanks for posting and a direct flight would be much easier on the pets learning from someone who loves their subject and gets you to love their subject is an awesome experience enthusiasm is contagious you seem to be dealing with some pretty big feellings there buddy are you sure youve correctly identified the little bitch in this situation this is gold theres a difference between op saying i want this and nowgf agreeing and saying deal the issue isnt ops communication its the lack of an agreement op even says i understand that we were not official and shes done nothing wrong they werent official gf has done nothing wrong op can feel his feelings but there was no transgression his trust was not violated lot of rage there that had clearly been sitting for a while maybe some therapy would be a thought dont want to burn yourself up from the inside i think nelson mandela said something along the lines of hate is like taking poison and hoping your enemies will die giving notice before your one year was a tactical error now they can trump up a reason fire you for cause before the one year mark and force you to pay them back slow walk the letter pretend to be cooperative then go after the one year date talk to her bob will almost certainly forbid her from going if he cant go and she may prefer you dont even formally invite her to avoid backlash bob might even like that because it will prove to him you two arent as close as you were best to quietly pregame the potential outcome of an abusive situation she told me i was not being a good father nta for what you said but your mom was for saying this and water still stinks after passing through the softener thats surprising back when we were on well water we had a big old tank softener that wed dump salt pellets into havent used a kinetico have you considered a water softener you know what im even better at engineering judy records is an osint site for court cases we call them merit badge blitzes in this area op when you talk to the council find out if any troops put on blitzes and contact that troop to participate in their next event though thats not likely to go anywhere since there isnt any proof you were there you witnessed it youre the proof others here are saying narcissism but let me offer a possible alternative i once worked with a guy who was married to a woman who really struggled with apologies she was raised in a toxic household with several competitive siblings and apologies were weakness it meant you had caved or lost she was otherwise a great person and her husband just dealt with it knowing her past and the baggage she carried op you would likely know if she had an upbringing similar to this otherwise probably a narcissist 1 there is a certain zen to repetitive tasks that can make them quite enjoyable when youre in the groove you can think about other things or just bliss out when youre hiking youre essentially doing the same thing for long stretches are you bored 2 different people appreciate different aspects of work some people dont want a lot of talkinginteraction and for those in factories there are often teams that engender esprit de corps and take pride in their groups output some people like to work with their hands some people really appreciate the immediate gratification of doing a task and that task is done in mental tasks like engineering sometimes you go down a road only to discover your approach wont work and you have redo or reconsider the task people who like closure would hate that before looking down on other jobs consider that there are people out there who wouldnt want yours dont pity the content individual it is wiser to try and emulate their contentment enough is better than more yes you dont need the sister in your life either first press charges for assault oh yeah id forgotten about that ostensible claim by anonymous that they were onto roves electioncooking schemes and had thwarted them hard to find articles on that theres this one about the configuration heres one about the story for those not familiar with the story heres the gist for example consider clevelands fourth ward in 2000 al gore won 95 of that wards vote but in 2004 the county reported its results after the 1114 pm crash and it showed that kerry had only won 59 of the vote a 35 drop without any explanation there were several other abnormalities across ohios postserver crash that delivered the state to bush an election server crashed before the server crash things were worse for bush than after the crash when votes seemed to have skewed in his favor the story goes that anonymous looked into this compromised the vote stealing system ahead of time so rove couldnt steal another election and in 2008 when the server crashed and came back up votes werent flipped so obama won same i have a jade plant that i put outside in the summer months when its getting that much sunlight the leaves redden when the plant is inside in the winter months getting much less light the leaves are green has it been getting a lot of sun if so this seems normal the leaves look firm and healthy theres also vegan pulled pork made with jack fruit looks like this 2004 also gets an asterisk because we were on war footingtechnically at war and the electorate generally sticks with the incumbent during war or even the remains of a springhouse used for cold storage warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info if he was 08 after 12 hours he was about 24 12 hours earlier source rto policies are also being used as stealth layoffs by some organizations these days they know people have moved away they want to reduce headcount in a time of economic headwinds but dont want the bad pr of a layoff solution force rto lose some people and you get a workforce reduction without having a formal layoff go to one of the big box store sites and search for something like white glass globe shade with 314 in fitter this is next level revenge op weaponized attention taking someone who has to be the center of attention and then making them the center of attention at the precise moment they dont want to be the center of attention or if you have nothing naught people who were either raised in a specific religion or who went through a significant cognitive process to arrive at their religion dont like it when something challenges the tenets of their religion most christians believe in heaven not reincarnation and so view reincarnation as a threat to their worldview they had everything sometimes laboriously figured out what the rules were and now youre telling them that their rules are wrong and they need to figure things out all over again no one likes to hear they got the assignment wrong and they have to redo it when i announced this to my boss she gave me an immediate 17 raise and a verbal promise of a promotion come 2023 the verbal promise is never ever worth the paper its written on dont make life decisions on verbal promises dude this is a complete replay of the last time you knew what to do then do it now incorrect link op this if she had a joint bank account with a parent she needs to empty that account and open a new one at a new bank otherwise her mom can take all her money to try and force her back home she thinks its fun she got on our nerves about this people who think that aggravating other people is fun are not nice people 2 people from our team just left within the last month so our department is falling apart as well my manager is awful and a micro manager so ive been looking to leave for some time this is all you need to consider great advice and maybe go bowling moving around and doing something will help keep you from spiraling let the subconscious mind come up with some ideas reach out to your network let them know what happened brainstorm some ideas trust me a lot of people who have been living in the states the last 10 years feel pretty alienated from their own country as well the polarization is intense rather than remount the bracket why not just cut a strip of mdf to sit between the bracket and top im guessing the stabby part functions but yeah not worth much if you need it gone op id just donate it to a nearby theater group to use as a prop sword you can just say the job was not as advertised its a common thing and an interviewer is unlikely to hold that against you i would only mention the second job so it doesnt look like a pattern robert wagner what really happened on that boat love this shame you wont be
