upside down on the truck and cant sell it or at least cant sell it without getting yet another loan to pay off the truck loan to clear the lien before selling so youre more or less 100k in the hole not 14k from the sound of it but if you could get a loan pay off the truck sell the truck get something much cheaper that would enable you to put probably at least 10k towards your debts that would be a better situation than you have now consolidation loan would probably be a good move if you could make it happen it could be glued back together and used as a display piece but you wont be able to

the issue isnt him prioritizing work over family its you yanking him from his first foray into adulthood and making it perfectly clear that to you hes just a kid and what he wants doesnt matter to you you have seriously damaged your relationship with your son and you should apologize for your narrow take on the situation in two years hes going to be 18 and not inclined to put up with your heavyhanded interference in his life if you want to alienate your son keep doing what youre doing you may find that once hes 18 or 19 he no longer comes on family trips at all and why would he hes not
