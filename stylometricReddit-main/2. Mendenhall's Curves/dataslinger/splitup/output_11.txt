that the gfs reaction is beyond reasonable but that doesnt mean that op did a good job of being a decent partner here if she didnt want to get into it just say theres been a death in the family and she needs some grieving time simple explanation gives new partner some idea of whats going on this murky personal issues thing could be anything a drug problem other relationships etc that could be alarming to a new partner its unnecessarily secretive amazed that doing basic communication is so controversial here and id said what about grandma he said dont worry your mom and i will handle it this is your day what happened to this i would have been pissed that despite their assurances they did not in fact handle it and the signature does not match public examples shes guessingon a fishing expedition for whats going on with you because you wont tell her she lied for a cover story its stupid and likely born of insecurity but if you had just communicated whats going on with you this never would have happened why wouldnt you tell her that your father died randoms at work probably know but you want to keep something like that from your so who could be supporting you healthy communication makes problems like this not come up so often dont keep your so in the dark its not good for the relationship grandmas probably insisting because it will be a bad look for her son people will ask why and then the dirt comes out dollars to donuts if you have 1020 one of your friends at school can hook you up with a burner phone tons of households have old phones laying around just communicate via wifi but be discreet if you go and dont have a car handy the lincoln park zoo on the lakefront has the lincoln park conservatory which is a much smaller version of the garfield park one but it happened here and i cant count the number of games where one team was clearly outshooting the other and lost im not saying it happens the majority of the time im saying it happens a lot who is john galt props to the badgers but this is one of the things i really dont like about hockey or soccer ohio state put 16 shots on net in the first frame compared to just 5 from the badgers its pretty common for the team dominating on offense to lose inexpensive healthcare and inexpensive ritter sports i was thinking bilbos trolls legal or not the emf would make me not want to spend too much time there research about effects isnt conclusive but it would be a pass for me if you ever find yourself in chicago the garfield park conservatory has a really nice fern room op did that now gf is pissed and not communicating if shes not up for couples therapy because this is a problematic relationship and not willing to work on things op doesnt have much choice but to invest his efforts in moving on to a new relationship gf is totally exploiting his people pleasing tendencies and waiting for him to cave again i hope op doesnt do it this time around maybe but he could have also taken vocational ed classes while still in high school kind of amounts to the same thing or entered an apprentice program warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info from the post he showed his slack which was him talking crap about me to that other team lead you got this wrong async it was ops boss badmouthing op not the team lead dwcom is a good place to stream germanlanguage news stories it really helps develop your ear to listen to the language as much as you can its not unheard of for hr to offer lower than what the hiring manager agreed to in order to see if they can get the new employee for less this would give the manager a headsup that theyre in danger of losing the candidate hahahaha will believe it when i see it yes the ignoring thing sounds like hes a bit intimidated by op most likely due to attraction op if you want to date him youll probably have to ask him out lol family counseling sounds like a good idea seems daughter is old enough to put cards on the table and tell her that mom is uncomfortable with some of the behaviors same if a partner does something sketchout of character they have given you a reason to investigate if you never check their phone when they dont act shady then your conscience should be clean i spent such a long time trying to bury the shame i had that someone that i claimed to be my biggest pride and joy had been adopted im now working through those feelings instead of hiding them this would be a really nice thing for oop to tell his son has your daughter by any chance shown an interest in trying to become an influencer with her newfound physique the cutting off of a nonphotogenic friends the importance of having the right pictures being at a resort all are things that are very important to influencers has she gone down a rabbit hole nta and your daughter clearly picked up these attitudes from a toxic peer group possibly worth letting her see these answers so she can digest what a different group of people see her actions as ikr its not like op needs help dropping the cars transmission or something no its laundry op needs help removing his clothing fun to see basil exposition in his salad days steady rest you can find videos on making your own even but depending on how far beyond the end of the lathe bed your piece could go you could get some whipping action which is problematic bottom line is its not a license to go as long as you want depending on what youre trying to do you might need both a steady rest and a lathe bed extension the purchases were strange like food gas some hobby items perhaps hes buying these things on behalf of the women he follows have been a few times and really enjoyed it if you go back try der dicke schmidt same when the sex abuse scandals broke years ago parents pressured the school systems to stop allowing cub scout recruiting in the schools cub scout recruiting fell off a cliff without the cub scouts feeding into the boy scouts the troops gradually withered thats a low bar for a partner partner implies that youre both contributing in meaningful ways to the relationship if you were to fall illbecome disabled you could become homeless with this guy in the early days it was possible to know everything there was to know in the field protocols modems multiplexers software now its not even possible to know everything going on with javascript fragmentation and innovation is super fast and trying to stay current on everything is not only impossible but risky theres a lot of technologies that come on fast stick around for awhile then become obsoleteabandonedmoot so any time invested in learning about them becomes a calculated risk that theyre promising enough to be worth learning and not be a wasted effort i was never on the arpanet but i remember all the bulletin board services 300 baud modems they rapidly got faster genie compuserve prodigy america online hayes modems getting succeeded by us robotics the rise of isps i was on macs so i used software like red ryder reading the cuckoos egg by cliff stoll hes on reddit brought back memories when he was talking about the software he used and speaking of that book it would be a good one to read if you want to know what it was like to operate in those days novell netware was once the important network infrastructure to know at least in the business world token ring from ibm came up ipxspx my first email address was on pine email os2 tried to fend off microsoft and lost all in the dustbins now i remember when ripco got busted by the secret service anyway eventually mosaic came out and the world changed pretty rapidly after that i havent heard anything but holt is pretty rural pesticides etc are a thing could be entirely due to prolonged exposure to ag chemicals dakotta does auto interiors and could theoretically work with materials that are toxic but who knows fibertec does petroleum and pfas testing so theres potential exposure there but guessing they have good safety protocols any common patterns on where these people worked or lived nta its not her day its their day these people helped raise him shes out of line so are her flying monkeys i try not to be overly bound by rules i read the golden dawn by israel regardie and was struck by how much they make their own implements imbuing them with their own intent the bottom line is that you are the reader various spreads are a framework but the magic comes from you whatever works and gives you good results is what you should use you can invent your own spreads and if your intentions are clear about what the positions represent you should get good results all that to say if this technique came to you in a dream i would give it a try and see how well it works if it works well keep it if it doesnt try something else sounds like a great message and a clue to how you might naturally operate though and i would give it credence sort of it looks like the agitated water ive seen in underwater surfing shots when the waves are breaking and by that i mean it looks like shallow waterbreaking waves water which isnt where id expect a whale to be example id expect deeper water to look more like this guys im i m26 over reacting here yes youre overreacting put a lid on it before you trash this relationship work on your insecurity same ive only ever seen them flat like a sand dollar just as you wouldnt ask him to add one of your features to a tattoo that he would do for a paying customer his
