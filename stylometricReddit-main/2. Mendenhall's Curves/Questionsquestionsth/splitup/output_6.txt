who causes a problem intentionally or otherwise even though you can read their reviewsvouches things can always happen whereas its a lot less likely for a company who has been around for a long time like davids to pull something unpleasant there are plenty of other rental sites out there but personally i have always found davids to have the best prices best policies and least hassle 100 life for any of us can end in an instant you cant take the money with you and i promise you will regret experiences not had and enjoyed more than youll regret not saving the money dont look at it as not the best financial decision youve earned it and you deserve the break take it while you can there is no guarantee of tomorrow so the perfect and responsible time to take it is when you have the extra money and you and your family are in good health and able to travel during the pandemic the unemployment payments were the first time i experienced consistent livable income in my life should i have done a better job of saving during that time probably from a purely finance perspective but as someone who has lived their entire live in abject poverty and who has always been severely disabled i took the opportunity to go on a couple trips with my partner knowing i may never have the extra money to do it again i have zero regrets i look back on those memories so fondly and they make it easier to get through this awful life my extra savings would have lasted longer had i not but that few months of delaying the inevitable wouldve done little for me mouse dining is one of many services that does this its a small fee and works wonderfully couldnt be easier to set up no one wants to be subjected to your overtired pint sized terror during their already uncomfortable and stressful travel day youre not the only one on the plane have some courtesy please are you really pretending not to know how inflation and rising prices not a concept exclusive to disney work and no it didnt cost her 99 in 2006 and yes prices on everything have raised since 2006 in case youve forgotten exactly the total price may seem large at first glance but when you break down how many daymultiday passes youd buy before breaking even it isnt bad at all if you go even remotely often or even if youre just taking a couple trips a year or one long trip plus the parking discounts park hopper etc its only a bad deal if youre not going to visit more than say 510 days in that year sure youre paying up front but hey thats the trade i absolutely hate kids cant stand them dont enjoy interacting with them whatsoever and have zero patience for it i enjoy the parks just fine and feel no guilt or shame about it however i also dont interact with kids while there and keep my disdain to myself so its not a problem as long as you arent actively acting out towardsaround them no one needs to know your personal views and its no ones business there isnt a rule that you have to adore those little shits to be admitted into the park just that youre respectful of everyone around you which isnt hard theres nothing wrong with a preference or a feeling on something like this as long as you arent mistreating others as a result anyone who says otherwise frankly matters not enjoy your trips to the park you belong there just as much as every other paid guest the stigma against adderallstimulant medication is insane so many shitty judgmental and blatantly incorrect comments ive seen on posts about the shortages and articles and posts are always focused on fucking adhd patients never people with narcolepsy my partner and i both have prescriptions for it and the tones people take when he calls around to check pharmacy stock is insane everyone with a legitimate prescription just trying to get the medication they need to survive must be tweaker drug seekers right infuriating its your job to provide medications not to decide if you think someones treatment plan is viable if you dont agree with stimulant medications existing youre a piece of shit especially if you let that show in your interactions on the job as someone who has spent the last year watching my mom grieve her husband my stepdad who died by suicide there is no normal when a person close to you dies the kinds of comments and mourning behaviors expressed in the op are perfectly common reactions for some when someone close to them dies even if they may be uncomfortable or cringeworthy to others its also not weird or uncommon to grieve the loss of a pet i hate dogs but im also not a sociopath so i understand that death hurts and losing a pet you were very attached to regardless of how flawed that relationship was can be painful and traumatic to someone the real problem here is that the mom obviously treated her human child as second to the dog isnt getting proper therapy to process this loss if its as hard for her to process as she is claiming and that she is still a controlling mess to her adult son from a distance im starting to wonder which is right after this post i personally keep a ton of cash around because i dont trust banks to have my back and quickly resolve fraudproblems nor do i want to be relying on them in an emergency or having to explain to my landlord why rent is on hold because of a banking errorlocked accountetc but im probably also way too paranoid and im willing to admit that dont leave anything in your car youd be upset about having stolen just as a smart rule of thumb at least not in most areas these days id think but im in a city with a huge car theftproperty crime problem id be more upset having 100 stolen out of my car so im willing to risk the potential of being at a drive thru or gas station without my wallet which has happened a total of once in my entire life and i can always use a cardless atm as well if my carcity was more secure and i cared less about 100 it wouldnt be unwise to have some emergency cash around maybe 20 makes more sense 100 and my ass would be chapped 20 id just be miffed to each their own not everywhere is for everyone ive paid money to go there and quite enjoyed it again comparing it to where i live it was a welcome break and i enjoyed everything i did again as a tourist theres a lot to do there and a lot of it is very enjoyable yeah theyre getting one in grapevine that is set to open in a couple months actually texas will actually be getting a second one as well though it will be in houston i believe next year ive only been to the vegas one but i loved it and looking forward to checking out the santa fe and denver locations someday as well as the texas locations when they open its not bad at all theres areas that arent great but that goes for everywhere i like it a hell of a lot better than where i live portland thats for sure theres some really cool venuespockets with lots to do theyre getting a meow wolf soon well grapevine but close enough which is a neat thing its hardly a bad place to visit and here in the pnw it isnt legally permitted for dogs to be in restaurants bars or grocery stores its insane everywhere i go theres a damn mutt inside where it legally doesnt belong and nothing is done about it people constantly asking what are some dog friendly barsrestaurants i can bring my dog into well technically fucking none but these entitled selfabsorbed idiots dont believe any rules apply to them and he was he explained that you get added room food and drink but that comparatively to the baseline offerings it isnt much of an increase because alaska is already comfortable he mentions that the quality of food and drink isnt high enough to justify the cost in most situations but that it isnt bad no shit its going to be in his opinion just like everyone elses comments are if op just wants to know what the offerings are zero opinion on quality he can read the alaska website and yet somehow thats a perfectly reasonable thing to mention in a review of first classwhat to expect if the expected experience doesnt feel worth the upgradecost its worth noting and setting expectations accordingly because it truly doesnt matter at higher reforges im over 30 reforges on chain blades and i roll through 1050 escalations crazy quick solo or with a random team and i prefer to bring my shock blades because the teleport saves me some running and the distance between matches gets old i havent died in an escalation in a long time though and pull my weight and then some a lot of the time so im not the kind of player youre asking about it seems youd have to ask each individual player why they could be trying something new couldve gotten bad advice for their level dont have another weapon want to use the special specifically are trying to complete a challenge etc etc theres always skip matchmaking if its annoying enough to you truly doesnt matter for me my symptoms are at the absolute worst end of severe regardless of the whether if its miserable dark gloomy cold and shitty how oregon is 98 of the time the seasonal depression lack of vitamin dsunlight and overall darkness make things worse if its hot the heat is exhausting the seasonal allergies suck the dryness and dehydration are tiring and it fucks with my sleep schedule and gives me migraines which make me that much more tired exertion of any kind in the heat is made that much harder and more draining basically theres no winning when the hell will this start being enforced im so sick of dogs in restaurants bars grocery stores etc my local city subreddit has people seeking out places thatll allow their shitty mutts inside and youre downvoted into oblivion for reminding them in perfectly plain language with no hints of dogfree mentality i should mention that its literally not legal and they are violating health codes a dog friendly barrestaurantstore shouldnt exist because its not allowed to exist but these people are so fucking entitled and the rules never apply to them so is ogas by a landslide why would they not just do fingerprints like wdw does solves this problem very easily i lived in dallas and midlandodessa for a while i feel you dallas was a lot better than living in portland but midland that small town texas community coupled with the heat and humidity nightmarish i still have bad dreams about walking through 115 degree heat with pocket change i scraped together to fill containers with water at the outside stations with the air stinking of oil was a weird place to live not to hijack this post but im curious whats the cost of living like there these days i was born in laguna hills and grew up in oceansideorange countysan diego but sadly my parents made the mistake of moving to portland oregon in my early teens and i am once again stuck here now well into adulthood i have such fond memories of san diego and have visited as an adult and loved it but
