has anything taken over that spot i used to work there and it was such a neat buildingspace overall its a shame it closed roadside attraction is sort of near rontoms and has a cool laidback not too loud atmosphere that isnt super romantic or explicitly datey ive loved hanging there alone with friends with my partner and weve taken his folks there on a weekday afternoon even lots of indoor seating options with a good variety of tunes but not too loud and arguably one of the best outdoor patios in portland plus youre close to a lot of other spots with a good variety of atmospheres if you want to move elsewhere the bar directly next door ive only been to once or twice but i remember it being quiet and chill and youre close to hawthorne belmont division etc the nest is semi close and another fun spot that isnt super romantic but is definitely a vibe close to what you describe they did this for us last week at port orleans fq i believe this is standard at most of the on property hotels if your room doesnt come with a microwave it is available upon request when available it was great to heat up our ohana leftovers without having to walk to the main building is there a particular part of town youd like to go with this will help folks narrow it down quite a bit x200b im a big fan of roadside attraction in se beautiful super cool reasonably quiet outdoor patio and its never insanely loud inside plenty of room to spread out in little alcoves cash only though atm readily available however so keep that in mind the nest can be a fun spot too lots of different rooms to spread out in and find some privacy decent outdoor seating and they have pool and some random games laying around if you want an activity theres some other bars within walking distance but i wouldnt call most of them quietas good for conversation him wanting better communicating and better behaviors during arguments for the both of you isnt him punishing you and the fact that youre looking at it that way says everything about your emotional maturity or lack thereof i also wouldnt want to travel with someone i am currently not seeing functional healthy mature communication and conflict resolution with most people wouldnt you dont want to shell out money arrange a trip be out of town and if a fight breaks out have to deal with the unpleasant unhealthy ways those unfold its not just about the walking away it seems like he wants to get to a place where youre both communicating and resolving problems together better as a couple before being in a position where youre away from home together for extended periods traveling together makes it difficult to take space be that a few minutes to a few hours of a break or be it a few days you are largely stuck together and being in a fight can ruin a lot of plans travel responsibilities etc travel is stressful enough as it is its perfectly mature and reasonable to want to get to a better place together before putting yourself repeatedly in that situation the fact that youre looking at things as a how much good do i have to do before im rewarded with what i want instead of as the two of you working together to improve your relationship and communication not just for your wantsdesire to travel but for the longevity of your relationship and bond as a couple is incredibly selfcentered and immature the fact that youre even asking if you should discuss this further with him or just walk away entirely for someone who will go along with your desires makes it seem like you really dont value this relationshiphim much either yeah growing up in hillsboro the shitty speakerfreezer vans you describe were decently consistent in the few summer months we get but that was about it definitely no nicer trucks and i honestly havent even heard a single shitty one in all my years in inner se either i hope it does too it wouldve been a great benefit for those of us who are childless and dont want to run to the lockers a bunchare hindered by disabilities too it is you definitely want to make sure and ship all your stuff at once because you will be charged a fee every time otherwise it always caps at 3995 and if you forget one thingfind an impulse buy after its usually no more than 510 but to get the most out of the tiered shipping you definitely want to just wait and send it all together at once x200b for those who arent familiar with the offering another few points the other thing to remember is that you need to have all your receipts at time of shipping so if youre typically unorganized with those are prone to throwing them away etc youll want to prepare we bring a tiny baggy and neatly fold all receipts into it as we go so none get lostdamagedforgotten about they can look up receipts if youve misplaced one but it can take a while and if you paid cash its a lot harder another note is that you can only ship disney items so mitsukoshi in the japan pavilion the china gift shop and a few other epcotdisney springs locations cannot be shipped if they are not disney ownedconsidered disney merch you also cannot ship popcorn buckets or ogas cantina specialty glasses like the rancor flight and i believe trader samsother dining location specialty mugs cannot be shipped either but those are really the only exceptions and nearly everything on property is able to be shipped a final note you always want to believe nothing will happen with your shipped items but in the rare case that something is damagedloststolen during transit if it is out of stock it will be refunded to you rather than replaced so if its something extremely rarehard to get you may want to consider that if youd be devastated if something happened this also means that if you pay in cash you will receive that money back to a gift card whereas debitcredit is back to your original payment method so thats something to think about when planning merch purchases also agreed i went once in 2013 for one ridiculously stressful busy day and twice as a decently young kid so i never experienced some of those nowgone amenities but hey its still awesome and there are still a lot of great benefits to enjoy we love the shiptohome merch service and use it every time it would be amazing if they did the parkstoresorts delivery again and maybe they will one day my understanding is its still a staffing issue but not having it doesnt really bother us much since we never experienced it prior we just plan our merch shopping around runs to the locker and then its a quick ride back to the onproperty resort with our hauls we load it all up on the last day of the trip and take it to the resort gift shop and they ship everything all at once for 3995 and its insured so if it shows up damaged or gets loststolen in transit they will refundreplace depending on stock cant imagine trying to pack everything up in a suitcase and worrying about more fragile items it rocks definitely not has never been free its based on total value of items and caps at a 3995 shipping charge which is why youd be best off waiting to ship all trip merch at once but it is an option for any number of items at most shops on property parks to room is simply not an option now your first point is not accurate as this is no longer available at disney world as far as im aware still has not been brought back or given a timeline for returning only ship to home is available if his mutt and current job come first thats his choice and well within his rights to prioritize what matters to him but that leaves you down the list and if it were me i wouldnt be jumping through hoops and moving to accommodate someone who cant even make me a priority over a fucking dog and scheduling conflicts your family will be there when you break up would you rather be close to them or have to try to move a third time when this doesnt work out if his job is a priority perhaps yours should be too meaning dont quit to run back and accommodate him i guess for me as a diagnosed narcoleptic i dont really see the point in what youre suggesting i suppose if you dont have narcolepsy and the testing there rules it out you can stop pushing for a sleep study in the usdirect your energy elsewhere so in that regard it may be useful but if you do have narcolepsy or ih and the test results will be useless back home for treatmentmedicationa legitimate diagnosis then youve just wasted timemoneyenergy and will no doubt be more frustrated having to continue to push for proper coverage in the us if it were me i would continue to push for a proper sleep study in the us its not impossible to get covered if your doctors genuinely feel it is appropriate and you are genuinely showing symptoms yes you will have to rule a lot of other things out first but thats a good thing and frankly we all had to go through it you are not special in that regard theres no cheat code to jump through the steps a proper diagnosis in the us will be needed to get proper treatment and to have those medications covered some of us were able to begin certain medications like lower doses of stimulants before a completed study and while the process can be long and unpleasant to get the study approvedscheduledcompletedget the results back it is worth it when you consider that it means you will be able to receive lifelong care for these issues it sounds like theres a chance that this sudden onset of symptoms came from something elsemay not be narcolepsy unless im misunderstanding what youre saying i apologize i would continue to explore everything else it could possibly be you dont want to have narcolepsy there are many other things that cause similar symptoms and i would pray that you find the answer in one of them because its truly a crippling life sentence to have this disease if you dont feel your doctor is listening to you fully or you feel they are creating unnecessary barriers to getting a sleep study scheduled and covered i suggest getting a second and third opinion you dont have to stay with a doctor you feel isnt best serving your needs and there are doctors out there who will be more than happy to help you get a study scheduled if you truly seem to be showing the signs i would think that theres definitely a difference when you were a resident of a place and receiving consistent care and monitoring vs somewhere you decided to seek out specifically to motivate a diagnosis as a tourist and there is a huge difference between a short term disability claim and a full valid diagnosis for which you will receive medication and continued insurance coverage i would not assume these situations to be similar whatsoever you definitely need to speak with your insurance first at minimum i would also speak with any doctorsspecialists you plan on seeing for thismedication management i would not be the least bit surprised if they tell you that no testing you receive as a tourist of a foreign
