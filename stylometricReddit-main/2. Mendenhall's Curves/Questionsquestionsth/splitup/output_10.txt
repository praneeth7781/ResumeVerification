would appreciate thisfind it appropriate this wasnt a good move on her part and was more than a little tone deaf the level she took it to she didnt just initiateoffer simple sex she made a whole eventshow out of things was in very poor taste and would definitely upset a lot of people were they in your shoes if she cant see that your upsetting reaction aside i would question her perspective and if we were on the same page on a lot of things that said if she doesnt have much experience with lossgrief or had reason to think this would be a good way to distracthelp you feel better its understandable that she made a bad judgement call but her intentions were goodcoming from a good place and you guys just need to have a chat about boundariesgriefprocessing so similar doesnt happen in the future from personal experience with my partner while something like she did would not have been cool we have processed griefloss by engaging sexuallyintimately in the past when our cat was tragically killed when his grandma passed when i had to clean up my stepdads suicide we didnt make a showy display of seduction out of it but we did have sex the evening of the loss and throughout the first handful of days after more as a way to reconnect with speaking burn some stressfrantic energy and feel a bit of endorphingoodchemicals release in light of the horrible circumstances at hand though her approach again was awful this may have been where she was coming from and what she was hoping to assist with giving you a release no one can blame you for your reaction op no one can blame you for being upset with her feeling it was tone deaf it was and not knowing how to process that on top of what you already have on your plate to mourn and deal with that said if you were namecalling yelling and being harshcruel thats still not okay despite what she may have done you yelling doesnt cancel out her wrong but her wrong doesnt cancel out yours either both sides need an apology and to apologize im not saying i will be returning at night once its dark considering sometimes i am unable to get into the park by 1pm either the 7am virtual queue is my best and only opportunity to grab a boarding group as the 1pm has to be done inside the park and may not be an option again i understand why theyre being strict on it but its pretty upsetting if theyre going to be so strict on it that someone with a legitimate reason for not arriving in the parks earlier but who is obviously not trying to skate around the rules just to ride at night is never going to be able to ride i can also understand the complaints of those who are locals but cannot arrive at the parks until say 5pmafter their work shift but who are allowed to enter the virtual queue at 7 it would be an unfair policy for them as well and im curious to see how they handle those folks longer term it would seem that having a virtual queue that can be entered from anywhere at 7am makes less sense with this now i so deeply hope theyll be accommodating for people in specific circumstances i understand the reasoning here but sometimes you cant just teleport into the park at the time your group is called i have das for a reason and there have been times on past visits when i couldnt get into the park until midlate afternoon no matter what i did as my disability gets in the way constantly 89am is impossible period and im going to be beyond crushed if i manage to get a boarding group but it gets called right away in the first few opening hours and im turned away when i do finally make it in were visiting in midmay for likely the last time due to my illness and tron is most of the reason on my last visit my guardians boarding group was called before the park technically opened but i was accommodated at 5pm when we finally made it in and rushed straight to the ride because it isnt legal here maybe stop looking for a bar where you can break the rules and abide by them like everyone else is supposed to you have my support loved everything i saw on your profile and will be excited to see what you do in the future major talent and skill for sure i could watch this for hours this is incredible i expected to tap your profile and see that you were employed with meow wolf or something this is superior to many of their exhibitions well done im assuming my questions are not appropriate for an individual thread and instead belong here but please point me in the right direction if this is not it x200b i am looking for some help with a dress i own as i dont want to style it poorly or look like a mess wearing it dress and sandals which are mentioned later are located here x200b first off i could really use some help choosing what type and color of slip or undergarment to wear with this i have never wornowned a seethrough dress before the product page describes this as slightly seethrough elastic tulle but as you can see from the photos theres nothing slightly about it its seethrough and dont want to pick the wrong color of slip dress for the patterncolor scheme i am very pale and tan colored items tend to look odd on me but im unsure if white or black would look equally strange especially with bright sunlight shining on the outfit or if im overthinking it too much in the photos provided youll see the model is wearing white panties and presumably a matching bra this is not an option for where ill be wearing this dress it needs to be appropriate and more modest than having my underwearbra visible a cleavagecut so to speak would be fine especially as its under the dress it doesnt need to be a turtleneck but needs slightly more coverage than the photos secondly i have no idea what type of shoes to match with this color schemepattern ive never been great at that black shoes with everything is my unfortunate goto and i dont have much of an eye for what stands out too much i was going to be lazy and just toss on the black sandals with gold accents pictured in my imgur album but im afraid the goldblack clashes with the light colors of the dress what would be a good fit here im open to just about anything with the caveat that they need to be somewhat reasonable for a long day of wear no thin heel no heel over 2 inches platforms are fine but lets keep it 23 inches as well tops ideally something that will allow tights to be worn underneath so no splittoe sandals x200b third what color tights would be appropriate under this i have a lot of distracting leg tattoos including a colorful full leg sleeve so for both appearance and personal comfort i never wear dresses without nylons under and dont wish to start here i want to find something that doesnt clash im assuming anything with a pattern is a no would i want something white or black or just a sheer nylon something twotone i get the feeling black will be too harsh x200b and lastly what color of accessories would you stick with gold jewelry or silver what general range of colors would you stick with for a purse x200b thank you in advance i know this was a lot and i probably sound super silly but i really adore this dress and want to enjoy it and not look back on photos later and go i look like a toddler oops and 30 for a 12 pizza is still outrageous regardless of any of those factors as has been continuously mentioned on this post agreed we did the lounge and it was still insanely overpriced for the overall atmosphere 100 one and done the entire restaurantlounge is tiny which makes it underwhelming even with the space windows which again are sadly very underwhelming though neat the ride updown is cool as is the entry hallway but beyond that the bartender we had was fast attentive and very friendly but kept trying to upsell us on drinks and things in a very nondisney way i know space 220 isnt technically disney run so thats probably why the drinks were fine but overpriced we enjoyed the moon rocks shots they were fun but again insanely overpriced and the lounge food was fast and tasted fine but nothing to write home about a cat isnt going to eat a toddler a cat wont maul a human to death you can feel strongly about people keeping cats inside i agree and acknowledge that theyre dangerous to native animals but they are nowhere near the threat a pit bull is to absolutely everything they arent comparable on any level she cant possibly know its sleep apnea without a test which is all i said the way the op is worded it sounds like the doctor after doing zero testing simply said it isnt narcolepsy its sleep apnea something she cant possibly know or conclude without further testing that she probably isnt even capable of doing herself and would need to further refer op out for anytime you feel outright dismissed by a doctor and as though they havent listened at all it is perfectly reasonable and your best plan of action to seek a second opinion elsewhere theres a different kind of feeling to the whole arrangement given that its a medical scenario but a doctor is no different than a mechanic hairdresser etc in that you are hiring them so to speak to address your concerns and needs you wouldnt keep going to a mechanic who blatantly ignores that your headlight is out and tells you its not a big deal just like you wouldnt keep going back to a hairdresser who dyes your hair green when you asked for a trim you have valid legitimate woes that you want to seek help for be that testing a diagnosis treatment a referral to a specialist etc and if this doctor wont take them seriously and help you pursue them move on get a second andor third opinion and go from there ultimately in the end it could be nothing im not saying that it is or that you should feel like it might be dont take this the wrong way but the only way for you and your medical care team to know that is through exploring all the possibilities testing a sleep study possible referral to a specialists possible medicationtreatment plans etc a doctor who hears your legitimate concerns about problems that are legitimately causing you discomfort and distress and goes lol its nothing or its even though we have done zero testing or exploration to determine a cause is not a good doctor period im assuming you havent had any testing done for sleep apnea correct me if im wrong thats just the assumption im making based on the wording of your post how exactly did this doctor come to that conclusion without running any tests if she believes that to be true why would she not be pursuing treatment for that any doctor that refers to my legitimate distressing symptoms as scary bumps in the night is not only a piece of shit i would never see again but is a doctor i would be complaining about to the right departmentsentities like you said no
