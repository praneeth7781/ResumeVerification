in hell youd catch me on it or a bus now granted due to disabilities neither is an option for me anymore for a variety of reasons but even if they were i was hassled attacked threatened and screamed at enough on both during prepandemic years now if the behaviors the unhinged display on the street are any indication of what i can expect in an enclosed space fuck no they seem to be doing this kind of thing at a lot of their locations and i agree its so unpleasant and adds such additional hassle that it completely puts me off shopping there the mall 205 target had damn near everything in the electronics department not just wrapped in an alarm device but physically chained to the shelves in addition to that of course not a single employee to be found anywhere and after walking the entire top floor and finally finding someone who upon asking had no idea if id ever be helped i think they all left 10 minutes ago or uh someone should be out in 5 minutes yeah i dunno i ended up standing there for 10 more minutes only to have someone finally come out and act like i was ruining their entire life asking to have the item removed from its shackles so i could purchase it if it hadnt have been a necessity i needed quickly i wouldve bailed on the entire experience but surely wont be doing so again its a shame this is what things have come to with all the unmanaged theft in this city wouldnt be surprised if plexiglass barriers in fast foodpizza places started becoming the norm too like in other places ive lived ive been looking into the ricoma leasing program youre referencing for similar reasons 135 a month seems like an excellent deal when you consider youre getting a multineedle machine plus the digitizing side of things there arent exactly a plethora of companies out there offering a bundle like that and it makes it a lot more reasonable and accessible for those of us who dont have the privilege of thousands of dollars up front to throw into a pro machine and digitizing software i think something big to consider is what your goals are and whether or not signing onto something like this is going to be the best route to achieving them while also being a sound idea financially if you are just looking for a minor side hustle or to practice and maintain a mostly hobbyist level i dont know that this would be the route to gogetting a hobby machine and a mediumtier digitizing software and starting to devote time and energy to practicing with that while maybe selling some custom things as you improve but keeping things on a small scale would definitely be more advisable if youre not trying to start a business or really invest the kind of time money and energy that starting down the path of leasing a big machine like this would warrant if you think youre ready to devote that time money and energy into really going full force ahead with machine embroidery and you see yourself really working at developing a brand or a shopbusiness then by all means this isnt a bad route to start investigating further and potentially moving forward with the easier to uselearn programs like hatch are a solid 1000 right off the bat and thats without a decent machine hobbyist machines really arent practical for anything more than very small scale etsy shops with very low sales volume and if you already know you want to move forward on a larger scale it might make more sense to invest that money into a leased multineedle machinepricier digitizing software so you can really dive in big right at the start this kind of thing also has a lot to do with your personal financesfinancial ability clearly 135 a month isnt out of the question for you since youre here asking but you have to also factor in materials utility cost and the cost of the time youd need to put in to see that money being worth investing if you have a full time job already for example and dont often have an abundance of free time you will have to work a lot harder to make up for that 135 plus materialsother costs than someone who pursues this as a full time selfemployed path all of the above points are of course assuming youre even looking to get into selling your designscustom things and arent just primarily doing this for yourselffriendsfamilyvery small scale if you dont have any interest on generating income from machine embroidery however big or small those income goals would be then all it really comes down to is whether or not 135 a month before materialsutilities for a personal hobbyinterest is practical and worth it to you i cant personally speak to the quality of a ricoma machine i have used their software to digitize a couple times was lucky enough to have a friend with the software and tried it a few times at their home and i loved it personally i have used about 5 30 day trials of hatch and produced hundreds of designs in those trial periods and i can say that i absolutely liked ricomas software better and found it much nicer to use with a lot better design results for a lot less effort i am by no means an expert digitizer so found it really easy to understand and learn as someone with an intermediate level of digitizing knowledgeskill i have watched a ton of videos about their machines on youtube and while its obvious there are a lot of paid reviewers pumping up the companymachines with positive reviews i can also see from these videos that the machines do a perfectly fine good job of stitching out designs the machines do produce quality outcomes and thats whats important to me are they the best company around with the best machines no probably notare there issues with the company reps and machines i have no doubtsbut as someone who otherwise would not be able to afford to have access to a multineedle machine and nice digitizing software and begin to really get more serious with machine embroidery i think that their program has a lot of benefits and would be perfectly suitable for my needs and for producing the kinds of things i want to createwhereas my hobbyist level brother machine certainly cannot a lot of people come to threads like this one and go its a rip off and look for a used higher end brand or finance or save up for that is not a possibility for everyone and for those of us that lack the financial privilege some of these commenters have the ricoma plan is a potentially beneficial option to have access to a better machine software and to be able to advance with machine embroidery and other personal goals only you will know what youre able to do and what is feasible for you and its important to do what you need to for yourself that is within you ability and affordable to you even if it isnt the best machine on earth if its a stepping stone to advancing having more resources to later upgrade etc id say its worth it their reps have been great to talk to so far and while im unsure if i will take the plunge it has certainly not been a waste of time to look into best of luck with whatever you decide and wherever your machine embroidery path takes you im probably missing something obvious or misunderstanding what youre referring to specifically but what does propranolol have in common with stimulants here forgive me if im connecting your comment to the wrong one by mistake on mobile it appears your response is in reply to depends on how much of the stimulants their surgical partners prescribe them they took the refusal to take side effects seriously or acknowledge that they may outweigh benefits is pretty baffling when i was requesting medication to help with fallingstaying asleep after an extremely traumatic event had to clean up my stepfathers gruesome suicide aftermath solo bare hands and watch my mom care for his living corpse on machines for a week for organ harvesting with a pretty poorly covered head wound i made it very clear that though i was experiencing ptsd and anxietypanic related to that though almost entirely at bedtimeovernight i was not interested in antidepressants and only wanted a temporary sleep aide i had multiple primary care doctors try to push them anyway trying to convince me that i must be anxiousdepressed all the time and not just at night or that my problems could only be solved with ssris not a sleeprelated medication i explained my disinterest and cited the extremely common and awful side effects as one of many reasons and got some of the most ridiculous responses well if you care about your wellbeing badly enough dealing with is a pretty manageable trade off to not be crippled by anxietydepression anymore i literally said i am unwilling to risk for example destroying my sex life sexual enjoyment and sexual drive for a medication well when youre really suffering sex is usually not really important in comparison to fixing the issue are you kidding me sure let me destroy my sex life with my partner and zap all physical enjoyment and pleasure out of my life that wont have immeasurable consequences in my relationship or cause me more depression this is the only explanation needed frankly it doesnt matter whatwho you arent attracted to that cant be helped no one should be trying to persuade you or change your mind you like what you like and for the most part those things arent changeablea conscious choice what matters is if it stays a personal preference or if it becomes a personal belief that youre trying to put on others or use to demean others like you said im personally not attracted to is fine developing that into all are unattractive crossed the line i feel like the openness behind it comes into play too for instance thinkingsaying im personally not attracted to black women but if i did meet one and found myself drawn to her attracted to her and wanting to date her that wouldnt be a problem for me though it hasnt happened up to this point vs i dont find black women attractive and would absolutely not date one for any reason regardless of who they are im confident i will never find a single attractive one out there exactly how it should be were all adults here lets act like it clearly your child is having intimate relations with their romantic relationship partner you dont have to share sex stories and get raunchy with them nor they with you but parents who act offended or disgusted or possessive over their adult child having sex are juvenile and frankly pathetic my partners parents are the perfect balance in this area it was never even a question of if i would be sleeping in the same roombed as him when we have visited them it was a given no we arent married for context theyve never made any uncomfortable comments or questioned us about anything sexualour sex lives but on the infrequent occasion a sexual story or joke comes up or some form of media leans sexual we all chuckle maybe drop a goofy one liner or joke of our own and move on there is a clear but unspoken were the parents there is a level of appropriateness vibe to things but its never stiff strict or overreaching and we both feel respected as adults in an adult relationship there isnt a vibe of infantilizing him me our
