live my life to the fullest and leave my loved ones with good memories to reflect on when i am gone im not going to try to put a happy spin on someone having an emergency like this at disney but at the very least there are worse places to have an emergencygo if it were me i would choose to imagine that he pulled through disney is very on top of emergencies in the parks and theres no doubt in my mind he received the fastest best care available and that those with him were cared for and given every courtesy possible to make it through the scary event while you could possibly reach out to guest services especially if youre still on propertywill be tomorrow and explain what happened and ask for some comfort or information i highly doubt they would tell you or be allowed to tell you if he had indeed passedwhat the actual outcome was however knowing disney they will do everything they can to comfort you and try to put you in a better mindset about the event its worth reaching out for that peace of mind even if theyre limited in what info theyre allowed to share please be kind to yourself and try not to dwell on what you saw the worst thing you can do for yourself in a situation like this is ruminate on these thoughts or try to replay the scene in your head instead take deep breaths try to distract yourself with positive memories from the day get some rest and try to shift this negative energy into positive by focusing on your loved ones and the wonderful place you are in and make more happy memories together tomorrow best wishes to you ah yes just spend the crazy amount it costs to move out of state and come to portland a place youre completely unfamiliar with where the cost of living sucks housing inventory is a mess and the city seriously sucks perfect solution when youre already broke if you dont think massive corporations who make money off each guest having the best experience possible want to be able to fit as many guests of as many sizes as possible on their rides i dont know what to tell you theyre doing the best they can with what is physically possible and safe do we not recall recent news of a very large individual dying on a ride he never shouldve been on due to safety standards just because it doesnt agree with your views doesnt mean safety standards arent real this is ridiculous disney as a business is motivated to give the best experience to as many guests as possible so they keep spending money not being able to fit on rides doesnt achieve this if it was possible theyd do it in fact there are very very few rides at disney again for example that large people cant fit on a local carnival doesnt have the funding nor resources that a company like disney does and will have more limitations as a result this again is a no brainer your lack of logic doesnt trump facts sorry safety standards arent inclusive enough for your liking but that doesnt mean there isnt a reason for them or companies just arent trying hard enough and to think otherwise is childish and delusional disney is an example someone else mentioned them as an example as well if disney one of the largest companies on earth with amusement park rides has limitations for weight and size due to ride safety despite wanting to serve the most guests as possible you better believe small carnivals like this one have the same if not more limitations given scale and budget think of how much better the world could be if people accepted that not everything is judgmental or not inclusive enough and that in reality there are limitations and safety regulations and just because you dont like them doesnt mean they arent real and necessary as if places like disney wouldnt want to be able to fit the most paying guests possible given the limitations of engineering for their rides to operate safely its not about judging peoples bodies you people are delusional ahh yes safety regulation how dare they inclusivity is waaaay more important 100 agree all the mentalemotional baggage i feel i need to now carry good grief op seriously seek therapy youd think he just told you something criminal the way youre acting you have some serious insecurities you need to address and none of them are on him or about his actions its all internal with you the man has had sex before oh no but wait so have you it doesnt matter how many partners anyone has had their value as a partner hasnt changed and it doesnt mean they cant value a current relationship just as strong as someone with less experience this is such a judgmental close minded childish mindset to have if hes been a great partner for 8 months up to this point what difference does things in the past make to that he hasnt cheated on you hes still the same person he was before you knew if he still wanted to be out there having those same types of encounters i promise you he would he determined it wasnt for him and he values you and your dynamic which is why hes in a relationship with you now if your sexual boundaries are that you will only pursue a relationship with someone who has remained sexually sheltered and pure enough by your standards thats fine its your right to set whatever standards you want for a partner however based in insecurity they may be and if thats the case for you then yes you need to break up and pursue someone who has kept to themselves enough to meet your ideals but dont make it about him or what hes done its 100 about you and your close minded views on past sexual encounters if that makes you incompatible it is what it is but he didnt do anything wrong the older you get youre going to find that men youre dating have gasp had sex with other women probably a good number of them and explored a bit along the way its part of life and youre going to be hard pressed to find men as you approach your 30s who have hardly been with anyone unless you seek out very religious partners but they probably wouldnt accept your sexual explorations so just because someone has a lot of sex doesnt mean they dont value it or seek connection through it or any of that it doesnt mean they cant be monogamous either your own insecurities are blowing this out of proportion and assigning meaning to something where it isnt hes had a lot of sex all that means is hes had a lot of sex if hes a good man and respects you and loves you thats whats important i highly suggest you seek therapy most people dont jump from my partner of 8 months has revealed their normal sexually active past to me to this is heavy baggage and im breaking down and feeling sick and this means he cant value sex at all and is incapable of monogamy their email address usually is quick to respond i would write in with your reference number and other info and ask for the tracking number which they can give you alongside an estimated arrival date mychoice is easy and free to set up as well if youre worried about it my area is a package theft hub so i always have to be on top of it sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt it worked for me searching via reference number in july 2020 it hasnt worked since and ive shipped from the parks maybe 8 times since ive had to either callemail or use ups mychoice every time if you go to tracking on upscom it should have a track by reference number in blue and underlined below the tracking box if it doesnt work youll need to reach out to them or sign up for mychoice easy and free and then youll get an email and itll show on your account dashboard when it ships and is scheduled for delivery you said it isnt disney so did it ship from a ds shop or mitsukoshi or did you ship it via disney did they give you one of those forms with a reference number and disney merchandising contact info in the upper left or was it something else if you shipped it with mitsukoshi there should be a tracking number somewhere on the receipt or form they gave you if not reach out to them via email and ask for tracking if it was disney you dont get a tracking number unless you call them or email them and ask but if you have ups mychoice or sign up for it with the addressnameemail you gave them ups will automatically email you when the package ships and let you know when its coming if it was on disney property its with disney even if they arent directly running the merchandising they surely arent allowing a store to run in disney springs or epcot that is ripping off customers this is a no brainer im assuming youre talking about mitsukoshi which again is a legitimate business that disney ensures isnt scamming customers out of their parks pavilion and which has a legitimate customer service websiteemailcontact ive had countless things shipped by them with no issues and they replaced our swords at no cost in rapid time when something was damaged by ups then literally why would you purchase in the first place if youre just going to assume its a scam and wont ship and i doubt youve had this experience with disney because they definitely always ship and their merchandising department is beyond on top of things and helpful and what has given you any indication that that couldve possibly happened why on earth would buying an item from the park and paying to ship it home something people do daily if not hourly there make you think youve been ripped off this is such an unnecessarily accusatory post for a simple legitimate business transaction and you have zero reason to believe anything suspicious has happened man must be nice mushrooms make me abundantly more aware of just how terrible my health is nothing breaks through the severity of my narcolepsy it 100 is so many options and all of them knock dlr out of the park yeah its very much a luck thing ive never once gotten sick at disney even visiting during the more pandemicy times and cant think of a time ive gotten sick from travel anywhere for that matter my immune system is terrible i generally get sick frequently throughout the year to varying degrees but always at home when im doing littlenothing and i have severe disabilities including one that compromises my immune system was on a direct flight from the west coast two rows away from a child with the most disgusting sounding cough of all time over a week ago still fine now its impossible to predict who will get sick or why and frankly i dont worry about it when you spend your entire life disabled and exhausted 247 its easier to accept that you cant control things and just take it as it comes instead of wasting what little enjoyable time you have worrying which isnt to say that i dont wash my hands or anything i do maintain regular hygiene habits but im long done with masking i dont sanitize constantly and im not trying to create a bubble around me in public or panicking when others seem unclean in my vicinity the whole everything
