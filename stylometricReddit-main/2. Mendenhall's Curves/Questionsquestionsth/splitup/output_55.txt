be seen as more tired or more exhausted from doing more is pathetic and obnoxious but as you say if it were a competition people without narcolepsy wouldnt even begin to stack up people really dont want to hear that though and it seldom changes their views or mind theyre still going well a single mom with 4 young kids is still way more tired than you or well im a nurse and with my hours i promise you dont even know what tired is nope point still stands people can only really relate by comparing what they know tiredexhaustion to be they have no idea what narcolepsy feels like or does to a person and the symptoms that come alongside the exhaustion so cant fathom that its possible to feel this bad i wish there was a simulator we could put people in i highly recommend getting a second opinionfinding another doctor if at all possible that is not the legally binding max dose anywhere in the us he is likely saying its the max dose he prescribes or the max dose for you with him but its clearly not enough for you and by no means is your only option 40mg is the adhd max around 60mg for narcolepsy you absolutely could take a booster or higher dose and a great many of us do i take close to 60mg all ir all at my leisure throughout the day i literally started on 10mg and it was nothing so was gradually brought up over time if you can definitely seek out another doctor i understand the fear since its a controlled substance but his word isnt law and if you arent getting the care and treatment you need fuck him find you a good doctor the 30 day supply90 day appointment thing is the case in many stateswith many insurance companies i can only have a 30 day supply at a time but my prescription is mailed to me every month and i havent had an appointment to check up on it in over a year from my understanding its at the requirement of both your insurance and doctor how often you have to come in to get more prescriptions written but 30 day supply limit is standard everywhere in the us the max dose thing is separate from this and 20mg is way lower period do dogs live anywhere near you do people walk their dogs anywhere near you cars do cars exist in your vicinity if yes you have predators there that can and may easily kill them if sorry when they get out my well behaved since you seem to think that makes a difference indoor cat who wanted nothing to do with the outdoors for almost 3 years bolted outside when startled when i was coming in with groceries literally had to push past me and squeeze through because i barely had the door open at all and was carefully sliding in he always would sit and stretch and meow hello when i got home never even sniffed around a door i never wouldve expected this this was june and it still hurts every day i searched for him tirelessly for 3 days literally didnt sleep he was mauled to death by a pit bull four houses down the bitch that owned the hellhound fled the scene and didnt even stay to see if he survived my neighbor who witnessed the attack and who had my number from lost fliers i immediately started putting up called me and i flew down the street to her backyard he took his last breath next to me while i sobbed and screamed uncontrollably i live in a dense nice neighborhood you wouldnt think theres many predators but dogs exist and theyre everywhere you dont think itll happen to you but it can anytime a cat gets loose theres predators everywhere for cats that are frantic and out of their element cats are hit by cars way too often over here and it kills me every time i hear about it on nextdoor outdoor or strayferal cats raccoons coyotes theyre in more places than youd think certain birds diseases shitty humans its absolutely an issue where you are and frankly why would you take the risk put a damn roof on the thing for the piece of mind and safety of your cats its a nobrainer and then you dont have to worry about it you already put this much effort into building the thing finish it properly your doctor said 20mg is the max dose or the max dose for you out of curiosity because it definitely isnt the max dose prescribeable on the flip side 10mg is pretty low for a great deal of us id be useless on that tiny dose op has been taking adderall for 10 years it sounds like its hard to tell from their wording exactly how long theyve been on it but a diagnosis over a decade ago leaves me to assume stimulants have been involved that long or close to it a dose that high or near it isnt unreasonable especially given tolerance many people who take xr take an ir booster for many reasons ir allows you to choose when you need that extra boost depending on your schedule and other life factors for a lot of people with narcolepsy and adhd as well for that matter find that xr does not work or last anywhere near 12 hours especially after prolonged use not saying op couldnt use to switch up their meds or play with changing the dose but i dont think anything in their post seems wildly out of the ordinary aside from their energy levels which quite frankly could just be a result of worsening narcolepsy as i know im not alone in finding that it has gotten progressively worse over the years maybe because its extremely expensive often doesnt cover a whole lot unless youre paying for the reeeeeally expensive plans and still has crippling deductibles dental care and dental insurance are abhorrently overpriced and inaccessible for many its not a why dont you just purchase when so many cant even get close to affording it i will say from experience lip gets to be a pain to reapply all day and if youre eatingdrinking frequently or tend to purse your lips a lot in the heat or need frequent chapstick it tends to get messy even with the best makeup the dots will be easier to keep neat and likely last longer if thats the route you go have a great visit im sure youll look awesome no matter what you go with i went to the may 4th after hours event at west and ended up doing just the lip makeup when i added the dots i personally felt it looked a bit too padme even though the rest of my costume was sith themed and i didnt do my hair like her i think its just such an iconic look that thats instantly where the mind goes but that doesnt mean the rest of the outfit wont stand out or itll be too close just that you cant really do the same makeup without thinking of the original character that wore it i think it just depends on your overall look how are you doing your hair what other costume pieces are you wearing as to if it looks too similar or not but it sounds like if youre trying for a naboo tourist look even if it does look too padme that isnt a bad thing because a tourist might wear something on purpose to give that kind of nod otherwise i agree that ditching the dots or moving the dots temples along the forehead near the lips would be a way to keep them but avoid being too similar to padme agreed and ive seen quite a few posts randomly while scrolling my front page sharing this sentiment so it isnt just youus i only need one more so im hopeful that ill get it in the next before the goals end but its been a slow crawl in comparison to the other tasks a few of my friends market boxes have stacks of 10 possibly multiple stacks so some people are getting them but the rng does seem a lot worse than the other goals weve had recently i hope youre able to get them in time if the rng is going to be this bad they should at least allow for market box purchases to count at least adds a little extra chance hello uakashictruth thanks for your

myremovedsubmissionmessageimwritingtoyouaboutthefollowingsubmission 0d0dmyissueis direct replies to official mod comments will most likely be ignored i dont want to taste my own vaginal fluids and find the thought of going down on a woman absolutely repulsive but i still enjoy receiving oral from my male partner i would never make him do it and have expressed many times that if he isnt into it he doesnt have to do it and i would never have an issue with that likewise he doesnt want to taste his own semen but is happy that i enjoy swallowing your ultimatum is really pointless and this outlook is incredibly immature i doubt most dudes are demanding that you act like its the best taste on earth if they are thats an issue specific to those partners most men enjoy the sensation and experience but certainly understand it isnt the most enjoyable for some women and are just happy with whatever youre comfortable with so long as its fulfilling their needs just like you have clearly indicated you expect in return i just wanted to chime in and say that while i have not had a hysterectomy myself your feelings regarding maid are valid and if thats the route you want to go i hope you are able to do so and find peace all the comments acting like youre ridiculous for not wanting to go through this process because its relatively safe and theyve had decent quality of life seem to miss the fact that its your choice and not everyone wants to endure these things and struggle through all the steps necessary to recover or gain any decent quality of life afterwards ive been severely chronically ill my entire life im exhausted 247 there are definitely some things i would not be willing to go through at this point regardless of the small potential benefits ending up in surgically induced menopause is definitely one of those things ive seen how that played out for my grandmother and mother and it was a nightmare and i would lose the last bits of comfort i have in this life to that ordeal i am not willing to sacrifice my sex life put my sexual setup at risk or endure the awful bullshit that is menopause when im already struggling to be present in 1 of my life as is given all the extra risks and factors for you i just wanted to validate your concerns and say that no matter what you decide youre not wrong in doing what you feel is right for you even if other people would choose differently its not just stds you need to worry about here vaginal infections like yeast
