it just seems way out of my ability financially even with as bad as portland has gotten too if youre on medicaid your options will likely be limited by the medicaid policiesoptions in any given state i live in oregon and i fucking hate this pitiful slice of hell but i dont foresee myself ever being able to move because i rely on oregon health plan our medicaid and food stamps etc when moving out of state your eligibility will change the coverage of the program will change and youre going to have to find all new doctors and hope they have availability provide a good quality of care will prescribe the same medications so you dont have to go through a hellish adjustment period etc in a lot of places i wouldnt bank on that being an easy transition if even possible at all then you factor in new cost of living transportation issues a lot of places in the south for example are not so easy to get aroundnavigate anywhere that doesnt get very cold in the winter is going to cost you that much more and hopefully you like 110 degrees all summer community doesnt just exist for you because you show up somewhere and place the responsibility on them to come together and take care of your needs a religious organization or tight community group existing somewhere prior to you moving does not mean they will accept you with open arms and take care of you in the ways you are seeking in order to find these types of community groups you often need to be very active in them have a lot to providebring to the table yourself and fit in swimmingly with the types of personalities in the group not be overly needy or negative etc this isnt easy and its why a lot of people dont have that community feeling around them it can take years in one place to find a group anything remotely close to what youre describing and again you need to bring a lot to the table from the start to really integrate into a close community and establish yourself to where they are rushing to your aid there are religious organizations and community groups in denver that operate the way youre describing why you arent finding yourself included in those groups is anyones guess but its not denvers fault so to speak and will likely happen to your everywhere until all the right variables come together at the right time for you to find that spot you fit with a group you enjoy this isnt to get you down or be negative just some perspective in portlandseattle the pacific northwest freezeseattle freeze is a big thing people arent very friendly theyre passive aggressive its really hard to find friendsa community group and yet many have that close community here because they did the work found a spot they fit in and it just all fell into place on the flipside many dont and its very isolating for a lot of us i have lived in over 15 cities across the us there are some more enjoyable than others some where people are friendlier on the surface people are more bubbly in the south than they are in the pacific northwest but that doesnt mean theyre genuinely nicefriendly people or people you want to be in a group with but the only factor you can control in any given place is yourself if you want a solid support group its going to take time no one wants a deadweight or a negativenancy not saying you are one please dont take this the wrong way so people are generally attracted to positive upbeat selfsufficient folks who seem like they will bring good energy to a gathering and who will contribute instead of constantly needing i know how hard that is when youre disabled im a 247 rain cloud i cant help it but doing your best to develop those qualities to the best of your ability and bringing that to groups of similar people who will understand where youre at better a support group for people with disabilities for example vs a church group with people of all agesdemographics who may not take to youunderstand where youre coming from is a good place to start amazing im so glad thats an option i know a ton of people are coming out with negative reviews of tron but im a lifelong tron fan and will just be happy to get to ride it even if it isnt the long immersive experience people would prefer from the ride so excited thank you warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info thank you so much ill be eligible for the extra hours at epcot and magic kingdom next month so wanted to know if it was wise to plan for the morning queue and potentially riding it a second time in the evening since im only doing one day at both thats great to hear does the extended evening hours queue work the same as the 7am and 1pm ive not encountered it yet ive done the evening hours but not in a park with a virtual queue so far and dont see much posted about it im guessing if you get the normal queue in the morning and have already had your group called you cant then enter the evening hours queue or does it provide the opportunity to ride twice that day potentially yep op sounds fucking awful stereotypical have you tried to dietexercisework hardereat betterstop being depressed bullshit from someone who doesnt really want their partner to improve their symptoms and difficult health woes but just wants the person to getbe better in ways that are more convenient and appealing to them wow op you mean your constant insistence that she exercise and motivate to your liking buying her a gym membershipequipment when shes trying to battle depression and a new and scary health diagnosis and having zero understanding of mental health issues isnt causing her to jump enthusiastically onto your dick color me surprised if you feel compelled to do so you could reach out more directly via email or perhaps a message on social media to see where to direct a more personalized indepth cast compliment i kind of dislike the inapp cast compliments and was disappointed with the feature when they rolled it out theres no way to personalize them or go into any detail and maybe thats because thats what disney wants but i feel like leaving a general they did good thats the same for all cast doesnt give them the full recognition they deserve when they go above and beyond to levels like in your post im so sorry to hear about your father in law and i hope you and your family are able to grieve and heal together peacefully this will no doubt be a wonderful memory your kids carry with them for the rest of their lives both because of you and because of the amazing magic of the cast members id add to this that things usually dont work out when you move backwards from living together to starting over dating and it can be difficulttoimpossible to reframe the phase of the relationship both in the short term and long term setting new boundaries and adjusting when you take a step back can be difficult and something that causes a lot of fighting when youre already fighting this much things are unlikely to survive agreed this could easily be the case for ops partner only way to figure it out is to sit down and have a specific discussion about it and how it makes him feel and what her thoughts are i will often be scrolling my phone aimlessly or cleaning or doing something with my hands when my partner is talking to me im listening actively i respond when it warrants it and i engage actively and my partner doesnt take offense because im an active participant even if im not sitting there still staring at him doing nothing else i have adhd and narcolepsy i will fall asleep or completely zone out if im just sitting and looking at someone while trying to listen i have to multitask to stay focused on them ups will charge you to change the delivery location even to a neighbors house or a different location than your damn porch sometimes and to change the delivery date but they wont do this unprompted wont reach out to you and ask you to pay for it and you have to go in and request to make those changes yourself on their website via your tracking people dont want to be fired especially when cost of living and inflation are so bad right now and getting worse all the time that people are living in a lot more desperate situations than ever before the employees that want to tell these nutters to leave know that their boss will not stand up for them when karen and her stinky mutt go to management claim it was a service dog etc the customers are always right mentality is still very present in a lot of workplaces and its not worth the risk dog owners are the worst kind of entitled and you know they arent just going to go okay fine and leave when a minimum wage employee tells them to leave people dont want to be accosted by customers or their stinky ass dogs 9 times out of 10 when i see a dog in public its a fucking piece of shit pit bull and quite frankly i wouldnt approach the owner either no one gets paid enough to have one of these nutjobs go off on them and potentially have their dog follow trend theres so few consequences when a dog attacks that these owners arent that concerned with the outcome if pissfingers were to pop off at the kroger a large amount of employees are dog nutters themselves and dont want the dogs to leave despite it being illegal or they know their coworkers are and will gang up on them or their boss is a nutter or has said dont confront the nutters for one reason or another the real problem is that there is no enforcement of these laws by a more powerful entity than a minimum wage employee or their boss nutterrunowned businesses get away with it because there are no consequences some of these places even encourage dogs even though they legally arent permitted to be in the business nutters get away with it because theyre the loudest most entitled most unhinged group so while the right thing to do is say get out its the law its often not worth the fallout in many places it isnt legal in many places dogs are not allowed in grocery stores or places where food is served the ownersemployees disregard these things because theyre either dog nutters themselves or they dont want to deal with the entitled mob that is dogpeople if only it worked that way the problem would almost certainly follow stimulant medications also used for narcolepsy are very different from street meth dont compare the two something that is universally true for disabilities of all kinds visible and invisible across all ages groups is that people are fucking rude and absolutely awful it doesnt make it feel any better but know youre not alone and weve all dealt with it and deal with it in some way all the time i am not a wheelchair user right now but regardless one thing that has helped me to better process the lookscomments is to just really call it what it is in my head i will go wow this ableist judgmental piece of trash
