enough sleep etc will help you in all parts of life not just with libido cant be of more help beyond that as im not a dude but hopefully someone else can get deeper with it for you it 100 is and boy am i sick of people who try to reframe it as though its not that bad or could be worse its absolutely horrible debilitating exhausting depressing and absolutely steals your life from you in many many ways and to add to this how can you expect someone to have sex with you be satisfied with it and enjoy it at all when youre repulsed by yourself are completely shut off sexually and have no desire to have an open mind or work to please your partner op is very me me me i want a man who is satisfied by the admittedly extremely boring and limited range of things i want to do never anything more which is unreasonably selfish a partnership is just that you may have boundaries and hard limits but how can you expect a partner to be down with the things you want if youll never do the same for them op desperately needs therapy desperately to overcome the selfdefeating insecure selfloathing body imagethoughts about herself and to work to having a more open mind in relationships and towards sex i know therapy isnt an option for everyone but there are like you said so many books and other resources to help and guide through this op youll be amazed how different relationships feel and work when you value and love yourself are comfortable with your body are open to a mutually satisfying and open minded relationship sexually and otherwise and are no longer at odds with yourself and others sexually found it im out of town in bend for a wedding but am driving back in the afternoon and will be home around 9pm as soon as im back ill dm you a photo of the machine and some info so you know

accounts to get around post removals and continue with spamming a removed post will also result in a ban im so sorry youre feeling this but know you arent alone many of us can relate myself included its very isolating no one can possibly understand what this disease is like who doesnt have nih period there are people who will try to relate but can never relate on any level stronger than oh yeah ive been really tired when i which just isnt it not that i dont appreciate that theyre trying to relate its just not the same then theres the people who feel like youre being lazy overdramatic etc because ive been really tired before and i was fine theres so many people like that and its awful my partner is amazing and im so grateful for him but i wish he could understand fully what its like hes always understanding and patient but i know he doesnt truly get why i cant do certain things why i feel the way i do a lot and what its like to be truly exhausted i would never want him to go through it and he never makes me feel bad for it but i often wonder what he really thinks about it all since he doesnt truly know its hard to relate to people in general because most dont know anything about narcolepsy or only know the completely inaccurate stereotypes so trying to explain that you have a severe disability and can never feel rested and start your day 100 points behind everyone else often requires endless explaining and justifying or falls on deaf ears lonely as fuck for real just know there are others out there suffering through the same horrible disease who feel the same pains and frustrations and who feel for you it sucks that those close to you cant always relate on that level or be as supportive but you arent fully alone i hope things improve for you my partner and i have been together over 6 years we have sex super frequently still every other week we set aside an entire day to do nothing but fuck we set the downstairs up with lots of fun mood lighting have playlists made watch sexy videos weve shot and go at it for literally 24 hours sometimes well drink mushroom tea which helps sustain that length too we get extremely kinky and wild anytime we have sex its always exciting always super sexually charged and horny and we both tease each other sexually a lot outside of sex were highly sexual people talk about sex a lot as a topic not just about sex between us and are very sexually open with each other im pretty constantly horny and have a super high sex drive theres nothing wrong with this it doesnt have any negative impacts on our relationship and if anything makes it stronger and more fun since our intimate life is healthy and satisfying but we also talk to each other about other things do other activities and are fine if we arent doing something sexual we discuss issues we work through fights or stressful situations and emotions and dont put off important things indefinitely just to fuck theres nothing wrong with being super horny when you guys are together sex is a needed and healthy part of any relationship you should be horny for and around your partner especially this early in the relationship but if youre never talking about anything never working through problems or stress and dont do anything or talk about anything its just sex thats not a relationship thats closer to a friends with benefits arrangement you both have to decide where your needs are at and what your goals are for the relationship youre young and barely see each other its okay to just be about sex but if youre looking for something more deep and connected on a level that isnt purely sexual you both need to prioritize that and make time to talk about those things the fact that shes an adult in college and has a curfew doesnt lend itself well to an adult relationship either ive also worked in vegas on fremont you have to tune out a lot of shit and focus on your main responsibilities to exist in that type of space on a consistent basis and do your job with the amount of tweakers crazies and just ridiculousness this looks very minor if youre standing farther away from the area and have to be focusing on your job and your place of work expecting employees of another bar or venue to monitor this stage when it isnt their job and notice that this is going on is a bit ridiculous should someone have stepped in absolutely but people need to stop pointing fingers at employees who couldnt have been further from needing to take responsibility for this this has nothing to do with brigading the bar that people keep posting on review sites the stage is not associated with them they have no responsibility to watch it or maintain the area nor assign security for the area people are so quick to brigade and cancel that theyre doing more harm than good fitting you should use a gif of portland where securitycops are also nonexistent the business was supposed to do what exactly this isnt their stage and this isnt their fault yall so ready to brigade you arent even putting your anger in the right place or towards anything worthwhile this is misdirected and does literally nothing yeah the katana item sadly for your house not a handheld or backpack item is really cool customizable in a bunch of colors too dang really it doesnt say one way or another so i assumed wed get more this long of an event period for 3 tickets total is really silly and the rewards were definitely lackluster i was stoked for an actual minigame since the monthly events are so dang repetitive but if its only 3 plays total per person this was weak collar training is both a lot more complicated and a lot more simple than it sounds haha basically just meant get them a collar put it on them get them to wear it full time some cats take to collars right away the younger they are the easier this will be and some really hate it you can google guidestips to get cats used to collars it can be a long and frustrating process with some cats but it is 100 worth it to have the piece of mind of a gpschipped collar if thats something you are willing to invest in and keep on them 247 im telling you when my kitty got out i have never felt more hopeless i knew that he was microchipped and that if someone picked him up wed get a call but there are so many indooroutdoor cats and strays in my neighborhood and so many overgrown yards for cats to hide i didnt think someone would bring him in if we had had a gps collar on him we couldve at least known which block or even which yard to look in that wouldve saved us so much time heartache and frustration i highly recommend it because cats can bolt out at any time and its really helpful to be able to find them yourself if you do get your cat used to a collar i would not take it off them the point is to have it on 247 which is totally humane and can be comfortable if you get a quality collar that fits well so that if they do manage to get out somehow bolt out the door break the screen and jump out etc you can locate them if your cats are still small kittens an airtag is probably a bit too big right now but get them used to a collar anyway so that once theyre a little bigger they can wear one on their collar there are other pet specific gps chipscollars but in my research airtag seemed perfectly accurate and was the most cost effective x200b as for spayneuter get this done asap seriously youll be a lot happier and so will they especially if theyre a male and female pair this cant wait you will end up with kittens if its a cost thing look up spay and save type programs there are low income programs for this and it might take time to get scheduled but its extremely important as for separating them after i would follow your vets recommendations there might be clinicslow income help for vaccines and such too if thats why youve delayed when giving cats liquid medication unless the vet advises otherwise it is always easier for them to ingest it when mixed with a wet food for example the liquid dewormer i give my kittens i squeeze the syringe onto a small portion of wet food and mix it in being careful not to spread the medication into the bowl but instead keeping it concealed on the food dont do this with too much because they wont finish it but give them each their own bowl separately monitoring them one at a time to make sure they eat it all ideally do this when theyre hungry not close to a meal i personally have never trimmed my cats
