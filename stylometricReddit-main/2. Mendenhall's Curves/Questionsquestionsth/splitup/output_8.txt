has so little going on in their empty pathetic head that theyre taking time out of their day to stare at me and size me up they think its okay to openly judge a person with a disability thats disgusting what a pitiful empty life they must have how sad because thats how it is people staring at you being closeminded and judging you for having a disability arent good people theyre scumbags and the lowest of the low as if you dont have enough to deal with having to dodge their shitty attitude too people like that arent worth your time attention or energy it takes a while to get past it but eventually you just stop caring you dont even notice them anymore most of the time shitty people are everywhere and will never go away its part of life for everyone dont let them win by staying home and hiding out these people arent thinking about you after they leave wherever they encountered you and go about their day so dont hold yourself hostage to worrying about encountering them this 100 your mother is a grown ass adult op if she cant be polite and respectful thats her wrong not your wifes for being sensitive when someone is being cruel and shitty you didnt marry your fucking mother you married your wife she is your partner and your other half if you dont have enough respect for her to treat her as a priority just say that stop playing like she had equal hands in something that was 100 caused by your shitty immature mom acting like a petulant child my mom has caused issues in my relationship in the past as such shes not invited to our home its that simple i had no qualms about saying because you cant behave this is off the table for my sanity and the sake of my partner grow a damn pair and be an adult op its this simple skating around the issue is disrespectful to your wife and looking for ways to lie about why they cant stay is only pushing the issue into the future where it will be a much much bigger issue when you run out of lies right and its always an attitude of well she is my mother like hello this is your fucking wife if she doesnt take priority oof thank you so much that does help a lot i really appreciate it i know theres tons of guides out

for half a second and youll find a good majority of us take these medications modafinil and similar medications are useless horseshit for a lot of us with severe narcolepsy just because these medications have been around for a long time doesnt mean theyre older and no longer used theyre still extremely common and some of the only treatment options we have youve been called out for being blatantly wrong and misinformed multiple times here i dont know what youre trying to do here or what you think youre trying to prove but i promise you you dont know better than an actual narcoleptic who is taking these medications ive been on adderall for 15 years for narcolepsy and it was an option before that and still is nothing has changed they still prescribe dexedrine for narcolepsy what are you talking about adderall and ritalin commonly as well vyvanse too magical moments of all kinds happen constantly its what makes disney such a special place my partner and i both adults no kids have had a couple moments similar to this believe it or not we get really into visiting galaxys edge star wars was a huge part of both of our childhoods and we are huge fans as adults and put a lot of effort into our swthemed outfits to visit that part of the park since they have much looser costume rules there than the rest of the parks one visit a photopass cast member cleared the entire area in front of the ship where kylo ren and his troopers come out and took photos of us when the characters came out keeping other guests from walking in the shot and allowing us some oneonone interaction with them another chewbacca came out with a handler and they came straight for us to say hello to my plush grogu i was carrying give us hugs and take photos cast let other guests meet him after of course but we were so shocked that they held other guests offaway until our interaction was done in those types of magical moments you completely forget that youre an adult at a theme park its just pure worryfree simple joy it takes me back to being a kid visiting disneyland with my family some of the only really great memories of my childhood that i have she will remember this for the rest of her life im sure thank you for sharing these stories remind me why i love disney parks and cast so much i hope you left them cast compliments too hes 19 unqualified and asking reddit how to manage hed going to bullshit his employees who i feel bad for because this is a terrible management situation to be working under youre not going to get your symptoms treated without a diagnosis thats how it works they have to figure out what your symptoms are caused by and diagnose it to proceed with proper treatment you may be able to get some form of medication beforehand if you explain your symptoms to them and how theyre disrupting your life but not all doctors will do this and you run the risk of being taken off those meds if you arent given a diagnosis that lines up with those meds and depending on what they are youd have to stop taking them for 2 weeks for the sleep study anyway you are not special in this regard everyone had to wait some amount of time everyone had to have testing done everyone had to receive a diagnosis of the actual disorder before being treated for it in many cases people wait a year or more for this process to conclude thats just how it goes yes its frustrating but its protocol your diagnosis determines your treatment options its not academic its literally what they use to proceed with treatment it seems you dont really have much of an understanding of what narcolepsy is and what the symptoms actually are constant naps is hardly what narcolepsy is a quick search will tell you that excessive daytime sleepinessexcessive sleepiness fragmented sleeppoor quality of overnight sleep and sleep attacks are some of the main symptoms constant naps isnt really a symptom its a product of the condition for some sufferers and a way some may deal with the exhaustion if youre tired all the time and arent sleeping well at night you would be wise to seek treatment for those things doing so is all part of treating narcolepsy which goes hand in hand with treating cataplexy assuming you have either of those things and receive a proper diagnosis unfortunately yes you will need a sleep study to further pursue a diagnosis and more than likely yes you will have to jump through hoops to get treatment narcolepsycataplexy are both decently uncommon problems and there arent a ton of treatment options available what is available doesnt work for everyone and sadly for some of us doesnt work much at all finding a doctorspecialist that knows what theyre doingtalking about when it comes to n1n2 is decently difficult and it can be hard to achieve proper productive medication management that provides true relief from symptoms it is a lifelong struggle for which there is no cure and finding a balance and battling tolerance for relevant medications is a constant uphill battle the road to diagnosis can be on its own an insanely long and difficult one but in the end its worth it to know whats truly going on and have a chance to treat it even if only a little no one is supposed to feel tired all the time and have awful fragmented sleep its not a small symptom even if it seems your cataplexy is the more unmanageable side it is worth it to get to the bottom of 100 of the symptoms and try to treat all of them if you can tired all the time is a severe symptom even if it may not seem like it because youre used to it or have dealt with it for so long best of luck in your journey ahead right it would take zero time for me to breakup if the person i was seeing ended up having a secret child they hid for 6 months unless youre having a one night stand this is something you absolutely disclose no matter how hard or complicated especially once its getting into dating and feelings territory and not just hooking up no breakup needed hes already done the work for her not responding ignoring her and moving on with his life hes already made it clear hes done now that shes questioning his real relationship and family and isnt just the easy side piece you literally used the term emotionally cheated in your post title clearly you recognize that emotional cheating exists and that she did it so i dont know why you keep asking as if it somehow makes it better if she just sexted and emotionally connected with her ex instead of physically fucking if you genuinely believe she hasnt physically cheated youre either being willfully ignorant or youre incredibly naive shes trickletruthing you by claiming she sexted met her ex went on hookup sites and set up potentially fuck meets on craigslist but never did anything physical youd have to be a fool to believe all that occurred but she stopped short of physical cheating the fact that she was on seeking arrangements really adds to what youve said in this comment you paid off her debts bought her a house and funded her every want you have played the roll of a sugar daddy for her which clearly she was looking for by using sa and it sounds like you were possibly not the only one or you just won out over other candidates she absolutely used you for money and she absolutely cheated on you multiple times in multiple ways even if it was just emotional cheating youre going to accept that that she cares more for her ex than you sexts with him meets up with him behind your back thats all okay with you this relationship shouldve been over when you found out about the ex all this other
