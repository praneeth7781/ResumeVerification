would not be moving forward towards marriage until she participates in therapy individual at minimum possibly couples counseling as well until she can work through some of her feelings towards sex and have a healthier view towards it and towards future intimacy in the marriage i would not be able to confidently say a commitment like this would be a good idea couldnt agree more between the seasonal depression 80 shit weather ridiculous and passive aggressive people filth everywhere crime high cost of living insane taxes getting higher all the time and being misused garbage city and state government abysmal social services for anyone who isnt homeless unhinged homelessdrug addicts assaultingrobbingdestroying every inch of town etc what exactly are we defending here in portland certainly not a high quality of life i get it no one wants to live in a shit hole no one wants to have to say yes its filthy dangerous and unpleasant here but just because you deny the realities around you doesnt somehow mean they dont exist and its that portland isnt so bad its worse elsewhere were fine attitude that is making it that much shittier here day by day wake the fuck up guys just because your little bubble of privilege has allowed you enough comforts to ignore the greater realities here doesnt mean portland is a nice place to live and without major problems yes he absolutely should have their pet didnt deserve to die because your dog was at large and is inclined to kill other animals i dont care that it was a rabbit you are responsible for ensuring your dog doesnt get out and maul another innocent persons pet so you are entitled to keeping your pet regardless of other peoples pets lives because what your dog is somehow superior absolutely not a wild rabbit a wild rabbit in your yard where your dog is fenced in and able to play unsupervised absolutely different story i agree i feel horrible for the people who had to lose a treasured pet to you and your animal i wasnt there i dont know whether or not laop is lying i dont really care either i dont have the time to sit and play detective with every post i was obviously commenting under the assumption laop was an honest post if its not its not none of my business and doesnt change my opinion in the general sense if the dog actually did take off enough skin from the arm to need reconstruction thats a serious problem if not and laop is lying or wasting peoples time with bs so be it hello uewalk21 thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for the following reasons rule 8 loweffort content general

will most likely be ignored i dont know a dog that attacks a random person especially one that wasnt instigating anything with said dog and injures them to the point of needing a skin graft absolutely should be put down period its unfortunate that the owner wasnt responsible and didnt properly lock up their dog but i have zero patience or tolerance for animals that maul other humans or other pets out of the blue nope not a chance edited changed or other animals to or other pets agreed ive lived in a handful of other states throughout my life grew up here sadly and its astonishing how much people here will allow if not downright enable and encourage im so sick of the most vulnerable houseless neighbors rhetoric enough is enough theres a reason portland is such a disgusting filth covered hellscape these days and a lot of it is how unwilling people are to do anything meaningful about it and no bitching about it once or twice a week doesnt count as an action if i could id move in a heartbeat but unfortunately im disabled and trying to build up a medical care team elsewhere isnt as easy as people think i dont foresee any great changes or comeback for the city unfortunately and i say that as someone who will be forced to die here alongside it if you think this is going to have a notable enjoyable impact on rent think again amen im so sick of seeing its like this everywhere all urban areas have these problems no it fucking isnt like this everywhere these problems may not be exclusive to portland but the way we enable them fail to clean them up and allow them to run rampant and steal everything that isnt nailed down before shooting it and lighting it on fire sure is a special flavor to this shithole city people arent living like this everywhere its crazy how happy people seem elsewhere how clean it is im sick of this dump and just as sick of people pretending it isnt as bad as it is theres nothing to defend yes it does as someone who sadly has to use ebt when i purchase things with bottle deposits i do not have to spend actual money on top of my ebt card give zero fucks about anything at all but themselves good luck but dont expect success my dad who had three strokes could barely care for himself anymore mentally reverted back to a very childlike state all the more complicated by extremely unmanageable diabetes eventually gave up because he couldnt make it through all the ridiculous hoops they force people to backflip through and was literally dying in povertyfrom poverty since you absolutely cannot work during the process no matter long it takes they fucking denied him the first time and used letter sorter and paper folder as job titles they thought he could qualify for and work fucking horrible ultimately the disgusting and inhumane disability system in the us is what killed him frankly as other have said narcolepsy isnt a recognized approval disability for them so it will be an uphill battle in every way at your age without other conditions close to impossible they will want to be sure youve tried every treatment option humanely possible for substantial lengths of time and youll have to argue that at such a young age no job is doable for you whatsoever this fight again must somehow happen while you have zero income whatsoever for the entire duration and if you do finally get on it you will live in abject poverty for the rest of your life thats not to say it isnt worth it some of us myself included genuinely cant work and have no other options but its something to consider the pay isnt worth it its a last resort when you truly cannot work whatsoever thanks for sharing these are awesome i especially love the decanter i cant get over how beautiful that piece is im sorry honey youre the one who responded to me you must be lost you must have some wildly bad dimensions if its literally difficult and painful to do something so simple nope its just literally not fucking hard to do at all but then again i actually like doing it instead of whining about it and half assing it like a lot of yall according to a lot of the women commenting here yes but in reality no youre entitled to likes and dislikes and preferences and boundaries it doesnt matter at all why you dont want to do it just that you dont and wont and that should be respected 100 it will be a deal breaker for some women but others will respect your boundaries and be happy to have sex and enjoy sex which is very much not just about receiving head and it sounds like youre more than willing to be attentive to their pleasure and needs so everyone will have a great time ignore the many fuck men who dont go down comments here these women suck frankly you wont be compatible with everyone but youre not less than or a worse candidate for partner for those who realize theres so much more to enjoy than just receiving head during a sexual encounter for what its worth im a woman who has been upvoting you youre not wrong in a lot of what youre saying frankly sucking dick isnt fucking hard my partner is above average in size and ive never once thought hmm this is painful or difficult and giving head is honestly my favorite sexual activity i have absolutely gone down on him for 3060 minutes without stopping as well as for a combined total of hours when weve had long all day to fuck sessions and i was fine was my jaw sore after hours a bit absolutely but it was fine in a handful of hoursafter a night of sleep and barely more than a minor annoyance not painful most women in these comments and the op talk about how they like giving head but its clear they do not you dont genuinely enjoy the act or selfless intent of giving a blowjob if you only enjoy it if youre getting something in return you like it as a gateway to something you want when its off the table if you dont get what you want you dont actually fucking like
