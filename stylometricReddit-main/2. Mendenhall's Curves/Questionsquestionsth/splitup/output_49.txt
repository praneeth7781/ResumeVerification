im surely missing a few things but those were the staples i noticed in their story im sure a lot of us are curious what medication are you on for how long how is it causing problems and how were you placed on it without any sort of diagnosis that aside the process of pursuing a diagnosis is never easy nor fun sleep studies are awful and can be inconclusive or flat out wrong and need further pursuing or retesting and thats with or without having to take time off your regularly scheduled medications for some of us that standard 2 week med break is devastating if not impossible and crippling youre not alone in that fear and struggle and im sorry youre having to face it during law school of all things as embarrassing as it may feel definitely reach out to your school in some capacity they should have a specific department that deals with medical accommodationsa disability specific departmentworker get in touch explain where youre at and let them know you need specific accommodations and exceptions during this time sleeping through class without alerting anyone about your specific woes obviously isnt the answer here and wont fly reputable schools have a system in place to accommodate for cases like yours but they can only implement them and help you if they know about it it will feel a bit embarrassing youll feel vulnerable and not everyone will be understanding 100 of the time but if you dont advocate for yourself no one can meet you halfway and help you see what they can do when you explain and go from there it may not solve 100 of the anxiety or struggle but once you know what patience your courses are willing to give you you can make a better plan i hope youre able to find the answers you need with this path of seeking out a formal diagnosis all the best have a blast especially being your first time youll be blown away no matter even if you dont know a single song they kill it sound excellent and the stage show is captivating i always make a spotify playlist of the set list beforehand to listen to in the days before the show youve got time to learn some lyrics im sure its typically the same yes im excited to go still because theyre never a bad time but this is probably my least favorite set list of all the tours ive gone out for and ive seen them many many times that said theres some great songs on there regardless itll be a great show no matter what the amount of people on this post who are like right when you rent you can treat the property like complete shit and if you break something the landlord can just pay for it and fix it yall are the reason shitty slumlords and predatory property management are about all thats left these days honest good landlords lost all incentive and will to rent their properties out to you heathens thank you there is a difference between op and the all too common deranged homeless person who is chasing you threatening you assaulting you brandishing a weapon leaving feces and drug paraphernalia in the open and creating a massive biohazard engaging in lewd sexual behavior in public stealing breaking into homescars littering the streets with mountains of garbage etc pretending their isnt is silly the sub lacks compassion for the latter for good reason so bummed it isnt on the set list this tour if you dont live with them and youre at their house you sure do need their consent could be advance consent its cool if you masturbate whenever doesnt bother me or quick is this cool beforehand but youre most certainly not entitled to whip out your genitals and start going for it at someone elses house whenever you damn feel like it relationshipfwb or not without prior permission hello ushadowman1093 thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for the following

myremovedsubmissionmessageimwritingtoyouaboutthefollowingsubmission 0d0dmyissueis direct replies to official mod comments will most likely be ignored ive seen them probably way too many times so ive gotten to enjoy a lot of dream tracks live over the years so its hard to decide what id want for a full set list given how many ive seen and how much variety there is trying to give the newest album some slots and thinking about songs i havent heard livehavent heard live in ages and without overthinking it too hard 1 bassem sabry i got way too into this song after hearing it live no shame 2 peace to all freaks 3 id engager 4 gronlandic edit 5 how lester lost his wife 6 coquet coquette 7 virgilian lots 8 nightsift 9 sophie calle private game 10 i was a landscape in your dream 11 touched somethings hollow 12 hmm 13 blab sabbath lathe of maiden 14 we will commit wolf murder encore 1 st sebastian 2 deliberate selfharm ha ha 3 suffer for fashion ive been to numerous shows on every tour since 2011 so have seen a lot of setlist variety the one tour i missed was for ur fun and i really regret it wouldve been an amazing nye show because ive really been loving peace to all freaks st sebastian and deliberate selfharm ha ha lately and wouldve loved to see those tracks live not that into the setlist for this tour that ive seen posted so far but its never a bad show so im excited nonetheless was going to say the same thing op your problem is this entitled why wont girls love me other men are getting women but i havent even been kissed i have a stable job and want a family why are women not lining up for me attitude the fact that youve even mentioned or considered a mail order brideimporting a wife situation speaks to some of the reasons why you are not finding a partner a girlfriend or spouse is not someone you pick out of a catalog and provide for in exchange for sex loyalty and the partnership of your dreams a relationship like youre describing happens organically because you have a good personality genuine love to grow with another person and bring more to the table than cash and stability if youre looking for a person to have your children live in your house and be given the title of wife youre not going to find a loving genuine relationship because youre not looking for a partner youre looking to check off a list of goals and milestones that screams desperation which no one finds attractive and possessive which is also a huge turn off that attitude also tells potential partners that you dont really care about them just what theyre doing for you or have to offer you the point of starting a family getting married and building a long term relationship is doing it with someone you genuinely care about enjoy and love you should find yourself inspired to do those things with someone youve been dating not entering every relationship assuming its going to get to that point just because you can provide financially and have a house to offer none of that shit matters to a partner of quality its about the genuine quality of the relationship not how rich or poor the partner may be if youre just looking to get laid hire a sex worker for the love of god dont import a wife from a poorer country who would only be with you because she is essentially selling herself into servitude with you and who will almost definitely leave you as soon as she establishes permanent residency and will absolutely resent you from day one that kind of shit is really exploitative and gross and the fact that youre open to it shows that youre not looking for a real partner just someone to tote around as a wife i highly recommend some therapy first and foremost from there as others have mentioned what do you bring to the table no not stability or financial wellbeing personality hobbies etc you have managed to convey zero of that in this post which tells me you likely havent held it to the same importance as having a decent paycheck and working out which is absolutely a problem hello uglitteringmud4088 thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for the following reasons rule 4 no bugstechnical errors technical or account support posts are
