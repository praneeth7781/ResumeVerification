yep this is my only hard dont touch it right now after they ruined californias tower i will lose my mind if they touch wdws especially as it was always the superior version to me its such well done theming from the walk up the street to the queue its such a timeless classy theme overall that really ties the entire area together and it will not benefit from some modern retheme or overhaul especially marvel leave it alone people dont want to accept this but its absolutely a fact a lot of these people would absolutely destroy whatever housing you give them much like they do everything else they come in contact with theyd be doing all kinds of illegal shit from this hypothetical housing and it would become a filthy druglittered biohazard full of stolen goods im not saying we dont need to help with housing for anyone but continuing to parrot housing first1111 if ignoring the very real core problems were facing that have everything to do with mental health problems and drug abuse haha no worries just wanted to make sure you knew and clarify if you were planning pre or post houston opening in case anyone chimes in with ideas personally i feel like that would be a bit intense of a road trip but would also be a ton of fun to attempt i would want to spend 2 days at each location to be able to really take it all in participate in the stories and not feel rushed at least personally so that would make for a long trek if trying to do it all across one vacation if youre waiting for houston to open in this hypothetical there will be five not four locations to consider couldnt tell if you meant prehouston opening or not i wonder what she considers to be the real problems like hmm did she forget about that time where she put a random postmates driver on blast by posting their photo and accusing them of theft of fucking food whod have guessed causing them to receive death threats and endless harassment when nothing even close to theft occurred right lizzo the real problems mkay ha i saw him at the rainbow once back in late 2016 was in a booth grabbing a drink and he was in the middle of the room at a table being interviewed by some younger looking dude who was holding a dildo camera people were walking around the room and recording everyone sitting around which was uncomfortable because i was just trying to snack and grab a few rounds and didnt want to end up in some recording somewhere ive tried to find the video but never was able to 1 i hate kids genuinely cannot stand to be around them at all for any length of time dont enjoy it dont want to do it and hearing kids be loud in a public place sets me off so quickly i dont see it changing frankly kids dont seem to love me either its like i dont talk to them in the right tone or lap up their dumb shit enough i dont know 2 i simply cant afford it kids in this economy absolutely not 3 even if i could afford it id never waste my time and money like that id like to enjoy what of my life i can kids would suck any chance of that up real fast freedom to travel live on my own schedule do things the way i need to not giving that up 4 this world sucks i barely survive each day at this point i wouldnt bring another life into this willingly 5 i have severe health problems i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy i wouldnt want to risk passing those on and i wouldnt want to make them insanely worse by having a kid and having to use what tiny bits of energy i dont have often to care for it im maybe functional 13 hours a day at this point it wouldnt work out 6 my partner doesnt hate kids but he doesnt like them or want them either i have extremely severe narcolepsy it simply isnt possible not only do i simply not have the energy or any energy ever for that matter the fact that i am incapable of ever actually having restorative sleep means that the pain and stress it would put on my body is that much more excruciating and i simply dont recover its actively harmful for me to even attempt fortunately i have always been on the thinner side i guess but between other chronic illnesses and the awful life stealer that narcolepsy is i just cant be any kind of active ooooof luckily my pair are only 8 months old right now but this is just not something i have the capacity to think about and i dont know how ill ever manage it theyre so insanely bonded and i just cant imagine what thatll be like for one of them nonetheless for us having to process the loss at the same time nothing has hurt quite the way tragically losing my fuzzy orange best friend summer of 2022 has and without these two id still be a very lost cold lonely mess of a person this is my first time with two cats at the same time and i just never even thought about that eventual scenario where one outlives the other nope nope not fun never said anyone was reading comprehension may be a solid goal for 2023 for you i believe in a lot of places legally they cant require a sick note for 2 days or less this is dependent upon statecity of course i 100 agree though why would you want your employees to risk coming in sick thus risking other employees falling ill as the disease spreads through the business and why would you want an employee who doesnt feel wellup to the task of working representing your business to customers handling tasks in the workplace etc ive never understood the way some workplaces treat employees like theyre kids in middle school that cant behave and wont do anything unless forced were fucking adults if i say im sick and cant work im sick and i cant fucking work doesnt matter what im sick with im not going to perform today and you shouldnt want to try to force me when i have already assessed it isnt going to happen in a satisfactory way let me get some fucking rest and yep why burden a doctor a doctors note is something you give a principal or teacher in grade school fuck outta here the way it reads to me is that if you dont bring a sick note explaining the days you called in sick prior to returning with you when you return from your days home you will be sent back home x200b which like yeah is pretty ridiculous but hey i always want to be at home and never at a job so by all means send me back home chances are if i was home sick i still feel like shit when im coming back anyway im telling you for a goddamn fact no it has never cost me 7k or anywhere near it in a year uncomfortably poor people tend to know their exact finances down to a penny 100 of the time we dont get the luxury of a choice i sure as fuck know how much my car costs me it costs me exactly as much as i think budget for and knowingly spend thanks im not saying 100 car dependence should be built into society and forced upon everyone never said that but its ignorant and all kinds of plain wrong to assume that some people dont need to be able to drive places and cars are not some great evil that we can all just eliminate and be better for theres absolutely no way i will ever be able to take public transit again in my lifetime no matter how much better the access is to housingdoctorsworkplacesetc life is not that black and white and there are many legitimate reasons even with a more transitfriendly infrastructure that many will need to drive im not arguing against better transit and better infrastructure for those who cant or choose not to drive i think those are greats things we agree there but this cars are evil people who drive are badignorantdumb attitude on this subreddit is ridiculous delusional and needs to stop they both look and are godawful but damn darcey looks a lot worse than stacey these days somehow those under eyes my god i forgot they had a spinoff what a shame these narcissists dont deserve screen time and maybe if we stopped giving it to them theyd eventually look at themselves and get some real therapy wait you say you live in america in california have you ever heard of a money order i think im in love i know this is crazy but would you marry me right i mean i get people need the hours well the pay but the whole gets you sent home boggles my mind anytime ive seen it id much rather be at home especially if im sickhave been sick make my day and if corners have been cut and things have been tough due to shortage of staff why are you sending staff home for every single little thing not for everyone it doesnt its never cost me even close to 7k a year to have a car and ive been poor and disabled my entire life thanks some cant afford to live close to their jobs and doctors and arent privileged enough to have those be located on functional public transport routes either and have no choice but to drive a shitty beater to get where theyre forced to go but sure fuck cars theyre never useful or necessary yeah evil warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info seriously im so sick of all the car hate on this subreddit people here are delusional selfabsorbed antipoor and ableist especially when it comes to carsthe need to drive it shouldnt come as such a shock or insult that some people have to drive or have different needs that cant exclude driving and frankly with all of the max attackshappenings no one should catch any grief for saying they dont feel comfortable subjecting themselves to the unhinged wild card that is the trimet transportation experience the whole lol fuck cars people are so attached to driving theyd drive to take a shit nonsense is really pathetic grow up careless square is a good way to refer to downtown already a carless square isnt exactly going to do this for most people though it certainly doesnt suddenly make downtown more appealing im so sorry for your loss op please be kind to yourself i wish you the best in your grieving journey and the safest of travels out of town may 2023 improve despite this loss and may you come out of it stronger and feeling at peace with yourself not who you were responding to but wanted to chime in anyway i would not tell them openly that it was you who complained unless you are faced with a situation where you legally have to identify yourself they may seem relatively normal and like the keep to themselves types but you never really know someone especially when their lifestyle is being threatened or the possibility of legal trouble court letter from the city continued visits from law enforcement fines etc is on the table people that let their pets get this intrusive on the lives of those around them dont give a fuck about anyone
