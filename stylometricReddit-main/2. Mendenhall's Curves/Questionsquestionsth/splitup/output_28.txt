period of particularly hazardous weather which also happens to be falling during a time of year where illnesses tend to run rampant to deal with this we are going to make it outrageously difficult to keep your jobavoid being deemed fireable for insubordination which would only make us short more employees but thats not our fault we are also going to put everyone at an increased risk of falling ill by making it near impossible for sick workers to stay home hope a widespread outbreak doesnt completely destroy our ability to operate merry christmas at the time op had no concrete evidence that he was on fake phone calls for one second off humiliating your partner like that is pretty childish and petty a confrontation about his behavior can occur between the two of them on their own time mature adults dont make a huge display out of it in front of everyone else shifting the attention off the holiday party to their own drama anyone agreeing with that type of nonsense is outing themselves as a bratty child this isnt a sitcom handle your personal relationship business elsewhere and ideally with more grace than this bs for what its worth an emotionally mature person doesnt snoop through a partners phone and then commit to being dishonest about it op isnt checking a lot of the emotionally mature adult boxes here either ship is the best all year round doubt it she still cant and wont admit she was a serious abuser and i doubt shes done the therapy and work needed since she stills seems selfobsessed and unwilling to own just how wrong she was i dont care how much of a physical glow up she went through or what degree she earned doesnt make her any less of a toxic abuser and that doesnt just go away because you act nice and look pretty on instagram when i see people who endlessly support her says a lot about the person honestly alternatively ive never gotten a fedex package on time and those assholes ignore signature requirements and leave packages wherever the hell they feel like it and with absurdly incorrect tracking and then claim theyre not responsible for whatever happens to your shit despite never once making sure it gets to you in a timely secure fashion and youll be lucky if it isnt broken ive watched them throw my boxes like footballs on my doorbell camera fuck fedex not worth the gamble i was shocked that my mail and ups as well came today i was pretty sure when it started getting icy last night i could guarantee it wouldnt be happening today i think most will have expected this as well im super grateful my mailman made the trek i get my prescriptions by mail if it hadnt come today id be absolutely fucked until after christmas tuesday is when delivery starts up right and it wouldve destroyed me this weekend with no way to go get them from the pharmacy so your solution is being a manipulative child and trying to trick her into finally breaking up with you or doing 100 of what you want sexually and staying in a miserably incompatible relationship you need to grow up seriously youre banking on her not wanting another guy and are leaving everything up to her to keep a breakup from happening im guessing your assumption or at least hope is that she will decide to put all her wants and needs aside for you subscribing to 100 sexually incompatible vanilla sex to keep from having to deal with the unpleasant and difficult path of breaking up if its a dealbreaker for her she gets to look like the bad guy to you she dumped me because i wouldnt be rough with her in bed poor me and you get to feel sorry for yourself as the dumpee a mature rational adult in a healthy adult relationship realizes that this is a fundamental incompatibility that cannot be resolved and agrees that splitting up to find partners who are compatible in the future is the best thing both partners can do you should want to find a partner who is sexually compatible with you not try to force the other persons hand and make them do the hard workinitiate the breakup or be stuck with unfulfilling unpleasant sex in a relationship they arent satisfied with you shouldnt want to force a partner to give up their own sexual needs and desires for your benefit or force them to walk away it should be a mature mutual decision or a decision you make when you realize this cant be fixed allowing you both to move on and find a real healthy relationship elsewhere its pretty disgusting that youre willing to ask her to put 100 of her sexual needs aside for you to engage in sex with her you know she doesnt enjoyget satisfaction from or make her end things for you because youre too big of a coward to do it yourself if she doesnt bend to your needs i hope she does breakup with you and find a rational adult partner that is excited about fulfilling her sexually portlanders seem incapable of admitting there are any problems or downsides here and its ridiculous look i grew up here and im stuck here again now theres a lot that sucks about this place just because other cities deal with the same shit or have it worse doesnt make it not a problem here a lot of portlanders need to pull their heads out of their asses ah yeah because most of us poors have the kind of free outdoor space needed to raise chickens easy i agree with this wholeheartedly find out what happened first to gauge if it would be appreciated or appropriate and if its nothing too terrible send it anyway what she chooses to do with it is her choice regardless but the sentiment is still there and its a beautiful gift multnomah county is basically catch and release at this point no wonder everything is so fucked up and getting less and less safe all the time here portland is a joke this is definitely not a guarantee an ex was vegan and one vegetarian and their cum was some of the worst most foul and vile taste ive ever encountered in my life like literally repulsive bitter absolutely disgusting tastes my current partner of many years is far from the picture of perfect dietary and nutritional health but is super easy to take almost flavorless even yep couldnt agree more the dialogue between the brothers had serious rfellowkids energy and was absolutely cringeworthy and just plain dumb took was obnoxious and lazily written and kiri with her old woman voice was too poorly fleshed out for anyone to care about yet somehow allpowerful no thank you the adults are much more interesting and still not that exciting but we spend the entire moving following these bratty poorly written children causing problems noooope visually the movie was nice to look at but the plot eh i hope you enjoy it if you do go back and see it im not a diehard avatar fan here to endlessly defend the film or anything and hope i didnt seem that way heh but i feel like falling asleep 10 minutes in was a bit harsh especially with you having not finished it but hey we all like different things and thats okay i thought the plot was a bit dicey and too similar to the first film but the visuals were well done and i enjoyed the atmosphere and effects quite a bit will i be rushing out to see it a second time nah but i did enjoy it enough to feel i didnt waste my night sitting through it nevertheless it was loud as hell though agreed dolby atmos was a bit overpowering for me yep agree with 100 of your comment this is not professional attire regardless of if it is sold at the store you work at that is completely irrelevant you cant expect all things to be appropriate in a workplace for most workplaces and i would never expect this to be allowed at work aside from maybe a bar job or something that said youre not on the clock and its a day off so unless otherwise stated and then paid for the time it would stand to reason that youre going to wear day off attire if you happen to do them a favor by stopping in at the same time as rude as the comment is its just that a comment not sure why the post was needed aside from unnecessary validation let it roll off and move on all these lol call a lawyer comments are delusional this one off isnt a harassment case people make snide remarks in the workplace and they arent all sexual harassment or lawsuit worthy time for a reality check dont insult those who genuinely need the medication with this horseshit people who dont need it will abuse it and thats on them its not government meth portland has always looked like shit not sure when youre referring to roadside attraction however is and has been a wonderful place amongst the shit for a long time you claim to have left the theater less than an hour in youre clearly not the targeted audience for the movie and quite frankly no one wants to listen to you whine about a film you didnt even stay to finish i personally have zero respect for someone who pays for a movie leaves before its over and then complains about it you didnt even watch the whole thing and you wasted the cost of a ticket just to walk out before being able to form a full opinion you dont have to like it personally i dont feel like the avatar films have that solid of a plot im watching for the visuals and effects and environments but theyre definitely not fall asleep 10 minutes in worthy nor are they bad enough to warrant a walk out under an hour in if they arent for you they arent for you and you largely knew that already before visiting the theater no need to come here being hyperbolic and dramatic everyone in the theater fell asleep a mere ten minutes into the film sure dude and if he does hopefully its with a partner that actually respects him and the rules they set beforehand last time i checked youth arent legally permitted to purchase cigarettes flavored tobacco products or vape products in the first place if you think for one second that this will stop youth who are already obtaining these items through illegal avenues from continuing to do so i have a bridge to sell you as far as data on smoking cessation frankly who gives a shit there are countless adults who say that vaping was a valuable and successful aid to them quitting smoking there is some data claiming vaping is healthier than outright smoking both for the user and those around them and all that aside i dont care about that data frankly adults should be allowed to legally buy these things and make the choices for themselves as to whether it is detrimental to their health and lifestyle or not were doing a painfully bad job here with the choice to decriminalize drugs and hand out zero consequences for hard drug use and all the bullshittery that comes with it yet flavored tobacco and vapes is suddenly where we start taking a moral high ground and drawing some lines ridiculous im not a smoker or a vape user and never have been but this is getting ridiculous this isnt for the children and is just one of many stupid overstepping choices in a land of many shitty over the top
