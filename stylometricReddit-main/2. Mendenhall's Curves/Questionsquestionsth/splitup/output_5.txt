absolutely would it has been a dream of mine since i was a kid i know that the outsider perspective is a lot different than what it is actually like to work there but ive worked plenty of majorly shitty publicfacing jobs and i understand the downsides of working at a place like disney with so many guests shitty entitlement etc when i was a kid i dreamed of being an imagineer i wouldve loved to work with animatronics ride development attraction decor type stuff but i also grew up poor and im disabled so it was never really going to be on the table for me i would still love to work in the parks but i am heavily tattooed and have a severe disability so the opportunity wont ever arise for me that said in imagination land i would move to floridacalifornia in a heartbeat to work at disney assuming i could find a reasonable place to live close enough to commute from florida would be tough for me with the extreme climate ive lived in the pacific northwest for over a decade hot aint a thing like there over here but i have really good friends there that i wish werent on the opposite side of the country from me i lived in san diego as a kid and would love to move back so disneyland would probably be the better hypothetical choice for me but the cost of living is nuts and i much prefer world to land no competition x200b sure the pay isnt great and cast members definitely deserve so much more but its not impossible to make work especially if you work up to or land a higher paying role i obviously cant say from experience but my thought would be that it doesnt ruin the magic it just changes what the magic means you become the magic and providing that to guests is im sure what makes some of the shittier aspects easier to deal with even if only a little ive had some really great talks about it with some cast members usually photopass or ogas staff when theyre not busy and can chat for longer periods and there are those who definitely dont visit the parks as much because of aspects of the job but there are just as many ive talked to who genuinely seem to love everything about working there visit often etc funny enough i ran into a photopass guy we had at hollywood studios a couple days later when we were walking around pop century he was there with his lady they were grabbing lunch at disney springs i believe mightve been popping into the parks for a ride or something they seemed just as cheery and thrilled to be on property as he did joyfully making our photo experience special everything in life is what you make it truly i have had luck asking a cast member for alternatives when the ll is too long and will defeat the purpose of das for me and they will often allow me to go in the wheelchair entrance there still may be a small wait but its much more manageable and im not crammed in with hundreds of ll folks not always but it doesnt hurt to ask sometimes theyve offered to allow my partner to wait in the line while i wait out front and then the cast member bring me through the queue when hes a few guests away from boarding but this hasnt worked for my needs so we havent tried it it still wouldnt be instant access you waited on the app already das people have to wait twice and potentially twice as long if not more the purpose of das in part is to allow people who cant wait in a traditional line to still access attractions having them wait in a physical line that can be horrendous because its the damn lightning lane line defeats this purpose entirely especially when weve already had to wait in the virtual line when we book the attraction for those of us who cant wait in a longer traditional line its a nightmare having waited a long time already on the app just to turn up and still have it be inaccessible for you because of your disabilities sucks yep exactly i take a controlled substance medication it is necessary for my survival and honestly the safety of others if im out and about potentially and is the only way i can function at all my illness is cripplingly severe a horrible disability i wouldnt inflict on my worst enemy and is still barely manageable with medication but without the meds i would have no life at all and likely wouldve died years ago i 100 need the medication i have a legitimate diagnosed illness with more than enough medical records to prove or validate the severity of my symptoms and disability and have used it for many years 100 responsibly but even though theres no question my need for the medication is legitimate and consistent because its a controlled substance i have to be extremely careful at all times when visiting a doctorurgent carehospital for anything there is such a stigma against these medications and some medical professionals have such a shitty view towards them and the patients who take them that you have to be constantly aware that a worker may take anything you say and spin it against you at any time in a way that seriously fucks up your treatment plan may keep you from getting the meds you need and that youll be very limited in ways to fight back against not just obvious things like mentions of drug use or mental health woes anything the laws around these meds in many ways create serious terrible barriers for people who genuinely need them in an attempt to keep people who dont from having them either im not saying there shouldnt be regulations to keep them from misuse but the general attitude towards these medspeople using them sucks those of us who need them are in constant worry of doing anything wrong that could cause a doctor to ruin my life over stigmaprejudices and for those people a cartoony card is going to make a difference how would that play out i know youre being rude and denying i have a disability but here read this this 100 i dont care how great the owner is or how much time and effort gets put into training it isnt worth the risk there are how many other dog breeds available no one needs one of these when something happens and it maulskills another person pet child etc its too late and it happens constantly its always the pit that was trained well or never hurt a fly or is lovely sweet kind gentle and a giant baby your want to take a chance on this breed is not ever somehow more important than the lives and safety of the people and pets around you because unforeseen events do happen all the time and theres no taking that back you as an owner are never going to out love out train out discipline out socialize out whatever else genetics and breed traits breed traits exist gameness exists the general lack of selfpreservation and oh time to stop in these animals exists if you live in the middle of nowhere with a fence that cant be crawledjumped overunder without any living humanspets around you then sure feel free to take a chance like this whatever but the amount of people who see no problem with this level of selfish entitlement deciding to take a risk like this at the potential expense of everyone around them ugh x200b edit before it happens let me just state i am not going to argue with anyone about this im not here to debate your feelings on how great the breed is or who is really at fault for whatever dont care save your breath pit bull literally mauled people thats the facts in this post and in endless posts every day because its happening constantly and its always brutal and if youre thinking about arguing with me to defend these things given all that ooooof im not sure if links are allowed here if it gets removed before you see it let me know and i will dm it to you but this is the group i personally use i have used them 15 times with a handful of different owners and have never had any issues if you have any questionswould like some recommendations for ownersproperties let me know x200b you are correct due to the nature of these types of reservations davids does not allow cancellationsrefunds you will be very hard pressed to find a dvc rental service offering cancellations and id be cautious if i did see one as it would make me question the legitimacy the workaround for this would be to get travel insurance davids suggests you do this i believe on the page outlining their cancelation policy alternatively if you have any credit cards that offer extra purchase protections or travel protections you may be able to feel more safe in your booking by using one of those cards to pay for the reservation many cards offer some type of purchase and possibly even travel protection its a good idea to research this just to see what is available to you i personally have never had to deal with this because i havent had to cancel a trip partially why i prefer to wait to book until closer to i will usually book flights much earlier park passes dining etc but wait on the nonrefundables until i know for sure it will all come togetherlike you said things do happen though travel insurance is never a bad idea perhaps you would feel more comfortable booking something that can be canceled until your kiddo is a bit olderyou arent as concerned but again there are many things you just cant plan for so its definitely a risk to take some dvc owners may allow you to cancel the reservation so long as you leave enough time for them to resell and book someone else but i havent seen that super often some may be accommodating in case of legitimate emergency but dont advertise that leniency to avoid cancelations all depends on who you deal with i used davids to stay at the polynesian in december of 2020 and they were great completely legitimate no hidden fees or hassle everything just as it says on the website great customer service at least in my experience and the process though it asks a lot of questions is very easy being able to put in for multiple resorts and know the price estimate before hand is really nice and they have killer deals on confirmed reservations sometimes we had an amazing stay with zero mishaps and got an absolutely unreal price for our visit i highly recommend them and would absolutely use them again i personally go direct through dvc owners now using a very active facebook group but thats not in any way because of anything davids vacation rental did or didnt do ive just found better availability and sometimes better prices when booking more last minute say 35 months out through renting direct and sometimes not even davids usually has better prices on the resorts that we prefer but they are not always as available and you should probably book 6ish months in advance whereas sometimes i prefer to wait on dropping that much cash until ive planned everything else out 100 i always check davids before committing to any direct rentals and will absolutely opt to book with them next time if they have the priceavailability i need with direct booking you also run the risk of dealing with someone unsavory or
