areas and not worry about someone else fucking on her furniture she shouldnt have to come home to potentially walk in on you fucking in a common area thats part of living with roommates keep that shit in your room or get your own place she has no right to dictate what you do in your room unless youre disturbing her peaceful enjoyment of her home meaning after a reasonable hour she shouldnt have to hear you engaging in sexloud musicetc the cameras in a common area is a bit much but unless illegal is her right for securityother purposes it wont be a problem for you if you arent fucking on her couch in a common area ujaybloodsage if you cant be civil and respectful you wont be here at all this is a warning before a ban knock it off and quite inexpensive if you know where to look to quite a lot of places too ive noticed the best view and my personal favorite of portland is on your way out by plane this one definitely screamed some kind of bully breed in there to me too i highly doubt nearly any cocaine people are doing on the illegal market is anywhere near the type that this study wouldve been looking at that shit is so stepped oncut with all kinds of garbage that youre lucky to be getting any actual cocaine in it as such pretty hard to say what out of the substance they used would be responsible for benefitting someone who has done it in the past or if the perceived benefits outweighed whatever other chaos was going on in the bodyactively working against it thats a very interesting study though ha gotcha totally misread what you meant in your post in a haze of tiredness at like 3am as much as im happy for anyone who gains awareness of something that may be impacting them and is motivated to speak with a doctor as a result of these types of posts it should also be noted that narcolepsy is relatively rare takes a generally long and stressful and possibly expensive process to be diagnosed and there are many other things that cause fatigue sleepiness needing extra naps etc that should be and will have to be ruled out first narcolepsy is not just taking random naps or sleeping at random far from it actually so hopefully posts like the one youre referencing lead people to do some research and better understand what narcolepsy really is outside of the general stereotype x200b im glad you found the sub op if it sounds like something that may be true for you and i hope youre able to have the conversations you need with a doctor its a process to figure out but so worth it in the end i so wish there was a better more accurate more consistent type of test to conclusively diagnose these disorders its bad enough that the sleep study bed is shitty and uncomfortable the room is foreignsterileuncomfortabledifficult to relax in and potentially loud bright too hotcold etc but then you mix in the medical equipment all around youuncomfortably on you the anxiety of knowing youre being watched the anxiety of knowing this test is your best shot at answers and if you fail youre back to nothing or paying for another one and going through the hell again and possibly losing your medicationhaving to take more weeks off out of your life while you wait for the study again the absolute nonsense that is the naps portion of the test truly a form of torture still adjusting to being off your normal medications and thus unable to livefunctionsleep as youre used to which definitely impacts your sleep behaviors often negatively just general anxiety yay if youre at all finicky about the conditions of a bedroom when you sleep or as i do have related traumas which makes it impossible to sleep properly your first few nights in a new place youre pretty much fucked once you sprinkle that on top of all the above nonsense oops endrant heh all this to say yep the anxiety sure made me pretty alert too i think we can all relate on that one glad you were still able to get an ih diagnosis and treatment hope its working okay for you bring as many things as you canneed to feel like youre sleeping as you normally would blanket pillow eye covermask earplugs etc within reason most things should be fineallowed and its such a fucking awful environment thats nearly impossible to sleep comfortablynormally in that anything helps especially if youre at all like me and you take a lot to get comfortable call ahead if youre worried about what is allowed but youre definitely in the right mindset trying to replicate your usual sleep while there the best you kind my partner takes stimulant medication so do i but im not a dude and i can confidently say it doesnt have that effect on him at all which is just to say meds will hit everyone different never assume its black and white one way or another yep exactly no race has more of a right to intrude on other peoples quiet enjoyment of their fucking homes with ridiculous behavior no one needs nor has a right to blast music so loud it is disrupting other peoples lives inside their homes this is a standard that everyone should be held to equally its not discrimination to say turn your shit down and keep the noise levels reasonable so the people around you can exist if it impacts certain groups more than others oh well shouldnt be causing the problem in the first place this is an issue that can be that simple quite frankly what made me change my mind about organ donation was witnessing the process as a family member of an organ donor my stepdad committed suicide last january but was the ideal and rare candidate they look for for organ donors in that he was completely brain dead but stable and alive on machines indefinitely the organ donor team left a lot to be desired they came in right away and were almost excited to explain the grim details of the process to us with little bedside mannerthey kept him alive on machines for an entire fucking week leaving my mom unable to say goodbye and afraid to leave the hospital because he could be pulled at any time and she didnt want to miss the send off despite the hellish week other details of which ill save its a long one when it was all over she left with nothing but medical bills im of the opinion that if theyre going to keep your shell of a loved one alive to be fucking harvested for a goddamn week the least they could do is pay for the cremation or anything i get that this defeats the purpose of donation but my godthey had his body for weeks before they finally called her to arrange to have it transported to a funeral home with no warning basically saying if she didnt figure it out in 48 hours theyd start charging in the hundreds per day she was literally calling every cremation place in town trying to find one she could fucking afford because everything was outrageously expensive and yknow her life was just destroyed annnnnyway i digress i am not marked down for organ donation no thank you im not doing that to my loved ones ive read about the body donation problems as well and definitely wont be supporting that such a shame that things are that way i mean narcolepsy also has concomitant depression anxiety addiction etc amongst countless other serious illnesses and adhd too so i get what youre saying and im not saying adhd cant be severe but youre not going to fall asleep while driving or drop to the floor and crack your head open he clearly cares because hes asking not everyone enjoys being peed on or having someone piss in their bedroometc which is reasonable and perfectly acceptable to care about right like if anything falling asleep uncontrollablymost narcolepsy symptoms have more severe dangers and consequences than adhd in a lot of ways but again its approved for both so its not looked at as a dive bar it is a dive bar owners market it that way and the upkeep sure matches as does the crowd you sound like a lovely person and yet you also came from another city to visit there hmm las vegas is no more a cesspool than anywhere else you couldve gotten covid anywhere couldve been positive before you even got into town and just didnt quite know it yet its a tourist hotspot with things to do there will no doubt be a higher amount of people thus increasing risks of illness of any kind just like any other meow wolf location not specific to vegas dont rip on an entire city just because your immune system took a dump there op only ever wants him seeinghearing her like that and thinks this has something to do with modesty so id guess that youre right not quite mature enough nor ready enough for adult relationships in the real world op youre 18 the guy youre with now will almost certainly not be the only person seeinghearing you like that as youre statistically very likely to break uppart ways eventually due to your ages sex doesnt usually get to occur in a soundproof chamber and most humans engage in sex no one thinks its more modest or virtuous to make it a hush hush complicated activity just to feel like youre hiding it as if that somehow makes you look better or more wholesome do not move to the pacific nw wages are still garbage out here cost of living is stupid high outside of tiny areas and those high cost of living areas are largely filthy hellscapes no no no honestly your guess is as good as mine it boggles my mind whyhow places have things like dog menus when they very much are not supposed to have dogs inside their establishment nonetheless eating at them at all its definitely something that should be enforced and its definitely confusing but id guess lack of enforcement and it not being high on the priorities list to put resources into handling strictly is probably why it has become so widespreadcommon everyones doing it is a good enough excuse for a lot of people in most things in life not just this i suppose and on the smaller scale its hard to expect individual employees to enforce something especially when patrons often turn sourescalate a situation if they dont have anyoneanything backing them up so to speak or if the owner of the business refuses to follow the laws it would appear that the code both oregon specific and seemingly in the rest of the country as well reads that at no point in time should any dog be inside any portion of any food establishment or grocery store at any time x200b as it relates to restaurantsgrocery storesbarsplaces that serve any food oregon specific code reads e pet dogs may be allowed in outside seating areas of a food establishment under the following conditions 1 the food establishment prepares written procedures that include a a diagram of the outdoor area to be designated as available to consumers with pet dogs b the establishments procedure for assuring that employees do not touch pet or otherwise handle pet dogs and for immediately cleaning accidents involving dog waste the procedure must also describe the location of materials and equipment necessary to clean up accidents involving dog waste and c the establishments procedure for notifying employees and consumers of the requirements of this paragraph 2 pet dogs may not come into
