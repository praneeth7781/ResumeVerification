fail to add a little detail i have never not once in my life felt rested ever even in my earliest memories 9 times out of 10 i will have a headache various levels from lowgrade to migraine always brain fog so bad that it somehow feels physically painful can hardly form a thought nonetheless do much of anything extremely irritable sorein random pain often nauseas anxious beyond all reason and constantly fighting the indescribably powerful pull to go back to sleep or sleep inertia i suppose ive started having intermittent vision issues now too which are most prominent when waking up so sometimes i cant even see the first 13 hours of the day just blurriness whether these feelings settle a little bit after an hour or two and become a tiny bit more manageable or whether they stay at their worst through the entire day is always a 5050 toss up and determines if ill waste yet another day of my life in agony or if ill have 24 working hours where i can shower accomplish anything and then repeat this disease is a lifelong prison sentence i wouldnt wish it on anyone there is no cure for narcolepsy i have tried microdosing mushrooms in the past in an attempt to promote wakefulnessalertnesscombat the attention issues of narcolepsy and stretch out my stimulant medication more by ideally gaining more energy it did absolutely none of these things and if anything made me more tired made me feel shittier when it wore off and did anything but improve my memory issues and attention span taking psychedelics at higher doses where youd have a full trip experience so to speak only proved to suck out what little energy i had left and leave me depleted for days at a time they also had terrible effects on my memory but thats probably not a common side effect for everyone just my anecdotal experience when you read about potential mental health benefits to mushrooms it is almost always regarding ptsd depression anxiety etc i see no evidence of benefits for narcolepsy whatsoever i question their efficacy for depression and anxiety frankly as well and quite honestly i dont have time and energy to waste on something that isnt intended for this disease i surely dont have any energy to spare thats for sure the mods on rportland are some of the worst across reddit im not surprised thats portland for ya more choosing beggars here than ive seen anywhere else across all walks of life too disgusting i hope they sink and fail real fast and join the countless other bland bars that close down faster than they opened replace a few terms such as juggling with something that invokes less mental images of clowns this absolutely killed me well done agreed i use das and sometimes theres just no way im getting to the park early or by a certain time or rushing to a specific ride at the drop of a hat i need ample time to get somewhere especially if im doing something else and mornings can be difficult when trying to get going out of the resortmake it into the park with rise and cosmic rewind we had no issues showing up late even 5 hours later from time the group was called once since we were group 5 and called right around the park opening and they were always really understanding especially if we checked in first but had to come back later due to a dining reservation and not wanting to be charged im hoping this is just for the unexpected soft open and not a permanent strict no for all riders going forward its one thing if a guest is purposefully pushing it to ride at night but if you have a dining reservation or got stuck on a ride or are coming from a good length of distance or have a dasrelated reason it really should still be honored your doctor will make that decision with you based on your medical history and concerns make sure to be 100 honest about all medicationsself medicating youre doing as well as concerns you have about stopping and how disruptive it may be to your mental health and life you may not have to stop everything or for very long or you might if your doctor feels it will impact the results none of us can know but your doctor should listen to your concerns and consider your existing conditions ahead of your study if you feel they arent in general second opinionnew doctor may be in order but most of us had to go off critical medication before our appointments and spend 24 weeks in misery so that seems to be par for the course with these dumb tests i wish you the best of luck and im sorry to hear youre having to do this again what is your doctorthe lab instructing for your mslt what everyone else had to do is irrelevant to your study your doctorsleep team will specify what your exact instructions are for the study and will expect you to follow them 100 or notify them if that will be a problem and see if there are any adjustments that can be made there may not be you should ask your doctorsleep team about self medication with marijuana before your study and whether or not marijuana usage is allowed and if not how long you will need to abstain for before your test make sure to inform them of anyall medications you are taking and get individual guidance for each from what i gather the majority of people seem to be instructed to cease the majority of medications 24 weeks prior to the test this includes ssris stimulants etc sometimes the timeframe varies especially with ssris that you have to gradually come off ofgradually go back on and sometimes certain medications are okay while others are not they will almost certainly be giving you a ua meaning you will not sneak self medicating or failure to follow instructions past the sleep lab it is important to follow 100 of the instructions you are given in order to achieve the best study results and not have the results invalidated inconclusive unusable etc i was told no medications 2 weeks prior absolutely no marijuana which wasnt a concern for me as i dont use it for the record i am in a legal state and was even told no caffeineexcedrinlight sleeping meds the few days before aww thank you that means a lot im glad it resonated with you in some way no days are good and certainly none are better its merely how many hours i have that i can do anything vs the rest of the time where i am essentially a walking zombie i will say that my narcolepsysymptoms are extremely severe and that medication while better than nothing hardly does anything for me there are people who have it a lot better than i do with n or who have more success with medication this disease is very complicated and difficult and impacts everyone very differently and at very different levels but for me much like you said i have always had a baseline tiredness that never goes away this is a constant and has been there since my earliest childhood memories i have never felt good or normal or rested in my life no matter how much sleep i get or how quality that sleep is i always feel like shit i never wake up rested im never not exhausted and i feel like im constantly walking uphill through molasses just trying to process a simple thought nonetheless complete a task sleep hygiene diet exercise none of that shit matters not even remotely some days i will have 23 maybe even 4 hours where im half functional in those hours i try to squeeze in as much as i can to try to stay afloat from making callsscheduling appointments to keeping the house clean answering emails etc some days i get less than that and move from the bed to the couch to the couch to the shower the shower to the bed maybe to my desk chair where i get nothing done and stare blankly at my screen later wondering how 3 hours melted away and then suddenly the day is over and it felt like 5 minutes narcolepsy is horrifically portrayed in hollywood and in stereotypes most of us are not randomly passing out in full slumber mid sentence sleep attacks are a thing and yes i get them but they dont look like the movie interpretation of narcolepsy any media portrayal of the disease i have seen has made me want to punch through a wall and has been horribly insulting narcolepsy is a very misunderstood and badly stereotyped illness and its a damn shame could you have it sure cant know till you go through the sleep study process and meet with the right doctors but it is a fairly rare disease and there are a lot of things that cause the chronic fatigue exhaustion and need for naps that youre describing and for your sake i hope its not narcolepsy because i wouldnt wish this lifelong curse on anyone regardless of what it is its obviously not normal and is something you should continue to speak with doctors about and seek answers to there are a lot of different things that cause chronic fatigue or being extra sleepy and its worth investigation and seeing if you can remedy it unfortunately narcolepsy is not curable and for a lot of us the treatment options suck and hardly help there is no normal for us nor any hope to return to it not being capable of getting restful restorative sleep is the core of narcolepsy and its miserable it felt like i was being cursed when i was diagnosed but then comes acceptance and then comes understanding it may not change how bad it sucks but it sure does feel good to know theres a damn reason for it and im not just lazysleepy for no reason best of luck to you not necessarily he worked up from low level cashier to a higher position it is not uncommon for retailgrocery chains and such to cut higher paidhigher level positions and either replace with lower paideasier to manipulate workers or expect existing workers to cover the slack of an eliminated position to boost profitscut payroll spending despite still needing low level employees to fill shit jobs with constant turnover i wouldnt say that building was thriving in terms of bathroom and kitchen cleanliness it wasnt bad like it was in the articlebecame after management issues but i stayed there for a few weeks during summer 2017 on a couch of a friend who lived there and the shared public bathrooms were gross and that was just toiletsink i cant imagine a shared shower space like this article describes hell nah not abandoned level gross but they werent what id call thriving level of clean nor something id feel good about having to pay to live arounddeal with constantly the kitchens were a lot better than the bathrooms but still pretty grimy and the consensus was dont leave dishesanything in here you dont want to say goodbye to and it was always an ordeal trying to make a meal in any level of peacecomfort maybe these types of setups work for someone who isnt home often or super young folks in their first living situation outside of parents homewhile in college but to think this will work on a large scale for anyone else is delusional levels of optimistic the rent would have to be comparable if not lower than renting a room in a very cheap houseshare since in that setup youd be sharing a kitchen and bathroom with less people than you would in
