opposite side of it though it seems like it was before the yard apartments or whatever those death star looking rentals are id say 4 blocks before those apartments on the right side going towards them i drove by it as well last night you have no idea what that same day was like if op wasis as insecure as theyre painting themselves to be this breakup day theyre referencing wasnt some out of the blue were done event that the girl wouldve been caught off guard and totally emotionally wounded by more than likely dude was projecting his insecurities onto for a long time and they probably had a handful of argumentsdisagreementsbad nights as a result she likely knew this or some kind of serious issue was coming and there had been emotional turmoil for them both for a while meaning it wasnt a smooth healthy happy relationship for both of them that suddenly split on this day it was rocky for some time op is entitled to feeling hurt that she fucked someone that same split day and act accordingly but i also dont think the girl deserves this much hate for fucking around with someone at that time maybe she regrets it maybe not maybe she was so sick of having ops petty insecurities projected into her and being punished for them and just wanted to have fun and feel sexy and wanted again and it just happened to manifest during a highly emotional time who knows op can dump her again if he wants and feel bad about it if he wants and im not saying he is wrong or she is right but lets not pretend to know all the details here often times relationships are over or on break for both parties mentally long before its official not meaning they act on that beforehand but meaning that separation and numbness emotionally is there before this is semantics though person calls to report dog in car asserts that theyre going to break the window to save it car owner sees person attempting to bash in car window assumes theyre a thiefcriminal goes and protects their property since they believe a crime is being committed after the fact cardog owner claims they had the ac running or dog had plenty of air from windowsa cordless fanwhatever window breaker claims they did not and either they truly didnt or person didnt thoroughly check and went straight to smashing i dont know about you but id predict this ends in both parties being told its a civil matter i dont see cops siding with one person or the other necessarily so acting like its so cut and dry thats not usually how stuff like this goes not everyone likes kids wants them or can even tolerate them i absolutely hate kids chances are i would never get to the point of love or even basic likedating with someone with kids unless he lies and hides them from me because thats so far opposite of what i want value

centrally located with vaulted ceilings and unique modern design 1800 with utilities ample street parking available i wouldnt say this is quickly its been a year without any sexual contact intimacy etc if ops girlfriend is completely shut off to finding a solution which it sounds like she is despite continuous suggestions and attempts to work through it then what exactly is op supposed to do here continue to bang his head against a wall getting nowhere completely shutting off his needs and desires to cater to her stubbornness in this relationship hes already waited longer than i feel the majority of us would especially given her attitude at this point she either makes a significant change or a breakup is the only real option go be argumentative somewhere else bud im not going to pretend my personal experiences didnt happen just because you dont agree or like the narrative generally never had problems in nyc cant say that for portland doesnt mean either city is more dangerous than the other nor did i say that or try to infer that bottom line is trimet is unpleasant at best and unsafe at times at worst this isnt in comparison to anywhere else nor does it need to be a competition doesnt matter what public transportation is like anywhere else were talking about here peoples need to go well its worse elsewhere111 is why this shit continues to be enabled and ignored never once did i say either one was more dangerous than the other just that in my personal experiences and those of friends and family more assaultsharassment has occurred on trimet sure one or two crazy dudes may not be a huge deal until it is ive lived in bigger cities including nyc and have been hassled harassed assaulted and stalked more in portland than anywhere else ive had friendsfamily with similar problems as well more consistently here than anywhere and the comments on any thread about trimet show these arent rare isolated issues just wear headphones isnt a solution it doesnt solve the issue especially when these people escalate from annoyance to actual problem and frankly people shouldnt have to shrink down and blast music just to tolerate a commute home among all the crazies by enabling these folks so heavily by ignoring their ridiculous bs were only making things worse this kind of stuff shouldnt be tolerated period i dont know about anyone else but personally i dont care if they make it free im still not taking trimet its not worth the legitimate risks to my safety all the methed out bullshit the genuinely disgusting shit that happens people shittingpissingshooting up during rides the lack of consistent bussestrains the added time it takes to get anywhere etc i took trimet for years and it was always a shitty experience now the way things are no chance you couldnt pay me to take it i know its the only option for some people and i hope it improves but as it stands now its a lost cause for me personally this is a great comment and i agree that op should consider these points and really reflect on how he perceives social situations versus how his wife may be taking them considering hes admittedly had problems with being too flirtatious in the past to the point where its this deep of a wound for his wife i would guess youre not far off here regardless couples therapy sounds in order no matter what thank you for checking back up on us and for your initial comment it brought me a lot of calm at the time and i really appreciated the sentiment regardless of the way things turned out it was really kind of you we are absolutely heartbroken without iggy but are grateful that so many folks reached out and have offered condolences thank you again what i dont know how you possibly reached this conclusion from this post but youre seriously off base shes clumsy cant take direction or suggestion on how to better please her partner just lays there and moans excessively loudly while doing little else half the time has zero rythm and makes no attempts to consistently learn when shown doesnt sound like a sexual ferrari to me i have a foamhybrid and i honestly never feel my partner get in and out of bed and im generally pretty easily jostled when sleeping i dont think its bad for sex at all either sure it isnt bouncing all over the place like a trampoline like some spring mattresses feel but this doesnt impact sex negatively for us at all if anything its more supportive and makes it easier to hold a position without wobbling all over the place i refuse to believe this is real what is this really a thing tell me youre fucking with me yeah shit how did they pull that off even some of these tags around town blow my mind im not that knowledgeable in how people do this shit but where were they at to tag this nice lots of awesome shows particularly jealous of heatmiser how was that thank you 3 thank you 3 i apologize for responding so late i needed to take a few days to process things thank you so much for your kind words and empathy this has by far been the hardest loss i have endured its crazy how bonded we can become to our animals it feels like a part of me is missing im trying my best to heal through this and find ways to honor iggy as he deserved he didnt deserve such a tragic painful end im finally feeling up to the task of following up with animal control and beginning to see what my options are to pursue the owner no amount of money will make this better but i feel its only fair she at least pay for the expenses this caused especially as i was not financially prepared to deal with all of this thank you 3 i will absolutely be going after the woman full force and following up with animal control thank you 3 thank you so much 3 thank you 3 thank you 3 please give your kitty extra loves for me i will definitely be going after the owner thank you so much 3 thank you 3 it really is crazy how close and attached we can be to our little furry family members he was such a sweet little man and didnt deserve to be taken so soon thank you 3 thank you 3 it really does feel that way ive never hurt so deeply from a loss thank you 3 thank you 3
