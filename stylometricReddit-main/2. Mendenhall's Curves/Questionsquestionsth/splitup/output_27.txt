but themselves these types of people feel that they are more entitled to having an unruly pet than anyone around them is entitled to having any quiet enjoyment of their homes that alone should tell you that these arent polite reasonable decent people if they turn out to be and it only takes 1 or 2 minor complaints to see a change count yourself lucky and be glad but dont expect this or assume its the norm chances are there will be pushback either straight up ignoring the requestscomplaints or worse and theres zero reason to label yourself as the bad guy when you dont have to i would stay as anonymous as possible in every way shape and form for as long as you can you dont want some pissed off neighbor causing problems for you having their mutt fuck up your yard retaliation of any kind false cop calls on you verbal confrontations etc yep this is a big one for me im so so sick of the disabled isnt a bad thing toxic positivity attitude thats great if for you youve found a way to cope with your disability that includes a positive outlook and have found a way to manage it to where it isnt a serious detriment to your life im stoked for you if youre privileged enough to be able to look at the positives and find things that your disability doescausesimpacts you that you find to be good or something you appreciate im having a hard time wording this in a way that makes sense but essentially when people go i love about my disability it makes me more quirkycreativeetc or if i wasnt disabled i wouldnt be and i love that quality or like you said the being disabled isnt a big deal if you have the right outlookhandle it the right way crowd im not trying to rip on people who are able to have that positive outlook and maintain that kind of positivity for themselves thats awesome i wish it were honestly possible for it to be like that for me truly but man this shit fucking sucks i would give anything not to be disabled i have no quality of life i never will i know this to be fact theres no fun positive way to spice it up and change it into a motivating inspiring story it is what it is and it fucking sucks give me the benefit of understanding i know my situation better than anyone else have assessed it perfectly and have earned the right to be bitter upset negative in pain and thoroughly sick of being disabled i dont find having a disability cute positive something that makes me me its an uphill battle i rapidly lose every day that causes me endless problems and makes me absolutely miserable theres no adding sugar and sprinkles to that its not an outlook thing this made me cackle who knows maybe they love a high chair this please supervise the children op its easy for kids to get caught up in these types of environments and behave in ways that make it really unpleasant for everyone else who also paid quite a bit to be there many of whom may have flown from out of state please do not leave them unattended i dont care how well behaved you may think they are the worst part of my omega mart visit was loud rude entitled 1214 year olds literally running around the exhibits seeing what they could get away with etc udarkenfolk thats enough if you cant behave maturely and respectfully you wont be participating here at all consider this a warning before a ban this level of disrespect and aggression towards other users is unacceptable frankly bringing a dog to any park that isnt specifically a dog park is a dick move kids and adults alike who are afraid of dogs have been traumatized by them or frankly just dont like them shouldnt have to put up with them at nondog specific parks theyre obnoxious at best and hazardous at worst super interested chronic illness means i can rarely leave the house anymore and simply am not safe walking the neighborhood for exercise but desperately need a way to get my blood pumping and get active again doing so from home would be a godsend thank you for offering regardless love seeing the buy nothing group thrive for everyone this surprises me i was there a few weeks back and it was being over policed person was literally walking up to the car with their bags vehicle had just pulled up being screamed at and threatened with a ticket already instantaneously they were getting way too aggressive with literally every car there none of which were doing what you described that sucks they definitely should be keeping more on top of it if that kind of thing is happening again tough to balance im sure sorry youve been experiencing that done best of luck i mean in a way it is if youre a criminal asshole who is stealing from innocent people and are out endangering the lives of countless innocent people using said stolen vehicle with zero care for yourself and others karma is having your ability to continue to do so taken from you when youre being reckless play stupid games win stupid prizes im glad it was him that died and not the countless innocent folks he chose so selfishly to put in danger with these actions id rather it be him than an innocent bystander who was killed while he recklessly sped down the road i dont know i personally dont value some asshole who steals from other innocent people recklessly endangers countless innocent lives etc on the same level as most human lives but thats just me its truly just going to keep getting too expensive to be alive isnt it this increase might not seem like a lot for some but any increase is crippling for others when you dont have any other option and cant just find cheaper elsewhere and will automatically lose any home you rent by not actively affording the utility eventually youre just stuck at well cant afford to be alive anymore really can i love it did they used to have more flavors i remember this spot as a kid and in my mind they had a few more flavors than this a melon one comes to mind specifically it doesnt make you a sociopath to not like dogs poisoning animals is fucked up and wrong no matter the species thats the takeaway here uafishnamedfreddie if you dont have anything nice to say dont comment this isnt constructive criticism nor is it respectful and it wont be tolerated here same i get that the rain is good its still disgusting out the majority of the year here especially now that summers are less and less mild and come with fires and heat waves and the wet cold windy darkness is depressing and awful you can be happy for the benefits of the rain and still absolutely hate it jfc my one fear is that a retheme of rock n rollercoaster will bring a greater retheme to the area and be the end of days for the tower of terror the coaster area is already a bit of a mess imo and it will be hard to do a major rebrand that feels cohesive with the tower area and also pushes some ip which is all disney seems to care about these days ips everywhere i have absolutely nothing to base this on aside from past experiences with disney and their bad retheming decisions but i greatly fear they will tie the two together eventually and a major change for one will mark the final timeline for tower before they absolutely ruin that beautiful timeless attraction i do agree the coaster could use a faceless at least retheme at best agreed i have the brother lb5000s and started out on it and though it has a limited hoop size its great for making patches and getting the techniques down as a beginner this right here came here to say similar i dont give a flying fuck which people use say whatever you want i have much much more important things to worry about than nitpick over language what a tiny unimportant thing to waste energy on as if i have any to spare all i remotely care about is that the person addressing or referring to me is being respectful and frankly if they arent i dont have the energy to give a shit then either ubigreplacement9202 consider this a warning rsmite is not the place for politicsthese types of topics or debates getting into a bicker session with other users about terfs has nothing to do with smite and will be removed as such and telling a user to argue with you via dm doesnt qualify as respectful polite conversation either if you dont have anything nice to say just dont engage thank you ubiwrecksual thats enough keep the arguing and general nastiness to yourself this isnt the place for it likewise this is not the place for arguing about conservatives or steering any conversations to any topic unrelated to smite terfs politics etc are not considered smite related topics and steering conversations to these offtopic directions will be removed i suggest in the future you refrain from commenting on how happy you will be that other users will die alone this isnt considered civil respectful behavior and in the future will lead to a temp ban if you have a problem with another user report it to the mod team and disengage thank you does your landlord live in the same unit as you or something this sounds over the top and beyond what a lease can enforce oof hopefully one day youll have a place with more freedoms good luck with the kitty proofing its so hard sometimes all the things cats hate sometimes become their favorite things youre joking right tell me youre joking i had to make an allowance for this as well the main omad site everyone links goes into why diet soda is big bad but i cant drink coffee or tea for caffeine all kinds make me feel sick and jittery and need the small doses to survive im narcoleptic this is a nonnegotiable part of my day i need something to survive id say as long as you arent downing 10 a day youre good we all have different needs and dislikes and as long as youre noticing the results youre happy with youre good op threw a tantrum ran outside to the beach at 11 at night expecting him to follow her like a child they didnt talk for 2 days etc and has now thrown away a bunch of her clothes over an offhand notthatbig of a comment about her attire after a long travel day sure husband might not have been kind and tactful but op is acting like a petulant child over it and i wouldnt exactly be rushing to try to make it up to someone who has this big of an overreaction to something most adults wouldve maturely addressed together long ago couldnt agree more op sounds not all right herself with this massive overreaction google isnt anyones best source for this kind of thing and it shows that there was major lack of care and empathy from her towards her husband to take some online results and decide to turn on him immediately jumping to hes a monster and im no longer viewing him as the father of my precious babies i need to protect says shes either got serious issues herself was already looking for an out and has found an easy scapegoat or a mix of the two attention too many
