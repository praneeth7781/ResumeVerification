is filthy111 clean constantly111 is just not how i choose to live you cant eradicate 100 of the germs around you and many people still get sick even with all the over the top prevention measures im on vacation to relax and get away not glove up and spend a week in a neurotic episode over a potential germ if youre not into role play it seems like it wouldnt be that much of a value for you i havent gone but from everything ive watched and read part of why we decided not to go when we originally had booked for december was the fact that we are not big role play people improv isnt our thing and we cringe at a lot of that stuff in the moment and cant just dive into it and the itinerary really relies on you being engaged in the story fully 247 we do get into costuming for ge but the level of interactive improv on the starcruiser seemed a bit much for our comfort levels coupled with the exhausting schedule i have narcolepsy i cant get up at 8am and be gogogogo it wasnt justifiable for us even though were a 10000 on the fan scale i regret canceling a bit now that its closing because it does look amazing and there may never be another thing like it and we love ge but for the cost it seems you need to be very into role play to get your moneys worth of the experience people acting like it made things complicated or confusing or like it was forcing them to overplan boggle my mind it takes 5 seconds to make a park pass reservation its easy straightforward and they explain it and tell you you need it in countless places dining and fast pass reservations have been a thing for ages you werent just able to waltz in and do everything without putting a single thought to it before nor is it realistic to think thats how a vacation like this would ever work adding a quick i want to visit this park first reservation to it doesnt somehow make it a huge hassle i dont mean this to taunt you rather im hoping that putting things very bluntly will motivate some self reflection on your part how little self respect must you have to not only stay with someone who cant even accomplish the most basic human upkeep and maintenance but consider staying with them if they lie to you about it on top of that showering and not smelling like shit is the bare minimum its not a wild boundary or expectation to have or set 99 of people do this without needing to think about it its just a given a core part of their routine how you can even stand to be around someone like this is beyond me its disgusting rewarding this filthgoblin with sex and affection is truly mindboggling 99 of people would run from this man the second he refused to showeruse deodorant the first time not reward him with sex and a relationship the fact that youre even asking what if he lies says a lot here you need to do some soul searching and figure out why youre okay with these behaviors and are willingly choosing a relationship with someone most people wouldnt want to share an enclosed space with you even say it doesnt seem mental health related thats even more of a reason you shouldve laid down a firm ultimatum about cleanliness standards long ago and left if it didnt improve therapy sounds like a good path for you uh yeah it absolutely is i am fucking disabled im at a major disadvantage vs those who are not disabled im weaker physically mentally and can do far less my life is substantially harder and i am substantially more miserable if thats not a weakness i dont know what is im sick of people trying to reframe disabilities as a positive or not that bad or something that makes you you or any of that its a horrible constantly draining curse its a lifelong prison sentence there is no positive here and its not offensive to me when people see it that way because thats the way it is this is not the case for tron as i said they may be flexible in some circumstances they were for me but i had a das related reason for being late but dont bet on it it is being strictly enforced in most cases watched them turn people away numerous times and it has been posted many times here that this is the case this is blatantly false you have a one hour window after your group is called and for tron it is absolutely being enforced in manymost cases they are more flexible with early group numbers as long as you head to tron the second you get into the park but even then some people have been turned away if it was a value resort youd never stay there would be booked up forever or the theming would be lackluster and not as appealing like aoaall stars stimulant medications used for narcolepsy treatment are also a problem with this wide variance in side effects and effectiveness some generics im fine others i will have 30 debilitating migraine days in a row and fall asleep in the showerdrivingwalkingdoing anything it makes dlr feel so tiny and lackluster to me honestly i had leaving disneyland and being in a pretty unappealing stretch of anaheim part of the appeal and magic of wdw is being immersed in the experience and having beautifully maintained wonderful resortsfoodplaces to relax all around you vs walking out to all the gross chaos 100 its such an abusive ride i always do it because oh its space mountain i have to and i always regret it the disneyland sm isnt even the best ride on earth but in comparison to wdw feels like im trying to hoist myself up and crawl out of the crypt on the exit always glad theres stuff to see in the edit hall because i spend a solid 510 collecting my sanity there everest is definitely something to work your way up to if youre coaster resistant the commenter you responded to is probably good to give it a go but op it wouldnt be my first or second choice for overcoming a fear of coasters i ride it every trip and every trip i hoist myself out of the ride car stumble to the exit and say i think that took 20 years off my life its a beautiful ride but the backwards sensation is intense for mesome at least and the yeti soundsoverall pace makes me very tense that said its very fun and i never skip it but its definitely a lot to handle also on a side note space mountain wdw version anyway while not as intense feels like it takes 50 years off my life and leaves me feeling shaken and abused oh 100 i am pretty antikids in general so im usually very good at weaving in and out and dodging them but man wish it wasnt like an obstacle course where children are the obstacles 99 of the time thats why lateclosing time is the best this comment was a wild ride ahem thats a pretty hilarious story though i love mr toads and loved it as a kid but im also a weirdo and my parents had no concept of age appropriate so that may be why im pretty surprised it has survived with the hellscene but im glad its still there no lies detected i am with you agreeing with the person you asked the empty beautifully lit peaceful park on the way out after close is so special you can really take in the lights and the music and slow down and not have people running into you or ramming you with strollers and its just really comforting and relaxing plus you can get some great photos without the crowds in the background there are too many things to factor in to call lower cost of living in itself a net positive you have to factor in things like having family nearby established support circle nearby general absurd cost of moving to a new state losing benefits moving to a new state such as expanded medicaid in some states or food stamps not being able to establish a healthcare team of comparable accessibility or quality in a new place etc etc etc i rely on medicaid to survive and live in a high cost of living area im barely making it and its only getting worse all the time but i cant move somewhere without expanded medicaid nor can i move somewhere id lose my food stamps access to my specialists it can take years to get in and established with new care teamsmedical groups for all kinds of things and thats just the tip of it the rent may be lower but ill drown either way so yeah thats why a lot of us stay put this whole move to lower cost of living areas is the illusion of choice for many of us poor folks its not ever truly on the table all the time sometimes it hits me harder or longer than others but it never fails to throw a blanket of sadness over me no matter what im doing i lost my stepdad very unexpectedly last january and it has been hard to come to terms with the finality of this loss and all the missed opportunities i shouldve taken when he was alive to do more and spend more time together this week a few times it was i wouldve loved to have gifted him last week i was driving to the store and heard a song from a musician he really liked that i was excited to show him i had a really bad one a few weeks back when i was daydreaming about how cool it would be to get to go on a trip with him and my mom some day but that day wont come and my mom will never get to have those experiences with him again and how must she feel every day if this is how im feeling now it happens all the time it never feels good i try to treasure that they are still on my mind and imagine how they wouldve felt about the thing i wanted to share but it hardly makes it any easier im so sorry for your loss insomnia is 100 possible with narcolepsy dont let anyone tell you otherwise or act like you may not really have it because you cant fall asleep at 8pm a huge part of this shitty illness is not being able to sleep when you want to but being exhaustedneeding sleep at inappropriateunwanted times in some places theres fee caps or like here in portland for as horrible as this shithole city is they at least have a first come first serve ordinance for applications 100 doing better is knowing that you are not in a place to provide a stable financially secure better life to a child whatsoever im not saying children raised in poverty cant have a good life but as someone who lived through it as a kid the bad moments were far more frequent than any good i can truly say i wouldve rather not known life given the choice than deal with the instability food insecurity financial worries etc growing up poor often means starting life as an adult poor too i was set up for a lifetime of pain and suffering especially ending up disabled my mom is still struggling and impoverished the way to do better here is to know that its not the time to do at all i
