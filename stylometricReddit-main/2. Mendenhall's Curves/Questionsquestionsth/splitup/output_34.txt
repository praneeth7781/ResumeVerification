work against you specifically thats absolutely absurd and no one here is buying it just because she couldnt provide you anything in writing doesnt make this some grand conspiracy youre not entitled to have the answer given to you in the way you deem acceptable and you can be denied entry for any reason this is not the call out post you think it is this is 100 it in my opinion its clear op has never truly faced housing insecurities and has been privileged enough to avoid facing the situations you describe not all of us have had that luxury ive moved every single year for 10 straight years before moving into my current place february 2023 will be two years here it was a scramble every time rent was raised or they didnt offer me a month to month after my year term was up in order to turn it over at a much higher cost since tenant protections have a cap on rent raises here each time i had to leave one shitty place frantically with no real savings since rent is so damn expensive how do you put money away just to find another shitty place nowhere ever felt like home i was always worried and always monitoring craigslist and rental websites ive had to live with black mold meth addict neighbors stealing my shit had to occupy a unit while it was flooded with ankle deep water no heatpower no hot water etc etc the list never ends the place im in now is amazing but im scared 247 even after almost two years if they raise the rent at all ill be out the market now is so bad i wont find another place theres nothing not even another really awful slumlord owned shack it will be a death sentence for me as a disabled person when the private landlords i initially rented from informed us they were hiring a sleazy shitbag property management guy it felt like the world was falling apart around me things couldnt just remain chill of course wed have to face the road to the end sooner rather than later i took one look at the rental market and decided to update my will instead of investigating further when the time finally comes and the rent goes up here its more likely to be useful than anything else i get it owning is stressful and expensive but not having to live at the mercy of shitty landlords who can raise your rent or force you out at any time for any reason at all is worth every cent this is no way to live being trapped in forced poverty on top of it truly terrible yeah agreed i get the sense most of these people havent traveled much or explored other cities scenes whenif they have theres nothing in portland that isnt done better elsewhere she posted that to manipulate because she knew it would tug at the hearts of the kind of gullible people shes aiming for thats such transparent lazy classic sob story bullshit exactly if youre genuinely on a tight out of pocket budget trying to make magic happen out of the goodness of your heart your first stop is probably not endlessly browsing mercari and then over sharing your sob story to get people whose circumstances you dont know and could need the money at full price since these apps are people selling not businesses to lower their prices theres enough red flags in her two messages to decorate this entire fictional gym shes referring to trauma based children this one could just be meme being nitpicky but what trauma based children makes no fucking sense this is not how someone working with children whove gone through trauma would word this i feel like it sounds fake as hell like someone who is scrambling for a background for their sob story trying to come up with something legitimate but failing but again this one is probably just me being picky lol but the fact that she opened the conversation with it my rule and ive never been wrong is that if someone begins a conversation by over sharingpresenting a sob story its bullshit 100 of the time its not relevant yet not that it ever would be necessarily in that first message shes just trying to manipulate from the very first second transparent as hell not even remotely clever then that second message immediately after whats the best you can do were right back into the sob story whats the lowest you can go youll be helping boys who have no one doesnt take a pause just immediately launching into the poor me how low can go you for miserable lonely children the one that killed me was the really not trying to low ball you or whatever they call it like lady please youve got to be kidding me you werent born yesterday we all know what low balling is how transparent can you be i cant believe some of the comments here are making it out like this person was clever or potentially legit or somehow very good with this message 010 lazy sob story transparent as ever i personally really hate the i shop on this app all the time but this is out of my pocket and im on a tight budget shit too while trying to throw a pity party about wanting to make something magical for these apparently traumatized kids if you care so much and you shop for yourself all the time it should be no problem to pay a reasonable price either what op is charging or by making your own reasonable offer without all the bs messaging to do that for them why is it this strangers job youre joking right this is a very good sob story to you good grief they went right into the normal poor me youd be helping in need who have nothingno one right away this is as uniform lazy bullshit as it gets i mean op even said she recognized she was smelling gross long before engaging in sex with him that day and said fuck it and went for it anyway with no warning im not saying the guy was nice about it or that it isnt a natural thing for some women but if you realize you arent smelling great what the hell is wrong with you that youre going to let someone else put their face in that without warning or even a shower after a 3 hour drive and full day have some basic respect for them even just a im just coming off my period lets save oral for another time wouldve sufficed here that plus unloading on him that after one meeting she had feelings for him probably was enough for him to part ways before getting more invested in a situation with obvious incompatibilities haha im tempted to do the same i have all the materials to do it right now but havent touched my cricut in ages because im too exhausted and dead to craft most of the time i guess theres no better time than now thats definitely what it is a lot of the time especially with people who dont have any tattoos or arent heavily tattooed themselves and while i get it its also so frickin boring and lazy and it seems like no matter how respectfully i try to shift the topic or give the vibe that im not really excited to talk about it people just dont give up and keep going on about it feeling like google for peoples every question about tattoos how much did it costhurthow many do you havewhats the worst spothow much do they typically chargewhat do you think of this ideawhat is the story behind every single oneblah blah blah has gotten so so old after decades of wearing these tattoos x200b i definitely was like that at first too the first few pieces i got i felt they needed to have a story behind them and have a deep personal meaning but after that i found myself preferring to get tattoos just for the sake of the artbecause i liked them and the way they lookedetc its really obnoxious when people without many tattoos or who dont have any at all keep asking about the story behind my pieces what do you mean they dont mean anything isnt the point of tattoos to have a story behind them there has to be a story behind them groan dont shit where you eat is a saying for a reason mightve turned into a hot thing for you once mightve been an impulsive and dumb drunk night for them but trying to make this a regular occurrence is only going to add drama weirdness and a whole bunch of extra shit extra shit that it already appears your roommate and his fling are too young stupid and immature to handle respectfully and responsibly you dont want to add all those elements which have high potential to go south real fast and get really negative to your living situation im glad you ended up enjoying it but this was absolutely disgusting to do without prior consent on their part and shows a lack of maturity and sexual maturityresponsibility all around best to keep your roommate situation sex free youre young it may sound fun but you do not want to deal with how uncomfortable and problematic your home life canwill become ifwhen things arent so cool anymore portland oregon a heavily tattooed city in general and its still constant thank you so much ill check these out really appreciate all the info yep you nailed it if i could go back in time id never get a single visible tattoo im so fucking sick of being asked about them im so fucking sick of people pointing them out sick of them being the first thing anyone sees when they look at me sick of the assumptions people make about methembecause of them sick of people expecting me to be a tattoo faq pageendless google search bar at the drop of a hat sick of people using them to flirt make jokespuns think they know something about me etc leave me the fuck alone about them and in general thanks im sure a facial scar or visible scarring in general is the same way youd hope people would have more grace about scarring than tattoos given the nature but after decades of wearing tattoos around i doubt it people are straight up dumb as bricks about this kind of stuff and really have no sense of boundaries the worst that said i think ops scar is striking and doesnt take away from his face at all i totally respect wanting to cover it up but i hope he doesnt feel self conscious about it unrelated to the op but do you have a uv eyeliner recommendation by chance i keep meaning to find some yep not a lot of room for anything that isnt echoing the delusional levels of positive ignorant to all problems this is fine outlook here sadly im not saying we had better choices kotek was one of three equally terrible options and we really should all be feeling pretty devastated by all three options laid out in front of us we really werent given any suitable choice here whether you think kotek was the better of the three or not shes what were getting but if you think for a second that shes going to enact any meaningful change youve completely ignored her history and are choosing to be ignorant to the way things are at this point people werent frustrated with having to vote for her or choosing to vote against their own party to vote against her out of exhaustion with the current state of things because
