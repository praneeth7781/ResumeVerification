contact with serving dishes utensils and tableware pet dogs are also not allowed on chairs tables and other furnishings 3 employees and consumers may not provide food to pet dogs 4 pet dogs must be on a leash and under control of the consumer at all times 5 at no time may pet dogs be permitted to travel through the indoor or nondesignated outdoor portions of the food establishment the entire code and other related regulations can be found here x200b it sounds like youre courteous and doing your best to follow the rules the best you can which is awesome i know a lot of places dont enforce any of this which im sure probably makes it that much harder to know whats actually okay and whats being allowed yep and fortunately it doesnt need to be made into an argument of you hate dogs or whats wrong with dogs because it is not legally permitted dogs are not allowed inside restaurants bars etc period dogfriendly patios are allowed with certain restrictions which many dont follow unfortunately but at no point in time should a dog be in a bar like pictured in the op its not a matter of hating dogs they simply dont belong there and the law agrees yeah there absolutely is and for good reason dogs are not allowed in restaurants or any other establishment with food being soldservedhandled dogfriendly outdoor only patios are allowed to exist with the rule that employees must at absolutely no point pettouch or come into any contact with the dog and the rule that dogs are not allowed on any tables chairs any other furnishings and may not come into contact with dishesutensilsetc a lot of these dogfriendly establishments dont follow these rules at all unfortunately but they are very clearly laid out in law if any portland restaurant is advertising as dogfriendly in that they allow dogs inside the establishment thats a huge no and is definitely not permissible in oregon or the rest of the country as far as im aware you dont have to be a dog hater to point out that animals are not allowed and dont belong in food establishments please also tell that to seemingly half the bars restaurants grocery stores etc in portland where people inexplicably have dogs no not service dogs inside without a care in the world yes even if its the first time this was out of the ordinary and is not typically something that happens when both partners are enjoying a sexual encounter this is a clear signal that something was off she may be wondering why you didnt check up on her or ask if something was wrong and have just left it to pass or it may have been as little as her being irritable and tired and not as in the mood as she had hoped and you had thought in which case she can say that and you both can move on adults in adult relationships communicate this isnt a big deal and doesnt need to be made to be one the other night was everything okay anything you want to talk about just wanted to check in is all easy done i mean my partner and i are huge sw fans and we absolutely love galaxys edge yeah wed love if it wasnt tied to the sequel trilogy as much though ge west is doing a good job of bringing in characters that arent which is great but we still love it there i would love this im pretty indifferent towards the films but i love pandora in the park such a beautiful and peaceful area even when crowded and i really adore both rides thank you for reminding me about their fries i totally forgot about them theyre pretty simple but theyre super easy to inhale and the dipping sauce i remember being great their pork belly bahn mi is excellent too and their ketchup something about it when mixed with the truffle oil is so good 300 is what i paid for my 3 year old 14 pound cats cremation this included a clay pay print fur clippings ink paw print and basic bamboo urn box that is free with their cremations it was about a month from drop off to getting him home and it was a private cremation different places will charge different prices always if you felt respected and treated with dignity and received what you paid for it was worth the price imo uhawtpackage if you cant be respectful you wont be participating here at all this is a warning thats enough im not sorry to assert that no im not going to administer narcan to a stranger who may attack mecause me harmmay in someone attempt to hold me liable to the outcome of the event not even a little bit i dont want people to die and my attitude isnt you chose to die sucks to suck but i need to watch out for me first in this kind of a situation because i am not going to die or become seriously injured at the hand of someone else who in fairness did make the choice to get into the situation in the first place thats just called selfpreservation thank you and thank you for the tip his birthday is early february so ive been on the extra active hunt for a copy really appreciate it cooking stinky food can and does disturb other tenants depending on the building imagine thinking youre entitled to doing whatever the hell you want in your unit without anyone saying anything about it or disturbing you but not understanding that other people also want that same right and should be able to enjoy it its a fine line and its hard to find a balance but if your activities are making another persons home smell consistently horrible thats also not okay if no one picked up the blade runner vhs please please consider me ive been looking for one for over a year now my partner treasured his and it somehow stopped working and he was super bummed and ive been looking everywhere but havent been able to find him a replacement thank you whats your point disney isnt exclusively for kids its for everyone and it surely isnt for entitled parents who leave their shit everywhere like its their house get outta here yeah im wondering this as well i never understand how people come here complaining about their sexlesspassionless marriagesrelationships when they state in their op how it was almost always this way to some extent if they werent sexual with you at the start what made you think it would be fulfilling for your future you signed up for this well not the cheating with the stripper thats another story but the dead bedroom red flags were waving obviously from day one it clearly hasnt changed even with years of marriage and therapy it wont change now that she has cheated in front of you there is nothing to save walk away or you lose the right to complain why the hell would the response to ops spouse cheating in front of him leaving him feeling angry hurt confused and resentful be to let her go on some dates with someone else and consider opening the relationship op has been mistreated long enough before this happened she doesnt get a pass because it was with a woman and she may have a repressed sexual preference op needs to be done here if he decides he wants to repair it instead that happens through counseling not letting her run off to keep getting her way while he sits waiting for her to be a real partner i typically dont keep more than a months rent or two in there at a time though these days thats a few grand as im too paranoid ive never been super well off and cant afford to lose when things go wrong or numbers get stolen but i dont keep it sitting at 0 or overdrafted either so im not exactly a high value customer but i suppose not a problem client either thats good to know and be aware of though thank you heh yep i totally worded that weird not sure how i did that definitely dont eat during surgery it sounds like what ive been told in the past regarding chargebacks is not the case and thank you for correcting me i was always told that more than a very rare chargeback here and there made you an unattractive customer to your bank and eventually may lead to them no longer wanting to do business with you not meaning an outrageous amount of fraudulent chargebacks of course thats a different story i have only done a few in my lifetime and havent really needed to much fortunately but ive always been really nervous about ending up in situations where id need to because of what id been told not that i want to do business with companies i expect to have to do chargebacks with common sense would say hey dont do that but there have been times where ive had to spend extra or go through a lot of hassle to buy something from a company with a better policy because i was worried about being screwed if a package was lostmarked delivered but not received or something of that nature because i didnt want to end up filing a chargeback and looking negative to my bank ive been told by family who work at banks in relevant departments as well as by agents at my bank that though its not a this goes on your permanent record situation it is a negative mark towards you as a customer chargebacks not fraud disputes and more than a rare chargeback here or there makes you an unattractive customer to your bank which may eventually lead to them no longer wanting to do business with you i dont know that to be an absolute fact and thats awesome if its not the case because sometimes a chargeback is necessary and when ive had to do it im always worried that banks look at it negativelydont like when customers do it or that i might lose because again i only do it when necessary and i really dont know enough about it to know what the whole process is ill have to look into it more i suppose i didnt mean to state that as an absolute fact or anything just what ive been told x200b also regardless i shouldnt have to file a chargeback with my bank and wait up to 90 fucking days after a driver steals my food or brings me a completely wrong order the company should be better about those problems ive been told by family who work at banks in relevant departments as well as by agents at my bank that though its not a this goes on your permanent record situation it is a negative mark towards you as a customer chargebacks not fraud disputes and more than a rare chargeback here or there makes you an unattractive customer to your bank which may eventually lead to them no longer wanting to do business with you regardless i shouldnt have to file a fucking chargeback with my bank and wait up to 90 fucking days after a driver steals my food or brings me a completely wrong order the company should be better about those problems yeah sounds like op is either 1 trollingcreative writing exercise stealing the plot of an actual law and order svu and no doubt some other csi type show im sure but ive seen the svu one episode plot or 2 its his girlfriend setting this insanity up and blaming the ex where exactly are these 30k livable houses they couldve bought because nope not on this earth
