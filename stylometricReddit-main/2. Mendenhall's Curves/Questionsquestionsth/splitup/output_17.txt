want is you and acting like a petulant child by being sour over it when you couldnt communicate like an adult or because now that i had to ask i dont want it anymore is pitiful now if youve talked to a partner about this multiple times and have expressed that you need during and need them to make a point of doing so in the future and they continue to ignore those requests thats another story but assuming that every single man is going to read your mind assume what your exact needs are at the exact time without being told and will live up to your expectations without any communication well theres a reason youre continuously disappointed and its because it just doesnt work that way same some of the nightmare neighbors ive had i cant imagine buying a unit that shares a buildingwall sure you can get stuck with awful neighbors in a standalone home but youre not literally connected to them its a different beast but still a bit more privacyoptions ive lived in duplexes and unless the insulation is literally the best on the planet fuck no would i buy and sign up to live indefinitely with whoever ends up abovebelowbeside me im living in a townhouse right now and i love it great insulation so the neighbors i share a wall with never hear me nor i them and the neighbor across the shared patio space is generally quiet and very kind so it all works out however before the neighbors across the patio moved in we had a 3 month battle trying to get our landlord to get rid of the tenants that moved in and decided they were entitled to making all the noise in the world and having a constant stream of 20something partyassholes over theyd set up a fucking dinner table in the patio space which our landlord explained to them should be treated as if an incredible fence was in the middle it was not 100 shared between us our side was ours and theirs theirs basically right in front of our kitchen window and blocking our patio doors host loud parties with woo shots every 2 minutes etc one of the pair was a professional dj so anytime they played music on their pro equipment of course it would vibrate my entire house i could hear that shit in my upstairs shower when bathing windows closed on both houses and i wanted to kill them it was nonstop i could somehow hear her talking in my upstairs bedroom with my tv on all windows closed and her partner joked he had measured the decibels of her voice shes so loud lol when i confronted them fortunately they were evicted they had crossed the landlord too many times and this was the last phase of last straws but god i cant imagine what it wouldve been like had i owned this townhouse and they were staying put not that moving when leasing is easy as pie but its a lot less of a mess than when you own i want to preface this by saying that my intention here is not to be a negative nelly or try to shut down your hopes and goals before they even start like you said no one knows what the outcome of your sleep appointments will be if you will even receive a related diagnosis or what a treatment plan may look like for you given that all i can do is speak to some of the variables and possibilities and try to give you the perspective of someone who does have narcolepsy and what that journey has looked like for me even if you do receive a narcolepsy or ih diagnosis your symptoms journey and treatment may and probably will look very or even completely different from mine im not here trying to spread a message of doom and gloom and hope that you dont digest my comment and take it as that rather i want to share my perspective from my experience which may or may not ever be relevant to you purely because i wish someone had told me these things when i was first figuring it out i got a whole lot of stay positive and theres treatment out there youll be fine if you just do xyz and sometimes you just have to roll with the punches and do it even if youre miserable none of which helped no one prepared me for the real realities of this awful disease i am diagnosed with narcolepsy specifically and how debilitating and crippling it truly can be for those of us with severe symptoms it took many years and many appointments before someone was finally honest with me about the true realities for many of us with n i was made to think that there would be a return to normal and that i wouldnt always be behind everyone else struggling to keep up and balance my life for many of us there is no normal and there is no back on top now again every narcoleptic is different some people dont have that severe of symptoms some people respond well to medications especially when their symptoms werent ever that bad to begin with and the impact to their day to day life is minimal for a lot of us however that couldnt be further from reality there is no cure for narcolepsyih it does not just go away and you dont just return to normal which is to say successful treatment may not mean elimination of symptoms or return to presymptomatic state of being and instead means decentslight managementminimizing of some symptoms you mention once im sleeping and able to live like a normal person something that you may have to accept down the road is that this will never happen nih means you do not sleep like a normal person though it can be minimized through medication for some people this is not something that just goes away or stops for most sufferers the road to diagnosis can be years long requiring stressful uncomfortable and sometimes inconclusive testing that may need to be done multiple times and can be very disruptive to your life not to mention ungodly expensive in some cases these diseases are still fairly rare and the researchtreatment plans available are not as plentiful as we would like as such the treatment options available can be cumbersome unpleasant and extremely time consuming to get right and even then many of us find that no matter what medication were on nothing really breaks through the symptoms and at best provides very very slight help but never relief these medications come with their own list of other problemsside effects can be very expensive difficult to get and hard to balance and like all medication management it can be a long road of trial and error trying to find the right combination and a painful road of trying to fight the build up of tolerance once you do find something that works my sleep doctor once put it to me in a way i really did not want to hear but in hindsight wished i wouldve heard much sooner i expressed to him my frustration with n and how behind i felt all the time that i was sick of trying to balance work college and all the other responsibilities i had to try to keep my life in order and stay afloat that i was sick of starting 100 steps behind everyone else so exhausted fatigued and brain fogged that i could barely function i expected some sort of well eventually this will improve we just need to or something to that effect but instead he said essentially well i hate to break it to you but you have narcolepsy theres nothing you can do to erase that we can keep working on medication management but youre never going to not be narcoleptic as much as that might suck to accept acceptance is necessary and acceptance means accepting that you simply cannot do the same things as everyone else like everyone else you have to manage your expectations of your life and realize that you have a disease that will in some ways hold you back whether that means you have to do things slower or whether that means you have to manage your schedule differently maybe that means you cant go to school full time and work full time simultaneously no one wants to limit themselves but if you dont you will crash and burn because like it or not you are dealing with a lifelong health problem that is going to be there actively working against you regardless so you can either accept that and make adjustments so you can manage it or you can pretend that its not a factor and continue to wonder why youre feeling exhausted sick and terrible all the time while everything falls apart of course i was not happy with that conversation at first and instinctually wanted to go youre wrong i can do whatever i want just like everyone else but the more i thought about it the more i realized how right he was its unfortunate and no one wants to face that reality but when youre diagnosed with a disease like nih that impacts your ability to get restful restorative sleep and leaves you with extreme fatigue brain fog memory problems hallucinations and all kinds of other comorbid problems and disorders like it or not you are not operating on the same normal level as a person without nih and it will only harm you to try to pretend and live as though you are before this gets too too long this is all to say that a diagnosis and treatment plan does not likely mean a return to normal expecting that it does is setting yourself up for major heartache and disappointment in the future though you may well find that medication and treatment help a great deal and you are only dealing with some slight symptoms here and there you should also be prepared for a long difficult stressful road of trying to figure all this out and a future where medication doesnt really help that much potentially being prepared for the worst case scenario like that is the best thing you can do for yourself strive to find the best treatment possible hope that it works out that way but if it doesnt start thinking now about what that future looks like how will you manage that what will you have to do to adjust and stay afloat and progress in your life if that is the hand youre dealt what support would you need to be able to adapt and make it through if thats the case what can you do now to make things easier on yourself in the short medium and long term if your symptoms persist as they are now these are all things i wish i wouldve spent my time focusing on and preparing for and getting started on immediately instead of waiting for some potential treatment or diagnosis down the road and going over hypotheticals in my head about a potential time in the future where id get my life going again because that future never really came the way i had hoped for ubarbarianlover if you cant express your viewpoints in a
