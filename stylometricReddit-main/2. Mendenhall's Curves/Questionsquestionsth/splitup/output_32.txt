the store will have either had sex at some point in their lives be in a sexual relationship currently be actively seeking sexual encounters or plan to have sex in the future being sexually involvedinclined in some capacity is the norm its human nature those who frown upon sex judge others for having it or feel that it is shameful are not normal and do not have a healthy rational mentality about sexsexual behavior given that why do you care about their thoughts or opinions what weight does their internal monologue which may or may not include you specifically and will almost certainly shift away from the fleeting second they saw you purchasing merchandise legally at a store if they even noticed what you were buying at all very quickly and you will never be thought about again no one is going home and spending time thinking about how they saw you buying condoms and if they are so what you dont even know them so if youre mature for lack of a better word enough to be sexually active and comfortable doing sexual things with other people you can be mature enough to realize these things and buy whatever you need without stressing yourself out over other people other people dont give a fuck if you see them buying all kinds of shit you arent a factor to them no need to pay more attention to them than they do you also online retailers my friend boom i recently tried to detail to my partner after seeing a post where shes still photoshopping the everloving shit out of her photos as if we havent seen what she really looks like the whole ziedrebecca photo ordeal and his mind was blown he couldnt wrap his mind around wearing a shirt with your partners face on it or printing out weird selfies of them to hang in your house for that matter i just cant imagine doing this its so cringe and stinks of insecurity and desperation bonus points to the rebecca story for being genuinely hilarious nothing like your so wearing a shirt with a highly filtered and edited photo of you on it and then seeing what you really look like in person truly amazing sure but not in the same way as someone who doesnt have casual sex and views sex as something they only valuewant to pursue with someone they feel strongly aboutknow welletc neither person is wrong but they are different viewpoints and mentalities and would make those people incompatible exactly my partner and i dont often do things apart and try not to travel separately unless the situation specifically makes it necessary my partner is also not a huge textercaller in general and finds traveling super stressful exhausting and distracting and finds it difficult to make a ton of time to be on his phone when traveling but i still hear from him at least twice morning and evening when he travels and we keep each other updated with how things are going a i love you hope everything is going good at night etc even if we save the details and stories for when were back in person first solo trip and not even a things are going good howre youthe kids love you is very odd when you couple that with the lack of info beforehand its a red flag i mean shit he had no contact info for her friend no idea where exactly she was going what if something happened given the of aspect of this this couldve been a very dangerous trap for his wife maybe when youre a couple that travels solo often these things arent as notable but this does strike me as super odd super interested would make an amazing holiday gift for my partner who is hard to buy for and who i wasnt thinking about when halloween stuff was still around who has a crazy skeleton aesthetic space in our home that needs more inhabitants how much do you like it its only worth as much as the buyer is willing to pay if you really want it and really like the piece 30 might be worth it to you if you really want it in your collection and dont think youll find the same pieceanything quite like it personally i wouldnt pay more than maybe 1015 for it if i had the extra spending cash possibly more if it was a really big cupgoblet versus something small i like the look and could imagine it looking good in a lot of different types of displays it has a classiness about it that makes it versatile its also pretty dang hardrare to find any uranium glass where im at and most of it is just super genericbland plates and tea cups and its all extremely expensive so thats something i factor in too if its easy to find where youre at it wont sting to pass on this for being a bit overpriced maybe ask her to come down a bit and see if the seller is willing to budge if not ultimately 30 is a bit overpriced in my opinion but if you really like it and cant get it out of your mind go ahead and splurge warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info i mean i get what youre saying but op is claiming theyd never been to wdw ever yet also says the reason they desperately need this reservation is because her favorite memory is dining in the castle at disneyland not saying op is lying but the internet is full of fake sob stories so i dont blame people for calling out the major inconsistency there yep i have narcolepsy this is a daily occurrence for me very much couldve been what happened op usmitecorporate consider this a warning before a ban this type of disrespectful behavior doesnt fly here nor does imitating smitehirez staff however poor a job this may be at that its still considered imitation and will not be tolerated dogs dont experience human emotions in the way that we do nor do they experience emotions in the same way as this specific droid is portrayed as experiencing human companionship isnt a concept to dogs they know where their food is we can anthropomorphize dogs all we want but its simply not the same emotional range or experience i think thats a bit of an insult to droids frankly which serve a purpose have their own thoughtspersonalitiesdesires to an extent can perform useful and complex tasks etc the sadness and companionship the droid youre referencing experiences in andor is more akin to a child or an intelligent andor human companion these are not things a dog is capable of feeling ive worked nights before its definitely a whole strange level of tough totally and 100 a coffee shop totally a luxury no one is more entitled than anyone else which extends to everything of course your choice to have kids doesnt entitle you to anything i think i get most frustrated when people insinuate that they have a deeper understanding of exhaustion or tiredness because they have kids its simply not true and even if it was who gives a shit were all here same playing field no one gives me any considerations and im literally disabled and have a crippling disease that impacts my ability to have restorative sleep people with cancer still have to deal with the same bullshit the rest of us do so why would kids entitle to you anything no kidding i have narcolepsy im incapable of getting restful restorative sleep ever thats not me hyperbolizing thats what this disease is im always mentally and physically running as though im at least 72 hours or more sleep deprived and yet entitled moms will still go youre not as tired as me though you dont have kids absolutely fuck off you dont even know what tired is lady if someone wants to avoid better care that should be their right and choice what you perceive as better care is not always actually better care and quite frankly you dont have to live through it struggle through it maintain through it or pay for it so it isnt your place to decide if its better care or not the person struggling to survive their disability and struggling to survive this life while disabled knows best whether or not theyve exhausted all viable options and if the other options available will genuinely offer a chance at a better quality of life and without too many risks or negatives to negate the benefits or if they have finally run out of better choices quite frankly even if someone hasnt exhausted all better care options they should be allowed to make this choice with dignity and acceptance as someone who cleaned up the literal aftermath of my stepfathers suicide earlier this year people will make this choice when they are done whether they are legally permitted to do so or not being able to do so in a comfortable environment with supervision and dignity rather than the all too common alternatives is a huge plus in my mind no one wants to lose a loved one especially not in circumstances we perceive to be before their time but that is not for us to decide we dont have to live as them we dont have to suffer through their reality definitely time for a cabinet display i agree its definitely becoming more and more rare i never see it anywhere where im at when hunting in person and the stuff i see online is often overpriced in bad shape or pretty basic pieces gotta snag the good stuff when you find it that tray with the glasses alone would be worth it to me they look awesome together really cool pieces the butter dish and the pitcher which is gorgeous by the way are just the icing on the cake absolutely a win thanks for sharing you surely didnt hear right tattoo removal isnt exactly a one and done quick removal process i mean look at a certain point for some of us there is no better quality of life sure having the financial means to actually live an enjoyable life without employment where housing isnt a concernluxury and isnt substandard and where i could actually enjoy things and do activities instead of just trying to scrape by and exist as inexpensively as possible while being stuck in forced poverty would help but at the end of the day my disabilities are only going to keep getting worse and thats going to make staying alive pretty fucking miserable regardless of any other amenities or benefits im afforded it is clear that my disease is not important enough for there to be any major research or treatment options on the horizon to change this or afford me any substantial relief either it is harder and harder every day to maintain any semblance of function there will come a time where it is no longer worth it at all to continue to drag myself through each day it is too damn painful at that point i would like the option to dignified release from this vessel instead of continuing to be trapped in this physical prison i am 100 all for this for those of us who will never have a viable cure or treatment that provides enough relief to maintain a decent quality of life and thats ignoring the financial strain of existing yep this right here disney will 100 make this right with no hassle at all know from personal experience and they went above and beyond but you dont get the internet validation if you just do what youre supposed to and contact them instead of whining online unfortunately it
