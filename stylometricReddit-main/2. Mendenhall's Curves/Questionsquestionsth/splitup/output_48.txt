official mod comments will most likely be ignored playing willfully dumb makes you look just that dumb i didnt say theres shitty landlords because a few tenants put bacon greese down the drain a lot of comments were bragging about all the awful ways theyve treated a property and how its nice to be able to treat their rental home like absolute shit since they arent responsible for fixing it or paying for it and yes that attitude is why a lot of good honest smalltime landlords stop renting their properties out leaving tenants with nothing but shitty exploitative landlords on the market but

will most likely be ignored i mean for someone who has 180 pounds to lose they need more than to just walk around outside and a better diet is an understatement i mean sure he failed because he didnt change his habits and establish healthier routines outside of the meal plan but the meal plan isnt to blame for some people it takes a preplanned diet like that to shift their eating habits enough for it to matter you cant just make small changes when youre that overweight if you cant trust your primary doctor and have to go behind their back and lie to them about major surgery and large components of your health its time to get a new primary doctor what if you have complications from the surgery later on what if youre having issues that could be linked to this surgery or couldve formed because of it but she doesnt know to look or go that route because youve lied about it is that when youll decide to tell her and then have to backtrack on even more years of dishonesty i guarantee your doctor will care more about you lying about your health and impeding her ability to treat you fully than she cares that you went elsewhere for surgery and if not thats how you know she isnt an ethical good doctor and its time to go elsewhere but i highly doubt shed have much to say after you get the procedure done theres no going back whats she going to do lecture you that has no benefit to her as a medical professional which is her only relationship to you she doesnt think about or care about you outside of the appointment whether she would or wouldnt do the procedure isnt really important youre allowed to visit other doctors and specialists and have procedures done wherever you feel comfortable when youre ready maybe your friend had a good experience with a specialist for the same thingthey came highly recommended maybe you couldnt get an appointment with the primary when it was best for your schedule maybe you didnt want to pay for a referral appointment and went straight to the option you knew would handle the procedure there are many valid reasons to go elsewhere for something like this and you wont be the first nor the last person theyve encountered in their medical career who has done so hello ufuffles thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for the following reasons rule 9 meme monday memes and joke posts are only allowed on meme monday which can be indicated

more years of waiting and fighting be glad ifwhen its less but expect it to be a long hard road as it is for mosthas been for many of us it is especially hard to be approved for mental health problems and even more so if youre younger a diagnosis means and guarantees nothing its a long road of proving that youve tried enough treatments medications therapies etc and showing you have enough medical recordsproof people definitely get weird and wild ive seen it all casual plain loud wild way too revealing costumes all of it given seattle weather is much like ours down here in portland plan for the

tripbe easily knocked over in etc im excited for the saturday show to be 21 only for once nothing like underage kids in next to no clothing who have no idea how to behave at a concert to put a damper on an experience and plan to wear something sparklyflashy breathable for the show but with a warm jacket since itll be 60 out all evening i usually wear platform boots to shows since im short so i can see while still being able to balance and stand comfortably you really cant go wrong have fun with it and wear what makes you feel good comfortable and ready to party have fun post some photosvideo if you can enjoy absolutely do not ask to have an album signed during a set that is so incredibly rude and disrespectful trying to catch them by the van merch booth or standing at the front of the stage
