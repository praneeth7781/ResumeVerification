one here can know if what youre experiencing might be narcolepsy or not but you deserve to pursue answersa diagnosis for your woes definitely seek a second opinion and find yourself a doctor you feel comfortable with who listens to you hears you acknowledges you and takes you seriously uwhypayday2isagoodgam rule 1 please if you dont have anything respectfulcivil to contribute best not to comment at all uprestigiousflow465 enough rule 1 should go without saying but here is your reminder and first and final warning if you cant behave yourself and remain respectful and civil in your commenting here you will receive a ban if youre prone to watery eyes at all dont bother with thrive i loved it at first and it looked great but the second you yawn too much causing your eyes to water or are outside in the wind again watery eyes its coming right off in gross messy little black tubes all over your face i dont wear foundation but if i did it wouldve been completely ruined by the tube shedding still annoying to have to wipe it all off with a makeup wipe when im in the middle of doing things and then either have no mascara or reapply it exactly not only have i never done this i cant even imagine doing it theres just no circumstances under which i wouldnt care if my partner was satisfied fulfilled and got his during a sexual interaction it takes a very selfish careless kind of personmindset to do that to someone nonetheless do it every time come up with justifications for it and manipulate to keep it going every time as someone who has witnessed two suicides and cleaned up the brutal aftermath of another i hope they leave it things are going to trigger you in this world period if we cater to every single potential trigger there would be little left because there will always be someone taking issue or choosing to be triggered by something you know what really needs to be done about potential triggers therapy it isnt the responsibility of the world and everyone around you to save you from a potential trigger its yours and yours alone it is up to the individual to avoid a trigger dont look up on the hm problem solved done people do it every day or work through the trigger so it is no longer a crippling issue therapy breathing coping skills theres thousands of books out there to work you through this if therapy isnt an option getting real tired of anything remotely bothersome being erased to cater to the types that cant be bothered to help themselves yet expect the world around them to do 100 of the work 100 of the time then she isnt a sub she isnt asking you to dom you arent having good sex and shes selfish at bestselfish and manipulative at worst end of story it would be one thing if youd never brought this up before but given that you have and theres always excuses its obvious shes aware of the problem and simply doesnt care youre not her sexual partner shes treating you like a glorified sex toy youre her dildo that follows instructions shes not a sub when everything is under her control her demand and her instruction theres boundaries and likes and then theres this theres submission going on but it sure isnt from her i engage in extremely rough dominant sex with my partner im the sub in this dynamic it works because we both love it and are both getting off equally from it theres certain things he does that are things i am particularly fond of but he also enjoys them and gets off from them there are things i do for him that are more for his pleasure but i get off equally from that its a 5050 but no one is displeased or left unfulfilled by any of the acts he finishes every time if not multiple times for longer sessions and i make sure of this i want him to come i cant even imagine being so selfish and terrible that id let my partner do everything for me and not even care enough to make sure he got his that shows how little your partner cares about you you arent her equal in this partnership shes treating you like her pet agreed which is how i and you id say know that were monogamous it sounds like op probably isnt or at least isnt enough to be the type who should be in a fully monogamous partnership with a fully monogamous person nonetheless ever marry one someday ive had partners before my current as in this isnt my first sexual partner and the thought of my current being my last always and forever doesnt bother me at all no negative thoughts or feelings about that at all no but id miss out on nothing it excites me to think about how much great sex well continue to have for many years to come how much more well explore together and how much well grow and gain even more comfort with each other the sex were having now vs 7 years ago is a lot more wild and its awesome not that it was ever bad at the beginning it has always been amazing to me but weve become so much more comfortable with each other in that way and explore so much more than we used to the thought of the future as exclusive sexual partners excites me and i look forward to seeing how much more we explore and the new things well try together thinking about sleeping with other people doesnt interest me at all i dont miss the new partner phase where its awkward and youre not in tune with each other yet or comfortable enough to try much out i dont miss the unpartnered phase where im single dont have anyone to share intimacy or sex with or am trying to find a partner and dealing with the woes of that life stage and i dont have any interest in finding another sexual partner im fully satisfied with my partner theres nothing i am missing or think i could find better in someone else but im also monogamous it sounds like the problem for op is monogamy heh i actually love the gold one on the left in the first photo and the one in the second photo and would wear them as normal everyday clothes if they werent swim material but your comment made me chuckle because ive been realizing my wardrobe is very star warsstar trek leaning these days yep its nuts im not paying 15 for half of an already tiny quesadilla that will leave me still hungry with the option to sit outside if im lucky ill more likely have to stand or go back to my car in shit weather with some homeless nut taking a shit and then hassling me for my foodmoney i miss when food trucks were cheap i miss when everything was cheaper for that matter 100 agree i mean its a cool bar regardless of the 21 hours and the drinks are fun but that sweet sweet no kids window is amazing literally a godsend especially for those of us happily childfree the fact that more bars on property arent 21 is really a problem and a shame abracadabar should absolutely be 21 the resort lounges after 8pm should absolutely be 21 period maybe the compromise for ops example would be ogas being 21 for reservations after say 6307pm even i 100 agree it should be 21 at least a portion of the time nothing like paying 18 pretaxandtip for a cocktail to sit at the bar top in a nice lounge at a deluxe resort just to have some loud sticky whiny little kid in a bathrobe and wet swimsuit smelling like chlorine burnt popcorn and stale peanut butter come in and start screaming about wanting thisneeding thatdid you see thisgive me that adults only spaces are desperately lacking on property im not saying invest in a new pleasure island but please do but capping minors at 8pm across the property in loungesbars and maybe having some adults only hours at a few poolsjacuzzis in the evening would be amazing trader sams is clearly thriving with these restrictions lets expand shall we you cant effectively capitalize on and advertise to adult guests while still treating them like the outlier by making every space obnoxiously kidfilledkidsallowed know what your audience wants please lord not even remotely they dont wake me up at all or give me any energy or noticeable relief from exhaustion they do make me feel like absolute shit though and will likely trigger a headache if not a migraine and completely ruin my day coffee is a big no also most i can do is a soda the only time ill drink any form of an energy drink is the very rare occasion im at a bar with friends the only alcoholic drink i can have is a vodkaredbull have to have caffeine immediately combating the alcohol or ill fall asleep mid sentence at the bar the comedown and hangover the next day even if i only have one is hell on earth i dont get to have nights out really anymore i wasnt aware there have been multiple gun related incidents at sandy hut and the vern thats really unfortunate i was pretty surprised by the gold dust shooting not somewhere i wouldve expected that to happen at saw some of the security video from a friend who is closely connected to the owner and it was pretty nuts i feel for all the staff across those locations i believe they own lay low and double barrel as well but havent heard anything newsworthy from there and hope they can stay safe and see a reduction in these happenings they deserve to be safe at work as does every customer coming in and they deserve good wellpaid security alibi and all those spots get wild on the weekend it shouldnt take gun violence to get solid security and its a damn shame it hasnt happened for the other locations either i wonder if these have all been random incidents or gangdrug related sure she cant go back in time but she already got all the advice possible on this before she had the damn kid she already knows what this guy is about and that her attempts arent working how much more validation does she need either do something about it which if your nagging isnt working means leaving if its something you cant tolerate or stop complaining about it since it isnt important enough to make major changes over thats it those are the options so many places around town i wouldve never imagined this kind of thing happening at that i now cant say that about its pretty wild hoping everyone is fine and those who witnessed the event are able to process it okay as someone who has witnessed similar it does weird things to your psyche do not pick up the bags yourself i certainly wasnt tempted but thank you and youre still alive and well you werent mauled to death or fucking eaten a small dogchihuahua doesnt have the capacity to eat your arm down to the bone rip through your neck and kill you without anyone being able to get it off or pull apart a child and rip it in half i usually go and i like to take medication that is best for my health situation not what the rest of your patients are subjected to based on your preconceived notions if you dont want to work with me ill take my business elsewhere to put it simply like absolute fucking shit every single time and without
