many things quite quickly where i wont be able to enjoy or do many things i once loved ever again sleep is hellish and i spend over half my time wasting my time on this earth doing it such vivid dreams that when coupled with the memory lossissues make it hard to know whats real and what was a dream did i do thing yeah of course i did i remember doing that oh wait nope it was a dream an exhausting dream from which i woke up even more tired than before having no real rest and now i have to try to do it again in real life its like being trapped in some kind of sick torture cycle forced to be constantly living the worst and painfully mundane versions of existence with no idea which are the real actions thatll have real consequences or impacts later sleep inertia is physically painful in ways i cant even verbalize well enough to get basic understanding from others so instead im lazy or choosing to sleep in the hallucinations are so frustratingly vivid and bad that i feel like an insane person sleep is my biggest enemy for so many reasons sleep medicine is a joke at this point for people with truly severe symptoms treatment options are limited and not wildly effective for many my meds dont work a good deal of the time and when they do its barely an improvement and ill only continue to build more and more tolerance until there are no longer any options on the table at all so given these factors what exactly is my hope for a fulfilling life the us government hates disabled and poor people i will be trapped in poverty pain and suffering until i die i lose more and more memory and function and feel worse and worse every day it seems like cant financially afford a comfortable manageable or fulfilling life or to do anything i still enjoy before i cant any longer and there is no job on earth that can accommodate the severity of my symptoms at least if im lucky ill stop remembering any of it at all at a certain point and just black out to the rest of this life this isnt to say you or others cant i envy those who can and im happy for them but they arent the only reality and its okay to feel disappointed or like your life isnt fulfilling and this disease is robbing you of a good life it definitely can couldnt agree more 100 this disease is a curse and comes with the added sting of no one taking it a seriously as it deserves this is the difference i love sw in all forms but this is the first show that hasnt been aimed at children the movies are all trying to appeal to kidsfamilies and the camp is heavy which makes the atrocities fall flathard to take seriously sometimes having a grittier darker sw that appeals to adults is obviously going to hit harder and be able to do more with the concepts anyone pretending this isnt the case is frankly silly it doesnt mean the ot isnt amazing or that the empire didnt do horrible things but when its covered with 100 layers of camp and child friendly filters it just doesnt have the same impact was was this seriously necessary its very clear what he meant plenty women with refer to it that way because its an easier general term to use instead of being pedantic and getting unnecessarily specific when we all know whats being referenced when youre cripplingly poor the price tag at checkout is the only cost you can afford to focus on amazon sucks and major corporations need to stop fucking over workers and everything else they negatively impact but for poordisabled people sometimes these companies are the only options we have agreed i love sw but i also grew up watching it and didnt have a bunch of newer content to compare it to i still love the older films but i can imagine someone coming into the franchise and not finding it as interesting or exciting in comparison especially if its someone who cant overlook the fact that its an older movie and the effects and stuff arent on the same level as the more current movies and shows i feel like i wouldve still loved it and gotten into the franchise had i been shown sw for the first time in this order today but i also have a pretty eclectic movie taste and enjoy the charm of older stuff if she is not like this it will likely be harder for her to enjoy after the newer content this feels like a troll post 100 if it isnt the guy doesnt know you the other redditors dont know you this isnt a funny but questionable joke with a friend who i have that kind of rapport with and make nonpc jokes with situation given that yes those comments could come off as racist offensive and like youre teasing or insulting the guy over his raceracial stereotypes whether you meant it that way or not and who you are as a personif youre racist or not isnt going to translate into a comment youre making to a stranger online so its best to avoid making jokes that can be read that way if you dont want people to assume the worst this is only true for progestinonly pills and the majority of people take combination pills which this is not true for if youre taking a combination pill one pill a day taken at any time is perfect and varying times daily is fine good idea to know which youre on and what the specific instructions are op im not bitter just because im agreeing that i dont get it youre the one choosing to pick an argument with someone who wasnt talking to you in the first place frankly nowhere did i invalidate someones ocd experience by stating that some of us dont get whatever metaphor is being presented here good for you that you think you get it my comment wasnt directed at you move along i know what a metaphor is this isnt a very clear one obviously because most of us have no idea what the hell it is yeah i know zero idea life with ocd is life sitting with your feet replaced by ocd and flowers growing out of your head thats always a clock what it has gotten so bad and gets worse all the time that i have chosen to essentially look at my life and live it much in the same way i would if i was diagnosed with a terminal illness or told i had early onset dementia or something i know that my ability to enjoy any aspects of this life is very limited not and will only get progressively worse each day i know that i am becoming less and less functional all the time as a result of my narcolepsy and memory loss so ive basically erased my priority list and replaced it with a few basic things try to survive try to stay afloat and focus solely on enjoying any moment i can whenever i can because itll all be gone before i know it this disease is hell i truly feel like my brain is rapidly deteriorating i can barely remember what im doing while im doing it anymore whats the point of anything if you arent forming any memories lmfao holy shit this cracked me up ive never gotten a relevant username comment in my entire 8 year span of having this specific account well done happy thanksgiving is is there a reason behind this post do you not remember last night is there something special about this area do we win a prize if we guess did something happen why op personally ive had migraines since some of my earliest childhood memories i also have no recollection of any time in my entire life where i wasnt exhausted constantly sleepy having disordered sleep etc my parents have also confirmed that ive had horrible headaches since i was essentially able to speak and communicate their presence and that i was always exhausted as a young young kid and never able to be woken up on time for anythinghave energy for life so i would say both have probably been there equal lengths of time since my youngest childhood years yep couldnt agree more extremely stupid dangerous selfish reckless all of it put the babies at extreme risk put the siblings at risk of being motherless put her husband at risk of losing his partnercoparent puts them at risk of additional health issues and herself at risk of further complicationshealth problems literally nothing about it was at all smart no one needs to produce a small fleet of children frankly but especially not this close together it is an insane and dangerous thing to put your body through and she did it 100 by choice they were complicated dangerous pregnancies for her and were not without extreme risk to her and the babies and were advised against she needs to close up shop ideally permanently if not for a long time i see nothing wrong with this at all at least at this point in time you have a stressful job that is very demanding and takes a lot if not most of your attention and energy during the week instead of halfassing sexual encounters and being halfengaged because youre still trying to decompress from work and thinking about having to start back up again and maintain focus and commitment the very next day youre saving those encounters for the weekend when you can truly dive all in and this is giving you something to look forward to as a reward for getting through the hard parts of the week this is absolutely no different than when a couple who both work demanding jobs and are too busy during the week to really connect and have date nights set the weekend aside for a nice dinner a movie etc just because its sexsex related doesnt mean it isnt a date night or an opportunity for the two of you to connect connect emotionally and be intimate a healthy fulfilling sex life is pretty crucial to a healthy happy relationship that lasts and it sounds like you have that exploring your sexualityexploring sexually and exploring sexually with your partner are also incredibly healthy important things it can teach you a lot about yourself your partner your relationship the two of you together etc things like bdsm require an intense amount of trust and healthy communication skills youre not just fucking youre growing these qualities and strengthening your relationship yes it is important to have a social life to some extent and to do things outside the bedroom sometimes but some people are less social than others and some people prefer to spend the weekend engaging sexually and romantically with their significant other instead of going out to lunch and being around a bunch of people after an exhausting work week thats not only perfectly okay its perfectly normal my partner and i have a dynamic sort of like this sexually while we dont have a crazy career like you do so we have far more time together during the week and arent as mentally sidetracked with such a crazy workload we have our own challenges throughout the week that make things stressful and preoccupying on the weekends thats us time we will regularly have 12 hour sex sessions that go all daynight where we do all kinds of wild things together explore watch videos weve filmed film new videos for ourselves etc friends will hit us up to do things and the answer is sorry today is
