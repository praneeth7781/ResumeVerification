michaels as well unfortunately adderall has not done a thing for my adhd symptoms nor has any other medication but in fairness after all these years it does very little for my narcolepsy anymore and nothing else has done a thing either the hard part is that adhd and narcolepsy symptoms can overlap a lot attention issues memory problems brain fog forgetfulness etc are all narcolepsy symptoms that are very common does that mean if you have adhd n you have double the symptoms or theyre twice as strong does it make no difference and your focus should be on treating the symptoms not what they come from i have no idea nor has any specialist ive ever seen all of whom have been floored by the severity of my symptomsnarcolepsy i wish i could provide positive helpful feedback just chiming in with my two cents youre certainly not the only one dealing with this combo and issue i know i didnt mean to come off as if i expected that you could i apologize lost my best friend my kitty who i loved so dearly to a violent dog a few months back so its a sore spot for me i more mentioned it in case any part of you can do anything or say anything about it but of course its not your job to fix everything and i totally get that hello ubrokewyx thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for the following reasons rule 3 no soapboxing or rants by this we mean rsmite is not your

will most likely be ignored smash that like and subscribe button for more sick videos like these alright now were onto number 5 of the top 10 intersections to do meth while stealing a catalytic converter and this one is special guys im telling you hey now your privilege is showing those kgw employees have jobs and possessions clearly our most vulnerable neighbors need those electronics and personal bags more than those privileged employed oppressors i personally wont mess with antidepressants of any kind after many bad experiences with them for nondepression related treatments have been put on various forms for migraines nighttime sleep etc the side effects always suck and the time to adjust after stopping them does too my understanding from my doctor is that trazodone can cause physical dependence and cant always be stopped cold turkey as well as trouble adjusting to sleeping without it given the similar potential side effects to a lot of ssris i wasnt interested in pursuing it mom began taking it for sleep after trauma earlier this year she is not diagnosed narcoleptic but its suspected she has had it since her teenage years and it was messy awful side effects impossible to sleep on nights she didnt take it mood swings etc i currently take hydroxyzine which has worked okay for me i like that its a pretty casual medication and i can adjust my dose up and down at will depending on how im feeling it doesnt knock me out unless im already over tired and take a high dose but it helps combat the insomnia narcolepsy can cause and i dont feel groggy the next day as if ive taken something heavy it doesnt do a ton but xyrem is out of the question so im glad to have something a dog that is violent towards other animals is a problem that surely needs to be addressed too thank you for reporting the cat usparda10123 this conversation is going nowhere lets leave it be usteaminbman enough if you cant behave like a mature adult you wont be commenting here at all final warning uluke28 regardless of your personal feelings on the matter the subreddit rules are posted and you are expected to read them familiarize yourself with them and follow them just like everyone else thank you for the genuine laugh i just had at your expense no we are not hirez advocates paid in free gems nor is anyone on the rsmite mod team in any way affiliated with or employed by hirez you are not the first nor will you surely be the last person to resort to that unoriginal juvenile accusation when you arent getting your way on the subreddit no one on the moderation team works for hirez and thus to keep the subreddit running smoothly free of toxicitypersonal drama and rants clogging up the feed we as a team have chosen to prohibit posts of this nature that seek to rant about state of the community topics that no one on the moderation team or in the community has any influence over posts such as yours do not tend to inspire positive productive conversation on the subreddit and often devolve into bickering and toxicity just by looking at the current comments on your post it is clear that this is absolutely the case here as well i would not call these responses a discussion by any means if you have suggestions that you would like hirez to see reaching out to them directly is your best plan of action you can do this by voicing your personal opinion over a ticketfeedback email or by reaching out to them via their direct social media which again rsmite is not regardless of your personal opinion on the rsmite rules the moderation team expects you to familiarize yourself with the stated rules in the sidebar and to follow them accordingly all users in the rsmite community are expected to understand that we prohibit posts that solely seek to express their complaints on certain topics as this falls under rule 3 and as such you are expected to follow this rule as well your post was in direct violation of rule 3 and therefore is not eligible to be reinstated if you repost it it will be removed and continued attempts to do so will result in a ban from the subreddit as you now have been warned and familiarized with the rules and how they apply to you if you feel the moderation team is pathetic and rsmite is not up to your standards no one is forcing you to engage here thank you for your understanding hello uh8m8 thanks for your submission but weve had to

improvement to a supplement powder man i guess there really is something to be said for the placebo effect i do hope you went off zoloft at the full recommendation and supervision of your doctor and not just because you were afraid of the interaction when youre just starting out on a new medication it is best to stick with the medical treatment plan set by your medical professional adding in a bunch of unnecessary supplementation can make it quite difficult to know if the medication is working or not or what side effects are coming from where hello unostradamus26 thanks for your submission
