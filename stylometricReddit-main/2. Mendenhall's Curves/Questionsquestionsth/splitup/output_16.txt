be a bit more in the lead or in control and more expressive of your attraction and sexual desire for her seeing her doing something that youve agreed upon prior like in the conversation you mention and thinking god shes gorgeous im so lucky to be with such a beautiful sexy woman can transition quite easily into vocalizing those thoughts and walking up to her and groping her and starting to initiate some foreplaysex nothing about that screams bad boy or sex you dont have with long term valuable partners if anything youre lifting her up boosting her confidence and sexual confidence and strengthening your sex life by having more frequent fun sexual encounters together x200b and it feels a little demanding on her end when we have such a wonderful relationship outside of sex to also say the bedroom needs to be perfect too although of course she should ask for what she wants and i appreciate her honesty ugh this killed me in case no one else has reminded you yet let me make it clear she doesnt have to settle just because you have such a wonderful relationship she doesnt have to put aside her sexual needs and desires and settle for meh because everything else is great dont think for one second that its demanding for someone to expect a compatible fulfilling sexual relationship that meets their needs and sexual appetites just because everything else is going smoothly that attitude is going to get you nowhere good and very fast just because a lot of us have had to do it doesnt mean its okay or should be acceptable closing and then opening is fucking horrible and shouldnt be permitted check what sub youre on jesus uredneyo for what should be very obvious reasons we arent going to allow the debating of personal opinions regarding rape jokes and their comedic validity this is not an appropriate topic for the subreddit nor does it stay ontopic to smite rule 5 and as such comments further exploring this will be removed theres also a ritalin shortage in some areas from what ive read doesnt seem as bad as the adderall shortage but not a guarantee either its a toss up too theyre honestly not really comparable in effect for some people ritalin does nothing for me energy wise just makes me feel heavy and terrible its definitely worth checking out for those who havent they occasionally do a late night hours event for those of us who dont get going earlier in the day where they stay open until 10 or 11 which gives you even more time to check it out and youll definitely need to set aside a good chunk of time to see it all this place is huge theres some parking out frontright across from the entrance too which if not full really takes the hassle out of visiting they have a really great selection of all kinds of stuff some typical to vintage malls some you dont see very often and everything was really well arranged put together and it felt very clean and cared for it was a really enjoyable environment to browse around in and ill definitely be back took us a solid 23 hours to get through every booth at a leisurely pace but we like to really browse i would say its pretty on par with a lot of vintage malls and thrift stores in portland honestly not to say that some of the prices arent ridiculous because i definitely rolled my eyes at a fair amount of tags there but i wouldnt say its any worse than anywhere else here portland has its own special brand of silly pricing for vintage and thrifts honestly that said its still a really cool place to check out tons of booths with some really neat stuff and some prices will surprise you in a good way too very cool enjoy ive always been intrigued by the craft but it seems costlya bit intense to get into but i love seeing the amazing stained glass things people create i hope you have a good time and enjoy the learning experience yep sounds about right just watched her little tantrum you can tell she really thinks she did something there but she looks like a pathetic petulant child having an outburst ahhhh portland gotta love it youll have to do what everyone else has to do right now call around stock changes constantly a place that had it for one commenter will likely now be out as other people filled there im fortunate to get mine through kaiser so handle everything with them and dont have to branch out but my partner is also prescribed it and its the same thing every month he gets up early and starts calling the pharmacies he used to regularly go to first asking what mg they have only to be told none and then moves through the list calling all the costcos from portland to vancouver to hillsboro and tigardbeaverton then fred meyer starting closest to us and branching out then safeway etc theres a national shortage no one has a mystery in right now stock fluctuates constantly hell sometimes theyll have run out by the time my partner makes a mad dash over with his paper prescription you can try to have your doctor change the dosage breakdown same daily dose different mg pills to achieve that but youre still up against a shortage impacting all mgs ive heard name brand if you can afford it or get an authorization with your insurance isnt as impacted but have also heard it is so who knows i get mine for narcolepsy via mail through kaiser no problems ymmv outside of kaiser but its certainly legal exactly youre not more entitled to sitting because you chose to have kids your kids arent more entitled to sitting because theyre kids hell if anything theyre probably better equipped to stand than some of the rest of us if sitting is importantnecessary to you and you dont get there in time to be seated on the bus that comes you can wait for another bus first come first served im a lady but as a heavily tattooed youngerlooking person i am so endlessly tired of the dirty looks from entitled moms and their bratty kids i have an invisibledisability and i absolutely need to sit but i have straight up heard garbage moms trash talking me because that disrespectful expletive wont move why even come to disney if you look like that this place is for kids my kids need to sit on numerous occasions so neither your bff or his brother is a neurologist or sleep specialist hmm yeah not sure why theyre surprised theyre not someones goto for narcolepsy leave it to ufeetpicsaddict to drop a super unpopular unfun take although i will say i think those of us who want these characters would be thrilled to see them even just at launch bay why they dont do that is beyond me this is such a good point and i somehow didnt even think of it as a solution either this is the perfect balance doesnt invalidate the starcruiser in its current formstoryline when cruisers are visiting and allows for a fair distribution of character interactions most fans want the rest of the time i want to meet grogu more than words can describe but im simply not going to disneyland again at this point you said it have also had a doctor say well it must not be that bad if you arent willing to take as if miserable side effects arent a reasonable deterrent like wo im miserable already maybe i cant risk a milelong list of additional misery either totally feel ya its crazy how little many doctors seem to care about the sexual side effects of those types of medications literally have experienced multiple doctors say well yes the sexual side effects are a real and not uncommon risk but that hardly seems as important as managing depressionanxiety and well yes but if youre genuinely experiencing anxietydepression it seems like that should be a far higher priority than anything to do with sex its not that doctors dont know about these side effects or at least a lot of them seem to its that they dont really caredont see it as importantfeel like you should be fine with it if the medication works otherwise as if losing sexual desire pleasure arousal etc and for some people losing those things seemingly permanently or for a very long time isnt a serious problem in and of itself that can cause depression anxiety serious relationship problems etc i mean yeah when youre going through a mental health crisisdealing with prolonged mental health issues those things do tend to need to take priority but the general attitude around it is really unhelpful and alienating endrant ukhionesnow0216 rule 1 if you dont have anything nice to say best not to say it this is a warning so your argument against higher wages is that if it costs you more its not okay so you think you should be able to go enjoy wdw have cast members working for your enjoyment and being on top of their game but those people dont deserve a living wage if it impacts you gross wait what they switched your adderall are you normally prescribed armodafinil they cant just make a switch to a different medication on their own ah yes im a transplant and where im from i perceive to be worse so therefore yall have nothing to complain about and it cant possibly be bad for you here my favorite it is pretty depressing out there i dont disagree there are a few pockets that have been more recently cleaned up or developed theyve tried to make downtown hillsboro literally a 3 block stretch more inviting and happening and while its cute and nicer than it was its still pretty sad smalltown stuff a lot of payday loan strip mall dirty building wasteland strips as well as a mix of dingy older neighborhoods and cookie cutter newer suburban hoa developments its pretty safe theres some pockets of tomfoolery but not more than anywhere else but very boring and depressing interesting i rented in gresham once many years ago and was almost shot like a matter of seconds and it wouldve been me in my doorway twice no hyperbole shit was like the wild west up there long before portland got to the level of bad it is now im semi surprised ne was worse for you i prefer seattle to portland but know they share many of the same issues so wouldnt want to make that relocation mistake i will say seattle is remarkably nicer in comparison regardless i grew up in hillsboro and have been in various sections of portland proper for over a decade its absolutely a wasteland of filth and insanity now and i cant wait to leave someday ive been fucked with and put in direct danger more times here than any other major city ive been in and ive traveled a lot and have lived in other major metros as well this list is definitely beyond wrong unfortunately hillsboro and happy valley arent exactly the peak of safety and cleanliness either these days but theyre remarkably tame and better comparably gresham on the other hand thats never been a safe suburb which suburbs even sadly i live in portland now this list made me chuckle exactly if you want something it is up to you as a fucking grown adult to ask for it no one is going to read your mind and no one should be expected to either if your needs werent met communicate that if you need something specific communicate that otherwise the only person you have to blame for not getting what you
