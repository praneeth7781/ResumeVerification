this proposal so youd have to incentivize the extra inconveniences and theyd need a cleaning crew in twice a day at least the buildings would also need a dedicated security crew to keep nonresidentstheir visitors out and the rentals would need to be decently sound proof and very comfortableupdated to make this at all appealing to renters i dont see any of that happening but i guess we shall see yeah its the extra drivingtravel to seattle that kills it for me anytime its cheaper its a 335 hour drive from where im at in portland and then you have to factor in parking for the duration of your trip or the cost of a trainbusflight each way and youre adding an extra 3 hours of travel time to each travel day with plenty that can go wrong so its never really viable it would have to be a solid 1000 of savings to be worth the additional craziness thank you so much im guessing youd order from them again no complaints there isnt a ton of info out there on them still but they seem to have great deals so if theyre legit theyre definitely a hidden gem i really appreciate you responding youre amazing thank you i know this comment is 5 months old and i apologize for bothering you but have you ever purchased from baltini yourself im on the fence about ordering from them because there isnt much out there about them except for a ton of bad reviewspeople questioning if theyre a real company but theres a few items i cant seem to find anywhere else so im tempted to give them a chance thank you i did i ended up emailing them a big pdf but i still have the scans if youre looking for them its one of the very few treatment routes for narcoleptics and is indeed a medication prescribed for narcolepsy so clearly it does indeed benefit some of us to some extent there is no perfect medication that will work for 100 of narcoleptics 100 of the time but that can be said of a lot of different medicationsdiseases medication management is often a long difficult road and requires a lot of trial and error before the right or best option is found i have been on stimulants for over a decade and they are the only option for me as far as wakefulness medications go anything less than a stimulant might as well be a sugar pill even then i need an extremely high dose to combat how severe my symptoms are and to give me any semblance of a functioning life day to day of all the wakefulness medications ive tried the only ones that work even remotely are adderall dexedrine and vyvanse you will see plenty of posts if you search this subreddit agreeing that these medications work and you will also see plenty of posts of people who did not have luck with these specific prescriptions and found something else to be more helpful or who are still searching you have no way of knowing what will or wont work for you until you try it you may get lucky and find that modafinil andor adderall work for you right away you might find that they dont work at all and you need to try something else entirely or that the side effects arent agreeable for you you may also find that they dont work enough but that you are noticing some improvement so you might need to adjust your dose try a different type of stimulant try a combination of multiple medications switch from ir to xr or xr to ir etc medication management is usually not an easy road and it definitely takes some patience but i promise you that it is well worth it once you find something that works for you and gives you some relief from this horrible curse of a disease medication management is also for many of us a lifelong battle with stimulants and some other medications a lot of people tend to build up a tolerance meaning the medication may become less effective over time or you may need to adjust your dosage to a higher amount to receive the same benefits this isnt a bad thing its just how medications work and its part of having to deal with narcolepsy and medication management for the disease your doctor is there to help you find the right combinations for you and keep the dosage effective and doing the best it can for you over time if it werent for stimulants i would have no life at all i would be sleeping 24 hours a day every single day when i dont take my medication i might as well be in a coma stimulants are absolutely a life saving medication for narcolepsy then what exactly are you confused about here if she had rejected you because she wasnt into you and made that clear then i could see where youd be feeling concerned shes only asking you out because you saved her father but clearly thats not what happened she didnt want a relationship with anyone at the time and her dad not finding you to be a savory character would only further complicate things going forward so it simply wasnt on the table with you or with anyone for that matter i wouldnt go into this with shes only asking me out because of what i did on your mind theres no reason to be paranoid about that at all with the information youve provided and those kinds of insecurities and worries will only serve to complicate things and cloud your judgement and enjoyment of what could be a great daterelationship with someone you really like dont cloud a good thing with negativity before it has even started anesthesia is horrible for me i cant wake up to save my life it takes an abnormal amount of time for them to be able to pull me out and get me to where its safe for me to be discharged and even then i feel worse than anything can take days for me to be able to do anything but sleep will have to quite literally crawl to the bathroom usually cant keep my eyes open to eat etc uinrisd if you cant follow rule 1 and be respectful in your commentsdealings with other users you will receive a ban i mean its not a greedy request but it isnt a realistic request for many of us unfortunately which is probably why those were the majority of responses you received many of consider ourselves disabled because of this awful disease or at least consider it to be very debilitating i personally cannot work anymore at all because of the severity narcolepsy which has very much become a degenerative issue and crippled me in nearly all aspects of my life highpaying which usually means demanding or significantly skilled jobs just arent realistic or doable for a lot of us because of n it shouldnt be a big ask for us to be able to support ourselves and be comfortable but the system isnt really made for people with illnesses like ours and so a lot of us are stuck in poverty barely able to stay afloat until there is significant reform of the disability system or a serious shift in the job market living wages for entry levelless demanding positions for example its going to be a lifelong uphill battle for most of us sadly the way some of the people on this sub act i think youre onto something with that sentiment it seems like some of these people are not only so willfully ignorantblind to the realities around us but have convinced themselves that stepping on needles and shit and being attacked by unhinged homeless zombies is awesome and something that the rest of us are wrong for being upset about absolutely insane my sleep doctor has offered it to me and sees it as the same medication as adderall essentially i am free to switch between the two at any time for any reason just have to ask its absolutely prescribed still by all kinds of doctors psych sleep doctor neurologist primary care etc she can absolutely send a prescription in for it reach out to your sleep doctor dont let this nonsense keep you from the medication you need but be prepared for there to be shortages of it too right because the only logical explanation for me not wanting the same homeless pantsless lunatic to try to attack me twice in one night and not have my personal property burglarized is that i belong in texas good job big brains on this guy have fun being an ignorant brainless enabler it isnt lazy to want work life balance it isnt lazy to want to be able to actually live your fucking life instead of wasting away in a miserable work environment have you ever been to a typical cvs grim as hell for shit pay yeah i was it was summertime on a weekend so more busy than usual but this is exactly how it went and i really dont give a remote fuck if you choose to believe me or not it changes nothing if you think its outlandish that something like this would occur youre really ignorant to the daily happenings in portland warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info i know very clearly where the nines is i used to work a block away that area isnt a staycation paradise by any stretch of the imagination just because it isnt old town youre joking right where exactly are we supposed to go out of the us its next to impossible to immigrate to another country especially if you arent in a highly desirable field are poor are disabled etc and thats before you factor in the costs to even get there and move possibility of not being able to speak the language get medical care enter the job market etc this has to be a joke i have no problem trying to help small businesses i just feel like this is tasteless and gimmicky and will not have that effect my opinion is just that and doesnt really matter one way or another but my experiences in downtown in the last few years were not welcoming and did not leave me feeling positive or wanting to come back anytime soon a gimmicky scratchit contest wouldnt have changed that at all and if anything wouldve felt humorously insulting ah yes please bait me back with a staycation amongst the very problems i choose not to go downtown to not have to deal with on a night out a lot needs to change and clean up downtown before its going to be appealing to repeat guests again imo and this is a premature promotion that will only continue to highlight why no matter how nice the business may be people arent frequenting them due to where theyre located i dont see how converting to residential would suddenly solve the core issues downtown personally and its wildly impractical but im not saying i have the answers either you knows its bad when they have to come up with silly gimmicks like this to try to bait people to go downtown no i dont want a staycation at the nines even for free because that means having to stay downtown and deal with that general environment nothing is getting me to cross the river to hang out in old town right now either hell last time i went downtown to see a show at the roseland which i wouldnt have done had it not been the bands final tour i was nearly assaulted by a woman with no pants on
