a temp ban this is a warning if you dont have anything nice to say move along this was my answer as well lets start by giving some love to and adding to the existing pavilions that mt fuji ride would be amazing so sad it never came to be not everyone can afford to move some people have jobs doctors sickaging family close by with needs etc some people live in poverty and can barely afford to keep a roof over their head nonetheless the thousands it costs to uproot and start over elsewhere or move further and spend out the ass to commute the answer to violent criminal homeless people turning the city into an open air drug market and asylum isnt well just leave then its a problem that needs solving ive noticed that too i love visiting different parts of florida people seem much friendlier much healthier and happier mentally and physically and the overall vibe is a lot less angry and depressed and dirty the politics side does suck but its not how everyone there feels or lives i have gay friends and trans friends there who love it and have solid communities around them a few portland friends have moved there and said theyd never look back but its a major move wont be cheap and is a major climate adjustment so its a lot to consider im so sorry for your loss what a sweet set up he had its so obvious how much you loved him and how close you both were im sure he cherished being able to be so close to you all the time i love seeing when folks create little spaces to be closer to their pets through their daily routine instead of just setting their bed in a corner and calling it good when i lost my little dude last summer it was so rough coming home and seeing little pieces of him everywhere the house felt so empty and cold and he was missing every direction i looked for me at least it helped to keep some of those little spaces or pieces still around as a tribute it will sting for a while whether you leave anything up or not to look at those spaces where your friend should still be but eventually it will be a cherished memory to look back on hang in there 3 im curious what literally nothing really is like versus how it works at the beginning im not saying this is whats going on for you merely posing it as a possibility because it seems to happen to a lot of people when you first start a stimulant medication though it doesnt have the same adjustment period and build up in your system phase as say antidepressants there is still an adjustment period where your bodybrain are getting used to the medication and the effects are settling in so to speak so at the beginning you might feel great and then about a week later it doesnt feel as great and then a few weeks later you arent really noticing it at all because it doesnt feel like it did in week one that doesnt mean it isnt doing anything it just means you arent feeling the medication in the same stimulating noticeable way which is the point you arent going to feel that buzzy lifted feeling past the first week or so of taking a stimulant at the right dose as directed for a legitimate illness anyway people tend to confuse this with tolerance and with the medication not working at all and ceasing to be effective when its more that the medication has settled in and you are getting passive benefits but not in the same jolt as when it is fresh in your system now that doesnt mean that youre at the right dose or that there isnt a better medication combo out there or something you should add in addition to it just that its important to adjust our expectations of what these medications are for and what theyre really supposed to do in our systems stimulants arent ever going to make you feel truly rested or awake or alert theyre supposed to help take the edge off a bit definitely and make it easier to stay focusedalertfight through that excessive sleepiness and brain fog a bit but theyre also not miracle drugs for the majority of us with nih theyre not going to break through all of our symptoms or even most of them and theyre not going to magically erase the tiredness and heaviness when were on them were still going to have to deal with all the awful shit that comes with these diseases just maybe a little less so or with a little bit more power to push through it were still going to be exhausted were still going to really struggle its just an aid not a pause button likewise its very important to still be practicing good sleep hygiene eatinghydrating super well and generally taking good care of ourselves because if we arent stimulants will do less than nothing are you truly feeling zero improvementeffect after those few weeks or is it just not as noticeableas much of a boost when you take it theres a big difference between nothing at all and something but not strongly detectable and its an important difference to recognize if none of that rings true for you i apologize just wanted to offer a different perspective as i see a lot of people having unrealistic expectations of what stimulants and medication can really do and feeling that because they cant feel anything when they take it their meds must just not be working at all x200b if its not the above i would definitely recommend continuing to try different medication combinations and keeping a journal of your time on them to recognize patterns it would likely be very helpful for both you and your doctors to be able to see the timeline when youre taking these medications things like how it feels at the start how long it is effective each dayyou notice benefits the schedule youre taking them on and what youre eatingdrinkingdoing around those times when youre eatinghydrating in relation to your medication schedule sleepexercisework schedules when you start noticing it becoming less effective and exactly what that looks like each day having a timeline to look at might help youthem to draw conclusions about what is going on is it your diet other medications youre taking sleep hygiene what else is happening in your life when the effects start to dwindle is there any correlation or none at all it might just be that you metabolize these medications faster than average or maybe fooddrink you consume is playing a part in that or your sleep hygiene is very poor and thus stimulants arent going to stay consistently effective no matter how many you take theres a lot of things that can play into this it sounds weird but believe it or not in some cases taking higher doses can make you more tiredbe less effective especially if within the period of a month youre rushing straight to 60mg that might be counterproductive and whats causing the problem you cant possibly decide in the course of a month or less that multiple different doses of a medication is wrong or right you need to give it time to settle and to develop a routine for even just a short time to have a conclusive accurate answer one way or another you might be someone that benefits from er and ir combos er to keep a level all day but ir boosters periodically during times you are prone to crash or use up more energy or you may prefer exclusively ir so you can tailor the release of your meds to the times you need the boost the most but either way it takes time to figure out the best combo and you have to be willing to be patient it sucks but the fact of the matter is those of us with nih are always going to be struggling and suffering from the exhaustionsleepiness brain fogmental symptoms etc the cycle never ends this is a lifelong diagnosis with lifelong challenges the sooner you accept that this is a long trek and not a short race the better yeah it fucking sucks to have to deal with for any length of time and no one wants to be exhaustedgoing through the hassle and rollercoaster that is finding the right medication thatll work long term but its absolutely worth the hassle energy struggle and exhaustion that it takes to be patient and do it right instead of jumping around just trying to make something stick this might take a while for you to figure out and its probably going to suck a lot in the interim we can all relate i promise just be kind to yourself be patient and remember that in the grand scheme of things this phase is very short compared to the rest of your life it sucks to have to accept but the fact is it doesnt matter how much of a rush you are in this shit takes time theres no way around that none of us have wanted to put our lives on hold to deal with this disease but i can confidently say most of us have had to or will have to at one point or another thats just how it works its not fair we didnt ask for this but thats what life with a disease like this is like its largely not on your terms you have to roll with the punches if you havent already reaching out to your academic advisor andor disability services center at your college would likely be a good idea since you mention worrying about dropping out letting them know that you are diagnosed dealing with the long and harsh struggle of medication managementtreatment and would like to make them aware in case you need accommodations and thinking of what accommodations might help you in case you need them going forward would be a great start especially as they may have some suggestions for yoube willing to work with you on certain things nih are very much a disability for many of us x200b best of luck to you thank you so much for such a kind caring response youre amazing so its funny you should mention the high heat after another comment recommended going in and asking to purchase some of the sauce my partner made the trek for me and picked up a small container of it i tried to use it with some chicken i tend to toss in the slow cooker and i found that it didnt taste anything like the sauce i was used to so i immediately figured they either changed suppliersrecipes or it was a me problem because i am a horribly inexperienced cook i would love to be able to recreate the porkyakisoba noodle wok that ns had and it sounds like the key to doing that will be cooking it the same way to get the sauce hot enough if you have any tips to try to recreate this i would be so so grateful i dont know what it is but i feel like we all have that one thing that we crave constantly and always go back to i hate that mine is the porkyakisoba ns wok but i have eaten those for a solid decade and i think going to get them after various doctors appointmentssurgeries kind of trained my body to crave it as comforthealing food so to speak im guessing i will need to figure out buying some kind of wok dish to cook this in to start as well but any tips for this complete novice would be amazing thank you again
