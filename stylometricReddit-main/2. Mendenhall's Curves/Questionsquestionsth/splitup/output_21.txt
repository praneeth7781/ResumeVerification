you hadhave issues with porn addiction or dependency so theres no reason to quit unless you personally dont find it enjoyable and want to spend your time differently youre already masturbating every day what difference does it make if its with or without porn unless youre specifically spending worrisome amounts of time doing it when you do use porn or if the porn use is impacting your sexual relationships with real partners as long as thats not the case and youre not causing yourself death grip or related issues again its not a negative thing there is a very obnoxiously vocal minority that are very antiporn either nojerk bros religious types very insecure folks etc who will tell you quit at all costs its bad negative you dont need it its pathetic especially in a relationship these types are to be ignored theres nothing wrong with watching it nothing wrong with not make the best choices for you based on you alone hmm i would say that this really depends for me on what exactly im telling them in terms of how im doing i have completely given up on explaining my strugglessymptoms relating to narcolepsy to other people or answering how i am doing in relation to this fucking terrible disease people who do not have narcolepsy will never truly understand what it is like period though id say people who live withare very close to someone with it will have at least a better idea they still will never really get what its like to be essentially running as though youre 72 hours sleep deprived as a baseline trying to explain to people im so fucking tired because i am incapable of getting restful restorative sleep ever again in my life is exhausting in and of itself because people immediately try to relatecompare and go to things like oh im really tired too because ive been really busysickwhatever and its never going to compare on the same level and gets so old honestly when it comes to other issues again it depends i no longer explain that i cant do because of narcolepsy and how it is impacting my mental healthhow my life is falling apart as a result because people always come back with well just sleep more or lol i wish i could sleep all the time that doesnt sound so bad nonnarcolepsy related things like emotional woes depression life struggles if its someone i trust i have no qualms telling them how im really doing if they are genuinely asking and want to listen no need to overshare when someone is just giving a smalltalk howve you been type thing yes it can be really hard to put yourself back together but the bottling up of your emotions is only going to make things that much worse no one likes to fall apart and feel that energy drain that comes with sharing the tough deep emotions and struggles theyre facing but its healthy to share to vent and to process and though it may take some time you build yourself back up and can move forward if therapy is an option for you i highly recommend seeking it out it sounds like you need someone to share with and vent to that is there specifically for that purpose and who can help you reframe these exhausting upsetting emotions in a healthy way so you can take a load off and not be carrying the weight of so much pentup frustration and pain yes it would with likely nowhere to really start sending police on a wild goose chase for a bike that likely looks like every fucking bike until closely inspected so not exactly an easy findquick to spot item across the city through hundreds of shitty homeless camps chop shops trap houses squats rvs etc is so obviously a complete waste of time and resources especially when if caught the da is going to do anything substantial so theyll be right back at it in hours and thats assuming theres enough evidence to be able to chargearrest as the oh someone gave me thisbought it on craigslistfrom a pawn shop chain of excuses while easy to see through still has to be trumped with actual evidence and following our legal processes cars and bikes are everyones transportation it sucks when theyre stolen its wrong it seriously hurts the victims and there should be more that can be done but cant argue devoting what few cops we have to pointless chases like this is not a waste of resources because it is warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info its better than zero justice i disagree no one related to this grouparticle was say shooting people point blank in the street for a car they perceived to be stolen they were locating vehicles and reuniting owners with their much needed stolen property that otherwise almost certainly wouldnt have been taken back thats exactly the justice i want how is someone recovering their stolen car not a good outcome went in there because i actually wanted to watch the show big animatronics nerd wanted to see all the presidents but as a person with narcolepsy oof just about put me out for the entire day one minute i was excited next minute my partner is shaking me awake it was like magic this is definitely a big part of it the kind of partner that strictly wants a one night standfwb situation and knows they themselves will not get attached not deviate from that nsa plan and be cool to walk away at any time with no turmoil is the kind of partner that wont care if op is married and is the kind of sexual partner op should be looking to find instead of lying to other women to manipulate them into sex some may still not go for it because they dont care for the married variable or dont trust it or whatever else but i think a big part of it is that for a lot of people there is always a chance of getting attached developing feelings really bonding and wanting to take it a step further even if that step is just casual dating with a married man as in ops situation your options are strictly fucking youre never going to develop a relationship outside of fwb and its perfectly reasonable that a lot of people want to leave that door at least open in case something were to develop even if thats not really want they want going in some may also assume that an extra layer of dramacomplication comes with their potential sex partner having a wife that may not be true for op but its a fair concern and people are entitled to avoiding that dynamic if they arent comfortable with it sure it might take longer and be more difficult to find those strictlyunattached types but such is life lying or omitting that information is extremely scummy and wrong if the person youre lying to wouldnt sleep with you if they knew that information you shouldnt be sleeping with them period this shouldnt even be a question if you are referring to loading frames more in depth explanation of what they are how to get them and what options are available can be found here some can be purchased in the ingame store while others are from events chests or battle pass rewards you can browse your loading frame options in your loadout no problem narcolepsy symptoms vary so much person to person that itll probably be hard to get a conclusive answer one way or another but its definitely interesting to see how the symptoms present in different peoplehow they are connected for me i experience severe sleep inertia every single day it has been probably a decade at least since that wasnt the case and even then it was extremely frequent probably one or two days a week where it wasnt as present but has been such a constant in my life that its hard to really remember i dont always experience hh despite always experiencing sleep inertia but i would say that i experience hh a good 8590 of the time when waking be that in the morning from an overnight sleep or from a nap or when i wake up periodically throughout the night to use the bathroomwake up briefly at random i also experience a great deal of hypnogogic hallucinations as well though not sure if that is why i experience hh so much when waking or if theyre related but figured it worth mentioning email sent to the address in the op gotcha your wording kind of left it a bit open hence why i wanted to clarify i know a lot of us here take adderall and have been impacted by the shortages and are definitely feeling it i definitely havent seen the narcolepsy side of it being covered at all its all adhdtelehealth related which is a bummer because it seems we have been forgotten about in many ways something those with narcolepsy are very used to in medicine im sorry to hear youre being impacted by the shortages on top of covering them id be happy to chat with you if you need an adderalltakingnarcoleptic with an adderalltakingadhd partner man these shortages suck all around yep one of the worst parts of this curse of a disease in my opinion i have next to no short termworking memory anymore i will forget what im doing while im doing it forget facts about myself that should require no thought phone number clothing size etc forget what i did 5 minutes ago all of it itll come on like a flash sometimes ill be doing something and then my mind is gone nothing empty just confusion its getting to the point where im starting to plan my life the way someone with early onset dementiaalzheimers would seeing as this problem gets worse all the time on top of my energy levelssleepiness which is getting worse all the time as well i can only assume that in a few years i will be beyond the point of being able to maintain any quality of life for myself shit fucking sucks wish i could tell you it gets better or what to do about it but i cant seem to figure out any relief wish you the best youre not alone i suffer from extreme sleep inertia and also get hypnopompic hallucinations dont know if i get more or less than people who arent as impacted by sleep inertia as i have nothing to compare to i would say 90 of the time i have both while waking to clarify youre only seeking people who have been impacted by the concertaritalinetc shortage not narcoleptics impacted by the stimulant shortage as it relates to adderall by your post title i would assume thats the case but your line but some people who have narcolepsy are also affected and i want to tell their stories so here i am would indicate maybe youre just seeking impacted narcoleptics in general so i wanted to clarify just in case in any event id argue people with narcolepsy are a hell of a lot more impacted than adhd folks but thats just a personal take best of luck with your writing thank you for reaching out to tell more expanded stories agreed having sex in a common area is insanely disrespectful unless youve both agreed that you dont care and dont have boundaries about it which is clearly not the case here the fact that it isnt even your couch op is so much worse you clearly have some maturing to do and need to learn a few lessons in respect she has every right to feel comfortable in the common
