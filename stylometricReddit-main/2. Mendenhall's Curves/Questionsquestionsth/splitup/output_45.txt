behaviors she displayed this isnt easy and it takes time but it can definitely help to shift to a fresh perspective when dealing with the new pets coming into every interaction with no expectations no hopes for how theyre going to behave and not searching for any specific traits or actions can really help you to warm up to the new fresh personalities that these new cats have and find the things you love and appreciate about them specifically when my partner started coming from this perspective it was like a flip switched i could tell he was visibly happier interacting with them and suddenly he was pointing out all these cute poses and goofy things they do and really engaging in playing with them when were grieving its hard not to compare to the one that we lost but were only hurting ourselves in the process by limiting the depth and strength of the bonds we could be forming sorry to write you a novel its still a pretty fresh experience and loss for myself too so i tend to get off on a tangent and ramble a lot in any event i wish you and your husband and new kitties the absolute best ill be hoping for a strong snuggly amazing bond with these new goobers for you for many years to come i will take some high quality full scans in a couple hours and send them your way if you want to dm me i can send them to your email if youre comfortable as so to not lose any quality otherwise ill drop an imgur link youre jumping to some wild connections there bud not what i was getting at at all no i dont agree its anything like flat out rape like youre proposing nowhere near that level but it is wrong in my opinion to deceive someone whether that be lying outright or lying by omission when engaging with them sexually especially and specifically about things relating to sex and before any more ridiculous comparisons are made no i dont look at things like lying about say political affiliation or saying you like a band you dont or that you make more money than you do the same way i and many people judging by conversations on similar topics on this subon reddit do feel that lying about things pertaining directly to sex in order to engage with someone sexually is absolutely wrong and does not allow for fully informed consent if i dont want to have sex with a 28 year old virgin be that because i feel unwanted pressure or dont want to have a one night stand with a virgin for reasons i originally stated above or dont feel comfortable with how that alters the tone of the sexual encounter or even just because i dont want to which is everyones right no is a valid reason then that should 100 be my choice to make if the person im engaging with values informed consent and wants me to be enthusiastically willing to have sex with them and wants a partner who is comfortable with them and choosing them fully then they should be fine with me knowing that detail if theyre lying about it or deceiving me by omission is it because they fear i wouldnt have sex with them if i knew so theyre deceiving me in order to get me to have sex with them no thats pretty fucking disgusting to do someone wouldnt you say or is it because theyre afraid of my reaction that i wont be as comfortable that i would want to take it slow and maybe not engage sexually right away or think about it or get to know them better first or talk about it more and set the boundaries and mood more firmly why would they not want me to do that you dont have to agree with my feelings on it but i personally think lying to a sexual partner about things that pertain to sex specifically not that any lying is generally necessarily a good habit but thats not what were talking about makes you a scumbag at best a deceptive manipulator at worst and it does blur ones ability to fully agree to the act in cases where they would not have otherwise i guess since youre riding really hard on my wording yeah informed consent in a legal sense of rape vs not youre right but thats not what i meant clearly with you on everything here except for lying about your virginity status some people will not want to be a one night standhookupwhatever else to a 28 year old virgin and its their right to make that choice with informed consent not saying this happens for everyone or will for op but there is a lot of emotion uncertainty and all kinds of negative and positive reactions that can come with losing your virginityhaving sex for the first time especially with someone from a heavy religious background most people would want to know beforehand that those may arise with the person theyre about to engage sexually with lying about it helps no one here and can only lead to op or her sexual partner becoming very uncomfortable should certain needs emotions etc arise the store front rent would have to be very cheap for that to be possible for the majority of smallmedium etsy shops especially depending on what products they specialize in and the security would have to be excellent but that would be awesome if it were possible would much rather see shops like that than big chains ah yes just what portlands consistently enjoyable weather and crazyunhinged roaming community is good for

will definitely be weird at first with the new kitty it was for us too even though we chose to adopt them and had a say in how soon but i have no doubts youll come to appreciate the new cat and it will take your mind off things at times sometimes its hard because these new kittens we have are very different from iggy he was a special man and the most unique cat ive ever met one of those that doesnt feel like a cat at all more like a good friend we love our kittens but i have found myself at times feeling sad or disappointed that certain things i loved that he did they dont do but those moments pass quickly and i let myself feel them however i need and then things move on and theres new happy moments again as long as you know that its likely youve have a lot of those conflicting moments and are prepared to process them and let them pass i think itll all be just fine i hope your family is being empathetic to your feelings and gives you space to talk about the grief and conflicted emotions around the new cat if they arent im deeply sorry for that too something that has brought me a lot of joy has been thinking that iggy would be really happy to know we have given two new cats a good and safe home resources and a peaceful life thats the best gift you can give an animal and many are not so lucky it sounds like you really love animals and that youre taking the time to set up your kitty spots and prepare for them is really sweet and amazing this new cat will be very lucky to have you and know you i lost my best friend my kitty iggy end of june it was tragic devastating and very traumatic for my partner and i he was brutally mauled and died in our arms its an image ill never forget we immediately knew it would be difficult to think of getting another cat and had to take a few nights away from our home at a hotel because everywhere we looked we saw iggys stuff or memories of him the house started to feel really empty and cold without him around he was like my little shadow and it wasnt often id be in a room without him i talked to him constantly throughout the day and he was a huge part of our lives this emptiness really weighed on me and added to the grief and depression from his loss in ways that became unbearable we werent planning to adopt new cats so soon but we fell in love with a pair of kittens who were being mistreated by a shelter and we impulsively brought them home the same day we met them at first my partner really struggled with it he was happy to provide a better life for the kittens but didnt feel quite ready once we got them home and it brought up a lot of conflicting feelings for him its been a couple months now and were all doing a lot better with it the kittens feel like part of the family and while we miss iggy intensely every day we are so grateful to have them around to fill that empty space they bring us a lot of joy are super sweet and snuggly and are such goofy little characters we can never replace iggy but we can provide love and security to two new lives and that feels really good im sorry that you dont have a say in the timeline of adopting a new cat i know it will be hard but please be kind and open to this new life it could be easy to feel resentful or angry with this new pet especially since this was not your choice but its important to remember that this kitty hasnt done anything wrong and they deserve love and happiness too they will never replace your lost cat you may find yourself looking for traits that remind you of your lost kitty or trying to get them to act the way that kitty did and becoming irritated when they dont alternatively you might feel yourself getting frustrated if they do act like your old cat because they arent them and you resent them for that these are all normal human reactions to grief and its important to let yourself process and mourn however you need to but in time
