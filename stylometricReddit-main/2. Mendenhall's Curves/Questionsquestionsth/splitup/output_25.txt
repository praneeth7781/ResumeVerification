so much for taking the time to comment i really appreciate it x200b its funny our cat tree is right next to the kitchen we rent a townhouse with what they called an open concept floorplan downstairs so essentially just a long single rectangular room from kitchen to front door for the downstairs level because its the only real place to put it and they spend 99 of their day sleeping on it climbing it etc our lady kitten doesnt care about climbing the cabinets at all but kitten in my post is a bit more of a goober and wants to climb everything i think part of it is that i made a huge mistake and unintentionally trained him that going up there is a good way to get attentionpossibly treats because i used to try to coax him down with them when id catch him oops do you have any recommendations for rubber spikes by chance unfortunately the kitchen is pretty large and theres a ton of countercabinet space so it might be a bit of an undertaking to cover them but that seems like a good bet the gate would be great but given the open floorplan theres just nowhere to do it without building a literal great wall sadly my thought was maybe storing boxes of some kind that fill the entire upper cabinet space so theres no gapsroom for him to jump uphang out but i wonder if that would be effective on its own oh totally i didnt mean to imply sex was only vaginal penetrationcontact i was more coming from a place of if youre going to be stupid and say nope no birth control or abortions ever hell no its probably best at their age to just straight up avoid any sexual contact because its a slippery slope and like op said they tend to be very impulsive and then theres the risk of semenvaginal contact through various other activities which again too impulsivedumb to use condoms possibly too dumbimpulsive to not let that happen totally agree with your message to op as well of course if my response helped at all im glad i appreciate your respectful responses to my comments youre not trying to be argumentative and youre receptive to what people have to say and that alone tells me youre probably a pretty good kid with a good road ahead of you youre young mistakes happen weve all been young and impulsive once hell some folks take a loooooong time to grow out of it but theres a reason that sex and birth control can get pretty serious its not just a oops when a mistake happens it could be an entire human life i promise you you do not want nor are you in any way prepared for or should you be having a child at 14 or anytime in the near future maybe even the next decade or more i wont judge your religious beliefs and choices but lets just say if youre going to break the rules and have premarital sexual activity youll really thank yourself later for breaking them a little more with contraception and besides condoms help with stds too anyway ill leave you alone heh you get it i wish you the best going forward and applaud you for coming here and asking and chatting with folks instead of just throwing caution to the wind and saying fuck it pun intended we can agree to disagree i dont care for either of those rides and universal is still extremely lackluster to me theyre not beating disney at their own game theyre not even in the same realm to me they dont create the same experiences nor to the same level to me im more excited for tron than a single thing universal has on the table right now or hagridsvelocicoaster i dont care how long disney is taking to bring these things to the table their parks offer me a better overall value and atmosphere its not a competition of who releases the most things unfortunately it only takes one time for her to end up pregnant youre young but that doesnt mean you have to be impulsive and stupid the fact that youre asking here and are concerned about it shows that youre smart enough to know youre playing with fire and that this is dangerous listen to that instinct and stop making lifealteringly bad choices she can ask 1000 times the answer is absolutely not unless there is at least one form of birth control being properly used otherwise you should go into it expecting that at the end shell be pregnant and the next thing you know youll have a baby on the way that you are financially and legally responsible for sex is fun and it doesnt have to be a scary ordeal but unless youre using contraception and being safe about it it can ruin your life her life and the life of a potential unplanned unwanted child please do better for yourself and any lady youre with and use condoms at minimum every time they dont just protect against pregnancy you dont want an std either if you dont believe in birth control or abortions you either need to abstain 100 from any sex 100 of the time or you best believe youre going to be having unplanned children its not a matter of politics or faith if you dont want to become pregnant or get someone pregnant unsure if youre male or female your only options are to not have any sex period or to be smart and safe and use contraception if youre so catholic that abortion and birth control are out of the question premarital sex should also be off the table you dont get to pick and choose what you feel applies to you for your own enjoyment and then claim religion as your reasoning for not practicing safe sex there are no other real trusted alternatives condoms at minimum ideally combined with other birth control methods are the only way to truly practice safe sex by all means please refrain from having any sex whatsoever if youre unwilling to believe in birth control or abortion should it fail some people love it its worth trying it just to say youve done it but personally i think its awful im really big about the story of a ride i dont care how thrilling it is if the story is bad its not a good ride and boy is the story dumb as hell and seems very lazily thrown together on dca guardians the collectors archive area is fine but its honestly the only area of the entire queue that seems to have had any level of work put into it and after youve seen it once it looks cheaper and lamer every time the outside queue area is bad and frankly i feel like the tower facade is hideous and looks like a bunch of garbage glued to a computer tower its a mess and looks terrible from so many angles the area replacing the boiler room is honestly hilariously bad so lazy and literally looks like a toddler did it awful the drop sequences are more thrilling ill give it that but the random screens are boring and lazy the doors open to random shots of the guardians doing things always looking extremely bored and theres no real cohesive story movement to whatever theyve got going on theres no real sense of urgency for a ride called mission breakout and its painfully lackluster despite the attempts at making it more fastpaced with the drop changes then you exit to a very uninspired gift shop and again to the equally uninviting concrete hellscape that is avengers campus i dont hate marvel by any means but man are there so many misses in dca starting with the tower i sincerely hope they leave it alone in wdw it frames the area so well and that old hollywood vibe is timeless and classy marvel may be popular and im not saying they dont have any place in any of the parks but cosmic rewind is more than enough imo giving a similar treatment to studious would be an insane mistake its honestly awful at dca i specifically went out to dca to say goodbye in late 2016 and it hurt my heart skips a beat in fear anytime i see wdws tower in an article please leave it alone nothing good will come of any changes its super cramped and the crowd managementflow is pretty awful its also just not as big of a draw for me in general not a comparison but thats just for me the atmosphere just isnt there like it could be i dont believe youre supposed to be parking strollers there but try telling entitled disney parents to move their strollers the worst yeah cool i guess its still universal i just really dont care for or about universal at all its not even a competition to me they arent on the same level as disney dont interest me and have no major draws for me in the way disney does and the value simply isnt there for me i love area 15 where the lv experience will go but this isnt a draw for me there im indifferent to haunted houses and frankly area 15vegas are expensive enough as is so this will be a definite pass as omega martother offerings will certainly still be more attractive the texas park is for young kids that announcement left my brain as fast as i read it personally i find it kind of tiring to read the same look at all that universal is doing1111 new park rides111 disney has only opened a couple in that time111 comments its not a one to one competition universal can open 50 things to every 5 disney opens that doesnt mean theyre better quality beat disney somehow or take value away from disney parks i think theres a good chunk of us that universal just doesnt connect withdo enough for and that doesnt seem like its going to change for those that like universal im glad you are getting new offerings though please check out the rest of area 15 especially omega mart and wink world instead of just skipping over to the haunted section what do you mean by theyre doing omega mart no universal is not doing omega mart nothing is changing with om this universal experience wont be open anytime this year yep thank you while i feel for anyone who had to deal with pole i dont get the feeling that karine is some innocent stable woman who wouldve been a good example of parenting had he not caused 100 of the problems sure being an of creator or makeup influencer doesnt make you a bad parent automatically but you get the picture of the type of person she is here and you cant pretend he was forcing her to do of content when shes spending her time trying to be a content creatorinfluencer herself on her own shacking up with some bachelor weirdo who frankly had more than enough info about his ways out there she doesnt get to play naive on top of this doesnt exactly paint the stable mom doing anything she can to get her kids back which is her main priority picture people keep trying to sell if shes that worried about custody so worried we need to sympathize and give her our money through donations to help out youd expect her to be taking real steps to achieve that instead of whatever wannabe influencer mess shes got going on now the thing is if disney would hypothetically be removing aerosmith due to lets say issues with membershistorymusic content in attempt to be more safe kiss and acdc certainly wouldnt be on the table either
