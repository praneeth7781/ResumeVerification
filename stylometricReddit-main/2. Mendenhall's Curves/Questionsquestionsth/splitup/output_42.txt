it and no you dont like pleasing your partner or giving them pleasure if youre only willing to do it under the expectation they will do it back thats like giving a gift or doing a favor only to receive in return its not really a gift now is it granted i am very straight so the thought of eating pussy is repulsive to me but that aside its pretty ridiculous how judgmental some of these women are when a man isnt into going down i like receiving but i also like having sex and theres plenty else about a sexual encounter i enjoy and value besides just head i also know how to get myself off during a sexual encounter or guide my partner to do so without his fucking mouth so its not the only option for me to enjoy myself and frankly if a partner isnt into it im happy they feel they can set that boundary and not be forced to do something theyre repulsed by no matter what the reason the entire experience can surely be gross to some people lots of bodily fluids not always tasting of pure delight lots of textures sweaty thighslegs lots of pressure on your facehead inability to breathe etc and while many women can say the same of blowjobs in their opinion its ridiculous that some folks here cant seem to wrap their minds around a man not wanting to do it and cant respect that preference yet when men post about women not wanting to give blowjobs its all about respecting her in the comments isnt it if the only important pleasure you get out of sex is receiving head thats very much a problem with you if you cant respect another persons preference not to have someones genitals leaking fluids all over their mouth and face for anywhatever reason and you see them as less than for that thats pretty fucked up and i sure hope you dont have sexual preferences or hard nos not saying you have to have sex with someone who isnt into the things youre into or expect from sex not at all op was fine is setting and following a boundary im just so sick of all the fuck men who are like this how dare they comments these same women would be crying out 20 paragraphs about how horrible the man is if the situation were reversed im so glad that my comment specifically stuck out to you and provided a conversation starter for you and your partner and even happier that it helped so much im so proud of you for having that talk with your partner and deciding that therapy is the route for you therapy fucking rocks there is zero shame in seeing a therapist i firmly believe everyone should get therapy at some point in their life and that everyone can benefit from it and it can be such an amazing tool to really know yourself better love yourself harder and work through some of the tough shit life throws everyone it can be hard to find a therapist that you fit well with especially these days coming out of the pandemic it can be hard to get in with a clinician as there is a shortage but i encourage you to stick with it until you do its seriously amazing how much you can improve on things you didnt even know you needed to work on and i promise itll do wonders for your self esteem and your relationship learning how to communicate better and express your emotions in a healthy way even if your relationship is going great as is is such an awesome tool to have best of luck to you going forward take care im always dehydrated i hate drinking water for a lot of reasons not just i dont like it and generally drink mexican coke cant handle the taste of any other soda occasionally apple juice or green tea or nothing at all i also take stimulant medications in very high doses for narcolepsy stimulants are dehydrating i have been this way for well over a decade my boyfriend has never had an issue with the way i taste hes genuinely crazy about my tastescent i dont taste myself constantly by any means but its not at all unpleasant when he has had me do so on his fingers or if i go down on him after penetration which is just to say be prepared for water to not make much of a difference and not solve anything here it could make a difference it could not i eat red meat and dairy but dont drink coffee to comment on the other things in your plan some people just have a more bitter taste from what i gather and yours may not even be bad but just odd to you best of luck in any event im sure youre fine you couldnt be more off base with this many of us find full time work of any kind to be not at all feasible narcolepsy for some of us is a legitimate and severe disability full stop not because of multiple health issues or whatever else because its a fucking disability and a horrible debilitating disease when that season was airing i got sick of call outs towards syngin he knew who he was and was honest about it upfront if she wanted a motivated career driven husband she could manipulate and verbally abuse that wasnt him people may not agree with his lifestyle choices or whateverness but theres nothing wrong with not wanting to devote to a specific job and not being that driven towards wasting away all day working its not like he expected her to finance his every ambition and make millions while he did nothing some people are fine with less money and more time hello uomgiitzjesus thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for the following reasons rule 3 no soapboxing or rants by this we mean rsmite is not your personal

be ignored god cant believe i had to scroll this far to find something that wasnt just theyre perfect everyone is flawless the way they are never be unhappy with yourself1111111 there is nothing wrong with deciding to have surgery done to improve something if its something you genuinely want and the alteration would make you happy go for it the benefits to this surgery arent nonexistent besides just improving how they look and your views on them it may make it easier on your back be easier to find clothes that fit properly or fit in in a way you prefer and enjoy the look of the lifting aspect is something many women covet not to make them perfect but to achieve a more comfortable setup so to speak amongst other reasons if youre just getting it because you think you have to in order to be sexy or good enough or because you cant stop comparing yourself to countless other better looking women therapy is what fixes this and is a lot cheaper but if you are able to be objective about it and go you know what i love myself my partner loves me and is attracted to me im attractive as is and im happy with myself but you know what the confidence boost id get from the surgery would be amazing and i would achieve the look i desire and be able to wear things i cant now even though im fine the way i am today then i think looking into surgery is a great idea and theres nothing wrong with it people are so quick to judge cosmetic surgeries and hate on the reasons behind themthose who get them its one thing if youre jumping haphazardly into it to please other people or cover up deep self esteem problems you really should be working through in therapy but its not always a bad thing or a bad option and is just like any other body modification when it comes down to it regardless i hope youre able to make the right choice for you op im sure your partner loves you just the way you are and i hope you do too so he has to always meet her needs first and answer to her whims in order to have his needs met absolutely fucking not bullshit if your partner doesnt give a fuck about your needs and doesnt care about showing you love in the way you have indicated is important to you romance isnt usually second nature i dont feel like going out of my way to pay for plan and take someone on a date when they cant even participate in physical intimacy with me its 100 the same her needs wont be met if she cant start giving a shit about her partners needs because shes not the only important fucking partner in the relationship if she wants respect for what she wants or doesnt want he deserves equal respect for his needs and dislikes if she wants romance and her love languages attended to he deserves that as well 100 shes ignoring and denying his needs in the relationship its only fair hers arent his top priority either i simply had them switch me down to 5s i get the same dose as i always have per day i just have to take 3 times the amount of physical pills to get there they said theyll have plenty of sandos and teva 5s through the end of the shortage the only two manufacturers ive found to be in any way legitimate and dont anticipate a shortage so im hoping theyre right on that its annoying to have to take so many tiny pills but it beats having nothing somehow my partner has been able to get his teva or sandos 20s just fine with zero delay or shortage through fred meyer what kroger is called in oregon and has remained unaffected which is odd im sure youve done this already but if it happens again ask to have the pills switched to 5s 10s 20s etc in a way that allows you to maintain your original dose just with a different breakdown of pills manufacturers can be tricky as there are very few that actually work and are decent but it might be worth looking into switching those if nothing else also you arent dependent on your medication you wouldnt tell someone who has to use crutches that theyre dependent on them in a negative way you wouldnt say that to someone using insulin or an inhaler its no different here hello uslothguy0709 thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for the following reasons rule 3 no soapboxing or rants
