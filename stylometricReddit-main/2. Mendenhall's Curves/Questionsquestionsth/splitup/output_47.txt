direct replies to official mod comments will most likely be ignored hi there id love to be considered thank you for this giveaway regardless how wonderful to offer to the community recently i have found myself most impacted by the art and creations put on by meow wolf and associated artists its pretty crazy to browse the subredditrelated instagrams and see the amazing worlds the company is bringing in artists to create and nurture for those unfamiliar meow wolf currently has three locations of huge interactive art exhibits that have a story to explore with many rooms of wild art and sensory experiences i have been really inspired by these creations because it has really expanded my definition of what art could be what music can do what shapes art can take what film can be used for etc ive always felt ive had some form of artistic vision but never felt there was much of a place for me to express it i mostly do embroidery machine embroidery rug tufting etc which feel a bit bland and limited but seeing all the unique uses of different artistic mediums really helped bring me out of my creative shell hello uvgc989 thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for

completely bare whether im expecting sex or not it feels more clean and more comfortable to me right we cant know what will make a blow job better for your partner op if he already says youre amazing and hes already able to cum from what youre doing the only improvements you can make will be specific to him some guys like certain things done with their balls some absolutely do not want anything in that area at all some prefer deeper or faster or more or less hands we cant know that ask him what my partner loves is likely not going to be what yours is wanting ask him what hes wanted to try or what would really drive him crazy it doesnt ruin it to be told its not a guessing game you dont have to magically find it for it to blow his mind wow i hadnt seen that the buildings have to be at least 15 years old for rental assistance to apply thats useless if things were to go that route theyd not only need absurd amounts of additional rental assistance funding but theyd need to reformat the way it is awarded processed and actually staff the damn places responsible for doing it oerap was nothing short of a nightmare failure in many ways and i have zero faith in multnomah county to handle more funding responsibly or in a way that helps those who need it hello ujustyourdad thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for the following reasons rule 3 no soapboxing or rants
