date daynight and thats that friends dont pester and we feel no guilt us time is very important and very healthy to have that intense release and intense intimacy after a stressful week we will have sex periodically throughout most weeks sometimes but we also like to save it to build up the tension if we know a big weekend is coming and the week is particularly busyrough is an amazing reward for getting through it all weve been on this cycle for pretty much all of the year and were just fine our lives havent fallen apart our friends still know we exist and arent mad at us and our relationship is stronger than ever and were closer than we couldve ever imagined dont sweat it as long as you both feel fulfilled and happy love and respect each other and occasionally make time for your friends even just a phone call or a text or a lunch once a month when you have the energy and mental capacity to deal with it youre golden there is no room in this life for shame guilt or personal insecurity especially around sex have fun food candy especially is not safe inside the vagina so no it is not one thing its important to note is that an amphetamine based stimulant is not going to make you less tired either it will also only keep you awake if it even does that and potentially help with focusconcentrationattentionetc there is no daytime medicine that will take away your feelings of tired of exhaustion its important to set your expectations accordingly i would never necessarily advise this but my dad who had never been remotely religious joined the church for exactly those reasons and it was probably the best decision he couldve made during a time of extreme loneliness depression and hopelessness finding a supportive community and positive routine is never a bad idea doesnt have to be religion ive had a bunch of different manufacturers ive been on adderall for ages and over time i came to realize that a lot of the generics just plain dont work whenever id get a new looking pill id google the manufacturer and what do you know tons of reviewsposts all around the internet of people complaining that they seem like sugar pills or questioning whether or not theyre going crazy because it feels like their meds suddenly dont do anything ive been gaslit by medical professionals in the past and told that there is no difference between manufacturers and that thinking some of them dont work is all in my head and not possible yet ive also had medical professionals and have confirmed through research on my own time that they do indeed differ and some may not be as good as others i am inclined to believe the latter because i definitely have noticed that some work better than others and when there are hundreds of people across the internet posting about that same thing its hard to believe its just a mass delusion anyway i digress the two manufacturers i personally have used that i know consistently work for me are teva and sandoz my partner who also takes adderall by prescription also agrees that those are the two good ones others have given me headachesextreme migraines havent worked at allhave made me feel more exhausted caused more dry mouthnausea bad side effects etc i asked my pharmacy to specify that i will only accept sandoz or teva i told them that other manufacturers trigger extreme migraines for me and those are the two i know that work i couldve just given one but i wanted to have backup so that they could provide the alternative if the first was not available while i couldve gone off and said i dont feel like other manufacturers are as strongwork as good i didnt feel the need to potentially have another bullshit gaslighting conversation as if i dont know what it feels like when my meds are and arent working or have that come across as red flag type behavior i would suggest going about it the same way if you want to have a manufacturer specified you can typically see who manufacturers your prescription by reading the label on the bottle mine says general for adderall and underneath that mfr teva usa for example your label should have this somewhere on it im sorry youre having this experience and are being judged as though youre drugseeking its absolute horse shit that medical professionalspharmacists feel justified in having that attitude with patients you have a valid fucking prescription of course youre going to want to fill it and get the medication you need and are prescribed dont let them bully you its perfectly reasonable to want to find a solution and get your medication despite the shortage and its in no way weird or drugseeking to do so by having them change the mg breakdown in order to provide the same damn meds youve been getting best of luck i hope they work it out for you soon hell it was really upsetting and uncomfortable even for me as a preteen to witness my parents sobbing while putting down our cats absolutely no to bringing a 3 year old theyre either going to lose their shit fall apart and create an extremely hard to manage scene because they dont understand the deathwhat has occurred and are shaken by seeing their parent upset or theyre not going to react with the right types of emotions possibly get impatient or agitated for example and ruin your final moments with your beloved pet since youll have to be parenting them instead have an age appropriate send off beforehand and go without the child i would say god im so so sorry for your loss and the awful way you had to experience it i cant even begin to imagine having to witness that would absolutely shatter me i hope you are able to heal and in time begin to replace those traumatic flashbacks with more cherished memories to reflect on i dont need a lesson on unmedicated adhd ive had adhd since i was a child i fully understand the symptoms and how they can impact your day to day life im well aware that it isnt the lol squirrel disease it can be stereotyped as i still firmly believe narcoleptics suffer substantially more due to the nature of the disease and lack of capacity to achieve restful restorative sleep and therefore should be prioritized in time of shortage kind of hard to worry about my attention issues and mood swings and impulse problems when i cant stay awake could collapse at any moment without warning and cant differentiate between being asleep and awake not so much of a horror story as just a weird sickness occurrence ive always wondered about was at disneyland really excited for the first night of our short visit it was a ticketed event so we entered the park at around 6pm for an 8 or 9pm event start time i think i felt great nothing was amiss we go to bengal bbq having not had lunch yet and grab two skewers each i finish mine and were letting it settle and making a game plan out of nowhere i start feeling absolutely horrible nausea keep freezing up because it feels like projectile vomit is about to come out of nowhere finally feel safe enough to make it to the bathroom and take one of the large back stalls spent a solid hour and a half or so in there vomiting like crazy id stop feel better sit on the toilet to be sure it was over and collect myself and then it would come back finally after the solid 15 hours it seems like it isnt coming back and i put myself back together swish a ton of water in my mouth and try to regain composure and rejoin my boyfriend who was waiting patiently outside we take it slow walking towards main street to see if we should go back to the hotel or if im going to manage and im fine for the rest of the night and trip i have no idea what happened why i got sick or why it was so short lived but i was so glad i only missed a couple hours of the trip instead of it becoming a prolonged ordeal it was unlike anything id experienced before i felt so horrible i wish i knew what caused it 10000000 agree grew up with and obviously still have adhd but narcolepsy is a totally different much more dangerous and severe can of worms youre not going to fall asleep driving or doing dangerous tasks or working if you dont get your adhd meds i absolutely will as a narcoleptic but sadly thats not how it works and so for the millionth time narcoleptics are low priority in medicine and well all just suffer through the shortage indefinitely while having pharmacists and doctors treat us like drugseeking pieces of shit are you able to change the mg in order to have it filled for the same amount i went from taking 6 10s a day to taking the 5mg equivalent my dosage didnt change i just take twice as many pills now because though they were experiencing a shortage of the 10 and 20mg options in the two manufacturers i will accept they have not experienced a shortage on 5s theyll need your doctors approval for this or you can ask your doctor directly and see if they can help get to the bottom of things and find something that will work with a pharmacy available to you but it might be a good workaround for you yeah nothing is going to drop in price anyone who thinks this is naive delusional and has no idea how businesses work but maybe things will level out for a year or two somewhat which is something therapy should be higher on the priority list than dating and being in a relationship its okay to be single its okay to be single for a longer period of time while youre working on yourself and getting over and through your issues and fears and its okay to focus on yourself so you can be healthy enough to be with someone in the future this is not to say that people cant be in a relationshipdating while theyre in therapyworking through trauma but it sounds like youre not quite ready for that right now and bringing all of that into a relationship right off the bat isnt a great way to start off on a good track with someone especially when you arent even in therapy yet im sorry youve gone through this and are struggling regardless i know it can be hard to get started in therapy and its an uphill battle to process trauma and establish boundaries in new relationships i wish you the best right like it sounds like this guy is a dick in general or at least from ops perception but like youre a grown ass woman use a towel and get on with your day ive never once thought to sit there helpless waiting for my partner to clean me up for me im a fully capable human being and it takes no effort to do it myself is this seriously an expectation people have most people have better shit to do think about care about pay attention to and focus on than what a random stranger is buying at a store they are also shopping at you are not the main character or even side character interesting extra or memorable cameo in the lives of strangers at the store most humans have sex you can count on it being a fact that almost every person 18 and older and some younger at
