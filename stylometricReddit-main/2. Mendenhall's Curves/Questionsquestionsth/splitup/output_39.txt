relationship or what happens between adults who are partnered and i really appreciate that it boggles my mind when ive read posts about couples being forced to sleep in separate roomsone on the couch one in the guest bed when visiting parents unless your kid or their partner are completely out of control and disrespect the situation by having crazy loud sex when visiting its insanely disrespectful to undermine your childs relationship like that if you cant wrap your mind around and respect your kid having sex as an adult you shouldnt be a parent first off the scenario in op might be a little uncomfy depending on how well the partner knows the parents and the personal sense of humor of all involved but shouldnt require more than a chuckle and moving on ill second this and add denying children forced into mental holds or troubled youth boarding facilities the right to call parentsdirect familyanyone while inside allows for absolutely unhinged levels of abuse and mistreatment that go completely unreported and unchecked all while the facilities feed parents lines about how anything the kids say regarding mistreatment is a lie meant to manipulate them into bringing them home this kind of shit is horrific but no one talks about it you think care facilities for adults are bad these are another level entirely god what an exhaustingly miserable and frustrating person you are what a useful respectful necessary comment well done wow thats in amazing condition absolutely no way at that price but how gorgeous so well kept dont want to be a debbie downer by any means but this is sadly not always the case doordash almost never refundsreplaced the order for the customer when something gets fucked upnever arrives theyre absolutely the worst about this of all the delivery companies ive ever used grubhub and ubereats might make it right for the customer if they feel so inclined but also are likely to tell you to get fucked especially if youve had an order messed up with them before which unfortunately isnt an uncommon occurrence it seems im glad op had a come up like this and they absolutely shouldnt ever feel bad its not like they hid it from the person looking for it this was 100 a good omen for them just dont want to give these companies more credit than they deserve because they fuck over their customers so often and for people who dont have money to throw away it stings this is wildly dependent on where you live in portland what your needs are what your schedule is like etc the blanket no one needs one here statement couldnt be more wrong do you ever get tired of being so incredibly wrong and so incredibly predictable or is my assessment that you have nothing of value going on in your life and you feed off your own toxicity and downvotes accurate anyway enjoy your weekend bud not going to feed the troll any longer i never said that and you damn well know it its clear all you exist to do on this subreddit is argue and twist words regardless you know i never said that im all for sanctioned camps im not in support of putting people who actually pay for their housing and are just trying to get by in this filthy city through more hell by shoving them into neighborhoods or areas mostly populated by housing industrial areasother spaces not directly in neighborhoods do exist believe it or not put them there weve had enough of them in our neighborhoods we dont need to sanction an entire shanty town tent village for them near more of them the only alternative to i dont want these criminal violent unhinged zombies living directly near my house in chaotic filthy hazardous camps isnt well we just wont have them at all then believe it or not industrial areas exist as do other areas outside of fucking neighbors and dense housing sections of our city they can easily opt to put this shit somewhere like that instead of putting those of us who actually pay for our housing and would like to maintain some semblance of livability at it through more hell look i get it these types of things have to go somewhere obviously but calling people nimbys simply because they dont want the place they live to be infested with criminal drug addicts that assault harass threaten burglarize and attack whoever they can while destroying and littering every square inch available to them often with human feces and hazardous used drug paraphernalia leaving filth causing rat infestations and even causing out of control fires which have literally burned peoples homes as a result is a bit ridiculous its understandable why no one wants these types of safe rest villages or camping compounds in their fucking neighborhoods people whove dealt with these types around the city have already had enough of the deplorable behavior they exhibit and the disgusting conditions they leave spaces in im absolutely not sorry to be one of many voices to say you know what i pay too damn much in rent for my overpriced already unsafe place to live to want a literal shanty town of authorized campers and with them unending chaos to move in anywhere close to my domicile i have been stolen from assaulted harassed chased threatened flashed etc fucking enough in this city by our tent camping community members hell some asshole with a nail bat threatened me at my neighborhood plaid two weeks ago if not wanting to welcome a compound of them into my immediate blocks makes me a nimby what the fuck ever again yes i get it they have to go somewhere but im also in the camp that feels there has to be a place to put them that doesnt punish the housed community more than the lack of action on this already has year after year if that means placing these in industrial districts or away from areas with mostly housingneighborhoods i am all for that personally thank you so much you absolutely rock i look forward to trying to stitch the design out myself if you still feel like sharing whenever youre back it looks seriously great thanks for sharing thank you so much for the information really appreciate those tips and hadnt heard of that machine model it looks really nice i guess i more asked about the machine because a heavier duty more pro machine can definitely handle stitching through thick tough material a bit better than a lower end i have found this to be the case with really dense designs on thick fabric anyway can i bother you with one more question where do you buy your black denim or is there a type you use specifically ive gotten a few recommendations from this sub for materials felt being a big example but after purchasing some from joannes found it was definitely not the most optimal possibly because i wasnt buying the right kind like the person recommended sorry to bother you so much thanks again for sharing im surprised i havent seen more comments about her ads im absolutely sick of them they tell me nothing about koteks platform values etc just that all friends of tina kotek know how to do is pay for low effort finger pointing garbage full of buzzwords we get it tina drazan is bad and maga and qanon all in one but what the fuck do you have to offer how about dealing with the homeless the service resistant violent criminal ones littering our streets and attacking residents at an insane rate in a way that doesnt just throw more money at them crime the shootings im constantly witnessinghearing blocks from my overpriced apartment nah not gonna prioritize those things what oregonians really care about and whats really gonna win you votes is ads full of childish namecalling cool if a campaign ad is meant to draw in interest from voters she has lost me completely in a mere minute and a half with that shit oof youre entitled to your thoughts and boundaries but this is absolutely off the rails humans are visual curious creatures we love to expand our minds fantasize experience new things etc for the same movies are mentally stimulating visually and mentally arousing and captivate our minds pornography is an appealing visual aide to many it means nothing you arent cheating on your job or your home by watching a movie about a different lifestyle media allows us to explore different things and enjoy different scenarios without actually doing them which further extends to and speaks to the fact that often what people fantasize about and watch porn about isnt necessarily what they want in real life or their preference by your logic are you not emotionally cheating if you watch a film or read a book about romance are you not throwing yourself into characters and scenarios about love and relationships that arent with your partner and lusting after them or feeling excited by them and where does it end if you see an attractive person on the street and you unintentionally think damn theyre sexy or have a brief fantasy about them sexually not intentionally of course most peoples brains just do this are you cheating then is a film with nudity okay a sexually charged song or advertisement i could see drawing a line with cam girlsonlyfans type stuff where youre paying a human money and potentially interacting with them for pornsexual stimulation yes sex work is a job and many wouldnt consider frequenting a cam girl cheating but i can also see the argument for it being too much and crossing that line because you are interacting sexually with another person even if only digitally but porn sites seriously theres no interaction there its the same as seeing a film in the theater youre not cheating with leonardo dicaprio just because he gets sexual on screen very well said and great comparison since were playing to ops insecurities here i guess id add its not that the people in porn are objectively more attractive or better at sex than i find my partner to be its a nice visual aide i enjoy viewing different kinds of things but the best partnerbest sex out there for me is my partner its not that theyre not enough or im enjoying something objectively better its just a meaningless visual aide like any movie during me time which my partner cant always be there for and frankly during times i dont always want to have full sex or have the time for it interesting what type of machine i mainly got into machine embroidery to make patches and ive definitely been struggling to find the right material everything ive used never seems to be firm and flat like yours looks your patch looks excellent that looks great can i ask what kind of fabric you use alrighty unfortunately im going to have to lock the comments on this one rsmite is not a place to debate global minimum wages politics the economy personal finances hirezs financial statusdecisions the value of currency or any of the other completely offtopic tangents the

have to shut this conversation down at this point as its devolved into bickering and isnt a constructive respectful conversation speculation as to why an account was banned has no place on rsmite and
