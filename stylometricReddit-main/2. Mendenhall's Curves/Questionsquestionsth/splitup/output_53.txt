nails nor had it done at the vet i make sure to have quality scratching poststoys everywhere in the house and this has always been enough for me people tend to get their cats nails trimmedtrimmed them when they scratch a lot or use furniture as scratching posts if you play with them often provide plenty of toysscratching posts and redirect them when theyre scratching at peoplefurniture you may never need to do this i still do the paw rubs to get them used to having their toes touched just in case and because it can be helpful in general for them not to be skittish when touched in that way you have to be careful when trimming because you can hurt them if youre interested in doing it yourself frequently i would take them to the vet to have it done again and ask the vet to walk you through it and watch while you do a nail or two they should have no problem doing that they should also be able to recommend products to help with this it sounds like youve got an awesome scratch cactus for them so far i get little scratch pads that i can mount to the wallsides of furniture in addition to scratching posts and they have a cat tree with beds and posts on it as well cats are fickle some will like certain toys and not others so it can be tricky to find the right stuff make sure and get some active toys not just scratching materials stuff that encourages them to run around and play actively not lazily so they maintain a good weight best of luck with your kitties it sounds like you love them a lot and want to do the absolute best for them youre gonna do just fine hello

us absolutely would ive suffered in ways most people i meet cant imagine goddamn right id give a hand up to absolutely every person i care about who has helped me or who ive seen suffer in my time id get myself a decent house modest and safe vehicle and a couple practical luxuries like a nicer computer some decent shoes etc and from there id be trying however i could to fix and lift up the community around me i know that and can say that firmly because thats how ive lived any time ive had any come up it wasnt straight into savings with the extra or straight to luxuries it was quick to who can i help with this who will fall otherwise so speak for yourself yeah gross amounts of wealth changes a person but if you have truly good values and know who you are it doesnt have to be a negative greedy change storming out is what a child does when they dont get their way adults in adults relationships talk things out and if one partner is refusing to apologize they continue to discuss and share perspectives and feelings and come to a reasonable end of the conversation or make a decision to revisit it later throwing a tantrum over a joke that fell flat and then running off to stay at your condo because you didnt get the apology you wanted is childish as fuck and a major overreaction this was a joke it doesnt warrant this level of meltdown period right theyre super annoying to interact with but the items are mostly great the pagoda pyramid and sphinx katana these are all awesome items i honestly love all of his furniture items but those have been the most useful and versatile for me i do find his task a bit tedious but it really doesnt take that long gullivarrrs items i have had less use for but theyre still really cool and his task takes literally 60 seconds one piece and youre done i dont get all the hate is he annoying absolutely but the items make it worth it hello uadleather7922 thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for the following

which op escalated this is extremely childish and ridiculous and if i were ops boyfriend i would be considering if i wanted to be with someone who threw a tantrum over a joke if a joke falls flat it falls flat thats it explain you didnt find it funny and move the fuck on it doesnt require an argument storming off like a child to stay at your condo or anything more than a eh that wasnt funny to me lets skip that one next time if he continued to make jokes like this after that sure it would warrant further discussion and eventually be a bigger problem but man talk about an overreaction hello

this and remind myself to get back to you later i upgraded to an embroiderysewing machine last year from just one that sews and now that i think about it i have no idea what i did with the old one which means its still in my house somewhere in a box in excellent working condition just gotta find it ill look for it tonight and its yours if i find it collar train your cats and get them airtag collars if you have serious concern of them getting out honestly everyone should do this its impossible to find your cat once they get out most of the time and something horrible can happen so fast that its worth it a microchip is great too and i recommend doing that as soon as you can but if your cats get out a microchip does nothing unless someone catches them and brings them into a vetshelter to scan an airtag allows you to track them back in june my kitty got out bolted when scared by a loud car backfiring as my partner came inside had never even shown interest in the door before and trying to find him felt so hopeless we literally didnt sleep for 3 days searching endlessly through the neighborhood and putting up posters ultimately he was mauled to death by an off leash unmanaged pit bull just a few houses down the owner didnt even stay to see if he was okay or take responsibility just immediately bolted from the scene and then tried to lie to animal control fortunately other neighbors witnessed and gave their side of the story to the officer i wouldve given anything to have been able to know what block he was on nonetheless what house he was hiding at he was chipped but if he had an airtag or other gps collar we couldve maybe brought him home sounds like youre doing everything right for them so far if the screens are a concern make sure to keep the windows cracked with next to no room so they cant bust the screens and get out they will believe me or try to reinforce them somehow enjoy your kitty friends hello userenadinghaiku thanks for your submission but weve

medicaid in a new state once you get approved and finding doctors dentists specialists etc best hope there isnt a waitlist for all those things that the doctors you get are even remotely competent that you can get the same prescriptions carried over and same standards of care and that the providers that are covered are easily accessible and reasonably close to where you live people seem to not factor medicaldental care and coverage especially if theyre on medicaid or plan to be in out of state moves its a huge factor that can go wrong in a lot of ways yknow before you start factoring in the sheer cost of an out of state move moving truck transporting all your positions gasflights breaking a lease or moving out costs new depositfirstlast months rent application fees savings while finding secure jobs etc thats simply not doable for most
