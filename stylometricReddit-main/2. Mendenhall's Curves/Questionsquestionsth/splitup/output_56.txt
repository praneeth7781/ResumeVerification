infections or bacterial vaginosis are a huge risk and problem and quite frankly come with disgusting symptoms and often require really unpleasant medication as well as utis and other consequences of putting bacteria where it doesnt belong doesnt matter if youre std free and hygienic these can and will eventually develop if youre being this careless not sure what your partners balls are like or how youre doing it but no its never been anything like this for me came here to say exactly this they would 100 not be my soulmate if sex wasnt a priority enjoyable shared activity and active part of our relationship period i value sex sexual compatibility and would not be happy in nor stay in a relationship without an active fulfilling sex life where our sex drives are similar kinks match up etc sure things happen and it may be less frequent at times or take a pause when big life events happen but in general its very important to me in a relationship and i wouldnt feel fulfilled or invested without it and a partner who would be my soul mate and match with me on that level would have the same values and thoughts around sex inside is what we do most often and its always enjoyable i really love swallowing so thats a favorite too but we dont do it as often because we typically with intercourse but its fun when it does happen i love when he finishes during anal too but its a bit more effort cleanup wise so is also not as frequent neither of us are a huge fan of him finishing outside of meon me its a mess and it isnt as satisfying for either of us sensationwise to finish pulled out

ignored trying to give it a fair chance so listened through it a few times today for the first time and will revisit it a few more im seeing them next month so want to at least be familiar with the songs not knowing which might show up on tour so far the only songs sticking for me are hmm and nightsift and honestly i love these two tracks hmm really resonates with me and feels very raw and emotional the grief lyrics hit its been a year of loss for me so this song just clicked immediately nightsift surprised me first listen i was definitely ready to listen again and process it in more depth but wasnt sure if i liked it since that first play earlier ive honestly probably listened to it 50 times today its really catchy to me but not in the way you usually think of catchy the lyrics are a lot to digest but they sound good and the song just works somehow it just feels very polished and interesting to me like i cant stop listening to it and enjoying all the components the rest of the tracks havent hit for me yet i dont have them dont dislike them but dont feel any attachment or draw to them at all kind of a miss for me so far but i expect them to grow on me overall dont hate it and even if i only end up liking the two tracks and the rest dont click for me i would be satisfied with that because i really love these two tracks ill be curious to see what songs make it into the rotation on their tour next month and how they translate live really hoping for nightsift at minimum hmm would be a treat but i might also have an emotional breakdown i hope you can find something these seem fairly easy to make yourself with minimal skill but i know crafting isnt everyones cup of tea or the energyother capacity for it just isnt there so a knockoff would definitely be easier maybe reverse image search and see if you can find anything similar browsing google images or shopping i feel like maybe shein aliexpress alibaba or something of that nature could have something similar the quality wont be fantastic but then you can play around with paddingaltering them for your needs and have a few pairs at a cheap price for when they wear out alternatively theres some fashion knockoff subreddits maybe check there good luck agreed i always used to be self conscious that the experience wasnt actually that good for my partner but was something he did to please meenjoy seeing me experiencing pleasure even though i knew i have good hygiene smell perfectly normal and all that i was always self conscious and couldnt relax during thinking it must smelltaste unpleasant or be a chore when my partner verbalized how much he enjoys it craves the tastesmell and gets into it it completely changed my feelings towards receiving and made it an enjoyable experience for me and not a tense one 100 verbalize op its a compliment to her and might help her more than you know this is a designer brand selling fingerless leather fashion gloves not a brand for or marketed at disabled people specifically and in no way selling these as wheelchair gloves in fact im sure theyd prefer them not to be used in that way and rather as a high end fashion item these would likely not be that great for the wearer anyway if the intended purpose was a disability aid as they arent constructed to be durable comfortable and supportive for those kinds of needs definitely feels different the lazy spooning taking it from behind on my side position feels amazing and is great when were both feeling low energy tired before bed first thing in the morning etc but definitely feels different than if im laying on my stomach on my knees with my chesthead down or on all fours all those different angles feel a bit different and allow for varying levels of deepnessforce behind each thrust i would love the candle holders i collect brasshave my entire home office space done in brass pieces and these would look amazing amongst my collection the lamps are gorgeous too and would get use with us but dont want to be greedy i asked about any potential risks of continuing the pill beforeduringafter surgery and multiple doctors told me they are negligible at best and there was nothing to worry about ask your doctor if you are concerned as they will better know your circumstances medical history risks etc i hadnt given this album a shot yet i wasnt a huge fan of their last the one time i listened through so have been a bit nervous since im seeing them in september and dont want to dread the new tracks but decided to listen to hmm and nightsift to start after reading your comment and i love these two tracks im going to give the full album a proper listen this evening but even if these are the only 2 i enjoy from it id be plenty satisfied hello unowhyu thanks for your submission but

right beforehand just to be on the safe side hopefully those work and its a relatively easy swap for you whenever your appointment comes up ah gotcha i feel like for most piercings theres no chance theyre going to close in the very short time youre required to have them out but no idea about nipples im confused why piercings would close up arent you only required to take them out for the surgery which takes a couple hoursnot even an entire day unless you just got the piercing im not sure how it would close up unless im missing something hello umainmirror8625 thanks for your submission but
