restrictions right not wanting to and choosing not to are two different things id say a great deal of us dont want to pay our taxes but still have to the people that comment is referencing just straight up dont pay them or pay very little of their share big difference i never want to pay taxes especially where i live taxes are raisednew taxes passed all the time for ridiculous bullshit while quality of life plummets more and more and the city gets filthier local government absolutely pissing it away im well below the poverty line and disabled none of this shit benefits me and i can barely get by as it is i dont want to pay taxes but damn right theyll come for me if i dont ir or xr he usually gets 20s but was having trouble finding 5s and 10s as well his doctor was willing to rewrite the rx for the same dosage with those mg breakdowns but he called all over town and into beavertonhillsboro and still wasnt consistently able to find enough to fill his full script not sure if 15s are having the same issue or not it would be more complicated to achieve his dosage with 15s but if it keeps being a problem he might have to ask anyway lol glad you havent had to deal with it yet and hopefully you never do fortunately costco was able to fill his this month but its been an issue for him every month for the last 4 months i fortunately havent had to go outside of kaiser but have had to change my mg breakdown a few times which was annoying im not actually sure why theres an ir shortage vs xr to be honest id guess that has something to do with it perhaps different regulations around ir vs xr i was reading that the shortage comes from a problem with regulations only allowing so many to be made at a time or something to that effect perhaps its slightly different for xr since they have less potential for abuseare less viable on the illegal market but i havent really read anything indicating that so its just a wild guess the shortage definitely sucks i take it for narcolepsy and the n groups im in are suffering its a much more severe and potentially dangerous situation for narcoleptics not getting their meds but there isnt a priority list during shortages so its just luck of the draw who gets what and for what theyre estimating the shortage will continue well into 2023 which is pretty scary hopefully it doesnt impact you at all but id imagine people will have to supplement with xr at some point if this keeps dragging out so definitely be prepared oh you take xrs yeah youll probably be fine irs are experiencing the shortage though keep knocking on wood because its predicted to potentially hit xrs too just to a smaller extent its definitely happening in portland kaiser mail order has been a lot better than what my partner who isnt with kaiser has dealt with he usually fills at fred meyer but has had to call all over town to multiple different chains only to eventually fill at costco but even with them ive had to have my script rewritten to accommodate what mg tablets they have available taking handfuls of 5s per day instead of multiple 20s for example but its definitely ever present here id be shocked if you never encounter it in some form check out r1200isplenty its not easy to eat super low calorie especially in the beginning 1200 does not feel like plenty especially when youre used to eating high calorie meals you can gain a few extra calories into your allotment with exercise but not everyone can do this my narcolepsy is too severe its not even an option and frankly exercise doesnt pay off calorie wise in any substantial way when you have to eat that low cal to lose low calorie foods that are high in protein playing around with things like intermittent fastingomad using teas and hydration and other things to get you past the hunger these will all help but its still tough until you can get into a routine and retrain your stomach and brain there are tons of calorie counting meal plans out there fortunately id recommend looking into those takes the planning work out of it and gets you into a routine right off the bat amen all the people who claim that being constantly active and having a lot to do keeps sleep attacks away are the lucky ones this is not how my narcolepsy works and id be much better off if it was doing things is exhausting i have no energy as it is how am i supposed to work out have a highly active job etc if i could manage those things without extreme pain and sleep attacks i wouldnt be severely disabled as a result of having narcolepsy would love to be thrown in the hat for this my check in bag was destroyed last time i traveled with it soft fabric suitcases arent the best for checking ive learned and we cant afford a replacement right now but will have to travel soon to help transition my grandma into a care facility thank you for considering i have my adderall mailed every month and havent seen my prescribing provider in person or even done a telehealth appointment with them for that matter in almost 3 years they have been contacted on my behalf once but this was because of the shortage and needing to change the mg breakdown in order to be able to fill it without delay this is via kaiser which i get covered through medicaid granted i take the medication for narcolepsy so much more serious different ballgame but i would assume the same general controlled substance rules apply i have not heard of any changes or new worrisome controlled substance laws and i would not get too worked up over it until official news is available social media is not official news unless legitimate sources are linked you can ask your provider and ask them to keep you in the loop if youre genuinely concerned i lived in that building theres no amount of fixing up that will redeem or genuinely improve that place yep this is all i can think too he speaks highly of her and clearly loves the person she is but theyve barely been together one year i know plenty of people have married that quickly and plenty have had it work out but i would still never advise such a commitment and life choice after such a tiny amount of time that first year is very much honeymoon phase in a lot of ways and i doubt they were living together for the majority of that time they have a lot to learn about each other still and the fact that theres this much uncertainty around sex and intimacy proves they are not ready but given that op values sex and is a highly sexual person it wouldnt be surprising that rushing into it faster than maybe he otherwise would in order to unlock sex privileges plays a huge part here less than two years ago she was having frequent casual sex with someone and one year and 8 months ago give or take she completely changed her values and boundaries sexuallyin relationships and made a huge 180 as a person into church life abstinence etc she may not even truly know where shes at with sex or what thatll look like for them once married she may have no real interest in jumping right back into those activities or may feel deep shame about it still seeing as to how thats what brought her to the epiphany and church commitment you dont usually decide you want to be abstinent and look poorly on your sex phase because you love sex and are a highly sexual person that will quickly return to those behaviors once the vows are exchanged its usually because you dont plan to revisit that side of yourselfdont feel good about it look im a highly sexual person i love sex and sexual compatibility is crucial to me in a relationship i would never marry someone without be damn sure we are compatible sexually share the same values around intimacy and are equally excited about sex i also wouldnt be able to just switch off that side of myself for a year with someone i love and am dating show no interest or excitement in it and then switch it back on when i finally get the person to marry me it just doesnt work like that im not judging people who choose to remain abstinent i have no interest in that kind of risk and sex is important to me in a relationship so id be shooting myself in the foot taking a gamble like that but i am absolutely dumbfounded by people who claim to be very sexual and value sex in a relationship that wind up with a partner who is waiting until marriage theres just no reason to end up in this kind of a situation you might wind up just fine but more likely than not youre going to deal with mismatched libidos sexual incompatibility etc id never enter a marriage with those possibilities on the table right off the bat can you live a fulfilling life with narcolepsy this depends on how privileged you are and how severe your symptoms are many people answering yes while also not truly struggling financially being able to stay afloat and employed at a job acting like only minor changes like dietexercisesleep hygiene will make a world of difference to improve symptoms these are not the people with the more severe end of symptoms or with the more extreme hurdles to overcome for me the answer is absolutely fucking not this life is hell too disabled to work forever cursed to extreme poverty and struggle always in a constant fear of how the hell im going to survive and stay housed or fed or afloat always feel sick exhausted fatigued and can never achieve restful restorative sleep despite needing 1214 hours a night to even remotely function in a day and even then its not really functioning memory long gone feels like i have alzheimers most of the time workingshort term memory completely obliterated to the point of legitimate fear of losing myself entirely old memories fading more and more all the time i get maybe 23 hours in a day where i can do anything the rest of the time im too heavy and pained and fatigued and brain fogged to even answer a basic email or fold my laundry cant really have much in the way of fulfillment when the most you can muster most of the time is staring blankly at a wall or phone screen dazed and half asleep no one takes narcolepsy seriously and no one who doesnt suffer from it themselves understands it can even remotely relate or truly gets the weight and realness of all the symptoms so add in never being taken seriously or believed fully and not being able to truly relate to hardly anyone in your life to the roster of bullshit nothing i love more than having to constantly defend or explain myself or justify the hell that is living with narcolepsy and it gets worse all the time im substantially worse than i was two years ago much worse than one year ago definitely worse than 6 months ago too things i used to be able to manage or at least enjoy a little bit despite being more exhausted by them are now tougher and tougher and i see myself quickly approaching the point of no return for
