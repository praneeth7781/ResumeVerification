have it every way you want all the time thats not how life works if you cant transport yourself to work but need a job you need to start looking at work from home options the government isnt going to subsidize schedule and arrange transportation for you to and from whatever job you choose that is not a program that exists at most they will expect you to take public transportation and provide benefits towards that if youre trying to move to a city with morebetter options and need money to do so id advise you to start being realistic about your employment options and take what is most feasible so you can save up to move somewhere with better opportunities im home too much as it is and i cant transport myself to a job put you with little to no options for work this shit is happening all over the city not in one or two specific wellknown bad areas the shootings the stabbings the assaults the carhome breakinsthefts the fires the menacing by insane and unhinged homeless etc are happening all across portland you cant just avoid them by sticking to certain areas never wouldve thought that the block of the nest would be an area to avoid nor that gold dust meridian would be shot up this shit isnt just gang and criminal element shit happening in bad neighborhoods when there is no law enforced everywhere becomes a bad neighborhood theres zero consequences here i miss when they had pork belly skewers id eat 8 of those suckers in one visit their salmon teriyaki donburi is absolutely fantastic though i dont eat nearly enough sushi when i eat there because their other dishes are so awesome it obviously means that either op or their partner isnt being honest about not having had sexual contact with another person either before or during this relationship no chicken or egg about it its very clear the boop cards have been accessible and available for quite some time now this is still not solvable with them because its an unfinished part of the story this will largely depend on the doctorspecialistsurgeon i had a 20 minute phone consultation with a cnm where i told her i was seeking a bisalp and we had a quick chat about it she started by informing me that a tubal ligation was potentially reversible but they advise that you not rely on that possibilityconsider it permanent and that a bisalp was absolutely permanent she asked me if i was okay with this being permanent and said may i ask why you are seeking this procedure to which i said frankly i absolutely hate kids have always hated them and dont want them and to which she said cool we just have to ask she let me know that there would be paperwork coming from her in the mail which was basically a document that she signs stating that she believes im of sound mind to make this decision and that shes giving the okay for the procedure and which i will sign as a consent form she said that these forms have a 30 day waiting period meaning after signed i have to wait 30 days before a procedure can be done and said shed have them in the mail right away she also said shed put in the referral for the surgeon who would give me a call to set the surgery date and answer any further questions i might have she said a further inperson exam could be necessary depending on my health concerns risks and history but that typically a videotelephone consult with the surgeon is plenty an hour after my phone consult with the cnm i had a phone consult booked with the surgeon for a week later i did not need an exam prior but i also have a fairly normal history in that regard and had a routine pap recently enough that it wasnt something they felt necessary i did have to speak with them further about anesthesia issues but that was a personal matter due to my health another doctor might want you to do an exam first if you havent had one before had one for some time or have some concernsprior issues that they might want to check up on beforehand i would say this is a good thing you want to make sure youre prepared and that its advisable to move forward before undergoing any surgery its impossible to know if they will say no after an exam or not this would depend on a lot of factors i suppose you could ask and say if i complete this exam barring any major health concerns will we then be moving forward with the bisalp and if the answer is not satisfactory you can determine your next steps agreed maybe in some situations a religious partner and a nonreligious partner could maintain a relationship and be compatible enough to survive long term but i feel like that only works if the religious partner isnt super religious and doesnt subscribe to the limitations their religion imposes on themtheir relationships theres just no way i could date someone for any length of time that was seriously religious in any capacity not because i have anything against religious people but i just dont see how our values needs wants and mindsets could possibly match up usually that extends into sex which is a huge deal breaker for me its definitely unfortunate that that conditioning exists im proud of op for acknowledging his needs and sexual values its crazy to me how many posts on this subreddit are basically i cant break up with someone over sex so what do i do when the answer is break up over sex my answer would be feel free to get closer to god as close as you possibly can but by dropping this ultimatum youve pushed yourself as far from me as possible and the relationship has no hope going forward im glad op at least recognizes that sex is important to him and something he isnt willing to sacrifice some people get so wrapped up in feeling like i cant dump them over just sex how shallow but sex is such a key part of intimacy and relationships it shouldnt be ignored honestly the kind of partner who decides for me and for the relationship that sexual intimacy is no longer on the table period indefinitely is not the kind of partner i would want to work things out with phase or not it shows a lack of care for her partner that she feels she can drop huge ultimatums on her partner whenever she sees fit and expects hell just cave and go along with it regardless of his needs and values and frankly shows sexual incompatibility to a major extent as she clearly doesnt value sex the same way phase or not no thanks too different of values hello ukdizzlemc thanks for

youd be surprised sometimes especially on this sub lol well duh most preschoolers have homes get all their needs paid for and get 3 meals a day obviously theyre the privileged ones s i really love his spooky nightmares skin but hes just so painfully boring to play he needs a rework bad youve heard right the disability process is not quick easy or fun and a major roadblock for many is that you will not be able to work during the process no matter how long it takes you need to have substantial documentation from medical professionals validating that you cannot work any job not just jobs youve worked beforefeel youve been qualified for any job they can come up with from walmart greeter to receipt checker etc and that you will remain unable to work any job for a minimum of 12 months regardless of any and all treatments and that youve attempted all treatments available with nothing else on the horizon that your doctor feels might work depending on your age and work history you may not qualify for one type of disability if you dont have enough work credits which would leave you with the other which has strict limits on what assets you can have expect to be denied the first time and probably the second expect to have to appeal go through many painful examinations and doctors appointments and to have to explain every aspect of yourself your life and your illnesses countless times and of course you cant work during this time so you best hope someone can support you 100 or you have savings to live off because its going to likely be 12 months at minimum before you see a payment a payment if you are approved that is which of course will be so low each month youll remain in guaranteed poverty as long as youre on the program with no hopes of rising above the poverty line not saying dont apply but definitely do your research and decide if its something you can reasonably attempt its a pretty fucked up system met shaq at my local mall as a kid i live in portland not exactly a destination town never has been and man he truly is huge he was wearing a gigantic fur coat which definitely drew your attention to him but he certainly didnt need that you could spot him from miles away regardless im still so curious what happened i drove by it as well seemingly right as it started the guy who i assume was responsible for it or whos stuff was on fire at least was in the street waving people away frantically we drove by on the
