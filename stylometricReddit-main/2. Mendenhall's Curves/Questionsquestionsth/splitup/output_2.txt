country with different regulations testing standards and practices is not valid for american insurance and medication you more than likely will find a lot of resistance from your insurance and any american doctors you see if you try to bring those test resultsa perceived diagnosis to them form mexico i can all but guarantee most doctors will require you to test again in a facility they approvework with before giving you controlled substance medications and your insurance may require this as well im happy to be wrong about this but given some of my own experiences with trying to get care outside of the usual options this was the biggest barrier any care outside of the country was rendered useless and testing needed to be redone to be considered valid i would speak with your american insurance and care team to see what they would think of this first unless youre going to attempt to get 100 of your care in mexico 100 of the time and somehow manage to get all your medication from there consistently too this may not be the hack you think it is this is it for me if it was in a desirable location and the taxes and such werent crazy possibly but any money is too much money for me to live in ga oh believe me im guilty of trying to cram way too much in every time but ive been getting better at it i get this panic like what if we never come back what if is gone and ive had to learn to set my expectations more realistically and prioritize a couple of musts and leave the rest to chance so i can relax and actually enjoy i knew there was a good chance wed miss grogu entirely given the randomness of his appearances so promised myself it wouldnt ruin my trip if we missed him but i was pretty bummed after two days in the heat wave with no sightings in the end disney magic works out sometimes and im glad we saw him but wish disney set up his meet a bit better haha thank you it was definitely a bit of an ordeal but worth it to me no shame shulas was great but pricey sanaa is a must do steak every trip plus the bread service and beauty of akl for steaksimilar the kona braised short ribs at kona cafe are always a mustdo for us too people are ignoring outside the parks with le cellier but i wanted to comment on that anyway and say we were massively disappointed in le cellier and would never go back wildly overpriced terrible atmosphere awful service and mediocre food the steak wasnt bad and we loved the poutine but for the overall price it wasnt worth it even remotely and weve had better elsewhere on property for half the cost wasnt worth eating up park time we have both attempted to reach out to each other but it never went very far its clear that too much time has passed about 3 years or so and the hurt was too big on both sides to have just let it pass ive tried to initiate talking about things but it was never followed through on he did as well first in fact but then fell out of contact again for months and clearly wasnt interested in making time when i followed up he wished me well at christmas which i wasnt expecting but it was very brief and felt odd some things just cant be fixed i always mean to try the chicken but pass on it because the steak is so dang good sanaa is fantastic i regret not making a trip over there on my visit last week that bums me out to hear we ate there december 2022 and again last week and it was worth every penny absolutely fantastic kona is a good choice too the short rib is one of my favorite dishes on earth but i miss the endless noodles over there i agree with all of this set the boundary and offer her an opportunity to chat if you feel you miss the friendship and want to hear her out this will give you the final ultimate closure she either cant agree with the boundary and you know its truly over and for the best or you both talk and work through some things and either end up in each others lives again or decide to part ways having hashed it out i wouldnt put a big apology in a letter myself and would prefer to say it to the person she may be feeling the same way but only sheyou can know that as you move forward guessingassuming does nothing productive here my situation was very different but ill add anyway during the pandemic i had a falling out with a dear friend of mine who i had known since i was 8 over 20 years who i went to for everything and them me and who was like family we knew each others parents etc as a result we no longer speak and the friendship has largely ended we messaged a couple times a year ago and both acknowledged we missed each other wish things wouldve gone differently wanted to catch up sometime and it just faded out and never came to be i think we both realize our wrongs during that time but also still feel hurt by the other person and cant just put it aside and ask to go back to the friendship that said i would give anything to repair that relationship if they sent me a letter like you describe i would absolutely give them a chance and if it didnt work out at least id know we both gave it a shot a friendship of that length means something and its clear you do miss it at least a bit in my opinion its worth the risk of chatting and setting your boundaries and giving repair a chance if only to know that there was no real opportunity in the first place they were there this last monday but let me tell you it was a pain trying to see them last week i am obsessed with grogu this entire trip was about meeting him we had 2 hollywood studios days booked and ended up having to squeeze a third in on our flight home day because we failed to meet him the first two he has no set times as a rule of thumb if its raining at all or a storm is brewing he isnt coming out originally i was told he doesnt come out after 5 but from my three days last week i would say he doesnt come out after 4 he comes out about once an hour maybe if all conditions are right and he comes out for maybe 1015 minutes at a time no line no photopass he has a handler and mando picks who he wants to interact withget a photo with you cant touchhold grogu but hes amazing and makes faces and noises and is perfect mando always will come out from the alcove in between rise of the resistance and the market thats where he exits to go backstage as well he sometimes goes into the market but when i saw him monday he came out the alcove walked to the umbrellasseating across from the market near the bushes on the other side of the shipsrise area and interacted with guests for just shy of 10 minutes then went back in didnt go towards the market at all i sat in the heat for 4 hours last tuesday in the same spot right by where he comes out from the back waiting for him only for him to never show and ruined the rest of my night because i overheated and got very sick thursday i missed him by literally 5 minutes at 330 and he never came out again monday i saw him at 129 he went back in at 138 and he never came out again it started lightly sprinkling at 230 i sat there after he left until it became actual rain at 245 and rained the rest of the day so there was no point in trying for another encounter cast members all said they have no idea what times he comes out and it is entirely random its never always 30 after for example but they all echoed that you need to get there early starting at 11 or 12 at least and for your best shots they said and you need to sit planted by that alcove because the second you leave and do something else for a second you are likely to just miss him its a hassle and i hate that they dont schedule such an amazing character that so many of us want to meet if they were smart hed be in the launch bay where hes protected from the elements kids cant rush the animatronic and cause problems and everyone gets a chance that said it was worth it to me i felt like a little kid i was literally squealing with joy i had my 11 inch grogu plush in a little bag with some vacation flair on and mando said grogu approves and took photos with us while grogu smiled and made happy sounds literally a moment ill never forget im still riding the high of that encounter im sorry to hear you had to have an encounter like that but im so glad they were able to get you the care you needed and you had a good experience with them that was my thought too in my city youre lucky if anyone shows up at all during an emergency and if they do its an hour or more at least disney is on top of emergencies instantly you have great odds and great care available to you there people with narcolepsy also have severe painful insomnia as a symptom of this horrible disease and the sleep we do get isnt really sleep im medically incapable of ever getting restful restorative sleep im severely severely disabled by this liferuining debilitating prison sentence of a disease its pretty insensitive to act like there are any benefits to this and no i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy ha i didnt even notice thank you aww thank you i try my best when i can im so glad it helped and that youre feeling better today its amazing what a good night of rest can do i hope you have a fantastic day and that youre able to quickly replace such a scary experience with some happy memories and feelings today take care not at all the taun taun has buzz button foam which causes a tingling the bespin fizz wasnt so much something youd feel in your mouth as a dry ice effect im sorry you had to witness that seeing someone in that state can be very scary and traumatic especially if youve never been in a situation like that before if theres someone you can talk to family support system therapist please do when you can everyone processes these things differently and it can sit with you for a while in some very dark and upsetting ways the truth of life is that there are no guarantees everything can end at any moment with no warning this is something that used to really scare me and i spent many years depressed over that lack of control and the fragility of everything these days it is something i keep in mind and is why i choose to cherish each moment i dont wait to do things that i feel are important like traveling to disney with my partner for example there is no guarantee of tomorrow and i want to
