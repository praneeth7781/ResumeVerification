shelf next to it currently i also have a beautiful painting done by an amazing redditor who helped look for him displayed next to his items with a couple toys he loved in the future i plan to have some of the ashes made into a piece of jewelry for myself and a small paperweightcrystal type item for my partner i personally didnt feel spreading his ashes anywhere was appropriate for the situation he was an indoor only cat and lived with me at only two apartments my old one which was terrible and the townhouse i currently rent which i surely wont be at forever leaving him at either place doesnt feel healing or right so we are keeping the ashes in the urn possibly to replace with a nicer urn later and will be bringing them with us wherever we move to be ideally spread or kept with us when we pass some people might think its silly or doesnt signify moving on to keep them around but i couldnt imagine not asking for them getting rid of them or spreading them anywhere though he isnt with us physically anymore i personally feel it gives a lot of respect to those who have passed to keep their ashes safe and displayed honorably sort of like a gravestone in a way my mom has done the same with my stepfather who passed tragically this last january do what feels right to you if you feel you want to spread them somewhere make a day of it have it be a special event or keep them you can have all kinds of beautiful things made from them as a keepsake i would say if youre on the fence absolutely ask to keep them you can always get rid of them or spread them later but you cant get them back and may have that regret for a lifetime alrighty comments are getting wildly out of hand here enjoy the art or dont and be on your way the sheer amount of juvenile tomfoolery unfolding here has been outrageous and unnecessary ive never heard the term bonus bones but damn that do be how it is its ridiculous im in more pain than ive ever been in in my life thanks to ohp and their terrible dental coverage eating anything is an ordeal and i want to die every time i have to do it but thats what us poors deserve right sorry to hear about your illness and financial woes i hope things start looking up for you even more soon care credit has a relatively low credit requirement as far as i know so might be worth looking into themsimilar programs but given your situation it may not be viable worth a shot though hey 500 is something i hope youre able to figure something out and get the work done id look into dental schools in the area but from my experience they tend to be backed up best of luck dont have any recommendations sadly but wanted to wish you good luck its criminal how bad ohps dental coverage is the fact that they wont cover root canals just extractions and then dont cover any form of implants is disgusting only wealthy people deserve teeth apparently wishing you the best of luck i had to have an extraction done because it was all too expensive are you eligible for care credit or anything of the like hello uconed29 thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for the following reasons rule 4 no bugstechnical errors posts regarding hacks andor exploits are not

versus somewhere like kentucky is dramatically higher rent all utilities gas parking car insurance health insurance groceries etc all cost more and wont be going down anytime soon the quality of life you can provide yourself here might be much much lower depending on your specific savings and what income you manage to get in the future i wouldnt leave a low cost of living with a job thats highly invested and provides good benefits nor would i leave a solid medical team permanently disabled here so i get how important that is and how hard it can be to find travel here multiple times a year if you have to but given the high cost of living how much of a nightmare portland is in general and other factors i wouldnt move im curious have you been to omega mart and if so did you feel they did this tutorial and explanation in a satisfactory way or did you have the same complaints i felt like it was a perfect balance there man this would be an interesting new scam i wonder how exactly theyd pull it off and what all it would entail i wouldnt be the least bit surprised but definitely havent heard of this one before hello ulocoleito thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for

0d0dmyissueis direct replies to official mod comments will most likely be ignored thats awesome i didnt know that ive never been to paris disney but ive wanted to even more ever since they closed dcas tot two months is way overboard for no sex swimming etc completely unnecessary unless youve had specific complications youre right its fine that youre wrong glad you can recognize that hate that i had to scroll this far to find this answer mission breakout feels like the cheap retheming that it is and its bad it looks like someone glued a bunch of random computer pieces to a giant tower super ugly and ruins the entire strip that you walk to get to it which used to be a beautiful area framed by the tower the ride itself used to be much better too tot was a wonderful ride yes even though the wdw version is more elaborate whereas gotg frankly makes zero sense has one of the laziest ride plots ive ever seen and is basically just a bunch of dumb one liners and brief lazy screen flashes they couldve kept tot exciting by randomizing the drop sequences and speeding it up like they did for the reskin wedging it into avengers campus was lazy boring and frankly is a huge eyesore from any angle in the park i think it sometimes depends on the skill level of the giver too it sounds like op is maybe not that experienced or that confident in his oral abilities if this is the case it could be that his lady would be more into it but he just isnt that great at providing or she could be like you said not that into oral in general i think op could use to talk to her about it are you not that into oral in general or are there things i could be doing to make this more enjoyable for you and perhaps try to improve his skills a bit before writing it off entirely as if she isnt into it at all unless of course she agrees that it isnt her thing i generally prefer penetration but my partner is awesome at oral so i always really enjoy it too before him oral wasnt my thing because my partners werent good at it and despite my best attempts at giving them tips or guiding them it was lackluster hello ufortunearomatic thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for the following

awesome would love to enter have a friend whos going through a really tough time and is crazy into dnd would love to surprise him with this thats definitely privilege speaking i would say as much as i would also prefer to pay for my own hotel and attempt to be reimbursed if facing this situation not everyone can afford that i know i certainly couldnt afford nights of hotel with no guarantee of reimbursement right now and we dont know if op has disposable income perhaps theyre just starting this job and are desperately awaiting pay many of us dont have the privilege of emergency savings ive had some great experiences with couchsurfingcom so wanted to chime in and vouch for it as a good possible option granted its been quite some years last time i used it when traveling was 2016 but i have been hosted countless times in the past and never once had a bad experience and im a very small female who was traveling solo and was pretty young a good deal of the times make sure and read the persons reviews and make sure everything sounds above board and trust your gut if you get a weird vibe when chatting with them over messages to arrange or even when you show up to meet them but at least when i used it last there were a lot of genuine awesome people in that community i used to host via couchsurfing as well couple apartments ago inner se portland and met some fantastic people traveling from all over for various reasons in town for work and wanted a unique experience couldnt afford typical accommodations etc i still talk to a few of them today even definitely check it out and see if you can find something that way if other offers dont work out if you find yourself in a true bind with nowhere to turn but a park bench please message me i am not in a great position to host someone right now going through some bummer times after our cat was murdered and things have been a bit chaotic but we have a large two floor apartment with a couch kitchen and a shower and are safe good people if you truly have nowhere else to turn hello ubigmonsmallpeen thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for the following reasons rule 8 loweffort content screenshots of
