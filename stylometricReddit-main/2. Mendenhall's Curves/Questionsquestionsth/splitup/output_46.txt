if you can try to form a new relationship with this kitty they wont be the same but you can come to love them just as much and find things about them that you will grow just as attached to having a new friend around can really help the grieving process even if its hard sometimes hang in there this person per their profile does this professionally and has huge multi needle machines for mass producing productspatches definitely not a hobbyist or anything near a hobby level amazing work nonetheless but the threadstabilizerfabrics they use will almost certainly not be availablepracticalrelevant to the just starting out level nonetheless the machine and possibly software but theyve got some cool embroideries in their post history to browse its hard to say i would talk to a vet or otherwise qualified cat expert about that i personally would never feel comfortable taking the risk having cremated my indooronly best friend 3 months ago when he was eaten by a disgusting pit bull after bolting out the front door when startled i cant imagine taking my kittens out and risking them getting out of the harness after witnessing firsthand just how unsafe it is out there for kitties on their own i will say ive collar trained both of my kittens now plan to have airtag collars on them when theyre big enough just in case a freak accident ever occurred where they got outside and its been a breeze if you get a harness that fits properly isnt binding but isnt loose practice extensively inside and live in an area with minimal big risks near prey driven dogs loud roads city areas potentially hazardous nature areas etc you may be fine but i think its a personal choice as to if the risk is worth it and if you feel like your cats will do well with it or not i would absolutely practice tirelessly for a long time with them wearing it and walking with it inside and in controlled environments where they cannot bolt and escape some cats are fine with collarskittens some fight it endlessly some collapse and go limp in protest some lose their shit in the most erratic ways etc i think a lot of it has to do with temperament your cats personality and how you introduce them to it how dedicated you are to training them with it how patient and the environment in which you do that as a kitten is definitely better for that kind of stuff but its not impossible for older cats if possible a catio is a much safer way to let them enjoy the outdoors but not everyone has the space for that kind of setup absolutely cracking up thats hilarious thanks for the laugh im sorry i wasnt aware we could be choosing beggars if the hypothetical treatment that will make me feel better than any other options on the market or be as close to feeling cured as possible has to be administered via iv sign me the fuck up some of us have actually lost enough to this god awful disease that thats a tiny and exciting price to pay for relief im with you on that one not enough motivation not an important enough or common enough or popular enough disease not enough money to be made over other focuses etc and frankly im sure its no cakewalk to come up with ways to fix this that are safe effective practical without horrendous side effects etc i dont feel there will be either i would almost guarantee if there is it wont be anywhere near my lifetime id love to be wrong i always wonder how pets work in the ac world like weve got cat and rabbit and dog villagers in clothes having lives talking but then wed have a petsized version running around the campsite makes you wonder id totally love this regardless though did you design these yourself amazing job either way thanks for sharing very envious of those talented at 3d printing its something id love to get into but its a big undertaking to create something as polished as this well done if you did would you be okay with me using a few of the designs to make a couple embroidered patches i will never sell them or profit off them in any way i do machine embroidery as a hobby mostly to make patches and would love to make a couple of these to use on some of the jackets i wear when i visit batuu personal use only purely id be happy to send a couple of any i make to you free of charge and free of shipping cost if that interests you at all in exchange for permission zero offense if you decline i wouldnt feel right not asking permission if you believe a word she says especially avoid jihoon in this situation i have a bridge to sell you i wouldnt send her a dime its not going to her childs treatment and that has been apparent shes a grifter and a shameless one at that and how is he supposed to get in contact or see him exactly she profits and wins if hes the bad guy her story falls apart if the truth behind her manipulation is revealed is jihoon supposed to get a visa cover high travel costs from south korea to the us with lodging for an extended period and then try to locate her to see his son with zero cooperation from her or anyone close to her is he supposed to just manifest like a magical fairy in the same room as his son who she is keeping from him does the child have a cellphone he can just call to obtain unmonitored access to him lets be real here at a certain point there isnt much you can do she has displayed a clear pattern of procreating to gain attention cash and a manipulation tool with multiple men and jihoon was just an unlucky pawn in her game she tossed him out replaced him with another stand in dad she could mold and fetishize and itll likely repeat again when he isnt fitting her will enough the way she behaves her history with men and restraining orders hes literally in a foreign country with no way to find and see his son without her allowing it i cant blame him personally i wouldnt send one penny if i were him that bitch has herself in mind and thats absolutely it i wouldnt trust that shed use it for the child necessary treatments or bills straight into fillers and luxuries just like any gofundme money shes getting jihoon isnt perfect but no one is at this point what is he supposed to do get a visa travel from south korea lets not pretend this is easy or cheap thanks guys and show up with no idea how to find or see his son and absolutely zero cooperation from her really were blaming him for not going along with that fantastic plan she cut him out and replaced him with another similar instant daddy she can fetishize and bend to her needs and when he stops fitting the mold shell toss him out too all she seems to know how to do is procreate to gain attention finding and manipulate menfansfamily and lie i wouldnt believe a word she says this happened to my mom as well fortunately she was right by her car and he bolted underneath it and she was able to grab him and toss him back in the vehicle but i told her shes a fool if she ever does it again because she may not be so lucky next time hes 5 years old and it was his first time using a harnessgoing for a walk he doesnt seem really antsy to learn how to enjoy it at this point in his life im so sorry to hear about your little guy i hope he comes home soon or is found and reunited with you you will both be in my thoughts so then remove them from the line and stop inflicting them on everyone else while forcing them onto something theyre miserable doing
