isnt that simple first of all because she was not the owner of the dog there is nothing i cancould do to compel anyone to have the dog put down the owner took the dog and claimed he would not be using her as a dogsitter again so as far as animal control was concerned that was enough i was informed by multiple animal control employees that nothing more could be done and that no court could compel the actual owner to bring the dog in to have it put down since i would not be suing him i would be suing the woman watching the dog at the time and they tend to only award verdicts of monetary value since that is all the loss is seen as i still would like to take her to court but unfortunately it isnt as easy as just going im suing you you killed my animal and walking away with a judgement she has dodged every attempt at contact and i simply do not have the financial ability to hire a process server nor to pay court fees i am severely disabled and unfortunately that means i am not financially privileged either small claims does not tend to be the most fruitful experience for anyone and animalloss cases like this are typically not easy to win nor very highpaying i agree it would have been some justice and i have been trying to see if theres anything i can still do to make her pay in one way or another but it doesnt look promising it pains me to say that the comment youre referring to likely wasnt me if it was on this subreddit this is the first time ive commented here so it was likely someone else which unfortunately just goes to show how often this tragedy occurs and how often lives are ruined by irresponsible dog owners and their mutts but that aside thank you so much for your kind words and compassion it really means so much to me to know that people have heard my little dudes story if nothing else that he wasnt just brushed off and forgotten by everyone just because the woman who caused this chose to handle things that way please do give your little fuzzballs extra loves from us today you sound like such a kind and sweet person and i have no doubt theyre very lucky to have you yeah a lot of hallmark ornaments ive seen lately look terrible super bad paint job zero quality control or consistency between different ornaments of the same design just really thrown together and cheap looking theyve definitely lost any standards of quality they ever had sadly i dont know personally i think she has now firmly entered was territory i cant possibly see how this could be considered still pretty or attractive in any way her face is horrifying and the general overall vibe of 100 plastic is really off putting she has gone way too far already thank you so much give your kittens extra love from me today im glad you have the protective instincts that you do to care for them the report and the retelling by the neighbor who called and tracked the bitch down who i am forever grateful to essentially said that the bitch lied tried to hide the dog and claim there was no dog then said that she was housesitting and didnt live there nor was it her dog then finally owned up and said she lives there but it isnt her dog she dog sits for some asshole who lives an hour outside of town and they immediately called him he came and picked the beast up and was allowed to take it home with zero follow up punishment etc because he said hed never use her for dog sitting again she tried to say my little dude was on her property and the dog dragged him out from under the shed and then rolled into the alley behind the house where the mauling ended in reality this bitch had an unleashed pitbull hanging out unattended in a backyard that barely even had a piece of chicken wire up as a fence and he jumped into the alley and attacked seeing as there was evidence of this and witnesses and no evidence it started on her lot the dog had to be choked out to release my little guy but by that point he had ripped through his entire abdomen it was bloody hellish to hearsee and half the damn street came outside while she bolted with the dog the second it dropped him she didnt stick around to see if my kitty survived nothing just bolted the financial and emotional burden this bitch caused i still havent recovered i dont understand how someone could be so fucking irresponsible having a pit bull unleashed in a yard with zero fence left unattended i see red every time i think about it its just too much he didnt deserve to go out like this animal control doing nothing was just the icing on the shit cake here believe me if the risks werent so high id have done it myself already i found out who it was animal control was called by a neighbor who located the bitch and the hellbeast so i got their information and they live 4 houses down not a day passes where the fact that there was no justice at all doesnt sting a lot of people chime in with something that keeps you on your feet and moving constantlykeeps them constantly busy whenever a post about best jobs for narcoleptics comes up and it absolutely boggles my fucking mind if i had the energy or ability to be constantly moving or in any way busy and active my narcolepsy wouldnt be much of a problem now would it and why the hell would i want a job that is going to keep me constantly moving and busy and thus depletes every last bit of energy reserve i possibly couldve had exhausting me even further every day no thank you thats torture i wish i knew what to tell ya but sadly i dont have a good answer i am permanently disabled by my narcolepsy and cannot work when i was still trying to cling onto working though something brainless and low key that wouldnt exhaust my energy resources or physically deplete me was the best thing possible work from home type thing lots of naps nothing physically demanding or anything that i needed to be constantly moving for i suppose everyone is different and if it works for some folks thats great but it definitely wasnt for me i 100 feel you i wish theyd separate waiting rooms or at least have clients leave and enter separately as so to never cross paths in this way back in late june a pitbull mauled my indooronly cat who bolted outside when startled by a truck backfiring on the street as i came inside to death and the coward owner fled the scene my fuzzy best friend bled to death in my fucking arms he meant the world to me and was a huge help in dealing with my severe disability each day in a number of ways i will never be the same after this loss i was never a fan of big dogs have traumafear from being attacked as a child but my hatred and fear oftowards pitbulls is immeasurable now and theyre fucking everywhere which definitely doesnt help i feel rage boil up inside of me the second i even see one these days i actively avoid being anywhere near them taking other entrances at shops crossing the street etc i now have two kittens who i rescued a couple months after losing my little dude and had a similar experience to this at the vet no your hellhound cant come near my kittens and curiously or playfully sniff at their cage i dont give a shit that they just want to check it out also no your shitbeast is not permitted to get anywhere near me either fuck off it can feel embarrassing at first to go against the popular dog crazy way of behaving be that moving away from them at the vet like you did or verbally stating a boundary and asking them to remove themselves from your space but the more you do it the less youll care and the happier youll be who cares what these people think you didnt do anything wrong youre protecting yourself and your pets which is the good responsible thing to do anyone taking issue with that has serious issues themselves and thus their opinion holds zero value at the end of the day as much as i dont want to cause problems or have uncomfortable encounters with others all i care about is my safety and that of my partner and pets fuck strangers all those pitloving eager to tell you how innocent and friendly their dog is quick to judge idiots arent going to be there helping you pick up the pieces when youre on your knees sobbing and screaming covered in the blood of your petloved oneetc gotta look out for you and yours first if you fully understand the reputation behind pit bulls why the hell do you have one i applaud you for muzzling and understanding why people dont want to go near yours but im genuinely confused as to why youre harboring one if youre also aware of the massive problem i dont mean this as a jab or an attack im genuinely interested in hearing your reasoning here and i do promise not to snap back and turn it into a debate thats not my intention thats ridiculous im sorry you had that experience definitely cant use sleepy with people as an alternative to tired to try to get people to better understandtake things seriously in my experience at least either sleepy sounds way more childish and even less serious excessive daytime sleepiness being the official term for a big part of narcolepsy makes me irrationally angry it sounds so laughably childish and fake and almost in a way sounds like its mocking the symptomsseverity trying to tell anyone about narcolepsy using those terms or trying to get them to take it seriously after they google it and see those terms is that much harder its so annoying how much language is failing to help us here never ever is there too much when it comes to cleaning every time i shower i use the detachable shower head and go to town down there blasting water everywhere absolutely always getting the inside and outside of my assother bits with hot water definitely would rather but too much into it than not enough so you expect us to believe that the staff and management decided to make it their mission to single out your family and ruin your night just for the hell of it it doesnt matter if you personally agree with the rules or contrived age restriction policies they are in place for a reason and meow wolf is hardly the only business on the planet that enforces these especially with live events the bottom line is that you have a minor child a minor child who is as of now still under 16 even liability is a thing you have no idea why their policies state a child must be 16 or over or 18 for some events its much bigger than you and your family and goes into insurance legality etc literally every event on the meow wolf calendarwhere you go to buy tickets states the age policy if you missed it take the loss and move on if youre trying to insinuate that the age policy wasnt stateda thing beforehand and management was crafting a story to
