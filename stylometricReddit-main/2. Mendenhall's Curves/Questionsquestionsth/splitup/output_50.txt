posted subreddit rules which we expect every user to familiarize themselves with before posting and follow accordingly clearly indicates in rule 4 that posts regarding bugs technical errors and account related issues are prohibited we are not directly affiliated with hirez it is pretty clearly stated under the rules in numerous places that if you have a bug technical error or account issue the place to address that is on the official smite discord channel or by opening a ticket with hirez directly or reaching out to them via their direct social media platforms no one here can help with crashes on consoles nor compel hirez to respond continuing to post about it does nothing and your time is better spent reaching out to hirez directly through various platforms a post that is titled to include how hirez refuses to respond to an individual users complaintstickets can be classified as a rantpersonal problem and per rule 3 rsmite is not your personal blog soapbox or helpdesk the rules are as they are for a reason the amount of misdirected anger ranting unnecessary bug report posts and just plain spam 100 posts in an hour about a game issue that has been identified and is being fixed for example that come from not enforcing rules like 3 and 4 far outweigh any benefits to allowing those posts to stay up at times the op is no exception and could also have fallen under rule 8

are too glad theyre still around i think its definitely different for a lot of men and women if my partner really wanted me to give it or anything hisass related a shot id enthusiastically try it for him once or twice but he has expressed that he has zero interest in having that kind of thing done for him and that doesnt disappoint me in the least because i have absolutely no desire to do it and dont think id get anything enjoyable from it and find it super offputting when i think about it i havent talked down onabout doing butt stuff on him to him for the record i dont personally find it appealing or see it as something i actively want to explore but i dont want him to feel he cant approach me with those things if hes curiouswants to explore so i keep that to myself fortunately hes very nope not for me about it so were both in the same mindset on the other hand hes all about anal anal play eating ass all that with me so i think its a preference thing for sure but men are more likely to want to go for it than women from what ive seen hello utrippinstarc thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for the following reasons rule 4 no bugstechnical errors technical or
