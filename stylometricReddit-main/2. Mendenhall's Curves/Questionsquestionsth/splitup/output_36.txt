also say erotic dancer and it would be correct but i dont think thats used nearly as much or at least i havent seen it often at all exotic is definitely the term used and it definitely is used to describe a stripper not a person of a minority groupwho is otherwise foreign what a unique and incredibly touching compliment wow your comment is just so wonderfully kind you seriously warmed my heart thank you so much i can definitely be an asshole and a cynic probably too much of the time admittedly sometimes on the internet but i try to be as genuinely kind and caring as i can when i can too im glad that side of me translates here and thank you for the reminder to choose to be that way more you rock please continue being you too oh no overly salty is literally the worst i am so glad both the op and your comment saved me the cost and hassle when you dont get to treat yourself often theres nothing worse than the food being literally repulsive and you feeling like youve somehow left yourself in a treat deficit as a result nope nope nope thank you so much for sharing your thoughts on all the close by spots weve lived in this rental for two years and have only been to pizza roma went once with my partners mom earlier last year as they have a huge patio and it seemed like a safe spot to eat outdoors when she was worried about covidtraveling so ive been curious about the other places close by for the most part it seems like everything in the immediate vicinity aside from super torta which ive been told countless times to avoid is probably pretty good but definitely a bit pricy not that we dont venture outside of the neighborhood but were on such a tight budget as it is and go out to eat so infrequently if there isnt something outstanding close by to support might as well stay in im gonna be honest i have always assumed ottos is just a meat market and doesnt sell hot food so havent even had it on my radar as a place to potentially check out thank you for the rundown on some of the other spots around we are such rare dineouters that weve not really ventured to any of the close by spots despite living in this rental for 2 years now but ive definitely been curious about our options should we decide to treat ourselves the noodle place seems decent but their menu looked a bit pricy im a huge fan of thai so im stoked to hear theres potentially a good spot close by oh no im so sorry for your experience that sounds truly terrible i have friends who swear by that place and im way too broke to care about going out to eat these days but was considering giving them a shot for a splurge after a big surgery i have coming up since theyre cheap and i absolutely love and constantly crave smash burgers definitely will avoid this place now thank you for the reviews we dont get out to eat much maybe a couple times a year if that so havent really been anywhere in the neighborhood despite living in this rental for 2 years and always in inner se through different apartments just different chunks and i felt a bit lost this week trying to come up with recommendations while we both had family in town i still have yet to try super deluxe even people wont stop recommending it because of my affinity for in n out but dicks is literally 10ish blocks from me so ive been curious whether its worth the venturecost eventually or not sounds like it wouldnt hurt to give it a chance worst case we tried something new best case we find a new favorite and yet their ask is for wfh jobs specifically not even factoring in the multitude of reasons why joining the military isnt a job recommendation to be taken lightly real men has nothing to do with this at all you can respect sex work as work and have no problem with sex workers and still not want a relationship with someone in that line of workwho is a stripper just like you can respect someone who bartends but not want to be in a relationship with someone who works until 4am around alcohol and drunk people every night or not want to date someone who is a traveling truck driver and is away for long lengths of time people are allowed to have preferences boundaries and dealbreakers stripping comes with its own baggage risks and problems people who dance deserve respect and love but they will not be the right partner for everyone for a multitude of reasons including crazy hours risky environmentsclients etc and thats perfectly fine it doesnt make someone not a real man for having different values boundaries or wants in a partnerrelationship i promise you exotic dancer never refers to a person who is part of a minority group and also dances in a nonsexual way at least in the states its nearly always referring to a stripper or otherwise sexual erotic dancer wasnt aware the military was wfh what a gem you are absolutely disgusting he doesnt owe you shit if you cant even muster up the nerve to ask the man to do it in the first place nonetheless ask him why he hasnt how the hell does he owe you anything is he supposed to be able to read your mind do you expect him to just out of the blue sense that you want this owed explanation and provide it in a satisfactory way part of being an adult in a sexual relationship is acting like an adult and communicating your needs wants questions concerns etc in a relationship no one is owed anything if you want something use your words if youre confused about something buck up and clarify if youre comfortable enough to fuck the man youre comfortable enough to ask him some basic questions about a very basic sex act youll also feel better about yourself speak for yourself buddy people who are truly disabled and truly cant work sure the fuck wont feel better about themselves trying to force themselves to handle the demeaning shitshow that 90 of jobs available are quite frankly there is nothing that feels worse to some of us than trying to manage working while disabled regardless of how pathetic and harmful the ssissdi systembenefits are for some its the only thing that gives any semblance of decent quality of life back to disabled folks no problem best of luck making the switch cats can be really picky but eventually theyll take to it if you keep consistent theres some great tips online for gradually switching over that i highly recommend versus just thrusting them right into it ive been to a bunch of banfield locations and theyve all been absolutely shit literally the mcdonalds of vet care wouldnt take my cats there even in a dire emergency at this point i live close by and ive been wondering about that place we never go out to eat but i always wonder what in the neighborhood is worth it on the off chance we can afford a treat out or have family in town or something sounds like this place is nothing special and im always happy to skip something overpriced our street is pretty dark desperately needs a fucking street light but apparently thats never going to happen so i didnt think wed have anyone down our block but my partner put an honor system bowl out anyway i was surprised we had a solid 1012 folks come by doorbell camera so i was able to actually count were directly connected to woodstock proper lower 60s kids looked cold and bundled uplots of umbrellas im not a big kids person but i was glad we put a bowl out so much of our neighborhood was lights offno decor and it was probably slim pickings out there for em right none of us have to agree with her share her insecurities or understand everything shes thinking but the bottom line is shes entitled to her own boundaries and feelings on the matter just like some people have a boundary that stripe clubs arent okay or interacting with cam girlsonlyfans girls is unacceptable or whatever else having a boundary about not wanting a partner who films pornographic or overtly sexual nude content is okay op doesnt have to agree with or follow the boundary but his partner is well within her rights to leave the relationship if hes unwilling to accept her boundaries while this wouldnt be a hard dealbreaker for me i wouldnt really want to continue down the path of a long term relationship with someone who will be spending months if not years filming pornographic material for a living it doesnt really remain on top of the litter because they absolutely still dig and bury the poops i would say they dont dig it as deep in you dont have to go hunting for it especially if you keep up on scooping but it will get slightly coated in the pellets which is great because that keeps the smell nonexistent the urine doesnt stick to the pellets and doesnt clump in the box and simply drains down into the tray below since it isnt collecting in the box you have a solid layer of pellets on the bottom and then id explain it as the top layer being where the poop is with a solid layer of pellets surrounding it ive never just had exposed poop on the top in the box its always at minimum coated in a good amount of pellets they do stick to the poop as they definitely still kick the pellets at it or bury it with small swipes of litter immediately after going ive also noticed that with the pellet system cats seem less interested in digging around in the box or kicking up litter everywhere they go do a little of that backwardskick covering thing or swipe a little on top and then get out and on with their day its all business all the time if theyre in there never any playing around or making a mess the breeze system is the only thing ill use ever ive had cats my entire life since childhood and god everything else is just disgusting and fails in comparison once you know how it can be you cant go back i swear i havent smelled the box once since i started using the system and ive used it with 3 different cats now first time with my solo cat and then now with my two 65 month old kittens who share a box even when ive accidentally let it go a few extra days litter pellets never leave the box and the pad makes cleaning it so easy and so much less grossmessy absolutely love it ive seen cheap knockoff versions and they werent anywhere near as good other kinds of pellets ive seen my mom tried many smelled absolutely horrible after a day or two or were a disastrous mess to clean breeze system is the way i know i probably sound silly getting this hyped over a cat box but when it works it works i wouldnt call stuffing your basic humans needs down so far that you eventually turn ll and are kept ok with the aid of ssris no less evolving it would seem youve devolved into being able to tolerate the situation youre in since youve chosen to stay the course but i wouldnt elevate that to evolving at all im glad youve found your peace with things and
