for whatever stupid as fuck reason here in oregon medicaid covers an eye exam every 24 months but doesnt cover any glassesprescriptions from that appointment why the fuck would you cover the damn appointment only to have the solution not be an option was so fucking pissed hearing the 150 bare minimum it would cost for me to get started remedying what they found but if i was pregnant it would be covered this country is a joke you are yeah was going to say the same thing ive had ubereatspostmates and doordashgrubhub orders marked delivered but never arrive with zero communication and no photo or be the completely wrong order even be half eaten or soaking wet and was burned by the company refusing to refund despite very clear and very documented proof that the driver screwed me over i refuse to use any of these services anymore i only used them in emergencies super sick after surgery etc or when traveling and in an unfamiliar area without a car or other options but its just not worth paying the insane markup and fees just to be completely fucked over by a company who doesnt give half a shit about their customers and have to go through the hassle of a chargeback i imagine banks dont look kindly on chargebacks either so its putting a negative mark on my account on top of it so to speak noooooope the instagram page the video came from is trash the woman clearly thinks very highly of herself and thinks shes doing real reporting despite posting a lot of false informationposting speculation as fact before details are confirmed she tried to push the korean church fire as a homeless camp fire that spread and argued with people in the comments informing her that the person responsible had come forward and it had been all over the news for hours she has a lot of really stupid takes and while i agree that portland is a dumpster fire and a lot of our government nonsense is getting ridiculous she just aint it agreed i dont think it would have the same feelingas much impact if i was staying off property ive done a night at the hotel in mco and one in celebration when flights were delayed and both daysnights felt very bland and like i was missing something as fun as disneyland can be its just not the same for me as well anaheim is in every direction you dont have that same separation from the outside world as someone who is disabled and severely chronically ill that also struggles with depressionptsd anxiety and ocd i can agree with those whove said that youll never really know until you get there but as long as you go in with an open mind and set your expectations realistically youre bound to have at least some fun for me it feels like disney is the only place where i can really ever shed the weight of my illnesses get out of the depression funk and truly live a little this does making coming home all the more difficult and its really hard to process that posttrip depression but in the end its worth it to me to get a break from the absolutely godawful city i live in and all the day to day nonsense of being disabled and having no quality of life this last trip my energy levels were the worst theyve ever been and we were getting to the parks each day later than ever before at first i was getting really upset over this what a waste of tripmoney the trip is going to fly by and ill have slept through it etc but i reframed this as you know what sleeping half the day in the polynesian resort sitting on that beautiful balcony looking out at the most gorgeous resort and then getting to spend half the day in the parks beats anything else i could possibly be doing just be kind to yourself and allow yourself to rest as needed stop when needed and feel whatever emotions come on as they happen ive cried many times on disney vacations as an adult for many different reasons the important thing is to let yourself feel how you need but also dont linger in it wipe the tears away pick yourself back up and let there still be magic left in the day one bad moment doesnt have to set the tone for the next hour evening day or rest of the trip sometimes when im in a funk i find that watching my partner enjoy things really distracts me too i might not be in the immediate mood to pick an activity and engage in it with full excitement but if i say why dont you pick im fine with whatever i will no doubt perk up when i see my partner getting really excited over a rideactivity and see the joy wash over him i hope youre able to enjoy the trip and you and your spouse have a wonderful time may it lift you from the pain and heaviness if only for a moment theres literally human feces on every corner and trash piles the size of houses everywhere here so i dont think the environmentally conscious compostable bags really matter at this point this place is filthy and disgusting and half the dog nuts dont pick up after their dogs at least anymore anyway theyve gone back and forth with having their china town flavor wings sadly but when theyve had them theyre so damn good i think about that flavor all the time their loaded fries are great too and slushees go dots down here in portland it is sadly the same dogs absolutely everywhere and for whatever reason portlanders are a special kind of stupid so theyre also all pit bull nuts specifically i swear to god i see a pit bull in a store every damn time i go out for groceries today it was fred meyer huge beast standing in the deli section slobbering on the glass case a new barrestaurant opened recently nearby and they have a photo of their huge shitbull in the restaurant on their instagram confirming theyre dog friendly great dogs inside in an eatery and the worst breed no less its unreal how dog friendly oregon and washington are and its awful im so tired of these things being absolutely everywhere last i checked i didnt choose to get a dog so why is there a barking shitting dog everywhere i turn i wouldnt care if people chose to have them if they werent constantly being made my problem loud as hell everywhere i go jumping on me running at me etc get me out of here narcolepsy type 2 i take ir adderall during the day and hydroxyzine hydrochloride at night x200b without any medication i will sleep until something prevents me and then go right back to sleeping i might wake up to use the bathroom or get up to eatshower if pestered enoughthe environment is loudbrightuncomfortable enough but i will immediately go back to sleep after and will be in a zombielike state the entire time feeling immense mental and physical pain i will turn off alarms in my sleep without ever knowing it and wont wake up to any if they do go off anyway without adderall but with the hydroxyzine i will be much the same as zero medication but will sleep harder feel worse upon waking and may not be able to be woken up no matter how hard someone tries with adderall but not hydroxyzine i experience a lot more of the insomnia side of narcolepsy it will take me longer to fall asleep at nighttime when i get into bed with the intention of sleeping for the night but i will still be exhausted throughout the day and easily able to nap and drift off at inappropriate times so it helps me fall asleep quicker than without though only if i shut down and let myself fall asleep the second i feel the drowsiness if i stay awake too long after taking it it will lose that effect i get really bad anxiety in the evenings when i lay down for rest which is what this medication is meant to target it makes me a bit drowsy but doesnt knock me out and i find i stay asleep for longerget up less throughout the night with it without it i will get up 10 times throughout the night easily use the bathroom and take anywhere between 1020 minutes to fall back asleep i tend to feel more restless at night without it i will sleep for an average of 1012 hours with adderall only no hydroxyzine with it i will sleep an average of 1014 hours a night sometimes it makes my sleep inertia worse and often it is much harder for me to get out of bed in the morning i dont usually feel more or less rested either way so its more that it helps me fall asleep fasterstay asleep without getting up as often adderall doesnt really impact how long i sleep at night its been a looooong time since i felt it really had much effect on how exhausted i am throughout the day without it im useless and my brain is complete soup 100 of the day whereas with it i can at least function on automatic behaviors and maybe be functional 13 hours a day i have maybe 13 working hours meaning hours where my brain works and i can do anything not hours at a job a day if im lucky when i first wake up my brain is soup im in physical and mental pain im exhausted everything is a fuzzy fatigued mess and that damned sleep inertia is painful sometimes i make it out of bed and to the couchinto the shower but i am a zombie for the first 24 hours of the day no matter what im doing i can do little more than stare at my phoneeatshowersit around i then maybe get 1 to 3 4 if im really lucky hours where i can do anything of value i still feel exhausted physically heavy in pain and fatigued but at least i can make some phone calls go to the store answer an email etc i wouldnt say im alert awake or very attentive during but im not brainsoupuseless either then after that im back to zombie i can feel my brain start to slow down the fatigue and brain fog gets thicker and heavier everything feels worse and takes longer to do i become more scatterbrained and its harder to focus or prioritize or do tasks i lose all motivation then when its time for bed i either take the hydroxyzine lay in bed and wait for it to kick in enough to drift off sleep 1012 sadly sometimes 14 hours and repeat or i lay in bed and take hours to fall asleep despite being painfully aware of how tired i am and how much more tired im becoming im grateful for my adderall because without it i get 0 working hours but damn does it feel hopeless most of the time this disease is a curse there are no positives here fuck narcolepsy thank you 3 im sorry for your loss as well time may pass but it always stings orange kitties are always so special thank you for sharing they sound like such a special pair its hard to imagine losing one of a bonded pair you cant explain to them what happened like you can a human not that that makes it any better but at least theres hope for understanding if only we could find a way for them to live forever sorry for the late reply first off thank you
