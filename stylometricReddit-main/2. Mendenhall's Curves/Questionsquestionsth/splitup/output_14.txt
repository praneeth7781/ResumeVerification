in broad daylight fucking twice had my car broken into in a garage and was chased by some methy zombie on my way back to my vehicle after the show no thanks this kind of thing is premature until there

worse all the time i absolutely consider my narcolepsy to be quite literally a degenerative issue in many ways especially where both long and short term memory are concerned and with mental ability overall i absolutely get worse at an increasingly fast rate where many things are concerned memory attention span mental ability focus absentmindedness brain fog overall fatigue all of it and more yay i would say that as a result of narcolepsy essentially rendering me incapable of ever achieving restful restorative sleep it doesnt matter what phase of sleep im primarily getting none of it does anything good anyway none of it counts or helps i used to have great short and long term memory and now i might as well have neither so i dont think any of my narcoleptic sleep is doing either any favors sadly i wish i could tell you what you can do to fight it but for many of us theres nothing you can do there is no cure for narcolepsy and there is no slowdown for a lot of this through medication management you may find reliefmore relief but there is no real return to normal for a lot of us not to say thats the case for you but its something to be prepared for i wish i wouldve prepared for the harsh realities of this a lot earlier you can try your best to develop coping skills and routines that help you manage and stay afloat as these things change but its really really hard especially as it worsens you just have to take it as it comes and hope that at the end of the day you havent overlooked something too important i make a lot of lists but i cant remember to look at them half the time anyway and if i do i dont have the mental ability focus or energy to complete them anyway so its not really helpful i guess just be patient and kind to yourself as much as you can this disease puts a lot of us 1000000000 steps behind everyone else as a baseline and thats extremely crippling we cant expect to operate on the same levels as someone who is privileged enough not to be suffering from this disease so you might have to take it slower and sometimes you might forget things or lose focus or have wasted daysweeksmonths and that sucks but thats just how this disease is adhd and narcolepsy are comorbid problems and share many of the same symptoms researching good coping skills and behavioral strategies to tackle these symptoms will help you a lot but the thing ive found that has helped the most is to slow down no one wants to have to slow down or adjust to these awful realities but youre going to have to do it one way or another willingly or not at a certain point your brain and body will say look we cant do this chill so its a lot better to be accepting of that and work with it willingly than to have everything shut down on you unexpectedly because youre trying to push push push when thats just not possible with narcolepsy most of the time for example i will forget what im doing while im doing it all the time this is humiliating it makes me want to curl up in a ball and sob uncontrollably and catastrophize to the extreme and it makes it insanely hard to do anything but i have come to accept that i cant change this this is a part of narcolepsy and i cant get rid of that and i cant go back so i try my best to take certain tasks and parts of my day slowly one thing at a time keep reminding myself of what absolutely has to get done and tackling that one at a time first and then moving forward i feel like a dementia patient sometimes but at least i can showered eat keep my place somewhat organized and occasionally get some other things done each day i might forget what i picked up my phone for or why i walked into a room but at least i have my priorities lined out and once you get into that routine its easier to at least keep running through the key activities you need to tackle automatic behaviors arent fun but at least you can steer them in a productive direction sometimes im sorry that youre going through this i wouldnt wish this curse of a disease on anyone i was
