points i personally couldnt imagine staying with or remaining interested in a partner who is as selfish and shortsighted as ops girlfriend shes fucking 19 she is in no way ready for a baby whatsoever and is haphazardly planning to bring a life into a world of chaos uncertainty and poverty her family arent financially sound or stable and neither is she how exactly is she planning to provide a wonderful life for this baby that her partner has made clear he doesnt even want i would lose 100 of my interest in continuing a relationship with someone like this and the resentment would grow so strong as my life is ruined for a child that wasnt wanted needed or planned for that it would be crippling im sorry this has happened op yes you had your part in getting her pregnant though it sounds like you guys did use protection sucks this happened despite being responsible but she is making a horrible choice all across the board and im sorry its going to destroy the next 18 years of your life do not wait to make your views firmly known here continue to repeat how poor of a decision this is how not ready both of you are and how rough this will be for the next two decades for you both reiterate that this is not her only opportunity to have a child and she should want to make this choice when prepared and stable and able to give the child the resources and stability it needs and reiterate that neither of you are anywhere close to that level of stable at this time nor will be in the near future reiterate how strenuous this will be on your relationship your relationship will never be the same in many ways negatively you will both be stressed exhausted and pushed to your absolute limit in every way sex will be minimal if not nonexistent personal timefree time gone hobbies goals dreams likely out the window for quite a while you will be financially drained and desperately trying to survive paycheck to paycheck in a shit economy with rising inflation and high costs of living and will likely feel as though you can never get ahead education will be tough if not impossible her body will change dramatically and she will have a whole new set of mental and physical woes to deal with for years at only 19 heaven forbid the child has any physical or developmental issues or disabilities get ready for a potential lifetime of caregiving its easy for some people god knows why i certainly cant figure it out to be talked into this shit by family or doctors that are antiabortion but they dont have to live with this baby and it isnt their life being destroyed by its arrival drill these points home its your last chance to change the path youre both on i hope she makes the smart choice and goes back to her initial decision either way i wish you all the best i like how my cat knocks out my wifi and i get a soft ban but some a hole spams ngr or other slurs and insults gets nothing this system is a joke im going to assume youre not seriously claiming that these types of sentences dont fall under no soapboxing rants or complaints but just in case as stated in the posted subreddit rules constructive criticism is allowed and encouraged but simple complaint posts that dont go into detail and dont encourage discussion will be removed if you have problems with the reporting system you can bring this to hirez directly via their support feature or by reaching out to them via their social media with questions concerns or complaints this issue is brought to the subreddit semifrequently and unfortunately does not tend to encourage constructive civil discussion on the topic as such posts of this nature are removed no one here on rsmite knows exactly how hirezsmites banreport system works or what their metrics on players are if you have suggestions or concerns regarding this your best bet will be to reach out to hirez directly in game if you are dealing with a toxic player reporting these players with a detailed filled out report and blocking them is the best way to stop encountering a problem user unfortunately any online gaming community will have bad apples that bring toxicity foul language and other unpleasant behaviors into the game the best thing any player can do is ignore these users report and move on regardless of your personal opinion on hirezs report system these are the options available to you as such there is no further

folks we understand theres some controversy going on around the mizkif allegations and that there are a lot of mixed feelings in the community on the topic until hirez makes a statement or takes action purely meaning if and when they do if they ever feel the need not commenting on if they should or should not large community discussions on this topic are only tangentially related to smite therefore all discussion on the topic should be focused in this post for the time being and all further posts will be removed should the situation develop further and receive official hirez attentionaction a stickied post may be made for discussion again until then we do not consider this a smite related topic being as it only tangentially relates to the game and therefore further posts are not needed nor on topic for rsmite by no means does this reflect any of the rsmite mod teams personal views or feelings on the alleged actions or topic whatsoever we simply feel that until hirez becomes involved it would be best to steer discussion back to smite specifically as that is the purpose of the subreddit feel free to continue civil respectful discussion on this post thank you received scanning now first off im so sorry for your loss and that you are going through this right now my heart goes out to both you and your husband 3 its definitely a difficult experience and there are a lot of foreign and hard feelings that come up during these times its hard because you know its not anything theyre doing on purpose or anything theyre doing wrong but even in knowing that its so hard not to feel that resentment anger or sadness anyway i totally get it im not sure based on what you wrote are these kittens or older cats if kittens absolutely give it time for all of the cats ive ever had theyve all changed a ton over their first few years sometimes it takes a while but as they settle down out of that first year phase and even out of that first year with you phase regardless of age they tend to become more snugglybuddied up with their people if youre persistent it can be hard especially when theyre giving your husband more attention but if you maintain that constant vibe of i want to give all the love to you i want to be your buddy i want to be close to you and bond strongly it usually develops even if it takes a little longer with you specifically its when you give up and back off and start being more distant around them that they usually match that and it starts to reset those im warming up to this person levels if theyre older not necessarily meaning old it can definitely take a lot more effort and time but its totally possible i dont believe any cat is firmly set in their ways when theyre cold not so social or distant i think some will certainly be more friendly than others just in general but you can absolutely get to a good strong bond with most cats given persistence maybe with your two new kitties that will just mean some extra google research into different ways to get to that closer snugglier more bonded place and extra catnip and treats surely but youre right you lost a really special unique sweet soul youve lost your best friend that shit is impossibly hard the grief is overwhelming and hurts in ways youve never imagined it could theres no fixing that and theres no replacing nala i mean you wouldnt even want to try to replace her right thats crazy talk she was amazing it definitely makes it that much harder that these new kitties despite your happiness to give them a new home and attempts to bond with them arent the kind of dream cats that are friendly followyoueverywhere snuggle bugs right off the bat sometimes we just get really lucky like with your girl i think the hardest thing for my partner was remembering in the moment that they arent our late cat you know that you know they wont be the same but in the moment its hard not to look for those traits or compare them to your memory of the best cat youve ever known its not intentional its just something you do without realizing because youre so used to that special friend and all the great things about them it can really help to make a conscious effort to try to wipe from your mind your expectations of a cat not forgetting about nala or her good qualities but not defining my cats as those
