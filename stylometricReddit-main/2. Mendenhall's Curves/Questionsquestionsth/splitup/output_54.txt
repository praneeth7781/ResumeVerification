people it requires massive savings which most cant accrue anymore this is not a remotely reasonable suggestion for someone in poverty ever its daily as in a thread that is posted and refreshed daily not daily achievements as in common achievementsfrequent achievements this absolutely belongs in the dailyposted achievements thread because it is exactly what that stickied thread aims to keep from clogging up the sub couldnt be more clear what that thread is intended for which is this kind of content the plaid pantry on woodstock and 55th has always been semi chill but the other day my partner went in for a quick stop and was greeted on the way out by a tweaker with a literal nail bat wrapped in spiked wire the guy asked him for a cigarette and when that was a no asked for change and blocked him off from getting back in his car boyfriend handed him 2 as thats all the cash he had and the guy finally moved a fucking nail bat weve been having more and more unfortunate encounters in our neighborhood lately it used to be so mellow theyre kids thats cool shouldve thought about that and lined up early enough to get a spot that would accommodate them without ruining the view of everyone else then the kids excuse means absolutely nothing to me i dont care about your kids i paid an absurd amount of money to be on this vacation and if you wanted your kid to have a specific viewexperience its your job to plan for it and get them there early enough to do it without intruding on the vacation a stranger is having haha no problem its not immediately obvious if youre not used to looking for collections of posts glad i was able to help just click on ops profile you will see the posts as theyre the only post on their profile currently well done op really enjoyed looking at these and your past submissions didnt say anything about orgasm if it isnt fun or enjoyable thats an issue foreplay isnt for the woman while piv is for the man and if thats how youre looking at sex i feel awful for you an 8 year old has no place being there either period if its a kids free event your shitty 8 year old is a kid and you can find a babysitter rules for thee but not for me is a shitty way to do anything small business or not that is the fun part for you uh and the actual intercourse isnt this wording foreplay should be enjoyable for both partners anyway as should the rest of the act god i hope youre joking cant imagine agreeing with ops hypocritical and toxic rules and point of view an 8 year old has no business being at an event like this bosses kid or not and regardless of if anyone else will argue it this sends a clear message i dont value my employees and any rules made only apply to everyone else i am above all rules and considerations and am entitled to do as i wish regardless of anything and everyone else good luck maintaining a healthy enjoyable working or camping event environment if you go down that road op these events are usually child free as they should be because its an event adults look forward to all year so they can get drunk and let loose but because were above the rules and our kid is so important and perfect and mature were going to make everyone uncomfortable and bring them anyway doesnt matter that an 8 year old will be uncomfortable in this environment and make all the adults uncomfortable too oh other employees with kids absolutely not were the bosses so we get to bring our kid but that one employee with the wife i dont like better find other arrangements so i dont have to deal with his heathens hello uthatbeastz

like the savis experience building a lightsaber in their workshop and carrying it out into batuu after with a group of other builders feeling the emotion and experiencing the atmosphere not comparable to online shopping whatsoever yes and i have an invisible disability even narcolepsy no i dont fall asleep randomly or collapse into slumber out of the blue with no notice and start snoring but i have been asked to leave various stores restaurants bars etc and have been hassled on public transportation and even at airports or doctors officesappointments a sleep attack can cause me to feel extremely dazed fatigued unsteady perhaps dizzy or faint it makes it difficult to think see clearly communicate properly sit upright need to lean or use more exhausted posture i dont just lay down it feels like suddenly being hit by the worlds largest and heaviest truck physically with an unimaginable heaviness crushing down upon you and mentally youre experiencing every fatigueexhaustion symptom possible while your brain and body try to fight the blurred sleepwake phase you live in constantly becoming even more chaotic it can be hard to verbalize whats going on i can slurstutter a bit or be very confusedhave trouble vocalizing or finding the right words its like talking to someone whos struggling to come out of anesthesia or who hasnt slept in 72 hours and is being woken up with an air horn every time theyre about to drift off i have because of this been accused of being drunk on drugs mentally insanepsychotic of being a mentally ill homeless person here to cause problems of having something seriously wrong with me of trying to pull some kind of scamact off with malicious intent etc i have been refused service because of this at all kinds of places told to leave hassled and judged and have had security or law enforcement called on me in all kinds of places youd never expect i never just fall asleep in public or lay downstart trying to nap or rest anywhere outside of my home at most i have sat leaning against a wall in a proper seat not just randomly where its inappropriate or using my hand to lean my head up when a table is in front of me eyes still open to breathe through it do i look exhausted and drained yes but no im not sleepingeyes closed i think a lot of it has to do with me having substantial tattoo work all professionally done well kept and not vulgar or offensive and being a younger small female people are very quick to judge and assume i must be on drugs or up to something because someone who looks like me couldnt possibly be disabled or experiencing medical distress this wouldnt be that noticeable to employees at various establishments if they werent already profiling me for how i look and then noticing that something is off not that they wouldnt notice when orderingserving at a food placebar or at a cash register for example but this happens far more outside of those actual interactions i dont go out anywhere anymore unless i am dressed well makeup done and hair styled i am assumed to be homelesssome kind of drug addict lowlife if i am not overly presentable despite neither being true and have a note in my bag about my situation with a number to call my partner or doctor i dont want to get into a situation where i am too exhausted and burdened by my symptoms to properly explain and am physically removedhassled by security or store employees who think theyre sticking it to another homeless nut job who dared act up in their store its pretty ridiculous embarrassing and hurtful i can only imagine what its like for those with more visible disabilities curious did you end up going with hatch or did you opt to give chroma a try the chroma trial definitely has me loving it over hatch but you also cant export in trial mode so i dont know how my designsdigitizing would turn out when actually stitching and that has me unsure as to whether i like hatch better or not ive done this it doesnt got one from goodwill i couldnt resist even though i have a few he looked so sad there and did two wash cycles on hot waterhigh because germsbugs paranoia i tied him in a pillow case made sure it was fastened between the two washes and even dried him on medium heat in the dryer still in a case but with a blanket in there too so he wouldnt bash around and he was perfectly fine no paint loss at all a clorox wipe will also do a good job with the plastic parts if youre too worried ugarbagelumi alrighty the aggression and vulgar snap backs are uncalled for consider this a warning lets calm down and remain civil or
