stuff is just reinforcing that you need to cut your losses before she milks any more support out of you by expressing frustration i meant that i literally just said oh no thats a bummer that no one has turned it in i was buying some emergency clothes after our flight for tomorrow got canceled should i check back tomorrow do you think or fill out the lost and found form to be contacted there was no frustration in my voice whatsoever so no i doubt it was only because i expressed frustration someone stole my bag off a counter seems like something theyd try to help anyone with if within their power to do so is the playlist actually in ogas now or just released on streaming all ive seen is that its out for streaming which is pretty underwhelming if theres no indication of when itll be in ogas i love ogas but a fresh playlist is desperately needed after multiple visits didnt pay attention to the ages on first read seeing this youre 100 right this isnt a relationship shes a fuckpiece constant sneaking away for quickies in publicwhen hanging with friends constant public sexual displays yep someone snatched a bag with a spirit jersey and two shirts i had just bought off the bathroom counter when i turned away to get a paper towel on my last disneyland visit in may 2022 reported to lost and found and nothing had been turned in and i expressed my frustration since our flight had been canceled and we had bought them to have clean clothes for the next unexpected resort day they offered me a voucher to purchase the shirts with again and said that they couldnt replace the spirit jersey policy regarding the jerseys specifically due to social media nonsense trying to get free jerseys were still ironing that out but came back out with two brand new sweaters with tags and said if you take these to the world of disney store theyll exchange them without a receipt and you can use that value to buy another jerseyanything else you need went above and beyond i was so impressed by how hard they worked to make things right agreed op is taking this as a personal attack and looking down on her partner because of it instead of realizing she isnt the only person who was shaken by this assault and having some understanding for the person who has had to shoulder 100 of her trauma processing and grief for the last two weeks when your loved one is assaulted it can be very traumatic for you as well its normal for people to feel scared confused erratic guilty out of control overwhelmed selfloathing etc after a situation like this especially if it occurred while they were there with you it doesnt sound like the partner tried to guilt op or leave her because of the incident it sounds like he was expressing fear and guilt over not protecting her and stopping the event that shes so torn up about now and was coming from a place of feeling he needed to punish himself for his inability to prevent this or needing to push away and disconnect to protect both her from his shortcomings and himself from the pain of seeing a loved one harmed like this again did he do that in the most productive healthy way no not at all but most people dont just suddenly experience a rare unexpected traumatic situation and manage to handle it 100 perfectly right off the bat no one is perfect and unless you already have years of therapy behind you youre probably going to have an outburst or two when youre deeply shaken and frightened he let his fears and anxieties and guilt build up for two weeks while tending to op and like most at some point do he reached his boiling point and some of it spilled out in an unhealthy way he realized this pretty quickly and apologized to op and explained and took it back what more does she want from this is she the only one allowed to feel any fearemotions and be upset over this ohana space 220 and id say ogas as well depending on what time of day if you want to do a late reservation for example where you get to stay in the park after closing and get to walk out with no one around for some awesome photos youll have a harder time getting that time slot vs a late morningweird lunch hour slot though theres always the walk up list and its not as crazy to get as it once was it can still fill up fast agreed i get the appeal for some kids but i also feel like the movie is very dated for todays kids im not ripping on the movie but it doesnt seem like one that has remained a must play for a lot of familiesit isnt reflected as much in merchandising on property so its probably not as relevant to a lot of younger kids these days either im shocked it was ever in that spot in the first place frankly but by now its crazy there hasnt been an update for such a beautiful detailrich park that seeks to teach about animals and cultures the park icon not reflecting that is such a shame because shanghai has a ton of other attractions is a different park and is a whole new disney experience in a foreign country why even ride pirates at disneyland and world i doubt many people book entire trips and travel to a distant park for one attraction yeah bugs life has never made sense to me the beautiful park icon being used for a dated show thats unappealing to many and doesnt really reflect the vibe of the treepark is so odd cars doesnt fit into tomorrowland whatsoever though im sorry youre dealing with the same hell but thank you it does help to know it isnt just me as much as i hate to hear others are suffering similarly my question has been do you need to get the vq to buy an ill for tron or does the ill bypass the need for vq ive seen people say both and im not sure which it is ive never needed ill and have gotten a vq for rotr and cosmic rewind every time ive visited with zero issues but were only doing one mk day and tron is a must for me and part of why were visiting so i dont want to screw up if we have to get a vq group either way theres no reason for us to buy ill but i just wanted to be 100 sure would you rather wait another month or more for a potentially much more accurate test or risk an inaccurate test that leads to no diagnosis or that you have to retake and wait that much longer for sleep studies are miserable dont put yourself through it more than once if you can help it if youre concerned that this will impact it severely reschedule i saw the markus thing in the inbox message too so i wasnt sure if they just wrote it wrong or if mine was with ozz because i had already completed the titlecrown thing in past years seems it was an error on their part heh glad you figured it out have you completed slayer path node 2 like it mentions in the springtide overview have you completed the quests honest ozz has available i got the quest to complete the pufflehop rescue mission from him after a quest to break behemoth parts but ive also gotten the crowntitleall cosmetics from past years so perhaps thats why it depends on your luggage situation if youre flying southwest for example and have the extra free checked bags go for it if youre like me and fly an airline where you have to pay to check bags unless youre a very light packer with your other items its a better plan to just buy them there i always order walmart amazon or instacart grocery delivery before i even depart for my trip and schedule it to get there the day i do no delivery fee no worrying about things getting smashed during flight bread would definitely not survive well the way tsa treats my bags lol and it shows up before i do on my travel day so theres no waiting around for it plus i can get drinks for the roomto bring into the park which is a huge bonus the op is wondering if women and men who are straight can live together and not be with each other in some capacity the comment youre responding to is stating that bisexual people who are attracted to both males and females are capable of having roommates and not fucking them since theyre attracted to both genders theyre comparing their situation to the ops question ooooof i wish i could say it was good heh x200b wake up anywhere between 2pm and 430pm no amount of alarmsanything else will change this sometimes 5 if im especially dead every once and a while ill get lucky and get a 1130 wake up regardless of when i wake up im not going to be functional for at least the first 34 hours minimum of my day so i might be awake but just rolling around in bed trying to look at my phone or i might move to the couch but still just be in a haze sleep inertia lasts 24 hours on average lately i am having vision issues upon waking cant see shit for the first few hours of the day eyes completely blurry usually ill have a headache sometimes a migraine so either excedrine or imatrex basically just in a halfsleep state staring off and on at my phonethe wall 34 hours after i wake ill shower 45 hours after i wake i may eat a light meal 6 or so hours after i wake up i will attempt to check my email on my desktop look at my todo list try to pick 3 or 4 things to attempt to get done that day from around 93010pm to maybe 121am i will feel semifunctional which is the best i can hope for these days and the highest level of functioning i will reach during which time i will maybe answer some emails catch up on messages from friendsfamily possibly clean my bathroomdo some laundrypick up around the houseschedule appointmentsetc from 1130ish to around 2303am i will not be wound down enough to sleep but not functional enough to accomplish anything of value ill keep trying to truck along through todo list tasks but its mostly automatic behaviors and i end up complicating simple tasks because my brain is too foggyheavy to do anything properly 3amish ill go to bed ill either take 4560 minutes to fall asleep or ill crash instantly no way to predict which itll be no rhyme or reason as to why i will get up a few times throughout the night to use the bathroom next day this hellcycle begins again every day of my life this is not living and its hardly surviving severe narcolepsy is a prison sentence and i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy very much agree with your comment super levelheaded take to add everyone grieves differently and some people especially those who dont have a lot of experience with loss or who process loss by wanting to distractescape rather than grieve may lean more into trying to take theiryour mind of things or trying to provide an up to pull you out of the down was this wildly inappropriate yes and no given that she didnt know and hadnt established through past experiences with you that
