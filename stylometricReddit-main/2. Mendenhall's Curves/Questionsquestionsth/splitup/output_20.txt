years and has notwill notis not coming back or ever getting better just know youre not alone a lot of us are experiencing these symptoms and with extreme severity its terrifying can be embarrassing and no one really gets it unless they have narcolepsy theyll never know what its like even remotely just on the exhaustion alone i absolutely relate to everything you mentioned and im so sorry youre going through all this too its mortifying to forget simple things that you should absolutely know and knew for years its so scary to realize how much your memory has deteriorated and to know itll never come back i wish there was a way out or back from this awful disease they still come in daily anyway unfortunately whether youre getting cleaning services or not but i agree i prefer not to have people maneuvering around my stuff every day i worry about things getting losttakentossed by mistake i mean considering i need a controlled substance medication to survive each day and not collapse at random or be essentially catatonic i will be at the mercy of however much medication i have left when a disaster hits if the stress and trauma of the event doesnt render it useless anyway so im not working myself up too much about it im not one of the folks meant to survive something like this its close to impossible for anyone suffering through life in poverty to be reasonably prepared anyway where are people supposed to store all these supplies nonetheless afford them our government is happy to leave the poor out to suffer and die on a normal day and through the pandemic so i can say with certainty the same will be true in an event such as this it sucks to think about but at the same time theres only so much a lot of us can do to prepare knowing i cant really do anything i try not to think about it i agree with you while ops boyfriend may have been lying and doesnt sound very committed here op doesnt exactly sound like mature relationship material either shes 29 for gods sake this is some teenage drama bullshit id be pretty upset too if someone was posting my photo and information on a dating forum to get opinions and takes from strangers thats a pretty big violation of my privacy and id be pretty upset that my supposed partner wouldnt address their concerns with me or talk to me about whats bothering them but would happily go to strangers and blast my picture and problems online op has some growing up to do i got precheck specifically because regular tsa times at pdx were so godawful i couldnt take it anymore has never taken more than 10 minutes in precheck even when getting those emails even the days after thanksgiving when the normal line was clogging back to the carrier desk areas and wrapped several rows of dividers deep it doesnt hurt to be 15 hours early regardless but ive never needed 23 with precheck pdx also has an estimator on their website you can check i think in general it really depends on when youre traveling specifically i think they send that as a blanket warning rather than it being triggered by your specific flight time this is my fearassumption my hope was they sell itits purchasable somewhere or something i could obtain a recipe for but im guessing this is probably the case i have this as well and i love it the tower is my absolute favorite im not a huge funko person but i think this one is super well done they have one with mickey in black instead of gold as well yep its probably near impossible to switch in such little time and if you do id question how preparedrested youd be for the studyif it would have a negative impact still i would call your doctorwhomever is doing your study and ask what they recommend if you can op let them know youre really concerned ive done this three times in the last year actually and was told no idea no one back here worked that and uh why would i have taken note of that i was hoping perhaps this post would reach an exwok worker or someone whos had more success in asking but ill attempt to ask again in the future i just dont get to ns often especially these days right as if nearly every bar ive ever been in in portland doesnt actively overserve constantly bottle service exists in other states and manages just fine thats pretty silly even dives are getting to be that bad these days i could rarely ever afford to go out before but now its getting insane im so glad i mean not glad youre going through it equally because that sucks and im so sorry but im so glad my comment resonated with you and helped im so sorry youre feeling it too friend always here if you need to chat i wish you the absolute best in your journey do you seriously think that their only job requirements involve aimlessly hunting for stolen cars are you kidding me i didnt say that i knew for a fact she did as we clearly dont i said if she did just because there isnt a lease doesnt mean she isnt a tenant eviction doesnt require a lease as you so confidently incorrectly stated there are other laws surrounding occupancy and establishing tenancy that dont involve paying any rent as well under no circumstances do you get to kick someone out with one day or less notice unless youre an idiot that wants to deal with a hell of a legal ordeal with the court system i dont need to source anything these are facts in the real world sounds like you could use to start living in it this is stupid plain ignorant advice it varies by location but in most a lease is not required establishing tenancy occurs through a few different avenues and no doubt if shes lived there over a few months paid any rent etc she is legally a tenant and must be given proper legal notice to vacate for legally permitted reasons or be evicted through the court system in some states even just occupying a space for a certain period of time gives you these types of rights you dont just get to kick someone out without even a day to pack no matter how much you dont like themhow shitty it was that they brought dogs into your house hopefully no one listens to this absolutely dumb completely inaccurate take likely because there are a lot of landlords on this subreddit whereas the people you are talking to are probably largely not in that category the most vocal are always the most noticeable on reddit as a general rule there is plenty of pushback from rentersthose who arent super prolandlords making big profits around these parts too but you will definitely see landlords chime in more vocally when something is impacting them directly because while not all renters may be bothered by some of these billschanges it will apply to all landlords did you not read disabled there us folks with disabilities work harder just to survive each day than you likely ever will in your fucking lifetime there is no work more work better for disabled folks quite frankly if we can work at all which many of us cant hence disabled the jobs are almost never paying a living wage nor are enough hours availablecan we work enough hours to get by hard work more work these dont equal more money in the us you can work yourself to death and still be paycheck to paycheck because the system isnt built to raise you up its built to keep you down theres nothing the majority can do to escape that especially when theyre already living life in hard mode by having a disability which they also cant fucking do anything about didnt ask for and didnt deserve youre a privileged piece of shit clearly by your tone and ideals here maybe spoiled entitled consider yourself lucky you arent in the same position as those of us who are disabled and impoverished and who are barely surviving despite all our best efforts ualternativesquare123 this is your first and final warning before a ban the way youre engaging on this subreddit is absolutely not okay if you cant be respectful and civil with other users you wont be here at all for a good majority of people it wont have much if any impact more than likely because for a good majority of people it isnt a problem and isnt interfering with their livessexual relationships so what exactly would there be for it to improveeffect those friends of yours who noted it had some kind of effect on them likely were using it differently than you experiencing different negative effects from their routines than you or potentially also reduced the amount they were masturbating in addition to ceasing to view porn honestly theres quite a lot of things that could factor into why they noticed a difference in their lives and you did not unless you are doing a 11 comparison between two people living exactly the same livesroutines with the same masturbationporn habits and such its really hard to sayto expect the same effects a lot of people who quit watching pornography also stop masturbating dailyas much this decrease in masturbation on top of quitting porn would likely cause an increase in general horniness potentially sexual performance and would mean theyre allocating time they normally would be using to jerk off to do other things which could be perceived as discipline or work ethic since theyre potentially spending more time on other things these friends also couldve had more obscure porngeneral masturbation habits that was impacting their sex livessexual motivation maybe they were jerking off more than you and reduced the frequency or maybe they were spending a great deal of time per session watching porn and no longer doing so freed up a good deal of free time for them theres a lot to be said for the placebo effect if the person quitting is doing so because they feel its problematiccausing issuesa negative behavior or they go into it expecting and truly believing they will experience a great deal of positive benefits they may perceive the outcome of the change to go along with that belief it may not actually be positive benefits relating to ceasing porn use but theyre attributing it to thatclaiming that is either because thats what they want other people to believe due to their own motivesmentality or because they dont realize that the change is more in themselves than it is a result of quitting porn a lot of times when were going to make a sizable change in our lives under the assumption it will benefit us positively and improve things like mood motivation drive productivity etc we tend to start working a bit harder at things in general staying more upbeatoptimistic trying to balance our priorities more etc those things can improve without changing anything around pornmasturbation but because theyve committed to this quit that they believe will improve their lives suddenly quitting porn is solely responsible for this change when thats not it at all point being the only person whos habits and results matter in your life is yours if you dont feel porn is causing any problems in your life sexually motivation wise etc and you are satisfied with your work ethic sexual interactions motivation etc then theres no reason to deprive yourself of it or consider it a bad habit when you start neglecting other tasksresponsibilities to watch porn thats when it starts becoming an actual problem it doesnt sound like
