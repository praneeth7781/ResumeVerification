diagnosed a lot younger than you but it became really isolating and i felt like my entire world fell apart right around your age when i was able to really digest the full reality of the diagnosis and symptoms and how they had already worsened so much despite being so young and how that was going to impact me as a real adult on my own i would recommend seeking out a therapist if that is an affordable and practical option for you it can really help to have someone to talk through these things with and to process the really difficult heavy emotions that come with having such a debilitating difficult lifelong illness especially with all the bad stigma lack of understanding and negativity people will give narcoleptics over their diseasesymptoms it really helped me when i finally was able to say this is a disability i have a disability a lifelong severe disability it felt like a prison sentence yet also an intense rush of relief and freedom at the same time i hate that i have it i hate what it does to me i hate that i cant get rid of it but it is real it is hard and i am struggling with a legitimate disability i can be patient with myself others can be patient with me and its okay if i cant operate on the same level as everyone else my age because i am not them and cant be no matter how hard i work at it i wish you the best in your journey it may seem bleak now but i would say that you are fortunate to have found out your diagnosis by age 20 there are many posts here of people much older just getting diagnosedstill seeking testing who wasted many many formative years flopping around like a fish out of water just trying to survive with no idea what was going on you have a lot brighter road ahead of you as a result of knowing the why behind your woes very much agree unfortunately unless you can literally relocate to a bubble a reactive animal like this just doesnt have a place in society at a certain point while some reactive animals can be trained enough to be safe just as many cant and no one deserves to have their or their petsloved ones safety and potentially lives put at risk by a dangerous biteprone animal in the meantime while you can muzzle a dog while its in public extremely reactive dogs are very escapeprone i could link you 100 stories of pitbulls escaping chewing their way out of houses etc to attack so taking precautions solely while in public settings just isnt enough if the behavior remains and is a dog that would need to be muzzled 100 of the time to be safe going to be a very happy dog one that has to be on a tight leash constantly watched and redirected and reprimanded no i dont think so dont let the assholes dissuade you from what you know you need to do op your safety life and financial stability come first period if you cant keep those in order you wont be able to provide for a pet either and you have to put yourself first regardless what comes second to that is the safety of those around you keeping an aggressive dangerous animal is an extreme hazard to everyone else and they dont deserve to have their pets wellness jeopardized as a result you are not required to keep a dangerous dog just to prove to a bunch of judgmental strangers that youre a good pet owner if theyre so concerned maybe they should come pick up the dog and take it on along with all the consequences that come with it it sounds like you genuinely tried your best despite being lied to which is enough to warrant taking the dog back to the shelter in the first place guilt free and there is nothing good that will come of being guilted into continuing down this road that you know ends in more disaster no one wants an animal to be put down keep returning to a shelter or to deal with these behavioral issues its sad and it sucks to see animals suffer or lose an opportunity to have a long healthy life but its part of life and when a dog reaches a certain point of reactivity and aggression its perfectly normal acceptable and the right thing to do in cases like this where it harms another persontheir pet that dog didnt deserve to be bit and couldve ended up much worse nor did another person deserve to see their pet suffer and incur costs and trauma as a result why people feel the need to jump on threads like this and go that dog youre trying to rehome deserves better is fucking beyond me no it doesnt it isnt the victim here the animal it injured and that pets owner is best of luck to you op they quite literally mention a pitbull rescue in their post which would indicate that the dog is a pitbull why is that pit people need to jump in to save them from stereotypes when even a slight mention of the breed occurs almost like the behaviors speak for themselves yep this is the only answer that matters call the people who deal with this professionally instead of asking for anecdotes on reddit i know this post isnt about stimulants but japans strictness on those medications means ill never be able to fulfill a lifelong dream of visiting such a shame some countries have such strict medication bans but so it goes right no i absolutely cannot live a normal life with this curse no amount of medication is fixing that and believe me ive tried its not easy never has been and absolutely never will be and it gets worse all the time and almost certainly will for the rest of my life i am also not privileged beyond reason like op here with his multiple 7 figure businesses which makes surviving that much more of a constant horrible battle but sure thats nice op im glad its possible for you but thats not the norm especially if your symptoms are anywhere near severe and the wording of this post really invalidates those of us desperately trying to stay afloat and make it through this miserable life and trust me we dont need any more invalidating we get plenty finally getting a diagnosis is both relieving and crushing for a lot of us i can relate its nice to know what the cause is and to be validated in how youre feeling you arent just lazy or weak or depressed or not getting enough sleep etc its a legitimate and serious illness but it can be very hard to come to terms with the fact that this is the rest of your life now and youre at a disadvantage as a result of something you didnt ask for some people have great outcomes with treatment and that may be you too my n is extremely severe and treatment is bleak for me stimulant medication can only do so much and its not much at all with fast building tolerance but thats not to say it wont be better for you one thing i wish i had known and accepted much earlier on though was that there is no cure and for some treatment just wont ever do much there will be no rested or normal again for some of us yes its depressing and sucks but accepting that it could be like that lets you prepare process and expect the worst but hope for the best youll do a lot better taking things as they come and managing the ups and downs the process of finding medication that works for youyou can tolerate can be very long and difficult if you look at things honestly at the start and set your expectations accordingly i wish you the best going forward and hope your outcomes are better than mine it can be a very stressful isolating road but youre not alone many of us with n who are being treated still do not ever feel finally rested unfortunately it is a complicated illness with not that many treatment options many of which arent great and it can get more severe with time be prepared for a lot of trial and error and the potential to never truly be rested again there is no cure for narcolepsy i kept waiting for this post to get to where she was asking you to be the bad boy and it just never did unless im missing something or youre leaving some key pieces out it doesnt sound like that at all what it reads like is that shes just asking you to initiate ideally more spontaneously with more general passion and for you to show her that you are attracted to her and want her in a more physical obvious way shes not asking you for anything that wild it doesnt seem like none of this says degrade me tie me up slap me around not that theres anything wrong with that i enjoy rougher domination type stuff myself and have a perfectly respectful reliable partner who is happy to step into that role sexually i just dont see that in your post anywhere it more seems that shes saying i want to feel deeply wanted arousing sexy and sexually desired by my partner ideally with some level of spontaneity if you cant see yourself initiating rather tame spontaneous sex with your partner that makes her feel like youre wild about her because you picture her as someone you want to have kids withmarry theres a lot to that and that road probably leads to some form of therapy for you the person you settle down and have kids with isnt your mother or a sibling theres no rule that says that role has to be set aside for some clean and virtuous entity that doesnt have a dirty side and that you cant get dirty with or it wont work or be right somehow not being able to see someone youre sexually crazy about as a viable long term partner is as youve acknowledged not a good complex to have and likely a hangup that will take a bit of work be it with a therapist or in a more selfguided therapy routine because i would hazard a guess that it will come out and cause turbulence in the relationship more than just now and in more ways than just this you are entitled to your own sexual boundaries and desires and if being in a more dominant role isnt for you anymore or isnt something youre seeking in this relationship thats totally fine and its okay to express that kudos to you for making an attempt at giving her something she has expressed wanting but at the same time it sounds like youre forcing yourself into a role you arent thrilled about and dont feel very connected with already psyching yourself out that you probably wont be that fulfilled by it just to check a box off for her in the long run thats not going to play out the way you seem to think it is shell almost certainly not be enjoying it if you arent truly into it and honestly it sounds like youre misreading what she was asking of you and are going into detached sexfiend doesnt give a fuck mode when from what youve written here shes just asking for you to express your sexual attraction and lust for her in a bit more vocal commanding way again all i have to go off is your post but it really seems like by dominating shes just asking you to
