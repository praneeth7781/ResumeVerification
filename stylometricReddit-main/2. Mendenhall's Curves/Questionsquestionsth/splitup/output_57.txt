find someone awesome who you can excitegets you excited like this when the time is right haha we are both very lucky indeed i feel super silly about it and it definitely can be embarrassing andor inconvenient but i also cant really complain too much its pretty wild sometimes how quickly the brain can just switch into primal sex mode over something without you really controlling it a past partner said he would get extremely uncomfortably horny if not a pretty decent halfboner when he thought he was smelling the lotionperfume i wore all the time while out in public i was never sure if i really believed him at the time but ive definitely been accidentally conditioned in similar ways since so its definitely a thing i hate that one of those things is eye contact with my partner for me we used to never really make eye contact much during sex no reason just wasnt a big focus i would often close my eyes when giving oral as more of a focus thing and somehow 7 years later weve gotten into some pretty kinky shit and yet direct eye contact has been a newer thing that drives me crazy the downside is when we have that same direct eye contact in our day to day my brain switches to crazy horny mode immediately regardless of circumstances yep couldnt agree more a lot of people who wantlike children are toxic as hell about it like theres something wrong with you if you arent absolutely wild about the gross little shits and everyone is required to want to deal with 18 years of hell because its some sort of miracle and beautiful journey i also personally find those with that special kind of intense over the top desire to raise a child by birth a bit narcissistic but thats just me yeah my childhood was horrendous but i dont want kids because i find them horrendous which has no ties to my childhood traumas my life is hard enough without a sticky mouth to feed and as someone with severe chronic illness im frankly doing the world a favor by not procreating plus all those great things you give up nope i dont believe youre seriously asking me this as if you somehow dont know but to give you the benefit of the doubt ill put it very simply youre not having physical sexual contact with someones political views you are with their genitals do the math as to why one is more relevant here than the other i dont believe you have to disclose every piece of information up front that could potentially change someones views as if reading off some kind of list i do believe you need to be honest if they ask you and i do believe if theres something out of the ordinary or something that could impact someones attractioncomfortpreference you need to disclose it before sex period theres a reason this trans woman in the op had sex with the lights off and didnt tell him until after she was being intentionally deceitful the word deceitful is literally in the title he obviously does mention it x200b youre being willfully daft and its obnoxious x200b bottom line is when engaging in sexual activity with someone revealing things like this that directly pertain to sex are required for someone to fully consent to having sex with you while you might be angry about a hypothetical conservative woman hiding her political beliefs those arent directly related to sex and most people wouldnt assume that they have relevance to that decision i dont think it needs explaining why something like this in ops scenario does this is the right answer period theres no need for well hypothetically what if it was someone who had reconstructive surgery but wasnt trans or yeah but you liked them before the bottom line is that lying and deceiving someone in order to engage in a sexual encounter is wrong and doesnt allow that person to consent fully i would say this about anything regardless of peoples views on the trans element here they were intentionally dishonest and misled op he has every right to feel hurt angry upset etc mostly applies to damn near any laws here drug decriminalization means rampant methheroin abuse open air drug markets everywhere dodging used needles on every sidewalk and absolutely unhinged tweakers everywhere shootings are rampant and very few are solved or consequenced we might as well refer to our legal system as catch and release if caught at all violent menacing offenders are released quickly and likely not truly consequenced property theftcrimes are constant hello utopgap430 thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for the following reasons rule 5 smite relevancy your post is not smiterelated

0d0dmyissueis direct replies to official mod comments will most likely be ignored we have a living wage shortage here lets get it right the jobs struggling to fill positions are largely not paying enough to make it worth working them the jobs that do pay enough to live have a crazy amount of competition anytime theres an opening the wages here have absolutely not gone up enough for the majority to make col manageable uroguerunway in the interest of fairness consider this a warning also if you dont have anything nice to say move along alrighty ugarbagelumi thats enough asking people to not be dicks in response to your comments but then snapping back with this level of venom to other users is unacceptable the report button exists for a reason if someone is bothering you or being disrespectful report it and move on you are still expected to follow the rules of the subreddit and remain civil to others regardless of the comments other users make consider this a warning absolutely not the period of time i was collecting pua pandemic unemployment for nonw2 jobs was the best period of my life i could afford to live put money in savings and have a safety net and i got to actually enjoy and live my life instead of spending every waking second struggling to survive in constant fear and anxiety fuck a job for those of us without the privilege of a high paying career we can actually enjoy and thrive inbe genuinely passionate about its all menial busy work bullshit who wants to work entry level minimum wage jobs retail fast food are you kidding me its all demeaning exhausting horrible busy work nonsense no one wants to do and when it doesnt even pay a living wage its no surprise theyre struggling to staff those awful positions i think a great many of us would rather not work the jobs available for the crap pay out there these days a great many of us would rather be able to enjoy our time on this earth instead of selling it for a pittance and for those of us like me who are disabled and will be for the rest of our miserable lives being able to afford to exist while not crippling and killing ourselves further in what few low paying positions are available to us would be a godsend i just picked up my cats ashes on friday iggy was my best friend a type of service animal and my little shadow that followed me everywhere and was very social and involved in each part of my day he died unexpectedly after being mauled by a horrible womans pit bull and had a lot of life left to live so i hadnt really put much thought into his final arrangements before the time came prematurely i am keeping his ashes in the bamboo urn the crematorium provided and have his clay paw print ink paw impressions and fur clippings the crematorium took sitting on a
