she was a promising candidate with real viable plans to fix this homeless crisis and crime crisis and filth crisis and drug crisis expect more of the same thats quite literally what was voted in

thank you for being so courteous and respectful its rare to find such genuine conversation on reddit these days haha i am definitely pretty perplexed and fascinated by triptan medications myself its pretty crazy how well they work when they work at zapping migraines and headaches away so incredibly quickly but they come with some very strange side effects too which is odd dont get your hopes up she barely wormed in her homeless plans to get herself in the seat but i can all but guarantee well see next to no change if any at all during her time not that the other candidates were good either we were given 3 frankly horrible choices all around but anyone expecting kotek to do anything of value regarding the homeless is kidding themselves i have taken stimulant medication for well over two decades for narcolepsy so i know what a substance comedown feeling is ive taken opiate pain medication for various conditions and surgeries over the years for shorter stints in the past as well as highly addictive sleep aides and antianxiety medications as well this is not that x200b it is an instant feeling of physical woe that begins very immediately after taking the medication fortunately the relief from a migrainecluster headache if it is going to come is very quick also sometimes 510 minutes later but again sometimes it doesnt work at all if you read up on triptan medications this is not uncommon especially with sumatriptan people report feeling a general sense of malaise directly after taking the medicine that can sometimes last an entire day i immediately feel extremely hot and feverish my face and seemingly the rest of my body gets flush and i feel a great deal of tension in my face and head almost like everything is tightening dramatically in a very painful way from there its a full body sense of discomfort coupled with a lot of weird and random painful feelings but its hard to pinpoint what exactly is hurting or put words to exactly how its hurting just that it is its unlike anything ive ever experienced its such a bizarre feeling of sick but not in the way a comedown feels thank you for your kindness 3 thank you 3 thank you 3 unfortunately no he did not both he and my mother were on medicaid and extra expenses like life insurance were out of the question of affordability he worked as a barber so was selfemployed and thus there were no workrelated benefits the pandemic obviously hit his industry incredibly hard which brought them further into poverty than ever before thank you for your kind words and empathy i sincerely appreciate that trying my best to hang in there thank you 3 it definitely killed all the faith i had left in this society to say the least for me they were all tied into one if you have the money to go gamble especially during the pandemic you have the money to be responsible for your debts before youre literally sued over them and having your paychecks garnished theres a difference between reasoning and plans for your credit card debt so dealing with it slowly and letting it get to the point of collections and garnishments the latter reeks of shadiness lack of give a fuck about ones actions and responsibilities and is pretty disgusting from someone in her position ive been poor all my life and sadly always will be short of a miracle i understand debt but letting it get to the point she did whilst in office out gambling and treating lesser workers like shit what a disgusting person if the casino thing hadnt happened id have still found her insanely irresponsible and gross over the credit card situation so it was on brand for her and that all ties together yep its disgusting step father shot himself in front of my mom this year in their shared home the cleaning crew alone wouldve bankrupted her or me so i had to try clean the gruesome scene up myself with basic household products alone while she fell apart in the hospital waiting for the donor team to harvest his organs ill never forget it its indescribable having to mop up someones insides with your bare hands then came the other costs for her and for me the medical bills having to live in a hotel while trying to move therapy medications missed work trying to stay afloat debts etc etc the list never ends shit when my cat who i loved more than anything on earth and who i had trained to help me manage some of my disability symptoms was mauled to death by a horrible neighbor and her awful dog who fled the scene he was indoor only and bolted out the door as i came in when startled by a truck backfiring on the street the bills were so far beyond what i ever couldve expected im barely surviving right now as if i had any room to breathe after my stepfather passing the death of a pet was so expensive it has nearly put me in the ground its insane of all the things that shouldnt be a financial burden death is surely one of them as if loss isnt hard enough for those left behind as if living isnt hard enough as it is ill add another comment though it looks like more than enough have responded i have kaiser through ohp which surely changes some things a bit but i see all the same providers a nonohp person would their dental is fine nothing fantastic nothing too bad it seems like most dentistry in this city is a joke to some extent and im getting a lower standard of care being on ohp anyway so given those factors it is sufficient primary care is hit and miss ive had some great providers and some awful ones the upside is there are tons of providers with locations all over the place so youre likely to find someone you like even if it takes a few tries and appointments are usually plentiful their sleep lab and sleep doctors are fucking awful and a complete joke that said their pharmacy has been great and stress free i get everything mailed free including controlled substance medication and everything is always on time or early even during periods of shortages of some meds theyve found a way to fill mine be that working with me on switching manufacturers and switching pill counts filling elsewhere etc if you ever take a controlled substance medication youll know how important and how much of a godsend not having to do monthly uas and then having run all over town trying to fill the damn thing is when needing to see a specialist its also hit and miss sometimes awesome because theyre in the same complex readily available and its easy to hit multiple stops in one visit sometimes hellish because appointments are scarce and booked 6 months out really depends on the department i will say my experience with other large medical groups in town has been worse on the pharmacy end about the same or worse on everything else so do you not experience sleep paralysis a common symptom for most narcoleptics yeah ill continue to use paralysis to describe sleep paralysis honestly with or without holding it against her shes in self preservation mode and theres probably a big sunken cost aspect of it too she doesnt want to be homeless again she hasnt even been working lately shes already invested this much time energy and emotion into the relationship and has humiliated herself on a wildly popular reality tv show for quite a while leaving ed would mean departing from tlc having to go back to work and make enough to sustain herself and her lifestyle transition and shed likely end up back in her car for a while in the process even if shes done and wants to leave him she probably feels like she needs to at least see it through until the point at which she can take something with her when she goes so it wasnt all for nothing eh i think that only really applies so much unfortunately in a micropenis or close to it situation it absolutely will matter quite a bit to quite a lot of people there will be partners who are fine with it or dont care but they will be much harder to find and it will absolutely limit the dating pool substantially for those men dick jokes and insults are cruel and unkind its not something a man has any control over i do agree with you there 100 your friend doesnt need sex right now she needs therapy how soon sex will be practical and healing after something like this will vary from person to person but if she hasnt gotten professional help with the trauma and processing side of things the answer is not yet i wouldnt get involved in this process if you want to keep her as a friend and have this go smoothly until at minimum there is a professional involved in therapy with her a budget would be very helpful for both software and machines hatch is a great program but its also 1000 this isnt practical for everyone especially people who are mostly hobbyists machines can start at 450ish for something that does embroidery and can go into the 6000 range for a multi needle more capable machine wow clay amazing super well done i definitely wouldve guessed 3d printed clay mustve taken a ton of time and effort thanks for sharing thank you his response to my comment told me everything i need to know about him frankly impossible to miss the real meaning behind that jab i didnt really have time to think about it unfortunately my best bud was mauled to death by a shitty pit bull it was a completely unexpected loss he was indoor only and bolted out the door when startled as my partner came in so we didnt have time to think about final arrangements we had to do something with him i havent regretted cremation though we rent so burial never crossed my mind and even if we owned id be worried about moving someday as id feel devastated to leave him behind we have a shelf set up in our kitchen above where he used to eat and decorated it with photos of him the paw prints and fur clippings they took at the cremation facility and his urn it feels good to have a memorial for him in our home and the peace of mind of knowing he will be able to move with us wherever life takes us is priceless plus hes inside with us where he always was not outside under a bush something about that just feels right to me this is his home and hes here im not sure what youre getting at exactly people use the term exotic dancer to mean stripper in the us people could
