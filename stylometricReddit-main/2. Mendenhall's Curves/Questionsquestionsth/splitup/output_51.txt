make it seem like theres a decent probability youll end up having that experience op but it very much is not the norm for most of us its a lifelong disability from which there is no remission and for many it gets worse as time goes on and medication becomes less effective not that it cant happen but i dont want you to get your hopes up either dont let a doctor tell you you should be at that point alreadyever when you know the meds are needed get a second opinion op damn youre right huuuuge missed opportunity glad you caught it because even i didnt think of it at first ive suggested sex therapy but again her ego immediately feels crushed and she feels its her fault for being sexually stunted at this point it is her fault not for being sexually stunted necessarily but for having too big of an ego to get some therapy and work with her partner in a meaningful way if your ego feels crushed and you shut down any meaningful growth or discussion in your relationship because of it you are not mature enough to be in an adult relationship if youre unwilling to try anything dont want to take the steps necessary to help yourself grow and work through some of your hang ups and issues but also expect your partner to do 100 of the work and be 100 understanding you are very much the problem im not saying that she needs to be into everything that op is or that she needs to bend to his every will and be down for everything he wants but it would seem that she recognizes shes too in her head to be a very good sexual partner yet wont do anything to work on it and deflects and points the blame back to op anytime its discussed thats pretty awful op it doesnt matter what anyone else says if you are not happy or feeling fulfilled in the relationship be it sexually or otherwise then you have every right to leave you can break up with someone for any reason or no reason if you are no longer feeling it in a relationship or are no longer interested in continuing thats enough of a reason period you are not required to stay in a relationship that you arent being fulfilled by just because some of it is good and quite frankly no one should be pressuring you to do so i imagine your girlfriend wants to be in a relationship with someone who is fully happy and fulfilled not someone who is constantly feeling as though theyre missing out and incompatible sex is a huge factor in most relationships it is a major part of intimacy and is something that most people value with their partner in some way or another a lack of sexual chemistry and sexual fulfillment is a hugely valid reason to leave a relationship especially when you have put as much effort as you have into trying to fix it or work on it and have been met with zero effort by your partner there are plenty of people out there who think its shallow or superficial to break up over sex and quite frankly they couldnt be more wrong these people either dont value sex much have never been in the situation you have where theyve had to make this decision or are inserting their judgmental shaming opinions where they arent needed or wanted to make themselves feel superior in some way you are the only person who has to live with this relationship and be with your partner therefore it is truly only your opinion and feelings that matter here if you are unhappy and feeling incompatible life is too short to continue to beat your head against a wall with a partner who isnt interested in working on things with you dont waste 5 more years of your life with someone who isnt right for you let her find someone who will be a better fit for her sexually and go find the right person for you hello unordictrippin thanks for your submission but weve had to remove it for the following reasons rule 4 no bugstechnical errors

warning before a ban if you cant behave yourself and communicate respectfully you wont be communicating here at all keep it civil not a man but going to comment anyway so you can possibly expand your post a bit and maybe get some more usefultoyou responses why do you ask op are you struggling with libido finding that yours is lower than you would like or declining and you are concerned so want to improve it if this is the case id also ask how old you are and how long youve had these concerns or do you feel your libido is healthy and not of concern but want to level up more so to speak so are just looking for casual practices that could increase it a bit even though youre fine without because if its the former you should almost certainly speak with your primary care doctor and perhaps seek to have your hormones mainly testosterone checked potentially see a urologist or be recommended to a specialist that can help you directly if its a medical problem or psychiatric one things like stretching and supplements might help a little but generally wont do much if you arent identifying addressing and fixing the core issue if youre just looking to increase and improve but dont feel you have anything to worry about with it and just want to up your game thats another story still doesnt hurt to ask your doctor next time you talk to them as theyll be able to give recommendations more specific to you and what they know of your health generally maintaining a protein rich healthy balanced diet and getting a lot of vigorous exercise well balanced exercise that works on different parts of the body as well as cardio will help nurture a healthy libido when youre eating like shit and treating your body poorly libido is often one of the first things to get lazy as well being sure you arent vitamin deficient and get enough of the core vitamins you need is another one in both men and women pornmasturbation habits can impact libido both positively and negatively and are a good thing to think about as well sleep is another big one good sleep hygiene getting
