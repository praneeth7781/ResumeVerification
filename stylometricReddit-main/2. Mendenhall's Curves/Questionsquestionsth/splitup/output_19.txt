you come off so warm and kind in your comment and it really touched me if the shoe fits because some irrational entitled guest calling and demanding they call the authorities because they smell something they dont like isnt how they enforce any of their policies if the hotel was full there is nothing they can do about moving you obviously im certain they investigated the issue whether you were made aware of it or not they dont owe you a personal view of their every move because you called to whine and when they determined there was no problemnothing that could be done due to lack of evidence or issue they moved along to the next responsibility implying that disney is full of druggies and disney is actively aware of their presence and willfully enabling it is so hilariously delusional you clearly live a life of great privilege if disney seems full of druggies to you all of this you said it the sleep is the simplest of the issues honestly and seemingly the only one that 90 of websites about narcolepsy want to mention and that most doctors want to focus on and that anyone learning about the disease care to retain yeah the sleep side of things fucking sucks dont get me wrong but the memory loss i have no short termworking memory i might as well have a degenerative brain disorder or early onset alzheimers im losing my past and i cant form a present the physical and mental pain it fucking hurts to have narcolepsy my head always feels heavy exhausted foggy and actually in physical pain my body is always achy it takes me longer to recover from sleeping wrongbecoming sore sometimes the process of chewing is so painfully exhausting i cant even fathom eating standing up long enough to shower can be a burning sensation when im at my most tired the attention and focus issues the automatic behaviors the microsleeps the mood problems im a fucking useless zombie 95 of the day if im lucky im so sick of seeing narcolepsy information only mention 35 fucking symptoms every piece of literature out there paints us like sluggish sleepy oafs that have weird dreams and sleep paralysis but beyond being tired should function fine during the day ridiculous and god the stigma with medication you said it if i read one more fucking complaint from posts across reddit regarding the stimulant shortage ripping on stimulant users and acting like adhd people are the only ones who get this medication my head is going to explode god this one really hurts money issues aside since im so cripplingly disabled by narcolepsy i will be living in abject poverty for the rest of my life when i have been able to vacationget away the stress and exhaustion makes it hard to get anywhere near my moneys worth out of the experience i end up feeling more depressed than anything when i try to get away because its harder and harder all the time to get up and have any semblance of a day whether at home or anywhere else i had so many dreams of travel and accepting that none of them will ever happen both due to this fucked up country damning disabled people to a life of poverty and due to all the terrors of narcolepsy has been absolutely crushing i have wanted to visit japan ever since i was a young child i knew deep down id never be able to afford it but i at least kept the dream alive as a but what if but when i learned that you cant bring stimulant medication into the country i had an actual sobbing breakdown it was written in stone at that moment that i will never achieve that dream someone could hand me 50000 tomorrow and it will still never happen this is just one of many dreams ive had that moment about and it fucking sucks narcolepsy has stolen every dream every desire and every goal ive ever had from me i would love to vacation again some day but i know its just a waste ill sleep through most of it and even if i dont i wont remember most of it anyway they really should expand this and do it at om as well the hours are super short and its super infrequent not everyone wants the experience of going to a childrens machine or a zoo when visiting meow wolf unfortunately no i would be laughed out of the pharmacy or my doctors office if i even attempted to ask for extras of a controlled substance not only is it not legally permitted youre more than likely going to be marked as a drug seeker which is something that can impact your ability to get your lifesaving medications for the rest of your life for even asking no matter how reasonable the explanation might be such as relating to something like this i have fortunately been able to obtain a few months extra of things like my migraine medications and such but where the important stuff is concerned sadly our laws around controlled substances are really frankly stupid as i am painfully impoverished always have been and always will be yay america collecting a surplus of anything isnt really realistically feasible food stamps barely supplies enough to survive the month youre receiving benefits for stockpiling is out of the question and with inflation itll only become less and less doable for folks like myself who arent welloff having the space to store things like water or extra food or supplies would also be a major problem comfortable spacious housing isnt exactly abundant here i do appreciate your seemingly optimistic and wellinformed outlook on things youre right people need to prepare and there needs to be a plan in place to help those who couldnt stockpile and dont have the resources should an event like this happen unfortunately for those of us who are poor and disabled and who have difficult medical needs it wont really matter what the plan is we will be forgotten because there will be too much else to manage and it will be too hard to cover our needs definitely thought it said criddler which is a term used here in portland perhaps elsewhere too to describe our special flavor of awful methzombie homeless folks and was very confused looks great though seriously nicely done chuckled at the windows 95 manual mention ive seen one in a neighborhood lfl when walking to the store once or twice as well as some very random textbooks and wondered if theyd get any takers who knows that manual could be the book for someone who has truly read everything ah yes because white people cant be impoverished struggle with access to things or have need for free books exchanges totally awesome point thank you thank you so much i am by no means a good cook so perhaps that is why but ive made teriyaki sauce at home with a similar recipe and while decent it just wasnt it i dont know what it is exactly but the ns sauce just tasted very different to other teriyaki ive had and i could never figure out why but lets just say i probably couldve singlehandedly kept the wok bar open with how often id eat it i will give it another shot with this list on hand though i appreciate it so much im completely useless in the kitchen so id guess that plays a part in why i cant quite identify what it is about the ns teriyaki that makes it different but guess quality of ingredients and exact amounts does okay a big part in the final flavor ill try to play around a bit thank you again thank you so much for your response i dont know that ive ever seen teriyaki chicken in the self serve hot bar but then again i cant say ive looked that hard do you know if thats something they may still offer or if that was an older thing the couple times i asked about it since the wok closed i was told they had no ideadidnt sell the same stuff they used back there funnily enough i worked at the cedar hills new seasons a bit under a decade ago and wish i wouldve thought to investigate then but i just assumed it would be around forever thank you so much for responding im essentially just trying to find the teriyaki sauce that was used in the woks i dont know if yall used a certain brand or how it was made if it was something specific to new seasons but im desperate to find it i dont know why but there was something different about it that i havent found in other teriyaki sauces and i crave it constantly ah thank you so much ill give that a shot ufeelted1 please keep it civil if you dont have anything respectful to say no need to comment this is a warning thank you uitzaquaaa if you cant keep it civil you will receive a temp ban rule 1 if you cant be respectful no need to comment this is a warning udemidevil1 if you cant keep it civil you will receive a temp ban rule 1 if you cant be respectful no need to comment this is a warning the aftermath of my stepdads suicide was pretty fucked up i guess he shot himself in front of my mom last january couldnt have been more unexpected not that you ever expect these things but there were zero signs this was not someone exhibiting depression or going through a rough patch at all i had to clean up the aftermath on my own maybe an hour after they took him to the er he didnt make it but he was kept alive on machines for a week so they could harvest him for organ donation which quite frankly was almost more awful of an experience overall than cleaning up the unreasonably awful aftermath i still think about it all the time never on purpose it just flashes by sometimes its weird you see suicides in movies bloody scenes on screen it isnt really like that its different its somehow both less shocking and gory and more gruesome all at the same time i guess second to that would be six months later holding my cat who i loved more than anything while he bled to death from a needlessly cruel and gruesome mauling by our deplorable neighbors pit bull think what you want about pets cats dont have to be your thing but it absolutely ripped my heart out haunts me all the time this cracked me up what a wild way to say i cant afford to purchase a parking pass it does look good but i much prefer the tower at night without projections it just looks right when its lit up normally projection free and is really beautiful some of the holiday projections while well done are way too busychaotic the 50th look as in ops photo feels like the best of all of them not too over the top and very crisp but i feel like it really takes away from the tower and looks a bit odd in the area that said theyre fun once and a while at this point on the rare occasion i attempt to explain what narcolepsy is likehow some of the symptoms are i will use degenerative alongside a lot of the brainmental symptoms such as memory loss loss of executive functioning automatic behaviors brain fog etc i have absolutely lost most of my short termworking memory executive functioning attention span organization skills recollection etc the brain fog and memory loss absolutely feels degenerative gets worse all the time has gotten progressively and measurably worse over the
