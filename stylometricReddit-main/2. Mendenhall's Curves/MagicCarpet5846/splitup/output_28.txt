so deeply that you want to just take over from now on now is the chance to tell me are we on the same page if he gets at all angry walk away and say this is what i mean im leaving the conversation until you can continue this like an adult in a healthy relationship if you cant figure out how to have a conversation without belittling me then this relationship isnt going to work out find me once youve decided and leave go read a book go for a walk take a bath whatever it is that you want but show him that you mean business because right now he plain and simply doesnt respect you you need to demand respect and make it clear that if he doesnt start respecting you you are prepared to walk away out of curiosity if your husband is the one who is all dont disagree with anyone unhealthy bottle stuff in crap have you ever tried telling him not to speak to you that way i mean thats his preferred method of communication after all unless theres some hidden hierarchy youre not addressing where as the man of the household youre meant to follow him vibes going on of course women are allowed to speak its not about her gender at all try not to make things that arent about gender about gender its about the person who did bring it up did so with no intention to actually change the relationship at all she basically dangled a relationship carrot in front of op who was eagerly awaiting the moment they would become official which idk why he didnt bring it up himself since he clearly wanted it only for her to say aaaactually im still fucking and plan to continue to fuck other dudes you really gunna tell me that isnt humiliating unless shes denser than a bag of rocks she knows damn well what soooooo what are we on a romantic dinner out implies it is meant to progress the relationship forward not to literally say hey i just want to make sure youre clear that this isnt going anywhere and i also wont stop seeing other people she raised up ops hopes waited to make sure that he was happy about the offer of something more only to assure him that wasnt at all what she wanted or planned to do thats about as humiliating as it gets in terms of rejection in a situationship wait until it actually is truth before youre patting yourself on the back there bud one bad map does not months of mediocre tape make sure if he is consistently on the bottom of the leaderboard you may have a point but you also have no way of knowing yet if he wont drop 30 every map next week its an unhealthy behavior to develop of staying in a relationship only because you or he loves the other love isnt enough and you should always base your decision on whether to continue a relationship based on how your partner is treating you in the moment not in the past and not how you want him to treat you in the future youll save yourself from a lot of toxic and crappy relationships if you remember those two rules unfortunately if rachel thought finding a man with a family to provide for her kids was so important to her she should not have married your father she needs to either accept the incredibly sad and i entirely sympathize with her and her kids reality that they just dont have any family outside of their parentshalf siblings or she needs to divorce your father and go find a man who has family who will accept nonbio kids with open arms it sucks but this is the family she chose to marry into and youre under no obligation to cater to her wishes this is just like someone complaining about their crazy inlaws and trying to get them to changecut them out of their lives adults need to realize you dont just marry the man youre marrying the family if you arent happy enough with the total package as it is you dont proceed with the marriage just like you dont marry a man for their potential you marry them for who they are and let this be a life lesson for you too youre marrying a man but also youre marrying into a family and you need to consider those dynamics when evaluating if this is a something you will be happy in forever definitely remain nc the fact that she brought it up even knowing she didnt want exclusivity is pretty humiliating that being said dont wait for the woman to bring it up next time when youre ready you should be bringing it up i can only assume its insecurityfear and thats also probably not an attractive trait if it were me even if i did want a serious relationship i would quickly lose interestrecalibrate my feelings if after 5 months this conversation wasnt brought up just an fyi not in this day and age im going to be honest its decently fucked up she would bring up the what are we talk while actually not wanting anything to change about your relationship and in fact not wanting exclusivity it almost feels as though she knew you thought you two were heading towards exclusivity and felt extremely guilty about seeing and sleeping with other people and was attempting to clear her conscience take this as a sign she isnt ready or worth another serious thought and cut your losses definitely remain nc because its very clear she doesnt want a relationship and the fact that she would so callously mess with your feelings by asking you what are we while fully knowing she didnt want you to be anything is just not worth any more time yeah definitely dont invest your time money and effort into a woman whos shown you shes only looking for someone to provide for her and benefit her she wants a one sided relationship and that cant last forever once things get hard the relationship will fall apart and if you marry her while being an executive she may show you just how selfcentered she really is and take you for all youre worth its a really common story i dont think its unfair i think both 5050 and proportional are valid payment schemes but you do need to decide what works best for youyour values and stick to it if she was always down for 5050 then id say thats just as fair even though shes getting more free money now but its pretty clear her values arent we are equal partners5050 or we should each be contributing equal parts relative to our skills proportional to income her values are quite simply i expect the man to take care of me which is also a fair enough desire but op needs to understand her partners values and decide if thats the role he wants to fill not every man does and thats okay i honestly do think they both cheated emotional affairs are affairs and he said he accused her of one during their marriage and then theyre married within a year of the divorce that definitely screams emotional affair he cheated as well so at that point its clear you two both moved on from one another but im not sure how anyone can see the facts and the timeline and not think that there were mutual feelings involved long before the divorce was signed otherwise you just dont get married within a year to your ex husbands best friend if she cant afford to move out then you assess how insane you think shell be in the breakup if shell be mature you ride it out maybe one of you sleeps on the couch if you think shell handle it poorly you get a new apartment and you ride it out for the 6 months left on your lease or whatever it is and a few weeks before move in you tell her thats pretty much your only option she clearly did something before you two lived together so she can figure someone out after too moving forward dont move in with people youve known less time than some of the food in your fridge some people think it makes themselves sound bad ass rather than weak she obviously isnt 100 sure if steve really did have feelings for daisy or not so i take it as the human equivalent of puffing yourself up in the face of danger so hopefully the predator will run away people on reddit like to encourage others to do what will entertain strangers the most but this is your actual life you are living dont blow something up with someone you love because a bunch of strangers on the internet have nothing better to do than encourage more people to be miserable with them thanks fam guess im the ass carry on did you mean to reply to this comment because it makes no sense and makes you sound like a pompous ass in context he would be correct if you decide to stay love yourself more than that heres what you reply to every single person if standing up against the disrespect of the relationship with the woman i plan to spend my life with is something small to you that you think i should get over then god bless your marriage because no relationship will ever last with that attitude i will protect my relationship and back up the woman i love before i will anyone else you seem to be making excuses for her this is a thing people do to defend themselves no one wants to admit they werent enough for their partner no one wants to admit they had a bad judge of character when they committed to someone but look its okay to make mistakes good people fall for bad ones all the time but your fianc has shown you a lot of flaws 1 she wont communicate with you when shes feeling down and has unaddressed needs in the relationship 2 she wont turn down the attention of another guy in at least some circumstances 3 your fianc is of so low class to get with a married man 4 your fianc doesnt respect you enough to come clean before you gave up a lucrative career and your future for her she shouldve told you then so you could make an informed decision shes trying to trap you 5 your fianc didnt even tell you because she finally realize just how fucked up this is she only told you because someone else made her feel guilty about it 6 youre with a woman so good at lying to you she can carry on a whole other relationship for months and youll be none the wiser and lie to your face for years and youll be none the wiser now all this really taken into consideration are you going to tell me you can lay next to this woman every day for the rest of your life and feel peace if not its time to call off the wedding have you ever met a 15 year old boy with any form of siblings they can be viscous its almost like redditors dont understand what teenagers are like form an objective perspective siblings say crap like this all the time without any trauma i dont think they are asking him hes just saying it the daughters told op that he said it out of nowhere and according to op the one step sister who showed interest was told 6 years ago to knock it off it genuinely reads like the 15 year old is going through normal 15 year old growing pains combined with
