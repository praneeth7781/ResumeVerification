a phone call before agreeing your sibling can wait another 20 minutes yeah but even before all that how did op know her cousin was in the same school and major yet never mention his name to the cousin or so much as a picture i know my closest friends partners names and faces well enough that i would definitely recognize them if they showed up in my physics class dont even wait 3 days tell her she needs to get a job and start contributing let her start the divorce herself if you want to protect yourself you get in front of it dont just wait for him to decide hes built a strong enough case instead strike first info have you contacted the school and asked for an exception because most schools will give out more than the two tickets if you ask i mean the reality is what other choice does she have live in her car she has no family or friends around is attending a school with poor resources and doesnt make enough to easily afford a new place sometimes you have to act ignorant for self preservation not everyone has the luxury to immediately and shamelessly leave shitty situations idk man the facts here i see no way for op to go hey you need to pay for a new place for me and the grandma to go oh okay here you go i mean like i guess maybe she could but i very much doubt it especially because ops boyfriend would likely step in and even if he didnt i dont really see a world where a landlord is legally required to provide alternative accommodation and legally unable to simply terminate the lease hence it being a situation that would likely require a legal battle if theres even any chance of success which im dubious of i dont really care to get into a back and forth on hypothetical legal situations though suffice to say ops housing situation sounds on borrowed time so shes better off focusing on that right now and only then looking into anything else if shes so inclined because im sure if she tried anything legal with her boyfriends elderly grandmother unless she has backup accommodations right then and there he isnt going to continue living with her as she tries to sue his grandma or even send a strongly worded legal letter definitely op needs to learn renters rights and how to protect herself but at this point in time she probably has much more pressing matters than any potential recourse rethe old apartment sometimes unfortunately you learn lessons the hard way long expensive and complicated legal battles arent always the answer theres a good chance it wouldnt go anywhere landlords are under no obligation to inform you about renters insurance thats your own responsibility to limit your own liability some places landlords can require it but ive never heard of anywhere saying a landlord needs to usually the way the law is written a landlord either needs to repair the damage or if the place is uninhabitable they can terminate the lease which it sounds like is what she likely did i obviously dont know the law everywhere but dont feel bad about not wanting to pursue anything legally as i cant imagine a judge seeing i didnt know i needed insurance why didnt anyone tell me as a very good excuse im sure it depends but if the place is uninhabitable the landlord is allowed usually to just end the lease which is what it sounds like she did typically landlords are only under obligation for their home to be habitable and in the case where it isnt end the lease not to provide adequate housing elsewhere if their accommodations are uninhabitable renters insurance is what provides accommodation if yours is unavailable and its definitely not the responsibility of the landlord to tell you about renters insurance thats on you to do research and decide some places require it but thats mostly for their own protections op can definitely try to double check but given her situation her time money and effort would probably be better spent finding a place to live that meets her needs and she can afford on her own as i suspect this friend wont let op stay much longer much less past when the bf inevitably lets the beans spill you probably dont want to hear it but unless you have a backup plan no i would not say anything to him right now things are only somewhat fine because hes under the impression youre none the wiser as soon as you let him know there is no reason to pretend theres a goooood chance things get very ugly and at this point it seems like the people youre living with are only letting you stay because of your boyfriend you gotta look out for yourself number 1 so take this information and plan find an apartment on your own and get a move in date of asap only then should you bring it up as most likely once you do hell be honest with you and good chance you get kicked out of where youre staying probably would send them a were so happy you want to celebrate officially becoming a family but we are holding off on the big celebration with a dress and photos until baby is old enough to be a part this is important to us and hope you will respect our feelings as they wont change that being said wed love to have you and fiances parents said this was as your husband should be sending the message not you over for dinner to celebrate all of the good fortune in our lives lately did you buy or sell i dont know if the person who boughtsold it did so maybe the real estate agent honestly i have no idea how it works and id say it usually is pretty accurate but it definitely can be inaccurate and i suspect it has to do with someone incorrectly reporting it fringe case for sure but zillow definitely isnt getting the info from the government for every sale thats for sure but yes i saw the price and was a bit annoyed i wish i didnt have to spend that extra 100k but i definitely did 500k in lottery winnings comes with a minimum 125k in federal taxes and a potential additional 44k in state taxes that means he only got a maximum of 330375k thats still a lot of money but it isnt buy my family a house money or retire early money and thats assuming he was in a position to save all of it but most likely he had some debts or large purchases he was able to make with that money like student loans credit card debt maybe he paid off a mortgage or bought a new car it sucks but money doesnt go anywhere near as far as people think it does especially when you factor in taxes so just remember even with that huge leg up you probably canshould still have sympathy for him for all that stuff yep and for mine it shows a completely and wildly inaccurate price thats more than 100k less than i paid and a price that was never even remotely possible so while yes its a good starting point it isnt always 100 accurate just a heads up those arent accurate and must be selfreported by someone the house i bought was listed as being sold for well over 100k less than i paid and since i know how much i paid i know that zillow was very much not correct well theyre only 22 now so i would probably say theres not a huge difference between discussing it when theyre 1819 the ages they actually were as they met at 15 and were together for 3 years and at 22 its really only 3 years different and yes you change in that time but idk if youre really ready for marriage at that point where you werent before ya know but also i just find it so hard to understand how op can be madly in love with him and living with him but her cousin who shes really close to and is in the same major and school as had no idea nor did kenny how did you not say anything all my friends knew about my partner within a few dates certainly 3 years and marriage talks would never happen without showing a picture or giving a name especially if i knew someone knew my partner from outside of me and then how can you have that sort of heartbreak its rather obvious kenny ended things and not say anything to your cousin about it like hey dont date him im not over him idk man sounds really weird again doctors are more than just mds and even so yes the starting average salary is 211k for medical doctors thats after residency but you can complete your residency in your midlate 20s especially if you do medical school in another country or take advantage of a number of accelerated programs that pretty much every med school offers remember just because you havent had this experience doesnt mean it hasnt and cant happen to someone else my niece has just graduated as a doctor yes being vague to illustrate my point and makes 185k at 24 with a signing bonus of over 10k and my sibling who graduated a few years ago was able to purchase a 4 bedroom home in a really nice area at 23 this one not a doctor but in a well paying field i wouldnt call it a mansion but its an impressive achievement at 23 it happens it might not be common but personal experiences on reddit arent supposed to be the average experience theyre supposed to be what happens to you so try to open your perspective on what you see as possible more and dont discount something as an obvious trollfake just because you personally havent seen something happen but in the end totally up to you what to think of what you read on the internet its grossly selfish to stay in a relationship with the intention of thinking you can change her mind so assume she is 100 serious on never wanting kids if you know wanting kids is a must have in your life to the best of your abilities you two are fundamentally incompatible and the only honorable thing to do is leave her to find someone who doesnt want kids either if you think the right person is worth not having kids for i would be very honest with her so she is allowed the choice as well i have always wanted kids but i also feel a very strong connection with you i am not asking you to change your mind but more i am open to seeing if our relationship develops into something more where i accept not being a father but i also want to give you the choice on if youre on board because i cant guarantee how i will feel in the future and dont want to put you in an unfair position if we ultimately do disagree now chances are she probably will also say hey lets call it here and save us the potential heartbreak but at least youre being open and respecting this woman enough to communicate openly with her so many guys hear a woman say i do not want children and think it means i dont want kids right now or think to themselves well its too early to think about kids anyway so lets reevaluate in a few monthsyears but no do not do that this is why people bring it up early because they dont want to be
