want to stay it sucks but wake up man you deserve better you cant be that dense shes making at least 100hour on one table and no server at a high end restaurant handled one table at a time waitresses do not care if their money comes from the job itself or customers and there is no way theyre complaining about the pay because frankly theyre highly overcompensated here servers at even slightly fancy restaurants let alone one of this level routinely say the real reason they dont want tipping culture to change is because they make 6 figures and know damn well the job isnt a job worth 6 figures and if it were changed to a salaried position paid for by the employer theyd be making 2025hour flat rate instead of potentially hundreds of dollars an hour nta its insane anyone would think a waitress should be making well over 150hour and if theyre serving a normal number of tables the real figure would be at least double that yeah they should get a livable wage it isnt a job worth more than engineers lawyers and even some doctors are paid sorry but the expectations of someone without any qualifications being entitled to that kind of salary is utterly insane to me waitresses dont need to be making 100 dollars an hour for shitty service and thats assuming that was her only table which it obviously wasnt if them being busy and understaffed was the underlying reason for poor service sorry but a waitress even at the highest end of restaurants and the best of service should not be making more than most lawyers engineers and even some doctors make we dont know if sil made the rule or if family did we at least know sil isnt putting a stop to it though reaffirming this isnt how men are this is how shitty unhappy people are how to address it be honest i have a feeling youre planning on proposing soon and before we discuss marriage we need to have a serious conversation i am and have been unhappy and have not felt like my needs are being met for awhile now ive tried to delicately bring it up to you and it ended really tensely so i dropped it but i cant marry someone i dont feel loves me and isnt putting in effort in maintaining the spark i know weve been together awhile and its easy to get comfortable but i want more for my life than that i hope you do too i would love to go to a couples therapist if youre open to it so we can try to talk and find ways to reconnect but this isnt a dynamic i will be happy in forever and i want our marriage to last forever were you tested for hiv because i looked up all of those drugs and they seem to be commonly used in treating secondary infections associated with hiv i would likely have your partner get a full and i mean full std panel and have him show you the results assuming he is fully clean then you can decide if you think your unhappiness is truly just a state of mind or not i cant tell you to choose happiness but i will remind you your daughters are learning from the example you set so act accordingly to what youd want them to do in the same situation zitrolin appears to be azithromycin most commonly used to treat chlamydia and gonorrhea flucoral appears to be fluconazole and most commonly used to treat yeast infections or secondary infections with hiv herclov seems to be used for genital herpes in immunocompromised patients with hiv given the fact that two of these are given to treat secondary infections due to hiv and one is a general wide spectrum antibiotic your partner having a history of shady behavior at best and they all treat different genital infections your partner very well may have and is hiding hiv from you or had an unsafe exposure and went to the doctor to get treatment for a number of sexually transmitted pathogens this is all information ive gathered from looking up the drugs and isnt medical advice but you need to be very concerned because i do not imagine this combination of drugs being given just because of an old herpes flare up im not familiar with how drugs are prescribed in the regions it says these drugs are available though you didnt ask him if he was clean and when he was last tested before sleeping with him lady no offense but youre way too old to be so dumb and fast and loose with your own health at this point you need to decide if youre happy in this relationship exactly as it is or if you arent if you arent i would recognize you are a 44 year old woman and old enough to be able to stand up for yourself and say im not happy its better for us to go our separate ways and stop teaching your daughters that this is the relationship that they should aim for lol oh my god i only lied to you once and i cant believe youre doing this you dont love me youre damn fucking right i do not love someone who would so willingly endanger the lives of mothers and children on the road because youre too much of a fuck up to call an uber home the fact that completely sober he has no remorse and can say that to a nurse who very well may have real trauma surrounding the consequences of drunk driving shows that if anyone in this world is actually unloveable it might be him i would honestly question the moral integrity of anyone who told me they actually did still love someone who pulled this sort of shit nah i disagree rather strongly a girlfriend of 3 years absolutely gets to say if you want this relationship to continue you need to divorce your wife and i need to see proof do you know how many women believed the whole bullshit of were separated well get a divorce eventually she doesnt even live around here to find him married with a baby on the way not saying thats the case here but the gf would and frankly is for letting it go on so long be an idiot for not wanting the divorce to be official by now and for wanting to know without a doubt that it is a real divorce i mean you need to give your partner some faith and trust but 3 years into a relationship and 5 years after a separation sorry theres trust and then theres being a fool she still shouldnt force herself to be at the courthouse but this is absolutely 100 her business this isnt a new relationship this is in the territory of trying to decide if i can or want to spend my life with this person territory and at that point yeah a major decision of hmmmm should i continue being a married man with a serious girlfriend becomes your business as said serious girlfriend utterly ridiculous to claim it isnt her business or that its at all similar to her influencing his will i really dont think its fair to say a gf of three years should have no say and should keep out of the fact that shes dating a legally married man she definitely is fully within her rights to wonder why after 5 years neither of them has finally said hey this marriage is obviously over lets make it official because even knowing and believing op that theres no feelings i am wondering how five years later and multiple state moves this hasnt been made official i mean shes had to get licenses and file for new jobs completely divorced is saying shes married it is definitely weird it would definitely get a side eye and some questions from any rational selfrespecting person lets not make a completely valid concern of the girlfriend into an issue of insecurities because thats also harmful to women if i was dating someone separated and three years later they were still just separated omg everyone in my support system would be shaking me to snap out of it and leave i would just say this is a legal process and the lawyers have advised me to only have us and a lawyer there to take care of things as amicably and quickly as possible i will see you immediately after and we can celebrate but im going to take their advice here to make sure this happens and happens quickly i am ready to close this chapter fully could be how i dont think youre breaking up for your son and you need to stop framing it that way youre breaking up because of you and knowing youre unhappy its also true that youre putting your son in the middle of a seemingly unhealthy relationship but you should not make your child bear the burden of ending your relationship own that decision yourself nta but you need to handle this very delicately so i am glad youre excited and willing to support me in this journey and i am willing to pay up to 4kmonth for our home we can get a really nice place for 4kmonth and i would be willing to pay the entirety of the rent because im so happy to have you join me on this adventure but if you want a place thats more than 4k you need to be willing to pay the difference because i am not willing to spend any more than 4k if the place you want is 5k or 10kmonth i dont really care you need to pick a place where youre comfortable with paying that difference otherwise it feels like you want to spend all of the extra money im making and that would make this move totally pointless for me i want to save and i want to continue being responsible i need to know that you are i are on the same page here financially before we make this move because otherwise i honestly dont see the relationship working out long term if we are on such different wavelengths when it comes to finances also not to be that guy but you can definitely get a nice place in a good part of town for 45kmonth in any city i lived in a good part of la for 3kmonth in a giant 1bd apartment with high ceilings and i lived overlooking the river in manhattan in a luxury small but extremely nice and plenty for a couple that isnt working from home apartment for 5kmonth and had a 2 bd apartment in the upper east side for 6kmonth again luxury building yeah youre still living like a normal well off person you arent getting a mansion with 8 bathrooms but holy shit you dont need that especially if you her arent making enough to afford it and i specifically picked the prices for la and nyc because i know its two of the most expensive cities you can live in so absolutely bullshit you need an 810kmonth apartment for a couple with no kidspets where a 1 bed would be plenty and a 2 bd is excess if you want guests in order to live in a nice place without high crime your budget is plenty assuming you arent looking to live like a millionaire finding his trophy wifes lifestyle she needs to learn to make choices she cant have everything have you just say her down and said hey ive noticed this pattern and every time i try to talk to you about it you shut it down so the options are we either address it now or we need to
