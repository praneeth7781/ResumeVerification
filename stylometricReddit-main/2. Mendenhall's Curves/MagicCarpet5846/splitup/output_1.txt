tell your next closest friend shes the new invite op representative because clearly old friend cant handle it obviously word it way more professionally than that but seriously tell them to stop letting him invite you because he isnt and you want to join them next time so ask someone else to take up the reigns you literally just tell the girls hey i would love to join you guys next time looks like friend keeps not inviting me for some reason how about next time you all want me to join you invite me and ill be there stop letting your friend be the gatekeeper of your invite you were clearly getting invited by someone else before have them take the lead back up unfortunately you learned this guy isnt your friend anymore but youre his boss you gotta be professional i would just distance yourself and make sure to keep being the cool boss to everyone else this reeks of i want to sabotage you and take your job i mean you really just have to pick your girlfriend or your friends because if you dont break up with the girlfriend immediately after this none of these people will ever her over again and most likely will distance or drop you entirely my point was if hes getting tested regularly it seems without a doubt he made sure she was tested early on and was negative i never said you shouldnt but the reality is most dont so anyone who is subscribing to regular texting even in a relationship would be conscious enough to ask a partner about their std status early on and make sure they were tested recently idk man if hes getting tested while in a relationship you would think hes the type to ask about stds beforehand she sounds racist i know your type ill bet op is not white and the kids are potentially mixed and more white passing than she is im assuming its racism not classism maybe call the police and actual professionals rather than posting on reddit it just makes it so you can fully focus on moving on you dont have a reminder in your life of what you lost or what could have been you wouldnt be constantly putting yourself through little moments of longing and sadness no contact is definitely meant for times like this because otherwise youre never going to be able to fully let the past be the past if it really isnt past yeah shes going to totally fuck up her relationship with her kid by tracking her losing trust when she inevitably breaks the rules and potentially ends up in legal issues or needing to call the police some damage cant be undone she shouldnt risk it because shes already playing with fire saying shell show up randomly at her daughters job especially because it sounds like this may be or turn into an abusive or otherwise toxic relationship not enabling it while preserving the relationship as much as possible is the smartest and most parental action to take you likely need to simply take the car away from her in its entirety dont track your 22 year old daughter simply say its really clear youre not okay with following these rules and i dont want my trust in you to be damaged when you break them so you need to find a new way to get to work from now on because youve both lost access to the car im sorry but im not letting this situation escalate further you can seriously damage your daughters trust in you by tracking her and im sure it wont feel nice to be confronted with how far your daughter is willing to lie to you over a guy she just met dont make things worse make sure she can trust in you as much as possible should anything happen with this guy just dont enable her to be taken advantage of but be her mom not a police warden would she was a 362434 55 and 118 lbs at 19 which would probably make her a size 24 on todays standards at least when she was a teen i would imagine she filled out a little bit as she grew and ended up maybe a 68 which is still a perfectly healthy and beautiful size you dont need a tourist visa for us or canada just a passport i would be very honest with her that you cant stop her from going through with it but if she does that you cant promise it wont lead to divorce it sounds like shes scared as id make the argument you two were actively trying for kids if you werent using any actual birth control and actively were discussing kids i dont see this changing in a few years she can make the choice but she should do so understanding that it will end the marriage it does you both a disservice to pretend to be more supportive than you are itll make her feel blinded and could potentially influence her into a decision you are all unhappy with in the end you can make your feelings known so she can make an informed decision wanting to murder someone is not normal just because youre 90 lbs and a teenager does not make anything youre saying okay get help i am not engaging in this anymore you need help he will break up with you and if you dont speak to a therapist youll end up in jail because it wont be anyone manipulating him itll be him realizing hes dating a deeply unwell person if hes joking why didnt he apologize nothing youre feeling right now is normal please speak to a professional or at least a trusted adult about how youre feeling and if youre wrong what if he breaks up with you what will you do to him i wouldnt entertain that mindset most relationships at 17 dont last forever theres a very real prospect of you not being with him your life should continue beyond that okay you definitely need some therapy because that attitude is deeply disturbing get some help youre only 17 so i get it but you wont be well if you keep entertaining such an exceptionally toxic mindset what will you do if he breaks up with you that doesnt work the way you think it does in the real world youll end up dead if you have that attitude wild that youd risk tax fraud for the same money either way he cant work in japan with the proper visa if he plays theres no way it doesnt catch the attention of japanese officials and eg gets in trouble sure if he needed to do a business meeting for an hour with 5 people he might be able to get away with it but not an international televised event it was more like we arent getting results worth the price we are paying so they dropped him cant really give a guy a demotion its either keep paying the salary or cut him and they clearly made the right call im sure if the org was totally flush with cash they wouldnt have made such a fast decision but multiple people in the org have also said the team wasnt doing well leading up to the decision either because they are all teenagers who fail to understand that an expenditure report isnt just reporting pure salaries its reporting the cost to the company which will be at least 50100 more than the employee salaries and could be 34x depending on other overhead costs involved i will also remind you that when running a company expenses tend to run 50100 of the salaries of your employees meaning you can likely half the expenditures if youre trying to figure out what portion of the total cost is on pure salaries the players see rather than the overhead involved in taxes benefits lawyers offices equipment etc the number seems wrong because youre assuming that 100 of the cost of a team is player salaries and it typically isnt not from the perspective of the company theyll factor in at a minimum the taxes benefits and other comp package costs and theyll also need to have some additional overhead to keep everything running that will be summed in these expenditure reports nta but youre going to need to tell them youre changing the password on x date before the change takes effect and theyll either need their own account or lose the service then as you dont want to run the risk of unknown numbers of households being charged to your account if anyone shares the password so no one but you will have it from now on if youre inclined to say anything and only if youre an active part of the conversations i would just respond with its not that we suck youre just really good at hitting some insane shots im good for a casual player but those are some shots even the pros struggle to hit consistently kill them with kindness reframe things as beginners luck and encourage them to keep it up more than them really sucking and you lying about your skills best advice is telling anyone involved not to give you any information about his life you can always give the gf a heads up and say you dont have any proof so you just want to give her a heads up so she is cautious about any other red flags and then keep doing what youve been doing the sad thing is good doesnt always prevail sometimes evil wins the best we can do is try to combat it and not feed into it if you have any articles or police reports or arrest records id probably anonymously send it to her and then let her make her own decisions my guess is she found it funny or acceptable before but youve essentially described yourself as an asshole people like being around shes 18 i assume shes growing up and realizing she really doesnt want to be the person that loves hanging out with assholes and thats why shes putting some distance ill give you a heads up there are definitely people out there that find what you are describing totally normal and acceptable behavior but as you get older especially in modern society the number of people who do find that acceptable will rapidly dwindle if i were you id keep that in mind im not saying to completely shift your personality overnight but youre only 18 if you can try to be the person who grows up with their peers and doesnt get stuck in the assholes are cool phase of life what are you on about not many employers would let you take off 3 days during busy season with a few weeks notice in the case of you being weak then i really would not default to violence like this as youre essentially running the risk of if that hair pin doesnt make them back down you have no further defensive options and youve just royally pissed someone off youre putting yourself in significantly more danger this way be safe i mean i think the sad reality is if you turn to violence any time a dude disrespects your boundaries youre going to find yourself in trouble or seriously hurt i would probably default to less violent means but taking selfdense classes and knowing how to properly defend yourself against a genuine attack rather than a standard creep is good i understand how unfair it is but the reality is women are going to be subjected to an onslaught of creepy guys who will push boundaries and touch you without consent like that violence is sending a very clear message you arent okay with it and where high school boys
