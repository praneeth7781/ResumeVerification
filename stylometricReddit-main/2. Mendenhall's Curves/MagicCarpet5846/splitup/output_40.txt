with do not change for him please you should always be who you feel most comfortable being but you also may need to come to terms with the fact that youve begun to walk different paths that no longer cross maybe dont focus too much on him wanting someone to control because that might not really be true more likely he thought had a sweet chubby introverted gamer girl he wasnt worried about losing and now youre independent making more money than him youve gotten hot and probably have more male attention from dudes who never wouldve looked at you before and lets be real youve become an entirely different person than you were when you met he likely feels like he cant compete with the sort of guys you can get now how hes handling it isnt cool and its controlling but its also probably coming from a place of fear and desperationpanic that hes about to lose you the sad thing is if the fact that you two are now completely different people wasnt going to ruin your relationship how hes acting now certainly will its a selffulfilling prophecy but also the reality is you grew up and he didnt and thats okay but you two dont seem to be compatible anymore honestly i thought it was him making fun of how everyone in the sub jumps to insane conclusions boy was i wrong if it makes you feel better it wasnt you who selfsabotaged your marriage its pretty clear that something was very wrong in your marriage long before you ever said that as a happily married and monogamous man doesnt voraciously message everyone he knows looking for a hookup the second his wife indicates she might be okay with it a respectful husband doesnt ignore his wife communicating she isnt okay with it there were issues in your marriage that perhaps you were aware of or more likely werent prepared to actually face but the marriage was over a long time before you ever brought up another woman forgive yourself but also recognize you cant keep pretending this marriage is functional it isnt now and it wasnt before end it and set yourself free if it makes you feel better it wasnt you who selfsabotaged your marriage its pretty clear that something was very wrong in your marriage long before you ever said that as a happily married and monogamous man doesnt voraciously message everyone he knows looking for a hookup the second his wife indicates she might be okay with it a respectful husband doesnt ignore his wife communicating she isnt okay with it there were issues in your marriage that perhaps you were aware of or more likely werent prepared to actually face but the marriage was over a long time before you ever brought up another woman lmao of course were not 100 accurate but you said it yourself he was jerking you around why do you suddenly think thats going to change ive read your other comments youre either looking for a fight because youre upset this dude is ghosting or youre a troll because you havent responded to a single comment genuinely looking for an objective viewpoint youre just trying to argue which just makes me think if youre actually a real person really going through this dude has probably realized 10 year younger tang isnt worth crazy if youre a real person just recognize how batshit you must come off in real life if after 4 comments on the internet pretty much any man on here would be running from you good luck i do hope youre a troll because otherwise youre in for a very sad life if you dont grow up and fast yeah you dont respect yourself why wouldnt he beg you to move in you demand nothing of him let him do whatever he wants never ask for more and here you are left alone at home while he goes and hangs out with the family who degrades you that he apparently doesnt even care enough about you to talk about you in front of them and you still want to plan elaborate and thoughtful birthday celebrations and get him a cake it makes total sense why a person like him would drool over finding a woman who cant even demand she be a part of his birthday celebration you think he would actually want a woman who calls him out on his shit of course not be honest with yourself how much more do you let him get away with elaborate what you mean and what you got mad about overall he may not have been ignoring you then but you also probably never said im done either so it may be a bit different this time he read it because leaving someone on read sends a pretty clear message of i saw what you said i want you to know that i saw what you said and i want you to know that i am intentionally choosing not to reply to you in short he isnt interested why did you get mad at him perhaps you were right and this guy isnt right for you so all in all its probably a win for you both im the future just be a bit more careful when you tell someone youre done if you arent prepared to mean it its probably not a great idea to say it rarely do people play well into that sort of hot and cold maybe youve learned some valuable lessons dont start things with roommates and if this is a trend maybe youre moving too fast in your relationships and progressing too intensely with the wrong sort of guy youll heal but itll take time dont worry about breaking down youre human and thats a beautiful thing you arent meant to be a robot well just remember there is no waiting it out nothing will ever change until you do if youd realized this 45 years ago you couldve been married and successful by now but dont fret the second best time to make a change is now and thankfully you still have time for that stop being complacent in your own life you have a choice here dont forget you do have power in your own life you arent helpless but remember that is a choice you are actively making you can just as easily and quickly stop being a doormat as much as you dont want to say anything because youre scared and itll hurt or whatever other bullshit you keep telling yourself if you really asked yourself are you not already alone in your own marriage are you not causing yourself pain every day knowing your wife wants another mans affection wondering ifwhen shell cheat on you too people often overlook the chronic pain they invite upon themselves because they think an acute pain will be worse but trust me it isnt id rather have a broken arm that will heal than deal with lupus every day until i die good youve spent the past decade gaslighting yourself into ignoring or brushing off hundreds of red flags second guess everything and see your life and your marriage for what it really is not what you want it to be that way you can start to see just how much better you deserve and how much better you can get stop allowing yourself to be the backup i mean really the only think you can be sure of is youre being a doormat and of course your wife isnt going to respect you you dont even respect yourself youre worth more than this man you have to know that how can you lose something you never actually had she never actually picked you she just did enough to fool you into thinking she had i dont even see my actual friends from college as much as you seem to have this guy in your lives thats a bit weird dont you think heres to hoping he just doesnt care as much as some do care the vast majority really dont enjoy your newfound freedom well because its decently obvious by the lets just figure things out as housemates rather than as a couple that he sees it as a relationshipbreaker because shes basically said as much how else would you take that comment that is not what the joke implies not even close im going to be honest everyone in this story is a few years too old to be making such shitty decisions esh because at the end of the day who youre friends with also reflects on you and its pretty abysmal that even after all this you werent the one to pull the plug here on the friendship she was having fun and partying is great and all but its practically asking for some dark shit to befall one of you by inviting multiple complete strangers into your hotel room in the middle of the night from the sidewalk in manhattan during a huge holiday if this is commonplace for you or your friends and based on your tone it appears to be you need to really selfreflect and see if this is where you think you should be at 25 years old no i just dont feel the need to engage with victim blamers lmao so if you think the wife is abusive its cool to just blame the victim the father of her abuse got it yeah bye now id probably only ever see yelling as appropriate if someone is in actual danger or about to do something really destructive and you need to get their attention now i can also see people yelling at one another if extremely angryfed up about a lot of issues in their relationship that theyre just at the end of their rope for but in that example id probably say that either the person yelling has issues themselves or the person yelling is only doing so because they dont love themselves enough to walk away and instead think yelling will get through to an otherwise toxic partner ill go out on a limb and say your partner has anger issues though but regardless of if you or he is the problem and its him it isnt you this isnt a healthy relationship fiance thankfully she wont need to worry about a divorce all she needs to do is separate finances and figure things out like housemates instead of a couple which conveniently is exactly what shes doing and im sure we can all guess exactly why i think the point is unless you think he should be abusive he ultimately isnt in a position to allow his wife to do anything his wife is going to do what his wife is going to do shes her own person just like op is his own person and he cant force him to return home or forgive his sister see the issue youre acting as though the father can just snap his fingers and force everyone to fall in line to his will but thats not how people work his wife and the other kids are all independent people capable of their own decisions and actions theyll act as they see fit and its up to the people around them to react how they see fit the only very loose way to not allow his wife to treat op that way would be by saying if she keeps it up hes divorcing her and now were back to the beginning sentiment its unfair and unrealistic to expect this man to throw away his marriage and his relationship with his two other kids who actually live close to him to support ops beliefs who not only isnt cutting off his father but also lives across the country anyway idk if i were you id probably just say i know
