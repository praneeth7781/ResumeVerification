or even hugging each other no back massages or showers together or any form of intimacy she isnt willing to go to therapy with him and has made it clear she expects this to be permanent she has made her choice and its a choice anyone would respect but just because you respect someones choice doesnt mean you need to accept it her choice affects him as well and hes allowed to decide that thats not the life he signed up for stop acting as those refusing all forms of intimacy and affection and being unwilling to work on or compromise about it is just about sex i mean does she need to be worried about it because its a choice to remove all intimacy and romance from a marriage and thats a choice that was made separate from the lack of libido if you remove everything that makes a marriage unique from a friendshiproommate its unreasonable to expect someone to want to continue being in that marriage if ops wife wants op to stick around in a marriage with no intimacy at all thats very different from libido issues and a lack of piv i think you should just say this at this point it isnt about the cake its about you 1 saying you would do something repeatedly and then not following through 2 you not being able to handle being called out on not staying true to your word and 3 the fact that you can see clearly now that it is that important and youve shown no remorse or sense of accountability and havent even apologized or tried to make it up to me this isnt the kind of person i want to be with im glad i found this out only 10 months in at least because really this isnt the kind of person you want to be with while thats fair enough they definitely do upgrade only one person on the same reservation when its free upgrades had it happen a number of times to me theres a substantial difference between giving someone on your locator number an upgrade and a stranger though i get it but yeah relationships that go through so many bumps honestly arent stronger yes you need to be able to work through issues but relationships that constantly have bumps are just rocky and eventually someone is going to decide they dont want to deal with the rockiness forever i think a lot of people in rocky and unstable relationships think theyre stronger because well weve always worked though things before but i think most people outside of the relationship can see the opposite is really true because people just dont want to constantly be trying to work things out with someone as nauseam forever if youre constantly fighting with someone even small spats but especially bigger spats that almost always means that relationship isnt right at least not without something major changing i think the sad thing is people like that actually are often really loyal to the person they actually want and end up getting left by those people leading to them being in general super disrespectful of others time honestly i wouldnt even say that i would just say i realized i dont see this being a long term thing and dont want either of our time to be wasted so its best we part ways now rather than later why would you admit to knowing some pretty messed up info just say you dont feel it anymore and make her think its because of her not because of op not being enough for her nta just sit your parents down and say i am feeling like i dont matter as much to you as ana is this true let them answer once they do say every year you treat me like a second class citizen giving me a 10 minute meal i dont even really love to celebrate and giving everyone else the ability to choose whatever they want on their birthday i am willing to compromise and give ana our actual birthday but do you really think thats fair because im only 16 and i realize how blatantly unfair that is can we please as a family sit down and can you please listen to me expressing myself and come to a compromise listen for their answer if their answer isnt yes of course just say this i love you which is why im being really honest with this if you guys arent able to recognize the blatant favoritism and disrespect thats going on dont be surprised if in a few years our relationship looks very different if you guys arent willing to show all of your children the same love in the same ways thats going to really damage our relationship and im not saying this as a bratty teenager im saying this as your hurt daughter who doesnt want to believe that her parents would be so calloused to not realize that a 16 year old still needs the same love and joy around her birthday even if she has a younger sister i didnt stop existing when ana was born just be mature about it dont yell or throw a tantrum and remember youll be 18 in a few years and can decide how much this truly affects the relationship with your parents then i dont think one month is the standard either i know this is hard to hear but i dont think this is as quick a switch up as youre making it out to be sounds like there were a lot of issues throughout your relationship and a lot of incompatibilities thats not really a sudden problem its a bit misleading and naive to tell yourself this is sudden because even in your post i can tell this was a long time coming as a stranger and i didnt live this relationship you may benefit from being honest about the past 4 years to learn the signs of a doomed relationship because i bet upon reflection they will be there tbh its very possible they got notice and disregarded itmissed it i know i dont read a lot of mail that looks like junk i mean just remember people really do find out about their cheating spouse this way i think it really depends on where you are and how diligent you are a lot of times i think people are unfamiliar with how to find people to call which results in everyone calling the top few results and leading to insane wait times and inevitably people give up after a number of we have an appointment x months away but ive never had an issue getting an appointment when i needed one it was only ever a question of how many doctors would i need to call to get one im sure everyones experience is different though but there are definitely more resources available than a lot of people realize unfortunately so you arent saying she needs to include sil but the issue is you also arent saying she doesnt need to include her and frankly i do not want my wife to include someone who so deliberately excluded her from their own wedding inaction is action here you think just because you arent saying to include her youre in the clear but you arent you need to tell your family she doesnt and shouldnt include her understand the difference ok and to be fair you know your fiance did feel excluded you couldve spoken about it to the brother you are very very close to but you didnt so yes it is your not our your bad for for communicating this at the time two years ago and now lisa will learn actions have consequences even if those actions are somewhat reasonable just explain to anyone who asks if you didnt feel comfortable having my wife in your wedding party you cant expect her to feel comfortable having you in hers just like we respected your decision to choose who to include in your wedding party and your wedding photos you need to respect our decision this isnt up for discussion anymore i am not going to allow my wife to feel uncomfortable about anything surrounding the happiest day of our lives are we clear time to be a big boy and stand up for your wife and your marriage if you dont this is the sort of pattern that rots a marriage inside out take notes its the current standard of care for fractious cats in vet med easier said than done really shouldnt apply to doing your job properly not only that but its pretty simple to have the vet just place the towel over the cats body that the tech can then secure with the bits of his armtorso that are available sure if there was one person doing this you might have a point but not with two sets of hands available there are definitely way better restraint methods that are meant to be used for fractious cats like this for example placing a towel over the cats face which will help to calm the cat and also prevent the cat from reading back to bite like that you mean building a successful team doesnt happen overnight they actually gasp need time to bring everything together and dominate im shocked s heads up if youre actually a doctor you need to be smart enough to tell the difference your wife has a genuine problem with the frequency and amount of your drinking if youre unwillingunable to have a serious conversation about your alcohol consumption while youre both sober you probably arent making it to too many more anniversary celebrations shes getting fed up this isnt her humor this is her genuine annoyance and frustration you would be an utter fool not to see this for what it is and address your pretty clear problem men your age are not getting wasted every friday unless theyre alcoholics i mean definitely depends it wouldnt surprise me if op is an alcoholic i had another beer because thats just what i do on a friday night despite being visibly drunk already sounds like binge drinking and it sounds like something his wife isnt okay with and probably even had a conversation with him about please dont embarrass me at our anniversary or whatever wording it was asking him not to get so drunk and shes annoyed as shes been putting up with it for so long can confirm from experience anyone who says it wont affect things and says itll still be a friendship trip is lying the only reason it wont affect ops trip is because the friend and her boyfriend will never be around which in and of itself completely ruins the point of the trip unless op wanted to be alone the whole time very much not worth and ruined the friendship i will add yeah this is a reminder that unless you get some mega asshole people arent going to be commenting on this sort of thing its all about if youre comfortable enough to have that part of your body be seen ignore her if you really want a clear message sent block her account if ever you need to say anything just say i have no interest in being friends with someone like you i have way more respect for myself than to keep someone in my life who would purposefully flirt with my boyfriend in front of me just to prove a point that says a lot and everything that it says is appalling stop contacting me yes but they also pretty commonly get it when they themselves arent clean enough and bacteria from their butt gets into too close contact with their vagina during sex any uti you get using a condom is likely due to your own
