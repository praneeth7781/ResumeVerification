of toxic ones definitely do not make this right though she either needs to come to her senses which i suspect she will at some point especially if you dont chase after her or she wont in which case you can decide if thats really the sort of trait you want in a partner good luck you did nothing wrong though btw never lend money you arent willing to lose nah 24 is definitely an age where its fair to expect a person be mature and responsibly by shes been out of college for 23 years at this point she isnt a freshman in college thats definitely not normal behavior even for a 24 year old that isnt really true plenty of people are willing to bail their partners out now are they obligated to no but dont imply that asking your partner for any financial help automatically is unhealthy yeah and a reminder of your friends should understand if you cant contribute 1k dinners youre an awesome person and a true friend will be happy to have your company and whatever it is you can contribute thats in your budget i had a lot of friends way wealthier than me at that age there was never an expectation i had to keep up well dresses makeup the bachelorette party spa day theres lots of things you could contribute that would be around that much tbf if you have a pattern of ending up with immature women its possible that regardless of the age youre being attracted by traits that go hand in hand with this sort of immaturity i am pretty sure a lot of 24 year olds are significantly more mature than this especially ones who have educationsjobs and friends are getting married why would he offer to pay for a night out he wasnt even at i get we freak at age gaps but 24 and 32 are both adults that are at approximately the same life stage this isnt about age as much about 1 dont lend money youre not willing to lose and 2 always check your bank account so i want to address both sides of this the first is your friend lied to you and thats definitely problematic i dont really think testing people is ever a great tactic that said hes a friend not a lover and you dont necessarily need to be able to have the same level of trust in a friend as you would your wife so if you decide to keep being friends with him after this simply make sure you do so with caution and a modicum of distance put between you two on anything of importance i understand that may be controversial but 1 its difficult to make friends once youre older and have a family and 2 if all of us are honest we have or at least have had plenty of friends that were good to go to lunch or a concert with but you would never call if you needed a place to stay or something huge now onto his side of things hes a 29 year old male yes there are some dudes who will be fine going on a stroller walk but the reality is most guys arent hell id probably guess most dudes with kids wouldnt even want to do that as a hang out theyre going to want to have fun go to a bar watch a game play pool or whatever that activity is im not saying its going to involve drugs or blacking out but you probably also need to understand that in order to maintain friendships you need to retain your identity as okstill179 first and loving father second a lot of women also struggle with this balance so dont be alarmed or feel weird about it make sure youre taking time to go and just be you with your friends and make sure youre not making you and your infant a package deal most single 20s guys just arent going to want a kid involved and i definitely empathize it may mean its a few months till you and your wife find that balance so just ask for some patience but remember that the balance is important to find especially if realistically you want to be able to maintain friendships she said she sold it at a profit but so its an investment are you telling me you should sell your stocks at what you paid for it even if theyre worth double thats just stupid that is what happens when youre the waitress at a table you come back multiple times ok if thats what you mean then i understand that thats fair to expect once ownership has changed hands youre aware that you only deem op an ah because you want the brother to be able to continue to take advantage right because an eviction wouldve been inevitable unless you think he shouldve been allowed to take advantage as nauseam and at that point the difference between op serving him with an eviction and the new owner is its way harder to pressure a stranger than family so why do you really think the eviction is an ah move genuinely asking btw because i get what people are saying but i dont think they realize what that really would mean fair enough but no and i think a lot of people are really not understanding its extremely common that rented apartments dont have top of the line run your shower max temp for hours at a time water heaters that would be required for 56 people to get hot showers i mean hell my old apartment i alone couldnt take a shower longer than 15 minutes without getting cold water thats just usually how it is when you rent you dont get unlimited hot water you have to plan your showers you deal with it a quick common sense search also tells you 3 is a lot less than 612 its very obvious you think renting a home is the same as owning and it simply is not when you finally do own a home maybe youll understand until then dont comment on what you clearly dont understand thats simply not true if that were actually true developers builders property managers etc would never go bankrupt but they 100 do that would mean these people never get sued never had to evict anyone never have any damages ot gone a month without rent theres absolutely a risk just because someone is typically smart enough not to overextend themselves to the point where they cant float the additional costs does not mean there is no risk it just shows your ignorance on the costs involved in running a business and owning a home to think there isnt if there was no risk everyone would be a landlord but they arent why because theres risk
