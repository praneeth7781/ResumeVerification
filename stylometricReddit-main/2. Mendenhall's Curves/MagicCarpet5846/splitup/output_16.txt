like having as many kids as they want is a right and it simply is not eh i think its pretty callous to suggest theyre only having kids because they want to fuck over op they probably do want these kids plenty of people always dreamed of a large family and i understand it can be frustrating to have a great job and still struggle to afford the basics but thats their reality and many others reality they need to make the decision to have kids based on their current situation and also based on if they can afford it should anything change just like op should probably have a full time job because if her ex lost his job tomorrow shed either no longer get child support or get a significantly reduced amount if her current income isnt enough to at least mostly pay for expenses thats probably not ideal everyone needs to live within their means not the means of others idk if this is true everywhere or even anywhere but i thought that child custodychild support court cases are typically where possible handled by the same judge because it prevents finding a judge to rule how you want and also because it ensures someone at least somewhat familiar with the details of youyour case will be able to make more consistent ruling as life situations change and if it happens that op doesnt have enough income for her expenses shell need to figure it out but theres a good chance child support wont end until 21 idk i would tell my boyfriend about being groomed and her husband everything shes ever done and not told him and id add blackmailing her own sister on to that list yeah if everyone is just going to make up a narrative under the assumption the op must not be telling the truth then theres no point to this sub anyway just make a judgement based on the actual information given even if you personally dont think thats all the info oooor they really do just hate jim because they see it as a replacement for their father i mean to some extent we need to take op at face value shes the only person who was actually there if theres missing information then obviously any advice here wouldnt work regardless if the kids are happy with their dad thats all that matters but i will challenge you that depending on the circumstance cheating on a parent absolutely can impact your ability to be a good fathermother my parents both know very clearly that if either cheated on the other even if its the parent i dont really like getting cheated on i will not forgive the offender and they would be dead to me and im definitely not a rare case but what your wife is doing is not the way if the kids are happy to be with their dad thats all that matters cheating doesnt have to impact your ability to be a good parent but i just want to point out it 100 can yeah its extremely hard to say they very well may have had that conversation so i dont want to absolve this man of accountability buuuuut ive seen a number of men and women post on here about issues that arise because they assume theyre in an official relationship when the other person doesnt agree i can easily see this being a similar situation where he expected it to be maybe a week or so and now a few months in hes decided hes just not feeling it anymore and theres no real commitment so hes just letting it fade out i mean he did break up with you tell him he can pick either you broke up with me and i didnt cheat on you so drop it or you didnt break up with me in which case i am breaking up with you now because i sure as hell am not staying with someone who thinks its at all acceptable to ghost their girlfriend for 3 months which is it because im not doing this bullshit i didnt cheat on you and if you think i really did cheat on you then this relationship is done and make him pick once he picks dont let him unpick and frankly i would leave anyway because this asshat actually thinks its okay to ghost someone for 3 months with no consequences fuck that i would brea up with someone who didnt answer for 48 hours and i have im not exaggerating here with no warning or explanation let alone 3 months honestly the selfish bit is just not communicating about it though i honestly suspect theres a chance they arent actually bfgf and this is another case of assuming what they are rather than having the explicit conversation if so he isnt even really a jerk for just slow fading and losing interest if im wrong and they did explicitly say we are boyfriendgirlfriend and in a committed relationship then he is selfish for failing to communicate the relationship no longer working for him but outside of that its no surprise he doesnt want to invest a ton of time getting to know someone who he cant even really get to know seeing as they really dont get to see each other much yeah or could have just said i didnt have patience back then to put up with teaching and didnt want to give you a bad learning experience it was because i wasnt a good teacher to you not because you were a bad student i dont think you can fix this she doesnt love you anymore and she doesnt seem to be attracted to you either you cant make someone love you and you cant make someone want to work on things it sounds like she ended up with you because you saved her and then once she was finally back on her feet the love wasnt there enough to survive all the misfortune in your post your post has an almost unbelievable series of bad events in it if this really did all happen in the past two years its honestly no surprise she no longer loves you losing your money your jobs depression leaving her alone in a pregnancy being so unwilling to help clean your house developed a fungal infection and even more acts of bad luck would probably kill most marriages that young i get it hurts but youre both 24 you were married for only a year before she decided she wanted a divorce it sounds like she recognizes shes still young and would be happier in a different relationship and frankly i agree with her you would both be better off divorcing and you working on yourself and focusing on being the best father you can be and then making sure youre in a place where you can handle a relationship again good luck but you need to start mourning the relationship and give your wife a divorce if thats what she wants i would tell her if you want a divorce you need to be the one to take steps and file because i want to work this out but i also recognize i cant make you stay its definitely normal when a man 10 years older than you and richer than you is trying to take you on luxury vacations 4 months in yes theres a saying be with a man for money you earn every cent im not saying you were with him for money but i am trying to illustrate that men who provide their partners with lots of moneyfinancial supportluxury experiences do often expect exactly what your boyfriend did they think money should be enough to earn them an obedient and supportive gf now i firmly disagree and its clear you two arent compatible with one another both of you should be glad you found out early but beware in your next relationship that older rich men typically arent paying for their younger girlfriend to go on crazy vacations right after meeting out of the goodness of their heart sometimes they do this isnt an all men statement but it is something that happens and if you dont want it to happen id stick to men closer in age to you and be more firm about equal contributions financially in the relationship so there isnt anything to try to use as leverage against you you can love and be a good parent to your son without being this much of a doormat to your wife divorce her and go for split custody dating at 30 isnt much different than dating in your 20s however dating at 40 50 and so on after that long with one person is definitely not ideal so use that info to stand strong in ending things now and moving on end it move out if you live together and just block her if she tries to convince you shes just asking for permission to cheat and that is ridiculous she thinks she can brow beat you into agreeing to that i mean its been two weeks and youre 20 he honestly owes you nothing now do i believe he really forgot no not really dude isnt worth your time based on that alone but in a straight up hook up situation i dont really see it as reasonable to expect them to read your mind you clearly wanted him to come with you but that isnt what you said and you are expecting him to care about your wellbeing and honestly handle a potential pregnancy with more care than most peoples actual committed boyfriends would if you dont like this reality dont have unprotected sex with guys you arent in a relationship with otherwise its not really fair to be upset that they arent handling things the way you think they should it sucks for sure and this guy isnt anyone id want to have sex with but i dont see where this is anything out of the normal for a 20 year old male hooking up with someone for a couple of weeks i mean id love to be a billionaire too that doesnt mean its going to happen if you dont trust someone drunk or sober they probably arent someone you shouldnt date warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info it is weird and creepy just keep to im not interested in younger men romantically you know how all the waaay older men with young women say shes the one who heavily perused me ok but you also agreed so it is weird and creepy just keep to im not interested in younger men romantically i will mention this could very easily be a rule put in place to explicitly exclude your kids without outright saying it just be prepared in that case to graciously now out from attending and say you wont be able to make it dont turn things into a fight theres likely a reason they are making the wedding difficult to attend and its likely so they can have excuses not to include those they dont really want to be there i wouldnt bring it up the conversation isnt going to make you feel better you know how he really feels about you hes either going to lie to your face and beg for forgiveness or even worse he isnt going to deny any of it and will confirm this is how he really feels about you regardless of what he says youre going to feel like shit instead leave with your head held high instead bright side you dont live together and havent merged lives i get its scary to start over but its better to move on at 31 and find
