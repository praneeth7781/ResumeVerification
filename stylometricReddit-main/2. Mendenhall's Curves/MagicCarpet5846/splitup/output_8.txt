in love with someone and have to break up they know if theres a fundamental incompatibility its just not worth pursuing the relationship further because you can be on the same page in everything and a relationship still fail why pursue one where its break is inevitable uhm yes lol it is the pandemic completely changed the game for salaries in fields with burnout and high demand dentists average starting is 123k with source doctors sources vary pretty widely depending on specialty but average entry level doctor salary is 211k with source vets 107k average starting salary with source and this is average starting meaning a lot of people make substantially more than this right out of the gate i know a number of people who were graduating this year and had 150k offers with starting bonuses just because they were well educated and theres such a high demand right now and not enough supply i dont really know why its so surprising to see why a specialized field in medicine would start out low six figures even nurses right now are making 100k starting in certain areas location matters your education matters the experience you gained in school matters heck even your connections matter but its definitely not a crazy idea to me at all that someone out there could be a doctor and have a nice ass house before theyre 30 girl come now dont be so dense hes 8 years older than you and already trying to isolate you he wants you to move in with him and is displaying an issue with your job he wants you to be financially reliant on him to survive and if you are then you cant go back to school to finish your degree hes doing his best to make you his good little housewife and youre playing right into it youre going through something serious and something scary you are looking for support and youre not getting it you and your boyfriend are both so young that its no surprise he isnt equipped to handle this well but neither of you are handling the stress too well you shouldnt need to make up anything as you did nothing wrong ultimately even though it hurts you need to accept that he is entitled to feel how he feels and if hes unable to be understanding and supportive of his sick and scared girlfriend he isnt the right one for you i mean no lol they are definitely also doctors and its also the internet its not super uncommon for people to be intentionally vague about personal details but anyway like i said its definitely an unusual path but totally possible to be a doctor in your mid 20s and have a really nice house i was the one who added the med school the other person just said a doctor you can become a doctor a number of ways without going to med school so i reiterate you can definitely be a doctor in your mid 20s and have a really nice house maybe uncommon definitely doable though its not even an okay marriage and youre thinking of staying man you do you but youre only 30 if just okay is your standard you can find just okay with someone who isnt going to cheat on you not residency thats totally true but could be a vet or a dentist which makes 6 figures right out of school and are still doctors no hes over it at this point and moved on to someone else most likely trying to fix things is going to make you seem creepy and desperate at this point just let it go youve learned something about dating and about yourself and take that with you for future experiences i agree here but she also shouldnt have sex with him if shed feel used if it was just sex because its very possible thats how it ends too and she shouldnt have sex if it will harm her mental health just to potentially keep someone around either am i the only one who thinks its at least a little bit wrong to effectively try to manipulate someone into a relationship by using sex as a bargaining chip im not saying its wrong to wait to have sex at all but based on the post it very much feels like she was only waiting because she was playing a game true could easily be a dentist or vet which are doctors no residency required and both have six figure starting salaries like i said definitely possible even if not the path most take as for student loans i know when i was in school more people than you would think graduated without substantial student loans either trough scholarships help from parents or working through school but that also was very heavily influenced by my going to a top school where most of my class was well off im just a proponent of even if something isnt possible for you doesnt mean it isnt possible for anyone lol question why were you on your laptop and taking calls when hosting a number of friends in your home you hadnt seen in a bit that seems to break a lot of hosting etiquette rules and while im not calling you an ah for it does seem like if you werent on your laptop or taking calls in the first place this wouldnt have happened fam youre clearly way too young to be on the internet if you think the employees would ever call the cops and in the event they did that the cops would do anything more than generally gesture to take a look into it and never follow up i mean its not actually as wild as you think you graduate from school at around 2425 if you go straight through and your starting salary can easily be 175k with the demand right now with large starting bonuses and even more if you go into criticalemergency care you could feasibly be 2526 and with that level of income afford a 500k600k house which in the right area could absolutely be a mansion or pretty close and yes i am talking about in todays day and age not 25 years ago definitely not the path most take but if you prioritize buying a home over renting i know plenty of mid 20s who own homes and they dont have nearly the income a new doctor today would have eta true med school requires residency but dentists and vets dont require residency and are making 100175k right out of school so like i said comment still stands just because something is uncommon doesnt mean its entirely impossible did we get an age on the friend he could be older and away at college and in an apartment rentedowned by family oop being 18 doesnt necessarily mean all of his friends are his age and i knew plenty of people who lived in apartmentshouses their family owned while away at school thats why it was so crazy everyone was blaming oop for simply saying to leave her out of this one i mean hes a parent to two children and it should be on him to manage his own relationship with his daughter rather than relying on the stepmom to always be the manager i feel like its super common for people to give the advice stop fixing things for xyz otherwise theyll never learn how to deal with it on their own yet here when oop simply comes to the conclusion of i wont be fixing things this time he needs to learn shes in the wrong just interesting how differently people can perceive the exact same behavior based on if it was advice they gave or just naturally how a person decides to handle a situation there was no easy answer here but i get oop wanting to be able to not always be the decision maker did she delete some posts because the ones i see now while clearly paint her as deeply unhappy in the relationship shows shes more of the problem than him or at least theyre equally the problem hahaha you mean like a teenager would be upset hes told he needs to finish his chores before he goes out with his friends theyre definitely not that much anymore unless youre trying to find something expensive i went to a show a few months ago and it was 200 for the most expensive seats there were and plenty of options in the 50 range if you want to do a broadway show it doesnt need to be break the bank expensive op is an electrical engineer engineers are pretty unanimously across the us excluded from overtime pay as it is a professional and has the advanced degree exemption i mean he clearly picked her when he yelled at you for your behavior so i wouldnt test this any further if i were you and would just apologize and offer to step down from the wedding party or wear whatever dress they pick whatever they prefer otherwise kiss your friendship with mark goodbye you should try to repair the relationship but also be aware some of them may not want an enabler in their lives anymore warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info i mean her behavior in this story alone should be enough to tell you its entirely possible she cut them all off for not doing exactly as she said id just send one message saying if you truly feel badly about what you did let me move on and stop contacting me i have no ill will towards you anymore but i also have no desire to have you in my life in any capacity oh no it gets worse later it can start very young though if op says he doesnt love her thats totally fair but a month is plenty of time for love for plenty of people she definitely needs some help but she doesnt appear to be looking for a victimsupply she sounds like any other insecure 22 year old who doesnt know how to self regulate their emotions and is hoping a guy will do it for her try not to have the darkest outlook possible on peoples intentions when there is a way more common and way more likely answer in that shes just emotionally immature and struggling with her own demons you should be encouraging her to get some therapy because you dont like hearing someone you love say such things well this was a new partner and you frankly arent entitled to know about a deeply personal letter like that you said this happened in the beginning of your relationship hes 7 good chance hes using sky because it pisses his mom off tell her to lay off and take away the appeal of sky being the rebellious name and then maybe hell change his mind in time or he wont but telling a little boy they cant do something only ever makes them want to do it more how long was that stick correct but this is an established thing tm in the horse world you dont sound like youre a big horse person horse people flock to horse people and can be as cliquey as high school mean girls its no surprise the two of them would gravitate to one another when they share such a massive hobby and love of horses it also sounds like youre projecting your feelings of loneliness onto the man instead talk to your wife tell her you miss one on one time and ask to carve out some time for a date night and her horse back riding communication is key and a marriage takes work on both parties if
