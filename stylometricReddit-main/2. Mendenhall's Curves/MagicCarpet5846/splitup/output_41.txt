why you beat up thank you but please dont do it again i dont want assholes like that to ever take anything else from me again and then just give him a big hug hey i agree fully im just saying when it comes to the father i understand why he isnt taking such a hard and fast approach now i think cheaters and wrong and i think the mom isnt handling things well at all but those two things are a bit unrelated his mom told him that not his father i agree the mom sucks for how shes acting im just saying it makes sense that the dude isnt going to ruin his marriage and relationship with all his other kids when 1 op isnt cutting him off and 2 op is across the country everyone else is right there real life is more complicated than reddit acts you should be able to get someone to do it for 5001k at most where do you see the dad putting himself in the middle by doing anything other than existing again this is his daughter its ridiculous to expect him to throw away his marriage and his relationship with all of his other kids because you think that its not completely normal for parents to be way more forgiving than you would be to their own childs mistakes i repeat the world is not as black and white as you seem to think it is and we do not have all the information here to know any of the details of why everyone feels how they feel on this matter she insinuated she does want kids so not sure why either of those should factor in if she wants kids its better to be with someone with a child than someone with undiagnosed and seemingly severe mental illness eh i dont really think its fair to expect people to entirely blow up their marriage and their relationship with the rest of their kids to support the beliefs of someone else yeah i think cheaters suck but thats also his daughter it makes sense that even when your kid messes up you arent going to immediately exile them the world isnt as black and white as reddit acts like it is it really isnt ive found partners at many ages you probably just arent looking in an effective place instead of relying on apps join classes or workout groups with interests you have so you meet someone naturally i mean its not actually that hard youre just being defeatist because it scares you to be alone for a year or so but thats perfectly normal be you 25 35 or 45 it takes time to find a good partner honestly the mom of whoever called overstepped id get it if a day had passed but thats really overkill for an adult woman a few hours with no contact just be prepared for your dad to turn the invite down hes right youre putting him in a nowin situation and more likely than not hes going to avoid pissing off his wife and kids that live close to him youre far away its way less hassle to turn you down than pick a fight with everyone near by i just want to prepare you for the most likely outcome you should probably speak to a lawyer familiar with this you should start by getting a survey of your land so you know exactly what is yours and what isnt get up property line markers it shouldnt cost more than 1k for the surveyor and marking everything out with physical markers youre going to need a lawyer to know how to best indicate anyone past this point is officially trespassing because like everyone said youre taking on a huge liability and also putting yourself in a position where your land could be seized by the local government as youve allowed public access i know youre very pregnant but this needs to take priority because the last thing you want is to be recovering from birth and trying to figure out how to be a mom and then youre getting sued because someone on an atv died hitting a low hanging branch and the parents blame you for not trimming the trees or a million other examples that have actually happened and the property owners were held liable for your husband can hopefully take on some of the burden of sorting this as it will likely be a good amount of logistical sorting but itll be cheaper in the long run especially if this is meant to be your forever home put up signs at the entry points for now take photos and get a lawyer asap im just going to pop in here to remind everyone that a person with ppp has an approximately 45 chance of either committing infanticide or suicide yes there is an elevated risk and yes these women absolutely need professional help do not treat women with this condition as ticking time bombs though you were in a previously abusive relationship so you think as long as he isnt abusive hes great but thats not true you may need some therapy to reset what you should want in a man because this isnt it not abusive isnt even the bare minimum of being a half decent guy and it seems like thats really all you have as your standard right now understandable but love yourself more than that aim higher stop going for dudes with no ambition hey women can have big feet too because if youre in an accident where enough forcefriction is generated to pull off your shoes its just statistically more likely that that same force was lethal if you dont leave just tell him you need to be more careful if this happens again im breaking up with you immediately i do not give a shit if its an accident or not if youre so incapable of controlling your dckk you cant keep it from sodomizing me i have 0 interest continuing our relationship am i crystal clear and if it happens again then you leave all that matters is it makes you feel good i dont think dresses like this look good on anyone personally its too shapeless and is reminiscent of a trash bag to me but fashion should always be more about how you feel than what others think imo youre never an ah for fighting for your kids never the sooner you learn that the better a father youll be just for some actual facts as worms arent something parents tend to discuss at daycare 2030 of preschoolprimary school aged children will have a threadworm infection so definitely common enough that it isnt a surefire sign of neglect but not so common that the parents shouldnt be taking steps to prevent because its not him forbidding her access to basic hygiene its just nature of being a parent to a newborn youd have to make the argument an infant is the abusive one as thats who is technically preventing the sil from showering regularly which is entirely ridiculous as a concept until you actually have a kid you clearly are ignorant to the fact that even two present and active parents will often not have time to shower for 2 days it isnt the husband directly saying i forbid you from showering which yeah is abusive its i have a newborn and my husband isnt being a present dad and i dont want to leave my kid alone or take him in the shower with me theyre fundamentally different im not going to argue with someone who has clearly never had a newborn or had the lowest maintenance newborn ever to know that its just plain normal and expected that when you have a newborn you just plain arent going to shower every day hell i dont have a newborn and im so busy with normal adulting tasks that i have often gone 2 days without a shower no one is abusing me its just ridiculous to conflate i dont have time to do x with someone is forcing me not to do x so yeah even by your definition this is not abuse i am not going to argue about this further because its clear you dont understand how common it is to be too busy to shower every day when you have a newborn its not a sign of abuse its just a sign of being a parent you probably need to stop considering him your husband he said pretty clearly he no longer views you as a wife youre just the woman who gave birth to his kid you need to understand you have absolutely no leverage here and your husband hasnt divorced you yet simply because it would put his daughter through more trauma than she needs right now but you arent an equal partner youre on probation and if you dont start acting like it dont be surprised if he realizes youre trying to traumatize your daughter more by forcing her to be a puppet than he will traumatize her by putting her through a messy custody battle op nicely but understand what your husband is really saying hes saying this if you ever want to see your daughter youre going to do everything exactly on my terms otherwise i will go through a court battle to completely strip you of the right to see your daughter i dont want to but if you force me to i will know youre place and right now your place is egg donor not mother you need to earn the right to call yourself her mom sure but none of that is abuse thats just not meeting your needs as a partner that isnt abuse again thats being a bad partner the two are very different and a lot of people conflate the two bad partner yes bad dad probably abusive nothing here indicates that he was working regardless of the rest it isnt abusive to tell your partner to take a screaming infant and guest out of the room youre working in look i agree hes a crappy fatherpartner but the bottom line is nothing here is actually abuse its just being a shitty partner he isnt keeping her unwashed or sleep deprived being a new borderline single mom is whats keeping her unwashed and sleep deprived and for those who dont understand how parenthood works even two fully attentive parents will likely end up unwashed and sleep deprived in the first year of parenthood its just what happens its not abuse its not neglect its what you sign up for when you have a kid yeah shes doing more than she should but thats different from abuse neglecting the child yes neglecting the needs of your partner especially while youre working like the guy was in this story no youre just a poor partner at worst believe it or not shes a fully grown adult and capable of taking care of herself and isnt fully reliant on a man like an infant may be for care abuse is definitely the wrong word here with the information presented please stop pushing for such a strong word to be watered down that only hurts actual abuse victims in the long run again not all bad partners are abusive partners hes a bad partner no info indicating hes an abusive one did i miss anything actually funny happening looks like he just walked by them carefully shes 23 shes dating a 37 year old how reliable do you really think either of them are going to be at caring for 2 young kids shes going to be stuck in the hotel room earning her free vacation there isnt much other reason 37 year olds date 23 year olds and they certainly dont do it because said 23 year old
