you communicate your needs and ask her to help problem solve on how to make time to reconnect im sure these feelings youre projecting onto the friends husband will dissipate because the real issue here is you dont feel like youre spending enough alone time with your wife this is only 3 months in the fuck just send him a message back you keep trying to guilt me about who loves who more yet you dont even feel strongly enough about me to be in a genuine relationship at this point its really clear everything you say is just manipulation to keep getting in my pants and i respectful myself enough to stop allowing the disrespect i dont think its a good idea for us to be friends after this its clear you dont have my best interests at heart and are only interested in getting your dick wet dont worry im sure someone other than me can fill that role goodbye and goodluck then block him hes just using you and thinks you have no self esteem prove him wrong interesting i see the opposite on reddit everyone says that you should be willing to love your partner regardless of weightappearance i definitely disagree there within reason 510 lbs whatever a significantly change in appearancelifestyle that now clashes with yours though is as much an incompatibility as anything else but yes i agree especially before youre in a relationship if youve struggled with weight its totally understandable not wanting to be with someone you think wouldnt be able to handle fluctuations in weight never put yourself in a relationship you think might weigh on your own mental well being i mean you can decide not to date someone for literally any reason yes no were talking about exactly the same thing people who think weight doesnt matter and attractionlack thereof isnt a valid reason not to date someone are delusional but its also fair to not want to date someone who rejected you before solely because of your weight or even just someone who rejected you before but now cant get anyone better and is desperate this is one of those no one is wrong but actions have consequences moments we can not judge them and also recognize that someone you rejected for any reason probably wont want to be a second choice where do you live id like to read into this i mean he said in more words that he was an ah for the sake of being an ah because the elderly couple did something a little sneaky too seems like no one is amazing here though i cant blame the elderly couple for giving a try something they probably saw online and had no idea it wouldnt work am i the only one not believing hes actually bad at giving gifts and its just that op thinks anything other than exactly what she wants is terrible i mean a terrible gift giver doesnt just come up with a thoughtful gift like this and the coaching more sounds like her just telling him exactly what to get and since she clearly didnt this year he still got a lovely gift and put together a sweet day for her it probably wouldnt be a bad idea to just know if you have toxic plants on the property not sure if theyre toxic just to pets or to kids as well or even if you ever invite kids over but just being able to quickly know in an emergency is never a bad idea even if its something as simple as asking the gardener to text you when he plants something new get the annulment and then sue her in civil court for the cost of things you may not win but you might its easy to represent yourself fam youre the problem here not the ex and not the boyfriend it depends on what vibe youre going for is this a new partner or an established relationship you dont look cute but you do look ready to hike if youre the type who want someone who loves you even with no effort this is fine because youre dressed for the activity if you still want to look cute and functional there are hikingathletic skirts you could do two braids in your hair and a cuter more fitting tank topsports bra and matching socks instead and a lot of sunscreen its either couples therapy or divorce but he isnt an intentional abuser who would use therapy only to find new ways to abuse op hes just letting his own issues be taken out on op theres a difference the bigger issue is with op just working in a call center and both having extreme health issues and him being unemployed they likely cant afford couples therapy anyway well ask him if moving in together would help otherwise move on bury his head in the sand the same way you are to the fact that your boyfriend very obviously doesnt want to marry you he doesnt want to propose to you and he doesnt want to marry you if he would marry you with no one watching he wouldve been happy to let you propose hes lying to you and youre letting him because that hurts less than the reality that he doesnt want to marry you but is fine enough to continue dating you indefinitely i mean at this point your choices are stay as just a girlfriend and drop the desire to be engaged or wait until you piss him off and he dumps you i mean by staying youve just told him he actually never needs to propose and youll just stay giving an ultimatum you dont really mean is a deaths blow for ever getting the thing in this case marriage you want he is never proposing he is never asking your father for your hand in marriage you either get over it and accept it or you leave but youve totally screwed yourself over for any chance of him ever proposing now because youve proven your words and threats are meaningless honestly esh learn to say no and leave it at that stop adding qualifiers and allowing yourself to be walked all over let the 100 go but also just tell him that you dont want to hire him and let that be it no reasons no chance to change your mind so you want this to happen again i mean do you think itll get easier if this keeps happening the space will be helpful because itll help distinguish between himyou actually wanting to work on things together or you two just being afraid of being alone if hes holding on because hes just afraid of the unknown then once he gets over that the marriage will be done anyway taking that space makes it more likely that if you move forward its genuine and it also just helps to emphasize what being without you would be like rather than giving him a nice easy transition to leaving you the first question you need an answer to is does he want to work things out with you the second question you need an answer to is do you want to work things out with him if you can both answer yes he needs to cut her out and send a message saying i feel our friendship is starting to cross a boundary that isnt appropriate for either of us to continue speaking outside of work it isnt about you but i am going to focus on my marriage the next thing is he needs to block her you both need to sign up for marriage counseling and likely individual counseling too then you two should take a break from one another sleep in separate rooms for at least 6 weeks while youre working through your feelings and how to move forward distance does make the heart grow fonder and often our desire to latch on even tighter in these moments makes it less likely the relationship survives he needs to be honest with you about what he thinks she gets that you dont and be willing to say the things he thinks are too hurtful you need to be willing to hear him say some really painful things too only once all the issues are out in the open can you two begin to assess if this relationship is fixable but it starts by deciding if you two are both willing to make it work and you are both willing to make serious changes otherwise theres no real point in trying itll only hurt you more i mean plenty of people are shit heads throughout their entire 20s so theres still help there it isnt a magic switch when you turn 25 its just that the brain is finally developed but theres plenty of people that dont even start to grow up until that point so hopefully theres hope for her nta if this man were anyone other than your husband youd be the ah you are fully within your rights to tell your husband another woman has a crush on him to ensure proper boundaries are always maintained doesnt matter if the other woman is family or not it was a mothers day meal i would hope she wouldnt be a teenager info you guys are married did you forget that once you get married its no longer mine and yours but ours it makes no difference which one of your cards were used youre giving him way too much leniency and its going to bite you in the ass and hard unless you want to follow in her footsteps you need to set down some iron clad expectations with your husband because hes your issue here if he isnt willing to put your comfort first you probably wont stay married very long its not the idea of someone asking you to choose its the idea of two separate peoples entire family asking them to choose despite knowing and getting along with one another for 7 years and three other completely unrelated people to op once believable twice kinda weird but sure no less than seven people from five different upbringings nah unless you were raised in a cult but op already said they werent well think about it this way do you think people who made mistakes are unable to ever change if you do know people can change and learn from poor choices theyve made why dont you think giving someone a chance is the right call hes a meth addict itll be easy to spot if hes still involved in shady shit and then if youre making a judgment based on current behavior go for it but at least give someone a chance to see if it is truly in the past or not its the internet if you wanna act like a dumbass and say something blatantly incorrect and easily googleable dont be shocked when someone treats you like a dumbass if you think someone correcting you is rude dont have such a fragile ego you cant take being wrong that isnt the analogy you think it is and i already said elsewhere its birds belonging to the psittacine family dont comment correcting someone on something a quick google searches will give you the answer to there isnt really an excuse for misinformation in the age of the internet apparently people in the sub about animals dont know what animals are but parrots are any bird in the psittacine family cockatiels are parrots budgies are parrots cockatoos are parrots macaws are parrots theres dozens of other species that are also parrots think of it the same way youd think of a golden retriever golden retrievers are all dogs but not all dogs are golden retrievers same thing here cockatiels are parrots what did you think parrots were thats
