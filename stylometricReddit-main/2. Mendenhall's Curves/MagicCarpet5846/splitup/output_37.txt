first step sounds like she figured after 3 years marriage should be the next logical step but she realized that wasnt what she actually wanted it could be someone else it could be she wasnt ready it could just be that you two arent right for each other it doesnt mean you were a bad partner or theres anything wrong with you but not everyone is meant to marry each other be happy she realized and finally told you before the wedding rather than after and im glad youre okay sometimes just the threat of it would be enough to get someone to back down well it would probably be easier to trust if you waited to trust until someone has proven they are worth it ya know then you wouldnt constantly be having dudes breaking it youd just be weeding out the bad eggs without feeling like its a person affront like i said before a person who when angry responds in a way to cause pain isnt marriage material you should aim for someone who even when angry is able to come at a conflict from a place of love you have time take a breather moving forward table any serious discussion of marriage engagement moving in etc until you feel like you actually know a person and there arent any massive flags thrown out if this is about a rush to the aisle youll end up there a lot quicker and only once if you take your time and make sure its right the first time plenty of mcdonalds are 24 hours still weird but possible explanation as to why no one checked girl youre a doormat stop believing what this therapist has to say and get your own therapist to work on your issues because youre about to be a mom and you need to work on your spine unless you want to get completely run over by the two kids youre about to have to raise on your own as soon as you realize he doesnt actually care about your feelings he only cares about his you should stop caring about how much you love him because thats meaningless to him fair enough good luck you seem to have a habit of rushing into situationships with men before you actually know if theyre worth the time investment id recommend slowing down and not jumping in head first with any guy who shows interest i do have to ask how many men are you dating and why are you talking about marriage to a man you arent even faithful to you made a post 4 days ago that youve since deleted about a wealthy older indian man wanting to date you and you were considering it expect he was married before i feel like youre going through something but none of the information youre giving is actually honest as theres a common theme of you wanted to be the first wife its ok to admit you cant move past it ive said it before and ill say it again never stay in a relationship with a person who when angry will say something just to hurt you that isnt who you commit to a lifetime with it shows theyre vindictive and cruel and neither are traits you need in a partner ive been angry before really angry i have never said to a person whom i intended to continue dating anything that i felt would hurt them just because i wanted to hurt them you should both recognize youre career oriented and neither of you should give up your career goals for the other but those goals are in direct contradiction geographic incompatibility is a real thing and residency is long hard and time consuming if you think long distance relationships dont work let me tell you relationships in residency also dont usually work if you combined long distance and residency its a whole other beast to tackle if you already have doubts it aint worth it to invest another 23 years just to find out what you already know youre in your final year of uni when do you graduate are you done in mayjune if so hold off until you graduate itll give you time to plan and get the logistics sorted start applying for jobs now either where you are or back home where your family is go to your universities career department to get in contact with alumni message recruiters on linkedin this all works way better than blindly applying network network network use being a student to your advantage there is no easier time to get a job than now as for how to get where youre going do you have a drivers license if so rent a car to get where youre going you can possibly take your bird on a train cover the bird during travel and get a travel cage that can fit either at your feet or on the seat next to you be realistic about how much it costs to transport things it may be cheaper to replace items than ship them i moved cross country twice in a very short period of time and the only thing i transported was clothing everything else was bought as cheap as possible and given to friends when i left vacuum bags are your best friend for getting as much as you can in your bagscar if you dont have a license but do have family willing to house you pay for a ticket for them to fly out and then rent the car to transport you and your stuff in the meantime you need some income look into on campus jobs the dining hall library cafes tutor centers etc all should have flexible hours and be okay with you working 515 hours a week for some pocket change save every penny work as much as youre able focus on 1 getting a part time job on campus if possible 2 getting a permanent job network network network 3 talking to family to see if they can help you and how 4 looking into how much it will cost to get where you need to go the further you have to travel the more it will be and ultimately make sure you dont try to take a bunch of stuff that will be cheap to replace but expensive to transport im going to go against the grain but i would be uncomfortable if my partner went out in clothing like that personally nips showing for me are a no go and its pretty clear there were some nips showing its your body you are 100 in your right to do whatever you want but hes also allowed to be uncomfortable with it after 5 years together id personally expect my opinion to matter a bit to my partner i think you probably should decide if this is the hill to die on and if it is go forth but i wouldnt think wearing a shirt with no braundershirt or jacket or anything is worth making my partner feel as though youre looking for other mens attention i think youre nta but i get where hes coming from you clearly dont need to be with a guy who is uncomfortable with clothing like that though either ultimately may just be an incompatibility in your views info do you actually have a choice because based on your description youre third in line after your grandparents and your aunts to get the land unfortunately if this is the case speak to a lawyer before responding because legally this might be the best youre actually going to get that doesnt make it right but you should get this info before deciding how to proceed because if you dont have leverage here legally youre going to need to proceed accordingly it honestly sounds like your family is legally entitled to take 100 of your inheritance if theyre so inclined and you wouldnt have any recourse if you irk them they may go this route im fairly certain she isnt using an account with a 120 balance in it to provide the cash to close last i checked you need a lot more than that to even get approved for a mortgage and so theres obviously another account somewhere again i do not you seem not to realize that apple has embedded software in the photos app that changes the video attributes when you copy a file this is exactly what was discussed by professionals and exactly why i said unless its an original the metadata is useless have a good day now again that is incorrect like i said this was key information in a public trial last year where multiple professionals said copying a file does not save that exact information date time location etc on iphones unless a file is the original the metadata isnt usable im not going to argue any further i will take the experts opinion over a random redditor looks super cute but needs a fun belt or even a flannel tied around the waist as it is its missing something but it definitely works i do youre referring to the date with which a video was physically taken ie the day that ops gf was having sex if the video isnt the original which would track in her story the metadata wouldnt be in tact granted i believe you can tell if the video is an original if youre a forensic technician but laymen are unable to tell what youre trying to say the metadata will say copying a file alters the metadata simple as that and like i said before ill take a paid professional with a decade of experience and tons of lauded credentials saying this in a court of law over some rando on reddit contradicting it this was a key point in a very public trial that involved forensic metadata experts and these were the conclusions they all drew if the files werent original the metadata would not be intact ill go with their expert opinion over yours thanks eta this was jd v ah where the fact that metadata couldnt be verified in copied files is what hurt her on top of everything else but thats not relevant here i think you missed the point is she able to financially bring the same as you do in the relationship is she willing to have an even financial split or is she looking for someone to take care of her what do you want do you want an equal partner or are you okay with being with someone who you need to care for what sources are you using because while its true that often these are compromises made in relationships at your age they are by no means necessary to find a relationship so long as and especially if youre willing to wait until you find someone who feels the same way as you in fact you have a lot of the conclusions it takes people another decade or so to come to so good for you realizing this so soon i will remind you that even with a healthy mindset relationships can fail but that doesnt mean the relationships werent worth it or didnt teach you anything so while you should properly vet women before committing to them try to loosen up on the disgust because things not working out being what you thought and all of this is a big pet of growing up and somewhere along the way its likely that exactly what you want in a partner will change and evolve as a result of these experiences and thats a good thing growth and experience isnt a bad thing just remember that regardless of what happens if you can learn something from it it was worth it thats only if the file is original otherwise the metadata would
