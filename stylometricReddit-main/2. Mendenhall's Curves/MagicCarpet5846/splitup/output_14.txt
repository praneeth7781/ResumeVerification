yeah just be aware of the labor laws in your state yeah cant say telling the rest of her kids they cant go have fun at a water park with their cousins because their sister thinks shes fat is a good way to help her body image issues knowing kidssiblings they just might use that against the daughter in the future i think youre going to drive yourself nuts trying to understand this its simple he wants a partner who is close to their family you are not close to your blood family he thought maybe he could accept it and hes realizing after 3 years he cannot thats the only thing you need to understand and now its time to respect it and more importantly start respecting yourself and stop trying to make it work with someone who doesnt want to make it work no i cant i am not him youd need to ask him i can only give you perspective on he is allowed to have any dealbreaker he wants and he isnt wrong for having them i could guess maybe if he doesnt have a close relationship hes always wanted one and thus wants a partner who does have that big happy family but youd need to ask him well in asking him to be flexible you are asking him not to care about what he cares about and in him asking you to consider forgiving your abusive family he isnt respecting your boundaries either but thats the thing he cares about this regardless of if you think its a valid thing to care about and theres no fixing the fact that this is his hill to die on make your hill to die on finding a partner who treats your chosen family just as well as he treats his own you cant ask me because im not him i dont really care about family and in fact prefer a partner who isnt very close to family my whole point is just because you disagree with what he finds important doesnt make it unimportant thats why we date to find someone who were compatible with if this is all true you need to come to terms with the fact that you cant give him what he wants and stop torturing yourself you dont deserve staying in a relationship with someone youre clearly on such wildly different pages you will find someone much better suited to you who treats you way better just like a close relationship with family may be his dealbreaker you should make wants me to forgive my family a dealbreaker for you no im not missing that you see them as your family and i think thats great but he is very clearly meaning family as in blood family and in that regard you dont have that your family is chosen but he very specifically wants the family lineage not just friends and thats okay too i am a person who thinks family means very little but even in my own perspective i am able to recognize that i do not get to tell others what they should and shouldnt think about family and thats something i think you need to recognize as well for you they are your family for him theyre your friends not your family and he wants someone who has a close relationship with their family which is where they incompatibilities come into play both in your definitions of family and the relationships he expects of them and i understand that but chosen family and the family you grew up with and raised you arent the same for him thats something you need to respect just as much as youuu need someone who respects and is fine with you have a chosen family and not a blood family thats an incompatibility though thats not one person being right or wrong you may be really hurt and youre 100000 valid in your story he is the wrong one and i get that but from an objective vantage point neither of you are the villains you just want different lives and neither of you can give the other what you each deserve no they arent thats him communicating his doubts people talk about things they think are incompatibilities all the time he has never suggested she forgive her family hes only communicating about he doesnt know if he can accept them not being in her life i have had dozens of conversations over the years when dating with people like this it was never pressure it was im struggling with this and am talking to my partner about it rather than blindsiding you i would always take someone telling me im reconsidering our relationship because of xyz over just ending things for seemingly no reason 3 years in op needs to realize he obviously isnt going to accept it and hes obviously never treated her very seriously because deep down he knows he cant start a life with her but he isnt pressuring her him communicating his feelings shouldnt be villianized it isnt wrong it would be wrong of him to say you need to forgive your family and be close to them for you and i to stay together but it is not wrong for him to say you arent close with your family and thats really important to me and regardless of if you have a really good reason i dont see a future with someone who isnt close to their family trying to change someone is wrong wanting something different from someone no matter what it is isnt wrong based on your post he isnt trying to change you hes just saying you two are incompatible and he isnt wrong for that no one is the easy example to understand is disagreeing on kids completely unacceptable behavior i want kids and even though you dont im not accepting that answer and will force you to have kids with me completely acceptable behavior i want kids and even though you have really good reasons for not wanting them this isnt something i can compromise on i think its better we find people we are both more compatible with in both cases everything else in the relationship can be fine but having a big close family is very integral to the life your boyfriend wants and realistically he isnt alone in that this isnt some foreign cult like desire is everyone you meet going to care no absolutely not but plenty of people choose their partner based on if they can have the life they want with them or not and thats about everything kids pets financial goals retirement anything and everything you can think of someone out there finds that thing really important to them and will absolutely break up with any partner that doesnt align well with them in that regard so please stop calling him wrongunreasonable for having his own vision of his life hes entitled to that just like you are entitled to not keep toxic people in your life just like you may not want to date someone in the future who is extremely close to their family these are all things we can and frankly should consider while dating if you wouldnt truly be happy making a life with someone are you saying you should still stay because you should be happy with them no of course not but its not the appearance if it were hed be pressuring op to forgive her family he isnt hes saying he doesnt think they have a future he doesnt want the appearance of family he wants the actual close family why is everyone purposefully misunderstanding that i actually dont see anywhere where he says op should have a relationship with her family hes simply saying regardless of if its for a good reason i dont want to marry someone who doesnt have a good relationship with their family which is fundamentally different hes saying op and him will not work because she doesnt have a relationship with her family and he isnt going to change the future he wants because op has a good reason but guess what thats totally his right and theres nothing wrong there it sucks but people dont need to accept anything about you and hes allowed to want any future he does and he isnt wrong for finding someone who aligns with that op doesnt now op sounds wayyyyyy better off without this guy in her life as well but he isnt wrong for wanting a partner who has a strong relationship with their family i actually dont see anywhere where he says op should have a relationship with her family hes simply saying regardless of if its for a good reason i dont want to marry someone who doesnt have a good relationship with their family which is fundamentally different hes saying op and him will not work because she doesnt have a relationship with her family and he isnt going to change the future he wants because op has a good reason but guess what thats totally his right and theres nothing wrong there it sucks but people dont need to accept anything about you and hes allowed to want any future he does and he isnt wrong for finding someone who aligns with that op doesnt now op sounds wayyyyyy better off without this guy in her life as well but he isnt wrong for wanting a partner who has a village it happens all the time though if he wanted kids and you didnt that would similarly be throwing away your relationship for people he doesnt know yet people have ideas of the futures that they want and are allowed to find a partner who meshes well with that future he shouldnt have to compromise on wanting a future where he and his wife can have all the in laws over for a bbq or whatever and you shouldnt have to compromise on not allowing harmful relationships in your life i understand it hurts but your bf isnt in the wrong here either if hes just saying you two arent compatible and he isnt insisting you mend your relationship with your family it honestly doesnt it just sounds like he knew they would never work out long term and so he never took the relationship very seriously heres the thing though it actually isnt an easy thing to work out its a dealbreaker for him to not have a close relationship with both his and his partners family unless youre telling me its easy because youll go and have a relationship with your family please dont then there isnt an easy fix at all youre at an impasse as much as you would be if he wanted kids and you didnt telling someone you shouldnt care about the thing you care about is not an appropriate way of working things out and its totally reasonable for him to want a partner that everyone can have this big huge family where everyone gets along its absolutely heartbreaking for you as i understand how much it hurts to be judged for reasons outside of your control but its 100 reasonable for someone to consider their partners family when deciding to marry someone i personally wouldnt marry someone with an exceptionally toxic family that they hadnt cut out everyone has different lines unfortunately for him his line is i want my partner to have a good and close relationship with her family and regardless of if you think thats reasonable he is fully entitled to that dealbreaker and you need to recognize that youre simply unable to provide that for him much like if you didnt want kids you could never give him a son im sorry for this but it sounds like he isnt that great of a boyfriend anyway and youd be much happier finding someone who accepts
