they didnt get married as they were likely around 2324 when they broke up i understand 10 years sounds like a lot but once you actually consider the majority of their relationship if not all of it comprised of middlehigh schoolcollege its not really a factor and we definitely have enough info from ops biased perspective to see why someone wouldnt want to marry her just yet you can love someone like crazy and still be able to recognize that someone with terrible credit poor spending habits and payday loans all things op readily admits to isnt someone to marry right away marriage is both an emotional and a logical decision and it definitely sounds like the logical part of the decision has entirely valid reasons to want to wait and make sure this isnt a disaster waiting to happen as differences in finances are the number one reason couples divorce just remember your ability to get an appointment and others experiences arent going to be the same this occurred during lockdown when everything was done online so options werent limited by location and zoom therapy opened up a lot of options for people that werent previously available for example ive never had to wait longer than 2 weeks for an appointment ive needed new patient or old therapy or any other doctor but that doesnt mean i would tell anyone else they didnt try hard enough if they werent able to find an appointment as quickly if your only reason for doubting the veracity of this story is the idea that someone was able to get a therapy appointment quickly and hire someone during a time where plenty of people werent able to work due to the lockdowns id urge you to remember your experiences wont be the same as everyone elses oooor its really obvious op was way too immature for marriage until very recently and he isnt readywilling to make a huge and lifelong commitment to someone who only recently had poor credit and payday loans why does it always need to be the guy is lying to op about wanting to get married and bullshitting her with his super valid concerns about proceeding i mean your relationship isnt serious hes said as much if hes already planning who hes going to fuck when you break up he clearly isnt very committed or interested in you if hes already prepared for how hell get over your breakup and which friends hell find comfort inside literally break up with him and you probably need to break up with that friend as well because i dont know how shitty of a person someone needs to be to sleep with their friend of 4 years fwb at a minimum pseudo boyfriend more accurately thats a pure trash move from both parties and most 2223 year olds will know better than to behave like this men and women i mean now youve learned how your husband will treat your kid ifwhen you divorce him and he finds some other younger woman to start a family with red flag if ever i saw one at that point just leave otherwise its just an attention seeking endeavor please notice me withdrawing rather than organically just matching the energy it wouldnt be noticeable otherwise and then youre brought back to my initial comment easier said than done when you live together and if youre at the point of needing to be petty to be heard the relationship clearly isnt working you moved and said no one you know is in your area how is your ex a genuine concern he wouldnt know where you live well you have no idea what shes in therapy for this is clearly either an obvious crush on bil and a bs sexist ploy to get close to himhave an affair or genuine anxiety but that doesnt mean that either have been adequately brought up in therapy you can be in therapy for things and not be in therapy for everything or even the right things sounds like she looked up the wine and saw the price for a case not a bottle as a case of 12 is around 200 and figured you wouldnt know the difference ok well neither of you sound grown up enough to get married thats probably much easier if you dont live and have pets together like op at that point its pretty difficult to pull back in any meaningful way without being seen as really petty you can be upset your girlfriend went to a con topless thats a pretty standard boundary for most people but you dont say you feel she crossed a line by being topless youre upset because she embarrassed you because you dont like how her body looks after beating cancer and thats what makes you ta its a small company there likely is not hr ok but i very much doubt she was overcompensating for the past 45 years this has likely been an issue for at least a few years no talking about this issue is the start but if you guys arent able to actively resolve these issues within the next 3 months i would cancel the wedding i would accelerate that timeline depending on whenif you need to cancel by a certain date to get refunds on whatever you can chances are you arent able to resolve these issues you would be extremely foolish to push forward into a marriage where resentment is already blooming because even canceling an expensive wedding will be much cheaper than a divorce the fact that its taken you 5 years to even begin to question such a glaring and obvious incompatibility is mind numbing to me this isnt fixable she isnt going to suddenly going to start wanting sex as much as you do youre signing up for a lifetime of disappointment which seems unwise yeah im really not surprised that attraction is at the core of this im sorry to kick you while youre down but in the absence of kids or seriously debilitating health issues there are honestly few people out there who wont start to lose attraction for such a massive change in appearance before marriage somehow everyone on reddit claims to be that minority and im sure most people wouldnt say anything but attraction and effort is also very important to a long lasting relationship and you will find that like i said there are plenty of people out there who really dont care and will find you beautiful at any weight or type of clothing its now just time to find them good luck to be honest i do not understand this your brothers 30th milestone birthday is the same night and you wanted to go as a couple and obviously were planning to attend so how did this conversation of am i invited and ill get a sitter even happen how was the conversation not it is my brothers birthday that same night you are either attending with me or youre staying and watching the children but going to a 21st birthday of a friend isnt an option like i just dont get how you didnt bring up your brothers birthday and how you were just ready to ditch your brothers birthday if you were invited to this persons 21st yeah and its foolish to think that will never happen because of course as soon as you bank your life on that wont happen it does without fail sadly doesnt seem like he cares about losing op too much as he left the house even after noelle told him to get lost and didnt deny it or try to work things out all things considered though op is better off with him not fighting because at least shell be able to leave much sooner and with much less pomp and circumstance uhm whoever that they is is an idiot because it isnt true alcohol isnt a truth serum it just lowers your inhibitions and sometimes those inhibitions are all thats stopping people from saying something absolutely wildly untrue but just pops into their head and sound goodfunnyshocking a 45 lb weight gain in less than 2 years as an otherwise healthy assuming here since nothing to indicate otherwise 20 something year old is definitely really concerning honestly reddit hates to address it but that would definitely put a strain on attraction for most people the other obvious issues aside that being said not everyone and you deserve a partner who is attracted to you as you are now and loves you and wouldnt leave you even if someone better came along idek if this is about him being insecure so much as about him wanting to be able to do better than op and the reality is things change in peoples lives all the time that open up previously unavailable dating options people get rich start to take skin care or fitness or eating healthy more seriously all the time health issues or fixes can completely change a person promotion at work lottery win inheritance or an investment that pays off some insecure 23 year old with daddy issues comes along as soon as that happens op is getting dumped immediately and remorselessly it isnt about her its about him he pretty outright told you if a woman like her were interested in me i wouldnt be with you i would be with her he might love you but ifwhen a woman in her league likes him hell be the type who cant resist you really want to be one of those my husband left me when i was pregnant with our second child for a woman 10 years younger than me stories because he is the man who leaves his wife for a woman 10 years younger than him because he never thought hed have a chance with the hot young woman and now that he does hes willing to blow up his life for the chance he can nuke this relationship with his friend to the ground and it doesnt matter because she isnt the woman who will give him a chance but someone someday probably will and if you cant trust your partner to turn down any woman young old hot rich smart poor stupid etc why are you with them you love who you thought he was not who he is are you telling me you think so little of yourself to fall in love with someone whom you know is only with you because he thinks he cant do any better he thinks youre fat thinks you cant cook and thinks hes also poor and not worth a better woman thats not what i look for in a dream man honesty do you regret having your son because this definitely sounds like you regret having your son and cant genuinely fathom someone wanting to be a parent as a 1 goal in life remember people can want different things and if you keep up this attitude your son is going to realize you clearly regret becoming a mother probably because he loves his wife and also because regardless of how unhappy you are not many people want to be the guy who divorced his wife after she beat cancer youd be surprised by how much guilt probably made him stay as long as he did a marriage is more than sex but a marriage is not more than any form of intimacy with absolutely no form of intimacy and affection you arent married youre just legal roommates why have all of the liability for none of the benefits that isnt a partner at that point it isnt just sex its all form of love and intimacy how can you expect a marriage to last if youre unwillingunable to do any of the things that actually make a marriage a marriage they arent kissing cuddling pleasing each other
