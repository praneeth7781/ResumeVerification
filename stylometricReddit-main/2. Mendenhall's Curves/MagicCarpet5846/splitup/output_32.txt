about more than just this match with everything going on with kyedae and to keep the flaming to a minimum it isnt going to help him improve and it honestly cant feel good for him to hear people shitting on him everyone has bad days and even if you think hes inconsistent it could be due to his entire world turning upside down within the past month ok op you need to realize there is no saving the kids it sucks but both of their parents are literal nazis the kids either will or wont take after their parents but unless youre going to do away with the nazi father which do not im trying to simply illustrate you need to accept the kids will turn out how they are destined to turn out then you need to accept that the kids got fucked with their parents reach out to the kids when theyre older if youre so inclined to protect them but at this point you cant do anything you need to just accept tank your cousin is now and stand up for your values a little late is definitely 15 minutes not over an hour i would definitely be more than a little annoyed if someone showed up to a meal over an hour late without explicitly stating that theres almost no restaurant ive ever been to where an hour and 15 minutes in i havent gotten and eaten my food already at that point honestly just dont come if youre going to be that late as it defeats the whole purpose of going out for food especially if it was just brunch and not like brunch and shopping or something else afterwards that being said the friends still fucked up and glad they took responsibility for it im proud of you youve come to this decision a lot easier than most wouldhave it isnt fixable and its ultimately a waste of time that you could spend with someone who actually loves you to even try to fix this just make arrangements for a divorce lawyer and you should legally be allowed to use your joint money to pay but check on your area and serve him with papers make sure to keep a friend or some family in the loop and have an emergency crash on the couch arrangement if you really need just in case if youre able to start applying for jobs or disability or some form of income and if he suddenly starts with i want to make this work then you can simply reply if you were ever interested in being a good husband you shouldve done that from the beginning not once ive decided ive had enough is there anyone with knowledge who can explain to me how an arranged marriage can happen where the groom and his entire family hate the bride and her family because i still find that part so confusing you should speak to a professional theres a lot of things that could be going on and youre right if you dont solve this youll end up either unhappy alone or both a therapist will help if youre willing to put in the work has he actually said that though because devils advocate in me thinks theres a chance he also just might have work you still dont need to go ofc also consider that youre violating your ex by showing someone else a sex tape of her with her face in full view personally that would be my bigger issue as now id be terrified of any nudes or videos wed takensent being something you either have or might share delete everything you have of any other woman on your phone tell her you understand that this was a violation on multiple levels of multiple people and you understand you were a fool and youve gotten your ass handed to you and are never going to do something like that again and then dont because holy shit your poor ex 1 youre assuming he doesnt want kids and knew he never wanted them that isnt actually stated 2 hes allowed to change his mind hes allowed to withdraw consent everyone is its crazy to argue that because shell lose out on something that his consent no longer should matter imagine making that argument for a woman its gross same thing here morally he can just as easily get a sperm donor or do ivf with a sperm donor and implant that embryo well the problem is you didnt tell him because you were afraid of him wanting your money you now know its not a fear its reality you do sound naive because you are failing to realize even if you couldve worked through the issues before you cant and shouldnt work through my boyfriend is a gold digger or potential financial abuser interested in taking or controlling my money sure maybe she cant but to be clear theres nothing saying she cant sue and win for the cost of ivf but the answer isnt to take any another persons consent in creating a life that doesnt yet exist which is why i said regardless of the legal aspect morally he should be given the right to withdraw consent well remember that youve made these changes for yourself and your marriage not to be praised it fell off in the house and you noticed within 30 minutes text him and ask for help looking when he comes home at the end of the day if your partner is upset over a one time accident that says more about him than you that being said just a tip whenever i put on jewelry with a clasp the first thing i do is give it a little tug to make sure its really on properly and not just appearing to be secured necklaces can be clasped just the wrong way where they stay on but once you tug it it slipped out of the clasp good habit to form to minimize unfortunate accidents but at the end of the day its still just an unfortunate accident to be honest i never understood people who say dont accuse someone because for all you know theyre using the condoms for masturbation thats pretty uncommon and frankly if thats the case as long as you dont accuse someone like a maniac theyll simply respond to the accusation with the real reason be aware that maybe there are other reasons but thats like someone saying all hooves are zebras unless you live in africa those hooves are horses 999999 of the time ok well unfortunately your mistake had a pretty direct hand in turning this dude into a misogynist you can want whatever that doesnt change the reality youre dating a misogynist and not only that but youre dating a man who rightfully resent the woman who allowed him to be bullied when he was less attractive and never stood up for him you arent going to overcome this if youre embarrassed to be with him youd better cut your losses because quite frankly you being in his life is part of the problem because youre a direct confirmation of everything thats fueling him people treating him better as soon as he got attractive just to say even if youre legally in the clear morally you should allow this man autonomy over his own progeny i understand there is a cost associated with either getting a sperm donor or doing ivf with someone else but please do not take away his consent to bring his child into the world men and women should be allowed this right sue him for the cost of the ivf and even what it would cost to do it again with a sperm donor but dont bring a child hes clearly stated he doesnt want into the world against his consent nta but moving forward upon ordering ask for separate checks not only does that make things way easier for the waiter it makes it clear to lynher boyfriend that whatever they order is fully on them its best to learn ways of dealing with difficult people in a way that isnt directly confronting them its unclear if you actually said to the waiter i want separate checks so i dont pay for the other couple but if you did probably best to just address things as i suggested instead because passive aggressive and snide remarks about your girlfriends best friend in front of said best friend without ever saying trying anything else is also not the most mature way of handling things and is bound to rub your gf the wrong way regardless of how in the right you are hey its clear youre in denial but you dont need to apologize to us the only one who suffers here is you just remember that are you his first girlfriend im going to assume you are or at least youre the first girlfriend to want to have physical intimacy kissing hugging sex etc and he asked you out unaware that he wouldnt like it but he doesnt and hes probably really unsure why himself i would say more likely than not this has to do more with him his feelings his identity and his journey than it has anything to do with you i understand that sucks but i would very gracefully break up with him just send him a text it feels like were friends not in a relationship i think it would be better for us to just be friends from now on well if you want the real talk maybe you wont ever be absolutely sure and in that case dont ever get married marriage isnt something you should take lightly and frankly much like children i believe plenty of people out there simply will never be fit for marriage if you cant do it right dont do it not when your decisions can have such huge effect on the lives of others both in the person you would be marrying while unsure and of the kids you may have with her id probably speak to a therapist as it sounds like youre struggling with empathy well sounds like even if you could trust him before in the past youre no longer able to trust him now as youve caught him in multiple lies hes turning into an addict and a liar and when you combined that with the fact that 1 he has additional traits you dont like and dont seem to have touched upon here and 2 youre on reddit asking strangers if you should break up means this this isnt the life you want for yourself and you know that this is the life you will have if you stay it sucks because you love so much about him and you wish you could just make him into that perfect person you have in your head but he isnt and as time goes on its becoming harder and harder for you to convince yourself hes close enough to being that person its true that no one is perfect and we all fight and have flaws but the reality is this isnt working and it probably hasnt really worked in a lot longer than you want to admit but the longer you stay the longer itll take to not only get over this relationship but also to find the person who doesnt make you feel this way not only that but staying with someone like this is only going to leave you with issues that make you a worse partner in the future all in all he may want to stop but you cant keep waiting around for him to stop even without the drugs probably if you were honest with yourself this wasnt a man that youd want to stay with even if you didnt love him im not sure how
