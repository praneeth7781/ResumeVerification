are concerned yeah theyll probably be shocked someone is so forceful and leave you alone but other people might call the police against you and the reality is if theyre the one bleeding you might get a cop that sides with them even worse unless youre fully able to defend yourself you may make someone angry enough to seriously hurt you or teach you a lesson you said in a comment youre weak but fast so please be smart and safe about when to act in self defense people can change dont act as though what someone said three years ago is what theyre beholden to for life i mean why do you have an issue with him giving an ultimatum you two did discuss it and you responded by essentially saying well i can still meet someone i like more than you even if its a closed relationship so we might as well keep it open not exactly comforting hes laying out his boundaries on what he needs to feel like a long distance relationship will work the discussion really is that simple i need xyz and you either say i can agree to that and you two continue dating or i cant agree to that and you break up it really sounds like what you want is a chance to convince him that an open relationship while living in portugal is fine otherwise whats the difference in how he opened up the second conversation hes being clear and expediting the discussion it can be really damaging to trust to try to convince someone why you still want an open relationship and he wants a closed one at this point the ball is in your court if youre telling the truth that youre fine with closing the relationship then you should have no issue with his ultimatum because ultimately it isnt an ultimatum its just him communicating and establishing really clear boundaries which is the only way an open relationship has even lasted thus far lowkey would expect her to just move to a major city which i mean thats probably what they should do you should consult about the actual eviction process and start it that means giving notice in writing usually and being aware of next steps if they refuse itll be different since you live there as well and own so a lawyer specializing in landlord tenant disputes will help you out i mean you just tell him i will not be getting pregnant until we have a baby name picked out if you really are this stubborn i will be going to get an implant in this week this is a hard boundary for me i am not going to endanger my life with a stressful pregnancy because youre too stubborn to compromise like an adult and i refuse to bring a child into the world with someone who thinks thats acceptable behavior i think he thinks now that youre married youre not going to leave its normal and common for military to cheat on their spouses not everyone but obviously your husband is one of them you can choose to be a stereotype or refuse to partake but sounds like those are your only options sean isnt on 100t im pretty sure hes on corrected to shopify rebellion as a content creator i think you need to accept that not being okay with something isnt just grumbling about it and going along with what he says in the end its making a clear statement with actions behind it if i am only paying my share if that isnt okay with you we need to split because at the end of the day you are okay with it because youve stayed for four years of this love yourself more youre definitely being taken advantage of again this isnt really a case of being wrong so much as you need to start respecting yourself is this really what you want in a life partner someone who is using you to subsidize their life despite making more than you i mean hes selfish at best and totally and plainly using you at worst your friends were directly asked not to tell you your exs business you never asked your friends to keep info from your ex in the same manner it isnt really fair to say they chose her i also assume that since everyone of them knew they were dating these may have started out as your friends but along the duration of your marriage and you moving they became mutual friends to both of you tell her she deserves to know shes being pursued by a cheater you owe him nothing and by telling her itll hopefully give him a reason to stay tf away from you holy shit nta im not going to diagnose anyone but you probably should not remain in contact with a woman who has even less control over her own behavior than you she likely has her own unaddressed struggles but you need to look out for you and i cant imagine it would be easy to modulate your behavior well when someone is constantly forcing perfection or utter insanity upon your life i would honestly think of it this way you would inevitably lose him anyway its better to lose him and gain a kind hearted man in your boyfriend than lose your boyfriend only to become bitter when your dad inevitably abandons you in the future i mean i think its her right to decide if she wants to share that information with you or not people saying their loyalty is to her and not you isnt really that fair as she directly asked them not to tell you whereas i dont think you did something similar the only person i think its fair to have an issue with is m28 as he was in a situation to tell you himself or to ask your ex to tell you i personally would just say to m28 hey im not mad at you for dating ex but i gotta be honest that it makes me uncomfortable that you listened to me talk about my experiences knowing you were with my ex i just want to clear the air so we can move forward without it being awkward you can decide you want to ditch the whole friend group but that seems like its punishing you more than them id just chalk this up to what happens when you have a lot of mutual friends it isnt their place to share news that they were explicitly told not to share well were you aware your husband was wearing that jersey or did you genuinely have no idea this was a jersey let alone a signed jersey until after he got upset with you if you were aware beforehand ofc youre the ah your kid vomiting doesnt suddenly shut down all higher level thinking in your brain you cant possible argue it isnt your fault for not having the common sense of i need to get a towel because my husbands jersey isnt an appropriate vomit rag nta fhv is highly transmissible and can cause tons of issues in kitties you have to know if either of your cats has it before moving in together and if only one does you two shouldnt move in together im gunna take a guess and say youve made similar comments in the past because calling this a lie is a pretty strong word it seems pretty clear you dont trust him especially since you just said its fair he wants someone who trusts him and not that he has someone who trusts him if you dont trust him and he knows you dont trust him why wouldnt he call of the wedding most likely women in his culture say similar things too and once theyre stuck in marriage kowtow to tradition idk where hes from but i have seen it in some other cultures so he pretended to be okay with everything youre saying because he figured it wouldnt matter when you were stuck in the marriage now its up to you to decide was he right its common yeah are the guys youre attracted to very different from you or something because i mean i can imagine this happening if youre going after the sort of guy who goes after different girls and this is just a we have very different types situation probably would see what you can do to reduce your hours so that you can show her with action that youre serious about making a change the issue is you work too much so work less make a change give her quality time not fancy gifts or expensive dates she wants to go on hikes or weekend beach trips with you she wants to make dinner together and fall asleep together not get fancy jewelry or a giant bouquet of roses sure thats nice too but if you try to throw money at the problem rather than make actionable changes in your behavior shes gone for good i mean you said hes an immigrant is this normal in his culture because it could also just be that this is what having a wife means to him and if thats the case run out of curiosity why are you not asking your fianc to handle this youre taking care of 95 of wedding planning and youre the one that needs to move in to care for his grandma girl you gotta make sure this man is an actual adult and capable of taking control of his own life his own family and his own relationship and not just throwing everything on you because it he isnt mark my words your marriage will end you will not be able to withstand being the manager of both of your lives forever being understaffed on a particular night doesnt mean anything about retaining staff someone who worked in a restaurant should know the difference it was a saturday night having 12 people call off sick could and often does make a restaurant understaffed says absolutely nothing about the ability of the restaurant to maintain staff ah yes please mansplain how people who say i take home well over 6 figures somehow know less about their own salary than you because you happened to have worked in a restaurant even though im talking about a fine dining restaurant on the level of 1600 meals being normal on not just servers in general but go off i guess you know more than people do about their own jobs guess what was also a restaurant manager some make over 6 figures its not unrealistic or even that uncommon in fine dining sorry fam he isnt changing for you or your kid accept him as he is or decide you want something different changing someone isnt happening especially not after 5 months you may understand tipping but you dont understand math if you are making 100hour you need to work less than 20 hours a week to make 6 figures shes making well over 100 an hour because this is just one table and if you dont believe me google it the articles are out there it is 100 realistic and common in fine dining waitresswaiter makes 6 figures a year hundreds of threads and articles and amas pop up immediately dang fam you got rejected by the person you let walk all over you and begged for more i would take this as a wake up call that youre really struggling with your self esteem and having any amount of selfrespect for yourself if i were you i would be asking myself why on earth i still want this to be salvaged because i mean shes never been loyal to you never never wanted to never will and is now isnt even getting enough from this to
