your child of any form of food for months seems like a fine strategy to at least try i read this as crows initially and had to zoom in in order to definitely say those definitely are not crows i mean realistically speaking thats because if a partner was going to negatively talk about body count its going to be towards a female i would be more surprised if i saw someone judging a man for sleeping with 100 girls in college quite honestly generally speaking it gets around when youre all friends in college you should probably read again i said this isnt a legal issue specifically where it pertains to her lying and saying he raped her i never said sexual assault isnt illegal i was specifically replying to the idea he should report it to the police for fear of her flipping the narrative he honestly isnt working that much yes its a lot but plenty of people do it the real issue is hes leaving for work at or around 12 pm if a 1213 hour day has him home at almost 2 am depending on her work hours that means they probably never see each other he needs to get his hours in check and start working wayyy earlier so that him and his wife can share meals together but honestly i have no sympathy for someone who expects his wife to work 30 hours a week do all the chores and then stay up past midnight to have a home cooked meal ready for him in the middle of the night this would be a totally different story if he was getting up at 5 am and getting home at 79 pm and expecting her to cook something quick or have take out or whatever but these timeframes are totally unreasonable and unnecessary to be honest the part everyone seems to be overlooking is if hes coming home at 130 am after a 1213 hour day that means hes leaving for work at noon he needs to start going into work at 67 am and getting home at a normal hour so its reasonable to expect a meal ready for him but its ludicrous to be going into work that late staying that long and still expecting your wife to stay up past midnight to then cook if he were coming home even at 9 pm i would be fully on his side coming home at almost 2 am fuck no im not saying it isnt im just saying this isnt a legal issue re she could lie and say he raped her no sex happened in the us actual rapists with evidence go free but you cant have evidence of what didnt happen and unfortunately even though he was sexually assaulted male victims have even less chance of legal success than female victims however filing the report will at least substantiate ops experience even if no consequences befall her and like i said if ops girlfriend doesnt believe him even after he has gone to her multiple times then hes learned a valuable lesson about how she prioritizes him so he can gtfo she could but since op was smart and went to gf about this before its consistent this wont be a legal issue sex never happened he got a bj and without any evidence of any sex let alone nonconsensual sex op really doesnt need to worry about a rape charge not in the us at least if his gf doesnt believe him ultimately its better for him to know she isnt someone who will have his back and he can leave the staff didnt side with her and theres nothing about anyone else agreeing it was simply she had an attitude i had one back the staff told us we were both able to use the equipment as we wished unless you see information not im the op but how youre portraying it is very different than how the op portrays things you do seem to be dragging your feet a bit on the legal side of things just to warn you that could seriously hurt you in the long run just be careful i mean if communication is important to you i wouldnt stay with someone who doesnt communicate i get it sucks but that just isnt who she is you should love someone for who they are not who you want them to be yes i agree but also recognize that there are some people who take undue offense to what most would consider normal so as much as it may depend on him recognize that it doesnt all depend on him this is so much an issue where women assume the worst of guys in the gym where its a growing trend on tiktok for girls to film and watch for anyone who glances at them just to start a fight its entirely possible that she may have also just assumed he was staring at her when he wasnt im not really speculating who was doing what because theres ultimately no way to know except that even if he were standing too close for her preference in a gym environment or really any if you come at someone with an attitude like she did you should expect an attitude in return it really isnt an abnormal social interaction even if you regret it in the future you can mourn him then theres no reason or expectation that mourning a life can only occur at a funeral with people to watch you grieve if you dont want to go now dont and whenif that ever changes decide how you want to remember him then let him blame you at the end of the day if him blaming you is what it takes for you to find a bigger better relationship far away from a cheater like him thats a small price to pay i mean i dont necessarily think its sincere but i am saying that if you immediate attack anyone even trying they will stop trying thats fair enough i will say i take it you were probably a bit more polite than it seems the woman in the story was but youre totally entitled to your opinions and experiences i think to me ops answer seems a bit more normal as i get the impression the woman also had an attitude to start and you tend to get what you give so i dont really find op an ah for responding to an attitude with an attitude but im glad you havent had that experience no she said she was convinced her intentions were good and realized they werent and her actions came from a place of judgment which was wrong yeah it is glaring obvious who does and doesnt go to the gym in this thread to the surprise of no one most people on aita clearly are not avid gym goers out of curiosity do you go to a busy gym because youre totally entitled to your opinion but its 100 normal expected and required in a busy gym to stand close enough to a desired piece of equipment that as soon as the person gets up from their set they can move up and take the equipment otherwise someone will take your place this comes down to if the woman isnt comfortable with that sort of environment thats totally fair but she probably needs to go either at a less busy time or a smaller gym also im not trying to attack you im just curious if youre familiar with this sort of environment because i can see how someone who isnt familiar with busy gym etiquette may get to your conclusion tbf if everyone in the thread is mischaracterizing his actions as something they clearly werent he can provide clarification people are out here acting like he was standing over glaring heavily and making tut tut noises while pointing at his watch when this sounds like completely normal gym interactions from someone who actually goes to a gym heads up gyms are filled with adrenaline and testosterone and women and men tend to be a bit testier than usual women often assume that everyone is leering at them and tend to want space and no one looking at them and men often just want the person theyre waiting on to get out of the way so they can do their set it sometimes leads to snarky interactions and its not that deep they didnt actually they said they understood where op was coming from but shes allowed to do whatever exercise wherever she wants thats actually the opposite of saying hes out of line thats retail worker speak for i fully agree with you but this is my job and i need to not get in trouble and believe it or not youre allowed to silently judge people he didnt say anything stop acting like you can police someones thought thats some orwellian bullshit right there youre gunna decide a person is an asshole for a silent thought dude thats just unreasonable the woman spoke to op first and told them to go away pretty sure op isnt the ah here i mean she has a point though as far as i was a giant flaming asshole and now i realize it goes she got further than a lot of people ever do none of these comments recognize that though id probably caution people at least in their real life to be kinder to people who have any form of selfreflection because the fact that this person still got piles of hate for acknowledging they messed up just makes people never want to acknowledge their flaws to some extent she cannot undo what she did she can only reflect on her previous actions and try to learn from it in the future if we actually want the world to be a better place and for people to want to be better we all need to encourage people for trying that doesnt mean forgive their previous mistakes but endlessly hating on someone even when theyre trying to reflect on their behavior isnt the answer yeah and then you realize really quickly someone who really loves you wouldnt hold you back and theyd probably move with you given he has nothing tying him to where he is i get how it feels but take it from an old curmudgeon like me you realize a lot of the things you were so sure of at 18 just arent true by the time youre 25 and then again when youre 35 youll find someone who loves you so much you never find yourself posting on reddit about how theyve made you feel guilty for achieving greatness ive lost loves before that felt like i wouldve died without them but im still here and in the end i now realize those loves were there to teach me something and prepare me to be the person i was meant to rather than to accompany me in the journey but youll find that person i promise the road may be bumpy but itll be worth it i think you should just be honest im going to great school you can either come with me or you can stay but i am going if this is where our paths diverge i can honestly say i loved every minute but i am not giving up on this dream i understand if you arent ready for this step but i am i was in a similar situation many years ago i have no regrets and id pick my education every single time my parents always said if its meant to be itll work out and if it wasnt meant to be it isnt worth sacrificing your future for does he have a therapist knowledgeable in addiction if not that should be the
