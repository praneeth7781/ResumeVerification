she stayed with you and you were head over heels in love with her so of course youd never be the one to leave shes been shoving these feelings down for an eternity because she feels guilt over these feelings but thats what it comes down to she just doesnt feel the way about you as she does about her ex and if you told her this shell cry and shell beg you to stay because shes never actually progressed beyond that 18 year old girl who cant deal with rejection or being alone so shell cling to whoever is around and willing to give her that love even if it isnt actually the love she wants pick anything you want then you seem to think im specifically talking about antisemitism and fail to understand what an analogy is so pick cheaters cheaters dont actively threaten your safety at all but plenty of people will choose not to invite someone to their wedding because they cheated on their spouse and morally object to that behavior that also is their sex life and shouldnt be any of your business that also doesnt have any actual affect on you but youd still agree someone is fully in their right to decide they are morally opposed to cheaters and dont want them around them right because newsflash they definitely have that right and newsflash same thing applies here why is the argument his sex life has nothing to do with you a reason hes not allowed to disagree would you say the same if this was a person who cheated on their spouse of 10 years while pregnant and op was saying i dont agree with your morals so im not inviting you because i dont support cheaters because its the same exact thing that pertains to their sex life and doesnt actually affect op but i can guarantee you everyone on here would say op is nta for not inviting the brother then the reality is people are allowed to choose not to be around people who have different morals than them even if you dont agree with those morals and yes people are allowed and i would fully argue should choose to uphold their values even if they dont directly affect them like why do you actually want that to be the standard because thats like saying as a white person youre an asshole for uninviting someone racists against whomever because well youre white so it doesnt even affect you but the fuck of course you should stand up for your values of not being racist and in fact if it were race being the issue here everyone would be saying you need to stand up for your morals even if it doesnt affect you otherwise youre being hypocritical you can have different morals and views to op about sexual freedom and still recognize that op is allowed to have that view and not want to be around someone who acts like his brother just because they happen to share blood i mean its completely fair and valid not to invite someone you dont agree with their morals and life choices to your wedding lets not act like just because you dont agree with someones decision doesnt mean it isnt their right to make that decision thats like not inviting someone because they are antisemitic and you dont approve of nazis even though you yourself arent jewish it has no bearing on you and no impact on your life personally but youre still allowed to say this isnt behavior or choices i am okay or comfortable being around its really easy to agree that the people getting married have that right when its something you can clearly agree is wrong isnt it but thats the thing everyone has the right to make that choice and yes even people with views you dont agree with that being said its definitely important to recognize that he wont have a relationship with his brother and much like op can post about this on the internet so can his brother especially when he sent a freaking letter and op needs to accept that however for anyone saying hell lose his brother with this behavior honestly do you actually think he cares it sounds like hes pretty emphatically throwing the brother out so i dont think that statement is likely to affect op at all hes either asexualon the asexual spectrum or hes not attracted to you either way no i dont think he comes around if sexual compatibility is a dealbreaker for you you should end the relationship sooner rather than later because lying to yourself is only going to hurt you in the long run well fuck that guy then hes guy a boring old misogynistic hypocrite where is that i didnt see that anywhere in the postcomments if i missed it and this isnt a standard hes also holding himself to then fuck that guy regardless end result is the same he isnt the person for op yeah there is pretty much no part of a heathy happy and functional relationship here theres no intimacy no respect no trust and sounds like your feelings for him are very quickly waning you cant really tell me this is what you imagined in your husband is it if not respect and love yourself in a way he is never going to and find that relationship i mean you cant really trust a man who isnt worth trusting unless youre going to brow beat yourself into accepting being treated like trash is that really what you want to do to yourself because he isnt worthy of being trusted thats why you dont trust him i think you need some harsh truths yes you need to give her space if you refuse to give her the space shes asking for her feelings are going to very quickly succumb to the resentment that will quickly build but in giving her that space most likely shes going to feel relief shes going to feel the weight that is being in a relationship with a man like you lifted and then your relationship will truly be over its hard but i think you need to learn this being grumpy isnt some cute personality quirk its fucking annoying and not something anyone selfrespecting wants in a life partner no one wants to be with a man who acts like they dont even like their partner and ive been there it sucks and yeah most likely her feelings for you are pretty done and dusted women try and try and try and once they get to the point where theyre telling you theyre falling out of love and need space 99 of the time they are out of love with you already but just cant admit it to you or themselves yet you may need to genuinely feel this loss to understand that you dont get to just suck for three years and then finally decide to see a problem with how youre acting you shouldnt be putting loved ones through your tantrums youre 27 its time you grow up and learn to be a kind respectful patient person and yes that likely will mean doing it single for a long while and getting a therapist to work through things with you to make sure you dont prematurely jump back into dating and someone who can hold you accountable to yourself depends how exactly did this come up its been three years together did you ask some hypothetical or did he out of the blue just tell you hes never going to let you see his phone because if this came up naturally in conversation it probably means nothing and id just respect his feelings if this came up unprompted out of nowhere id be getting highly suspicious it sounds like hes a virgin hes allowed to want to share that experience with his partner however if its a dealbreaker for him and hes said it is then you need to walk away you arent what he wants and its totally wrong of him to shame you for not being his perfect made to order bride hes a coward for not telling you this himself but you need to move on the right person will come along who wont care about your extremely limited past but the reality is this person does care and thats okay but it isnt okay to stay with someone who doesnt accept you as you are i mean there are plenty of 25 year old virgins in religious circles and even more still who just havent found that person or are waiting for personal reasons i dont think its really fair to say he wont find a virgin if thats something important to him it sounds like he himself is a virgin as well however he needs to recognize if he wants a virgin and thats an actual dealbreaker that he needs to share that one and only experience with his partner he needs to stop dating someone who he clearly cant have that with its completely wrong to shame someone for not being who you want over something they cant control its like saying dating someone who is under 6 tall is a dealbreaker and then continuing to go out with someone who is 56 they arent going to grow and if thats what you want in a partner okay thats fine but then dont waste someones time who is clearly also looking for a serious partner you and your husband should go to counseling and you personally need some help to accept that your ils will never accept you and will never like you i get its hard but you need to make peace with this fact so you can move forward your husband will also need to come to terms with how that will affect his family dynamic so he can make sure hes okay with that it very much sounds like he is but you need to stop they arent going to like you it is what it is it hurts absolutely but you need to get the idea of if only i did xyz they might finally like me they wont unless youre able to suddenly turn into a good korean housewife theyll never like you thats okay your husband married you not them but you arent doing yourself or your marriage any favors by trying to get people who simply never will like you to like you drop the rope live your life be happy stand up for yourself stop accepting hatred in your life idk the party was a lie so sounds like the alcohol was merely a coverin order to soothe the nerves she had about cheating you remind your brother her behavior isnt normal it isnt healthy and while you support him and will always be there for him you arent going to enable toxic behavior from her and just remind him that youre there for him if he realizes this isnt what he wants in a relationship anymore just remember it may be his choice to put up with controlling borderline abusive behavior in silence but that doesnt mean he gets to choose for you how youll react its pretty clear he knows this is ridiculous and probably is putting up with it either because of the idea women can do no wrongcant controlabuse a man or because he thinks he cant do better than this woman either way its not your job to keep the peace in someone elses toxic relationship dont feel badly that it affecting your finances was the final straw be so proud of yourself for even having that straw because you know deep down you shouldve had a final straw long ago and just be proud youve finally found it and then stick to it because youre right hes abusive and plain
