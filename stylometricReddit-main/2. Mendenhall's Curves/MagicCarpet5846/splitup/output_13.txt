result you want they dont care about you they only tangentially care about everything youre giving them but if you take that away none of them will ever call you except for maybe rob so please get some therapy and become okay with having a waaaay more distant relationship with your blood family they do not care about you and you jumping up and down throwing stuff at them is just telling them youre desperate for their attention and love and the more they dont give it to you the more they can take advantage of you with love and affection dangling like a carrot on a stick in front of you but they dont and never will stop doing so much for people who clearly will never return the favor one potential way is to call the non emergency police line and tell them whats going on and ask if theres anyway a cop can come over and facilitate the discussion where you ask the photos to be deleted and also to have it on record as youll be dumping him afterwards and are afraid for your safety they may not do it but they also might make sure you mention this has all been done nonconsensually if you happen to know any police officers you can also ask if theyll do you a favor and do this as well in uniform if youre able to get a cop to come make sure to delete the photos from his recently deleted photos and to also make sure theyre deleted from his icloud and then at the end of it make sure you ask the cop to put this on record so if somehow he managed to keep any photos if he ever distributes them itll be a very clear case of revenge porn as he is the only one with these photos and was told by a police officer to delete them nta this is like someone calling you an ah for calling the police because you were stabbed this is why hoas exist youre not an ah for calling the correct people you didnt call the hoa because the color of their house was the wrong shade of white you called because they were causing both property damage and psychological damage by keeping you up at night and just as an fyi theres almost no way that a 25 bouncy castle was legal either you couldve likely called the police too as you need permits and safety people for something that large and its usually not allowed in residential areas period a family friend does the carnivals in my area and the larger slides etc were all kiiiiinda illegal but they relied on the its only for 4 hours so no one will really care or know mentality your husband is right its time to completely cut all three of them off sure but that doesnt happen in engineering literally the definition in most states is make more than 600week and be in a job where an advanced degree is required this isnt some weird field engineering is pretty universally known to be exempt stop trying to make this something it isnt shes exempt she needs to decide what she wants and if shes cut out for a field where what shes being offered is as good as it will ever realistically get im done having this conversation if you dont believe me do a quick google search this is like the most easily verifiable information about labor laws out there bruh read the fucking post she is exempt she has clearly stated it stop trying to argue about something that is literally stated in the post as true its coming off as extremely argumentative take the antiwork attitude to the antiwork subreddit its 50 hours not 60 she started 3 months ago and this is her first job i can assure you in this instance no its almost 100 not a good career move to leave now if she can do a year that would be the least likely to impact her career and would be a good use of job hopping personally most of the recruiters i know want at least 2 years but 1 at least a year they will still interview a really good candidate and will definitely ask why the short tenure no company wants to employ a brand new professional train them only for them to leave a few months or a year later its just not worth it for them and again the company isnt taking advantage of her theyre paying her they are legally not required to pay her you do understand this right this is what the field entails theyre giving her more than most employers woulddo if she genuinely cant handle this reality shes simply not cut out to do engineering like i said you cant be a cpa and say you wont work overtime during tax season its just not how it works you come off as someone who thinks things should work how you want and dont actually understand how the professional world actually operates its not iffy im very familiar with the laws for engineers theyre exempt no overtime required and op has very explicitly stated this same thing in the post this is how it is for engineers unless you do consulting work honestly if op is a woman she should go through ivf and simply tell her partner if you dont want kids then we need to end things but this is nonnegotiable for me and im proceeding with it i recognize this is a terrible idea in reality but if shes a woman she should take autonomy over her own desire to have children and make it happen lmao youre aware op is 30 and would be instantly snapped up by another wonderful woman right its not as though his wife is his only chance at love sure hell have no wife for a few years while he gets to know someone else but hes young has a great job and wants a family hes a ton of womens dream man right there as long as he takes care of himself and knows how to wash a dish the idea that if he ends things hed be alone is almost as absurd as the people who imply a womans only worth is to procreate op is exempt they legally are not required to pay her anything and this is an issue shed find in most any company in the electrics engineering field she needs to be very realistic about what she wants her career path to be moving forward and take this info into consideration because shes definitely exempt and while a company that pays time and a half probably does exist it may not be easy to find and get a job there especially if she leaves her first job so soon shes only 23 and paying your dues is definitely necessary sometimes yeah exactly but op is an electrical engineer and an exempt employee depending on if shes a software vs a hardware side of ee she could just need to accept the nature of the job you work until a project is finisheda deadline is met in these fields a lot of the time you get paid well for it but sometimes thats just the cost of the business ya know my partner was a software engineer and some weeks were really chill and other weeks when something was due or there was an issue theyd be working 1618 hour days every day for a few weeks made good money but thats just the nature of the industry make sure you can handle it before pursuing a career in that field lmao op needs to recognize getting paid for her time is more than shes legally entitled to then and be happy sure but im also just stating that if shes in a salaried professional position she most likely legally is not entitled to overtime pay and in fact is getting more than the legally required payment she needs to do research absolutely but a number of people dont realize that a lot of occupations that make good money also arent entitled to any overtime pay now that doesnt mean every single occupation but thats the whole look it up be aware you may not be entitled to what youre asking disclaimer i was giving you definitely can i think you think im saying an employer can take someone from an hourly to salaried employee at will to avoid overtime but thats not what im saying im saying a company can choose to employee people either as a salary or hourly employee in a number of professional positions where in an hourly structure they would need to pay per hour worked but as a salaried employee it would be a flat rate regardless of if you worked 40 or 50 hours and yes legally this varies by state so its important to know your states labor laws and its also important to ask the right questions and set clear expectations when accepting a position on hours expected overtime etc but its 1000000 an employers decision to hire people on either an hourly or salaried basis and then depending on the local laws whether particular positions are entitled to overtime or not i mean you can definitely decide what you want but depending on your field that just isnt an option youll have theres plenty of industries where if youre unwilling to do what needs to be done to get a project done on time you wont survive in that industry for instance you cant be a cpa and tell your firm that you are only going to work 40 hour weeks during tax season and expect to keep your job you cant tell the hospital that youre not going to help out with a massive outbreak or accident or whatever it may be because youve worked 40 hours that week if that isnt for you totally fair just be realistic when choosing a career path then dont get taken advantage of but also people do sometimes take it too far for the principle of things without understanding it just isnt how it works in some fields everyone handles trauma differently but i have never heard of anyone man or woman to take selfies of themselves doing things to their rapist and looking happy while doing it that sounds like he cheated on you and thinks youre dumb enough to believe his story its unfortunate because op is only 23 and she just started it can definitely look poorly on her to already be searching for a new job well you absolutely can and many do make employees salaried so as not to pay ot but thats on the employee to carefully weigh job expectations and compensation packages before accepting a position it depends on the state laws in california salaried professionals arent entitled to overtime pay doesnt matter if youre an entry level or management level individual employers can do whatever they want but legally they dont have to pay anything if youre a salaried professional employee that actually isnt how it works in the professional world usually a number of states labor laws explicitly state professionalsalaried employees arent entitled to any overtime pay as in not even just normal time but 0 for any extra hours worked you usually are getting compensated well if youre in a position that might require overtime think if you work as a cpa or a surgeon but its important to understand laws and payment structures vary and theres definitely a lot of professions and jobs where you may be required to work overtime for your job description but you are not legally entitled to compensation for it this isnt true in most hourly positions and lower skilled jobs like retail workers but
