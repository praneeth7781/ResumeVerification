grieving his mom and being in a mixed family and just lashing out and those around him and saying something he knows will hurt but i dont actually see anywhere where anyone is even remotely provoking him unless youre going to count the five year old asking to take a look and at that point its time for both parents to step in and address the fact that he needs to have some patience for a five year old this is somewhat normal for teenagers even without all the stressors in his life siblings can say some awful stuff to each other but thats when its time for the parents to step in as the adults and guide their growing humans in the right direction girl why are you trying so hard to lie to yourself hes already doing a good enough job for you you cant both disrespect yourself this much nothing he said is really wrong though you come into a good amount of money the smart move is pay off any interest accruing debt and invest in something else to grow your money no one has tried to get their hands on it the step siblings havent tried touching it since op was married six years ago and his half brother alec is a 5 year old and asked to take a look believe it or not but a 15 year old does need to learn some patience for his 5 year old brother its bad parenting to act like his attitude is at all acceptable depends is your long term goal to be in a place where you two can be friends or is your long term goal to both be in a place to fully move on with your lives without one another in it if this was taken as the end no i wouldnt if the goal was to get space to get over the relationship so you two could maintain a friendship indefinitely something as simple as no need to reply but i hope you have a nice birthday would probably be fine more likely than not though one or both of you wanted this to simply be the end i dont think this is actually meant to convey the idea of what he would do in an emergency its meant to bluntly and hurtfully convey the idea that his stephalf siblings mean nothing to him and hes doing so by conveying that even a lifeless though important object means more to him than them and that sort of needless cruelty from a 15 year old repeatedly to a 5 9 and 11 year old is definitely the sort of thing you can and should step in to address if you are afraid of there being a time limit its pointless to even give it one last try hes essentially telling you we need to figure this out because im at the end of my rope and i dont want to leave but i will have to if you cant get it together quickly call it now this probably is hurting him a lot guys are also capable of leaving someone they love that it isnt working with just because hes told you this doesnt mean hes manipulating you it means hes trying to get you to care that youll lose him unfortunately at this point unless theres a miracle involved you two are unlikely going to be able to just stop and fix things but it is possible if youre both willing to try and put in the work also a reminder it isnt all or nothing he can say i cant pay for everything but i want to help you out i can pay 510kyear towards your tuition which i will pay directly to the school or whatever amount he decides depending on what tuition is like in his country if she freaks out he knows shes just looking for a free ride if shes grateful then maybe they can have at least some semblance of a relationship youll get nowhere if you dont accept the fact that your husband isnt loyal doesnt prioritize you and would frankly rather be with someone else i get denial is strong but the only person who suffers from your stubbornness is you not him he gets two women fighting for him someone to put his bills keep his home still have plenty of sex and feel no guilt because at this point you are well aware of who he is and are choosing to stay thats essentially you saying im okay with this in his mind youre definitely giving him way too much credit he needs to say the words assistant youre crossing professional boundaries right now you need to stop behaving like this its unprofessional and not okay the fact that hes never shut her down is a problem and it isnt remedied by you simply being sure he wont cheat on you he needs to be ready willing and able to actually tell this woman her behavior is entirely unprofessional and whatever her feelings for him are or are not she needs to learn what it means to be someones assistance in a place of work it would be an incredible overreaction if this were the first time an issue with money has come up but it isnt theyve been clashing about their views on money ever since and perhaps even before they pooled their money this isnt just one example of spending money without discussing it its a pattern of disregarding ops wishes failing to communicate stonewalling and mismanaging money the problem is people are human we arent endless wells of patience that never run out after monthspotentially years of trying to get his gf on board with discussing finances and having a plan and her never taking his concerns seriously or even hearing him out hes used up all of his patience on maintaining the status quo that its all gone for anything beyond that and while it can definitely be fixed its hard and it takes both people realizing theyre both going about things the wrong way and seriously changes all around will be needed to fix the gap and resentment thats formed all of those concern two babies born to the same generation though this isnt stealing a baby name this is simply using a name and if you really wanted to use the analogy the baby name in this case is hope and the sil would be the one stealing it by trying to make it so op cant use it i think theyre acting as though its so distant because op said she and her brother have a strained relationship so it isnt like theyre meeting up for weekly family dinners where theyll realistically always be getting confused its more like having to worry about it during thanksgivingchristmas and even then thats probably not every year if they celebrate with ops family as well so it amounts to the same level of inconvenience as youd have if you shared a name with a distant cousin the point is op would only be changing the name to appease sil but if ever her and her partner break updivorce shed have changed her daughters name for someone who was no longer her concern so her priority should be honoring her family rather than respecting sil im not moving any goal post everyone else is and theyre moving it down the bare minimum for not in poverty is being able to afford a roof over your head and food on the table bare minimum for middle class is being able to provide enough of a roof over your head and good food and the occasional take out and maybe saving for a vacation bare minimum for upper middle class is being able to afford a nice car a nice home and having savings for retirementeducationrainy day bare minimum for rich is having an excess of wealth that can freely be spent on luxury goods and not having to worry about the costs of any education things like luxury cars privateexclusive vacations mansionmcmansions having the closet of designer clothes newest devices buying your kids houses etc are common place and not a concern for those who are rich and yes the dollar sign it takes to be rich has drastically increased but no the goal post for what being rich means hasnt she said itll affect the relationship with her brother not the kid they already dont have a good relationship though so idk why she thinks theyd prioritize an already crappy relationship over that of the mother of the baby getting to honor her great grandmother realistically speaking regardless of the name she wasnt going to be very present in the babys life anyway as as it stands shes barely in her brothers life most people dont suddenly invest into the lives of a kid to a person they barely talk to she thinks that statement bears any weight but frankly it makes her argument worse not better as it just illustrates how little they lose by ignoring her wishes and how much they gain 2 years older shes 22 and dying of stage 4 cancer i get its an adult but i stand by my point yeah the price of kids and a good education in the us is no joke and if youre making that much money you really arent getting much if any help for the costs i had scholarships and it still ended up being that much im in a great place in life dont get me wrong but it takes a lot of money to raise kids in an ideal fashion people can of course make it work with way less but anyone who grew up poor can attest its better to grow up with more than less well the way i see it rich should be a higher standard of living than what everyone should be capable of not having to live paycheck to paycheck affording retirement vacations and at least somewhat of a college fund are all things i think everyone should be able to comfortably achieve youd need to go significantly above and beyond that basic standard of living to me to be considered rich which i see specifically as an excess of wealth not just enough shes practically a child dying of stage 4 cancer to some extent you cant expect her to be rolling in money for a wedding youre aware your dad is effectively trying to replace you with his daughters and to pretend like those are the kids he had with his late wife right i dont mean to put a damper here but that would really make me rethink having any form of close relationship with him someone that insecure doesnt accept that answer they keep pressing until they get something to fixate on yes its a relative term but its one that implies luxury it isnt actually a luxury to have a comfortable life i understand societal factors make it so that is something most for without but it shouldnt be the standard is able to live a comfortable life the problem is so few of us are able to but the standard for what we should be able to achieve didnt suddenly decline just because it got harder to achieve i know what its like not to have those savings but that still doesnt change the fact that being able to comfortably achieve a bare minimum doesnt mean youre rich it means youre middleupper middle class depending on if maybe there are some luxuries or if everything is fairly average that they are people are severely underestimating just how much more money it takes to go from nice life to amazing life when you also have multiple kids and even intend to pay for half of their education if grad school might be on
