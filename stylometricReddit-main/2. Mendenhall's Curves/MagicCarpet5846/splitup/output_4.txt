break up because this isnt fair to me nor is the lack of communication an attractive trait to me i think the issue is asking at all is going to damage your rep the same amount as trying to force her at this point if you no longer have any mutual in common no worries but otherwise i wouldnt i mean that just mean another day of childcare instead sending the message after she had to leave of hey daughter is lovely but im not comfortable having a child in my home unsupervised for safety reasons and i cant guarantee ill be home all day while youre here so if youre unable to find childcare for daughter i dont mind you taking the day off with just a heads up thanks for understanding thats probably the whole my toddler is still a toddler and isnt 100 perfect but we do try very hard to make sure they understand how to behave thing op was getting on yeah a baby is still going to be a baby sometimes but that doesnt mean good parenting and bad parenting wont produce on average wildly different behavior in children youre not an ah but you do need to bite the bullet next time they ask just say im sorry but every time our toddler and their kids get together toddler gets sick we need to look after her health first so until all of them are older and have stronger immune systems ie better behaved or you have time to find a better reason we dont feel comfortable doing hang outs you can also use olive oil followed up by her face wash to remove the oil then you can teach about skin care routines to promote natural beauty as thats a super diy two step cleanse the oils help gently break up the makeup and then the face wash removes the oils i mean youre both being childish blowing up his phone is also the immature response because a mature and selfrespecting woman would simply say when youre ready to talk let me know so we can arrange to give each other back the stuff at our places and never tolerate this behavior from a boyfriend this is not a friend is it because if he is genuinely just a friend you honestly need to back off youre coming off like a clingy gf ok well if you genuinely believe that you are delusional because this was absolutely meant to be malicious and controlling you need to snap out of whatever trance this dude has put you on before you end up a shell of yourself nta just say her name wont be anything after your mom you can either sit here and figure out a name we both agree to or i will be taking your refusal as permission to unilaterally choose the name as i am her mother and carried her in my womb for 9 months you can pick whatever you want of those two options but those are your only two options compromise or get no say i mean hes naturally a flirt he seems not to think of you as the special woman in his life but as though all women need to be blessed by his attention ill say i have known people like this and yes they ended up all cheatingleaving for someone else that isnt a comment necessarily on your boyfriend but what ive seen from people who are flirty and everyone likes them nta you asked what to do you do nothing remind him if you want to care for your brother i will get a job to support us and you can take care of baby and him thats your options i am unable and unwilling to take on that role and i have made that very clear it will go very poorly for you if you try to force this on me and will not end how you intend it also reveals something about you your comments are coming off very obtuse at points you two are very obviously not on the same page yet you for some reason are unwilling to talk to him and get on the same page that sort of expectation will kill any marriage you do get around to so you may wanna up your ability to have difficult and awkward convos with your partner give the cops a call heads up your fiance is pretty willing to straight up lie to your face thats uh something you should look into before you marry her good intentioned or not thats not wife material right there i mean did you actually ask him if he had any stds before having unprotected sex with him what he did is still likely illegal as usually hiv is a legally reportable disease to any sexual partners typically before any intercourse has occurred regardless of viral loading but also too many people assume a partner theyre exclusive with is automatically clean without asking the following do you have any stds or stis when was the last time you were tested before i feel comfortable having unprotected sex i want us to both get retested and send each other the results are you okay with that last one is optional but i have always done this it ensures that both of us were actually tested tested for everything not just chlamydia and gonorrhea and that no one is lying or asymptomatic or whatever and as an added bonus makes it really clear that if you ever do contract an std from them they without a doubt cheated and there is no well maybe it didnt show up yet crap nah fam if he was able to remember you giving him a hall pass he was able to remember the three rules you gave him in the same conversation thats just a straight lie to try to blame it on the adhd i dont even think a month has passed since hes left this sounds like it happened a few days ago okay fam youre focusing on the wrong things here him wanting kids in the past is irrelevant he said he didnt want them now people change for a number of reasons if someone says i dont want kids you gotta focus on what theyre telling you not what you hope theyll want in the future and not what they wanted in the past you see how you messed up there and unfortunately heres some more tough love if youre moving every 6 months to a new place every time i wouldnt picture yourself finding a long term relationship until youre able to settle down in one place guys are less likely than women to make a long distance thing work indefinitely that might also be playing a factor did this guy end things with you around when you had to move again is this info you tell the guys he wanted kids with he because he was madly in love with her and not with you because he wasnt in love with you i get it hurts but youre not doing yourself any favors here could be yeah might not be that either its impossible to know if he didnt tell you i dont think its worth your energy to figure out i think the big takeaway should be just because one particular individual was unable to love you does not mean you are unlovable in general and also dont date men who tell you they dont want kids warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info i mean a spark in the beginning can fade quickly and a spark for you is not a spark for him guys can also seem really excited for you when really they just like a new experience it can also just die for random reasons its called ick you are super into someone and then they do something could be as innocuous as bad breath fighting with a waitress stopping wearing makeup or a million other things and all of a sudden the physical chemistry is just dead but yes absolutely if you want kids and he doesnt that is enough for any man to immediately dip you need to be smart here and leave as soon as a man says he doesnt want kids because he isnt going to give you one and hell just dump you if you push it or happen to get pregnant kids are one of the biggest dealbreakers out there and can instantly kill a persons attraction to you you will find a long term partner but it start by realizing dating is about finding someone youre compatible with and wasting time on someone you arent compatible with for instance someone who doesnt want kids or someone who isnt showing you any affectiontaking you on dates just means youre losing out on the possibility of finding the person you should actually end up with ill give some tough love because youre 26 and its probably a lesson youd benefit from learning being wrong for a specific person does not necessarily mean there is something wrong with you in general yes i am sure there was a reason why he didnt fall in love with you maybe you did something that annoyed him maybe you have a different view on kids or retirement or whatever other fundamental goalbelief maybe you two just didnt have that spark physically whatever it is that is particular to him and your potential relationship with him not a comment on your worth as a person you kinda see the difference i know that i am an utterly amazing catch but i also know that i am wrong for a heck of a lot of people out there and they would never fall in love with me if we dated because we just arent right for each other does that make me as a person unloveable no definitely not it just means i found someone who wasnt my person thats what dating is though and unfortunately sometimes it takes a few months or years to figure out that someone isnt your person be glad it was only a few months and remember that someone deciding you arent whatwho they want is usually an individual thing and not a comment on your general worth honestly i wouldnt be okay with my partner doing this either lol yes blame the abuse victim for going back to his support system because hes a man thank you for proving you cannot read because there was not a single curse in that comment no one said verbal abuse between parents doesnt affect kids i simply said abuse directed at the parents isnt treated as abuse directed at kids in the eyes of the law but you have made it crystal clear you have some utterly abhorrent reading comprehension so at least that makes sense why you dont understand the difference have a good day now he is probably disenchanted with serious dating right now and likely wasnt very interested in you either if i had to take a guess he is having trouble finding and keeping someone he feels that intense chemistry with and has decided to only look for casual sex now its his journey and his burden to bear i wouldnt let it weigh too much on you youll find someone who treats you well but i would start by setting a higher bar for yourself than 6 months in and never being on a date theres an exceptionally large difference between parking illegally in a private residential spot and an emergency services access area and you know it the issue is exactly that people who take a mild inconvenience and definitely ah behavior like taking someones assigned spot in an apartment and trying
