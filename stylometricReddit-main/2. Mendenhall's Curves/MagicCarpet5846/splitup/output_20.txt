hygiene rather than the covered condom it definitely isnt just men who can have poor hygiene and its important to recognize that maybe they are both in need of a good scrub for the others comfort its never easy to bring up concerns so he may have a legitimate concern as well that he didnt know how to tactfully bring up they canshould both be taking showers before sex yeah but im sure you immediately saw his reaction and apologized clearly that did not happen here then you wouldnt be saying teehee idk when your partner asks what youll do you say i took it so hed leave me alone but ill delete it when were home lmao look she can absolutely have a hotwifecuck fetish and if her partner is on board like her ex obviously was thats totally cool im not shaming two individuals who have fully consented to whatever in their relationship but no you arent jealous for having a problem with your girlfriend saying i dont know what shes going to do about the dude who wants to fuck her and shes playing along with it thats like her trying to say youre jealous for being mad she has another dude inside of her there are some pretty well established boundaries within monogamous relationships that while its always best to discuss anyway are go without saying rules and expectations not entertaining dudes who very clearly want to get in your pants is pretty bare min your girl has something wrong with her if she genuinely doesnt see how without express consent from you playing this behavior that its just not okay usavevideo i would honestly just say your attitude is atrocious if i waited for you you can wait for me it was a few minutes im extremely disappointed in you for trying to turn something good in my life about yourself we need to talk about this because im absolutely not going to tolerate this sort of behavior but i think its best we both take some space from each other to collect our thoughts so we can hopefully have a productive conversation about this because right now im having a hard time seeing how to move forward in a relationship with someone who cant be happy when something good happens because this is either a habit of hers or this is the first time its happened and either way you need to make it crystal clear that if she thinks this is okay you two arent compatible why would you willingly stay with someone who would burst your bubble like this over seven fucking minutes ive literally taken shits that last longer did he actually not have sex with someone for 7 years im honestly doubtful of that because if it took him a few months to ask you to be exclusive you were presumably having sex while not in a relationship a guy who goes 7 years without sex doesnt really do things that way i dont know if youre taking didnt date anyone for 7 years to be the same as didnt have sex or see anyone at all for 7 years because they arent quite the same now obviously if he explicitly said the words youre the first person ive slept with since my ex 7 years ago then ofc also to op she feels the love has started growing since nov to him it didnt even start until they made things official which was only a few months it takes people awhile to fall in love sometimes especially if its been 7 years since he last was i assume he wasnt celibate during that time so it lends itself to the idea of he isnt one to fall in love easily or quickly op if youre offended i think you need to look inward and assess you say i love you because you want someone to feel good not because you want the emotional validation of hearing it back well because believe it or not it actually doesnt solve the problem to say omg wow he suuuuucks if we want to be high school girls gossiping in the lunch room well focus on the negative behavior but if youre actually trying to problem solve you focus less on the actions of the past and more on the actions to do in the future to address the behavior and in order the address it op needs to communicate how shes feeling well its not really a family vacation she specifically said to him i want to see this city and i want you to spend time with your teacher that can very reasonably be interpreted as two separate vacations that are going on at the same time with obvious time spent together but this isnt the same thing as a family vacation where the only intent is to have fun together as a family op wants to see the city and in trying to make that happen explicitly told her husband she wanted him to be able to spend time and hang out with a friend mind you this is the first time theyve ever met and its presumably in a country that speaks the language husband has been learning its completely understandable how meeting a friend for the first time you can get lost in the time and being exposed to a culture for the first time and being able to apply everything youve been working hard to learn could also just be so new and exciting for ops husband now is it right what hes doing no hes married to a mother and he needs to understand that there are certain limitations with that but this isnt a family vacation in the traditional sense and so its very easy to see how husband doesnt understand op would have a problem with him hanging out with his friend when he was explicitly told the purpose of the trip was so he could do so so communication is key and no not some condescending communication like thats some fucking ridiculous concept actual adult communication i have a feeling the fact that its not his daughter is playing a role he rather obviously doesnt really consider himself a father and while i dont think he should have to he also is married to a mother and with that comes an understanding of there will be natural changes and limitations to what you can do on vacation going out past 10 pm only to go out again at 3 am and not be back till after 7 am is definitely one of those things you really cant do yeah the longer she waits the more likely its completely over i dont see how a relationship recovers after this much time dead in the water honestly i had a friendship end pretty similarly and i was open to repairing it for like a few weeks and after they didnt reach out i was over it when they finally did reach out i just ignored it honestly given its been a few weeks since theyve spoken allie may not be keeping op in her life either if op wants to save that friendship she needs to reach out and apologize and ask how she can best support allie and respect her boundaries while doing so because if she doesnt reach out the relationship with allie is done for are you telling me that youre happy now idk everyone says that but they either dont know the people around them or just have a selection bias because if you are honest enough and live long enough you realize that like i said 95 of the population says catty things to their close confidants and humans as a whole really are not immune from having crappy thoughts its incredibly naive of people who claim not meeee must be you hell i can look at most peoples comment histories and see plenty of catty comments the only difference is being able to at least acknowledge it gently prodding for more details like the people asking for each of their exact salary i gotta say i side with him on that one hes asking for advice about a particular situation and attitude i mean he said slightly and its negligible at that point if you think negligible is 2x nothing then you also just think nothing op is saying is reliable in which case advice is pointless some people arent comfortable sharing specific details on the internet for anonymity imagine being so hungry for info on strangers you block someone for calling out how weird it is uhuh thats what everyone says its like someone saying they dont owe in the shower its more likely theyre lyingin denial about it than they dont actually pee in the shower most people dont realize just how catty private conversations really are to an outsider just tell her youll cover this month if she covers next and if she puts up a fight just say if you dont see the issue in your attitude we need to have a more serious conversation about our relationship in general because its not okay for you to expect me to cover the burden of your mistakes without so much as having a conversation or asking me about it im not okay being with someone who thinks thats okay regardless of if this is over 30 or way more dude stop asking about ops personal salary info i think the issue is she said im not paying this month because i already made my budget kinda hard assed imo but i guess and im not paying extra the month after either shes basically saying you need to pay for my fuck up and im not accepting any other answer over 5 or 5k or 50k that sort of attitude is really bad for any relationship well you also said youve only been dating a few months youd be surprised at how well people are at hiding their true nature for months and even years at a time but now youve seen a side to her and while its possible she means what she said to you more likely than not she just doesnt like confrontation and is spinning things to sound nicer to you now that you called her out either she is going to dump you or youre going to dump her but theres very little chance this person is your person im sorry i know it sucks to find out someone isnt who you thought they are no offense as well but its also really naive to think 95 of people dont have a mean side in some regard people are not known for being saints if you had to show strangers your worst private conversation with your closest friends and families we would all think every single person in this thread is vain judgmental and shallow i mean the whole point of the post was centered around a superficial perception of worth not surprising he would only bring up the direct comparisons that are relevant not only that but if he actually spent half the post talking about all the reasons he likes her outside of on paper youd be saying hes overcompensating and shes not really that great i think if you described your partner to a complete and utter stranger most would say similar things youre not going to go on about he gives the best head ive ever had youll say things like hes smart funny handsome etc warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is
