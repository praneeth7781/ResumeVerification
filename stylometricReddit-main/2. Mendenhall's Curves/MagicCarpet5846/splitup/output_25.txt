own are driven by him and you supporthelp him but arent the driving force and you said he has insecurities about his appearance but at least now is a good looking wealthy dude this is generally speaking how fairy tale romance ends with him trading me in for a woman half my age stories begin its easy to get sucked into something new and fresh and that feeling of being flattered by being wanted by someone seemingly unattainable now im not saying hes got bad intentions yet but you probably need to be aware that this is a concern like i said you guys should focus on reconnecting and making sure that your emotional bond is strong the gifts are nice and all but outside of material goods make sure you two are in a good place and keeping the flame alive talk to someone about what are healthy boundaries and how you can praise those around you and be generous without crossing a line being with the same person for 30 years is hard and requires a lot of active work to keep that love alive he seems to love you so im sure youll work it out but i definitely wouldnt ignore this out of curiosity is he extremely wealthy because this definitely sounds like looking for an upgrade territory you two probably could benefit from a trip to a couples therapist to discuss appropriate boundaries and how you two are feeling about each other in general and given the vibe im getting from the post a romantic trip to reconnect well technically someone with your correct address on it and not a human beings name on it would qualify unless you think loft on hold is ops next door neighbors name you got the ick once you catch it you only cure it by breaking up and moving on it doesnt typically and it shouldnt if youre unwilling to share the actual life youve built with a person during marriage dont marry them its fair to want to protect the assets given to you by family and assets you gained before the marriage but if you are even worried about sharing the assets youll gain during the marriage take that as a glaring sign that this isnt the woman for you a marriage is merging lives with someone that includes finances well shes 22 and just had a baby so shes hormonal and emotionally immature theyre not exactly a great combo and id take a guess and say it wasnt planned so shes also probably extremely confused on what the fuck she wants to do with her life now if you can reach out to the aunt make sure she has someone in her corner looking out for her she either is struggling with ppd or shes just another young and unprepared mom trying to figure things out and handling it poorly but either way you probably cant fix her so just make sure she has someone around her that is looking out for her honestly fashionova has great jeans for curvy women yikes so in your world a father cant just be a good dad and a daughters preferred parent a judge wants both parents in a kids life but im sure there is a solution in here where they are both in her life just not in a weekly capacity its pretty standard in these situations to spend the school year with the primary custodian and then breaks and summer with the other parent the mom can fly up to see the daughter and the daughter can fly once a month all that combined and thats a significant amount of time between both parents while still respecting what the daughter wants and without expecting her to fly by herself every single weekend controversial but nta your daughter wanted to go with you shes 14 her opinion is going to heavily be taken into consideration even in a court but it should be 1month for a long weekend she can afford to miss a day of school and then she should spend breaks with her mom she still needs to see her mother and get quality time with her but youre right traveling by plane every week is ridiculous perhaps tell your ex shes welcome to fly up as well to spend time with daughter youre making excuses for him and keep focusing on the ex the issue isnt the ex the issue is him and how he reacted to your hurt and not for anything but youve seen how he treated his ex who was his supposed love of his life so why do you think you will end up any differently you wont thats the answer so stop distracting yourself by focusing on the ex and start reflecting on how he is treating you the issue here isnt actually that he called her the love of his life the issue is 1 why is he telling his girlfriend of a year a story of his ex of over a half decade and 2 he responded to your hurt not with compassion and care but with an insult thats the issue youre not insecure any selfrespecting person will question why someone years later is speaking in present tense about their feelings for an ex its just plain idiotic to not see how that isnt a giant red flag so short of your boyfriend being an idiot hes doing so because he either does have feelings for her eh probably not if what youre saying is true even though i do doubt the veracity of that 5 years nc and as soon as he meets you shes begging for him back eh not that convinced or he is unable to take accountability for his missteps and refuses to apologize for hurting you his supposed love of his life thats the issue here thats what you need to be thinking about your boyfriend called you insecure and ridiculous for having a valid concern that anyone with a brain would have frankly you would be insecure if you didnt question him because it would show youd put up with such obvious bullshit nta the reality is you saved m from staying another 5 years and not having a real engagement ring you either got t to take his head out of his ass long enough to realize he cant keep putting off this commitment and expecting m to stay or you havent gotten through to t and now m is realizing that this isnt what she wants after this long with a man either way youre nta and thank you for saying what m was very clearly thinking but was trying to convince herself she was crazy for if she breaks up with t its because of t not you and if anything you saved m from a lifetime of unhappiness with t maybe next time t wont assume he has unlimited time to string along women he loves or he actually proposes either way win win for everyone involved idk man i have to think you enabling him is part of why hes never changed idk what rich people you know but every one i know has a substantial life insurance policy the more money a person has the better and greater the insurance they tend to have i dont know why youd think someone with money wouldnt have massive life insurance and other policies its poor people with families who actually need the money that often have to forgo the backup plan go reread the fourth paragraph of the post its literally right there in quotes and all id probably get your head out of your ass and realize material things dont make someone a good grandparent and who you allow in your childrens life will have a huge impact on who they grow up to be you know your parents arent good people and arent good influences for your children why would you compromise your values and your kids upbringing just so they can have someone well off in their lives i am not it literally says in the post the friend has said op will change her mind on not wanting marriage or kids and will often use the exact words when youre a mom when talking to op about her own pregnancy that is not the kind of shit you do to your friend who 1 doesnt want kids 2 has always supported you and 3 is going through a fresh breakup because of 1 reread the post if that isnt at all clear to you but it is directly in the main post im not making anything up or putting my own spin on anything warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info nta just tell the moh and anyone else who comes for you i have a medical condition sister can decide if me being a bridesmaid in an altered dress or me not being a bridesmaid at all will be the best option for her that is available but i have a medical condition unfortunately what she wants in a perfect world is no longer possible in this world where i have a medical condition if sister has decided shed rather her own family stand beside her than have a perfect photo im still happy to get the dress altered so i can wear it but those are sisters only two options plans change what was an option a few months ago no longer is and thats just a part of life generally when speaking your best friend who has done so much for you talking about her heartbreak and losing someone she cared about because she doesnt want kids is not the time to start bullshit like when youre a mom op doesnt want kids she doesnt need yet another person in her life who refuses to respect the fact that a womans worth isnt solely dependent on their decision to carry a life in them her best friend isnt respecting her or her decisions about her life and her body yeah thats definitely not harsh and frankly id have been way harsher eh you can definitely see cellulite but everyone has it no matter how thin or fat i am i have it its just genetic and even super models have it theyre just better at hiding it like you said nothing wrong with it though since 99 of people have it and all those use this one trick to destroy cellulite for good stuff you see is just a gimmick yes it does so you probably dont want to come to terms with this but your wife isnt over her ex because she doesnt feel the same way about you as she did him shes with you because you didnt leave her not because shes head over heels in love with you if she were head over heels in love with you the same way she was her ex shed have forgotten about him thats often how we really move on from those heartbreaking losses we find the next person that makes us feel the sameeven better sometimes we have relationships in between that we still mourn the ex and we say oh we arent over him were not ready to date anyone else etc etc and yeah in part that is true but also its true that generally you meet that person when you are ready that youre just crazy about and suddenly those dreams stop the tears you barely even remember why you were crying you remember how much better off you are and how wrong that relationship was but instead of moving on from you like would usually naturally do at 18 and finding that person she clearly struggles with rejection being alone and wanting to feel wanted so
