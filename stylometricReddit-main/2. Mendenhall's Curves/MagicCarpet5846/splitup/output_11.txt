we can all see exactly how not true it is that you dont do shit or you could offer one the rich and poor sure better or worse no thats often one or both people being a prick to the other no one stays married forever and isnt a prick to their partner at some point in time if its abuse obviously leave but theres a normal level of married couples are inevitably going to be shitheads at some point you cant just walk away the first time it happens the divorce happened several years before he posted and hes still taking his kids on his time so i dont know if thats a fair comment to make i dont think this is abusive which i think i made pretty clear but i do think op should not back down as shes already said she feels like maybe she should and i also am simply telling her to be hyper aware of if theres any additional red flags i am also one of those people who doesnt like everything to be called abuse so i did say this itself does not mean he is an abuser but its definitely how a lot of people say it starts so shes better off keeping this in the back of her mind and finding nooner red flags than ignoring this one and looking back 5 years from now and realizing it started here its up to you realistically your high school girlfriend doesnt last through college anyway so you can follow the normal path and break up once she leaves or break up now it takes people different times to know if they want to marry someone and marriage is a lifelong commitment he could very well be telling the truth that he isnt sure yet and he may be sure later he also could be hiding a reason he doesnt think he wants to marry you you can try to have a conversation about it he ultimately wont tell you if he doesnt want to i wouldnt ask if you already are fed up with waiting and its okay if after 3 years you want someone who is sure i would personally decide if youre willing to wait for him to be sure or not if you arent everything else is irrelevant and its time to move on if youre willing to wait you need to decide how long youre willing to wait and then its time to sit down and talk to him ask him if theres some concern in his mind that he is keeping to himself if he says no just tell him plainly i understand it takes some people time and i understand marriage is a huge commitment i dont want us to get married unless both of us are sure but im going to be really upfront with you that if by x date next year 5th anniversary 30th birthday whatever line it is for you youre still no closer to being sure about us i cant wait any longer marriage is important to me and while i want it to happen with you im not going to wait around forever for you to feel the same way around me im not going to bring it up further so i dont pressure you into a decision one way or the other but i want to set clear expectations so neither of us are blindsided in the future black white looks cheap and see through it genuinely looks great if youre uncomfortable with the bottoms i would suggest a swim skirt as the flared skirt will really flatter your curves he can talk to her and see what she wants to do like a rational adult find a compromise and see if maybe the fact that theyre on two different continents despite being married is causing her to feel pretty unconnected with him and shes fixating on the wedding as a symbol of their life together who knows but just because he cant give her a wedding doesnt mean he shouldnt talk to her yep i mean im not saying everyone needs to get married but if you see marriage as something that could and should end at the drop of the hat dont get married then theres not really a ton of benefits to marriage anymore and any of them can easily be achieved with a contract that can be unilaterally terminated so if you dont see it as an actual serious commitment through good and bad times dont do it it isnt an excuse though are you trying to tell me you think op did cheat because something was wrong with lauren because thats kinda bullshit too you look amazing in this dress you want to stay because you dont know anything different which is totally normal but youll find much better and be way happier hes getting his phd still and clearly cant afford the wedding she wants so its highly unlikely hes got much to worry about no they make you look incredibly blocky a low rise would look better yeah actually they kinda are marriage rules lol thats the whole richer or poor better or worse health and unhealthy stuff you say when you get married like i said if your rule is any time you do something i dont like im done dont get married seems pretty simple really if you dont see marriage as something worthy of doing the work to preserve dont do it its a lifelong commitment you want to be able to exit easily theres no reason someone needs to get married once you marry someone youre kinda obligated to at least try to work through issues unless it involves cheating or abuse if you think you should just jump ship the moment someone saysdoes something you dont like you probably arent the type who should get married sure it will get harder if they buy a house and have kids together but it isnt going to fundamentally change at this point if they sit down and have a conversation or go to a few therapy sessions first theyre legally married it isnt exactly easy to just move on at this point theyre already legally married lol abandon ship probably isnt the best advice they should at the very least have a conversation about expectations of lifestyle and maybe some counseling sessions is this the same girl you just started dating like a month ago because dude cut your losses you were also dating someone else just two months before this girl maybe take some time alone you seem to be a serial monogamist heres the two most likely outcomes you end things because you can see he isnt equipped to handle dating someone with your impairments or you dont end things and he inevitably gets frustrated and dumps you in a few weeksmonthsyears and then it hurts even more leaving now when its obvious you two arent a good match saves you the additional heartbreak that comes with being with someone even longer when things go south because at the heart of this is he simply doesnt have the patience to have a partner with an impairment like this honestly i can see him being annoyed not many people like being constantly bumped into however that means he isnt right for you he cant handle his space being invaded while hes also stressed or irritated its okay but your discomfort is also 100 valid because even if it isnt coming from a place of violence it is coming from a place of i cannot handle what it means to date you and you deserve someone who can handle what it means to date you you two just arent right for each other warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info people on here have some assbackwards high horse morals the people saying youre an ah are insane if you didnt buy it someone else would have sure you bought the bracelet because it gave you a bit of control over a situation where you dont have much but that doesnt make you an ah it makes you a 16 year old kid who has been tormented and oppressed by people who shouldve been family keep the bracelet say nothing when youve moved out and can objectively assess how you feel decide what you want to do if you miraculously repair your relationship you can always say you found a bracelet in a vintage shop and thought it looked familiar and wanted to give it to replace the previously lost bracelet but theres no benefit to telling them now that you have the bracelet being petty to a racist who has tormented you for years by legally buying a bracelet that was legally sold to a pawn shop isnt an ah move it isnt normal and yes you need to leave you have two children to take care of and this is no longer a safe environment for them its time to find a friend or even contact a church to find someone to stay with file for divorce and start dusting off the resume to find a job you can even look for jobs at day care or a play center if you cant affordfind child care your husband has decided for whatever reason he no longer wants to adult fine no one likes to work but you do not should not and cannot stick around and let him put your children in danger understand youre a mom first and you need to act in their best interest right now and make sure theyre taken care of i respect your opinions on pet care but youll need to respect my ability to make proper decisions about my own pet if you cant accept that we feel differently about this and dont think i should be allowed to interact with my pet as i see fit so long as im not causing bodily harm to her maybe this isnt going to work out we need to be able to respect differences of opinion and you cant expect me to just go along with everything you think i am my own person with my own beliefs just like you nah her parents are right a useful degree will provide a statistically better life for their daughter than a passion degree like history you can be successful with a history degree but youre not successful because of the history degree a majority of the time ive looked up the jobs you can do with a history degree and most of them can use but wouldnt require the degree i think it would be helpful to encourage niece to have a backup plan maybe minor in something she can use if she changes her mind or isnt finding success in history but its also nice of you to support her passions but life is just getting harder for people as time goes on and college degrees are getting less and less useful unless theyre in highly specialized fields spending a bunch of money on a passion degree without a strong plan for the future isnt really advisable unless you have family money to fall back on from an completely pragmatic perspective you can still study what you love while also pursuing a more stable and prosperous career you should be extremely concerned because while this could absolutely be your fianc trying to do something nice and just totally fucking up this is absolutely how and when a lot of abusers show their colors youre planning your wedding he thinks youre trapped and figured you wont leave he starts out small something thats a gift for you planning a honeymoon that will be a show of love hes using manipulative tactics to get you to agree and
