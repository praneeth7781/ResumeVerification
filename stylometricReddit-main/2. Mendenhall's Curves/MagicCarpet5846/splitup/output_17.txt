that person than have to start over at 41 after youve given him another 10 years to tear down your self esteem i mean yeah actually i have when youre in that level of crisis you can make some big strides does that mean everything is totally fine after 11 days no definitely not but you can definitely make enough progress in a few sessions to at a minimum know you both want to and are willing to work on things i doubt they went to 2 sessions and stopped for good it sounds like hes just giving an update on we are working things out and therapy has been helpful which isnt at all unbelievable yes i understood that but im saying youd be surprised just how quickly someone who is now free to do something can suddenly have all sorts of outings lined up she may not as well but im saying dont stay because youre afraid she cant socialize well she clearly can if she wants to did you do the right thing about what exactly she broke up with you for being an alcoholic you are a 28 year old dating a 21 year old no i dont really think you did the right thing and i think she tried to encourage you to be a better person but you can only change if you want to change and so i hope you want to and are able to change because at least at the beginning of your relationship you sounded like a creepy alcoholic dude who went out with someone really young and are surprised they actually have some standards granted her age is showing by not completely blocking you and moving on but its no surprise a 21 year old doesnt think an older alcoholic is really who she wants to spend time with she wants to keep being your friend because bullying you makes her feel good about herself youre the undesirable one of the two of you if you cut her off of course shes going to be upset because if someone like you doesnt even like her what does that say about her now im speaking in her perspective you sound lovely and way too patient here but its clear she only keeps you around because tearing you down and you tolerating it makes her feel that much bigger and better about herself yes you should absolutely cut her off i would simply tell her the next time she says anything even mildly passive aggressive ive tried hard not to say anything because at one point our friendship meant a lot to me but im done being your punching bag and am done with our friendship i dont want to talk to you anymore and i hope you learn to treat your friends a lot better than youve treated me and then block her just block her dont even wait for the reply tell your parents before sending the message so they dont let her in and make sure they support you in this block her on all socials if you think she might be really petty maybe wait for a reply for her to say some nasty shit to you screenshot it for ammo if she spreads rumors about you and then blockmute her at the end of the day thats really all you can do you cant fix her you can only try to make sure someone who cares about her will try to look out for her and idk man seems like her socializing well is the problem here so shell probably be more fine than you realize once she actually is allowed to do as she pleases once shes single exactly and i am sorry that you will need to go through this discomfort if youre able to just remember that it will be better in time and lead to better things nah being concerned about your kids safety is never something i will call someone an ah for much like a similar post the only people who i think are maybe ah is the neighbors who spread around the info that this person was responsible but theyre also allowed to be upset that their kids are losing out on a sweet tradition ultimately if she brings it up again i would just say i heard your concerns about your childs safety and i would never put a parent in an uncomfortable position regarding something so serious that being said it isnt up to me to decide how other parents are going to feel about their own children losing out on a tradition that the neighborhood has always really enjoyed if you change your mind and understand this isnt about luring kids into anything other than a joy of curiosity and exploration of nature im happy to continue but im not going to get involved in others being unhappy with you for this were all adults and can manage our own relationships her friends are fine too just someone you trust who will look out for her if they see her getting worse you arent trying to fix her youre just looking to tell someone youve noticed some things that are concerning and you want them to know in case they see it too so someone can be there for her dont even ask them to get her help just tell them to be on the lookout for any signs hey i totally get it when i was your age i thought that relationship would be my one and only it felt so amazing and like all my prayers were answered and then we grew up and who we were was no longer who we are and it was no longer right i learned so much though and you have too dont lose those principles your grandfather taught you just because something doesnt work out doesnt mean that the idea isnt good life just has other plans sometimes but youll find that person maybe next week and maybe next year or the next decade but youll find them and itll be worth it just remember that the heartbreak will be necessary to find that relationship youre meant to be in yeah this is definitely a case where having only one side of the story means any advice other than talk about it is probably not great he says he feels like shes prioritizing this friend over him but she may feel like he doesnt like when she does anything without him its really impossible to know which person is being reasonable or if maybe theyre both being reasonable but they simply arent compatible regardless of the answer i still maintain showing up when explicitly told not to come is never the answer unless youre looking to end the relationship i would personally reach out to her family instead of her if shes genuinely suffering from mental health issues that are undiagnosed shes unlikely to be equipped to address them if youre close to anyone in her life id just reach out to them right after you end things and say youve ended it for reasons you dont want to get into but you still care for her and want whats best for her and think shes been showing some signs of some mental issues that you dont want to go unaddressed if they persistworsen and thats a 100 understandable reaction personally i think there is a reason most relationships at 18 dont last anyway i know losing a relationship thats lasted this long is still painful but you deserve and will find someone who will not betray your trust like this i wish you well it will hurt but know that good will come from this pain on the one hand i think its pretty difficult to be fully committed to someone for life at 18 on the other hand if she couldnt be satisfied in her relationship just with you she shouldve broken up with you i think you need to ask yourself if you could move on and have a life with someone who did this to you do people change yeah but that doesnt mean she has yet and it doesnt mean just because shes said sorry you need to accept i honestly probably wouldnt do this they need to talk and resolve the issue if i were the girlfriend in that situation id feel like my boyfriend was jealous and controlling and couldnt let me have a trip by myself im not saying thats what op would be doing at all but that is definitely how i would feel if i told my boyfriend i wanted to do this trip alone with a friend and he explicitly went behind my back to be in the same city at the same time i mean just cut contact and tell her before you will discuss anything with her you want to submit a blood paternity test through the lab of your choosing without that retain a good lawyer in preparation for her to sue for child support do not contact her in anything other than writing and do not respond to anything unless its an agreement to take a paternity test but also no offense if you did get her pregnant you deserve the consequences as unprotected sex with a friend youre not attracted to and you know has mental health issues is just plain stupid youre too old to be acting like that i mean would you rather be that girl or the girl who was so afraid of looking like that girl that she allowed her boyfriend to blatantly disrespect her and cheat on her for the entirety of their relationship instead because honestly its way worse to be the second one than the first at least that girl has a shred of selfrespect but right now youre acting like you dont even like yourself idk i wouldnt be able to look at her the same if she didnt give you the money what is a marriage if your word to your partner means nothing if youre already over her what 2448 hours later yeah it was definitely the right call he was on mushrooms thats pretty par for the course with drugs of that nature its rather silly to try to diagnose someone on heavily mind altering substances with a serious mental illness from a reddit post that being said sober or high he doesnt sound like a life partner and if thats what op is looking for shed be best served moving on that wasnt in the post though i did see the comment you mentioned op has fertility issues and will likely need fertility treatments to conceive definitely still a risk but not quite the same risk as would be those otherwise healthy having unprotected sex which for a reference is only about 30 i kiiinda see what youre saying but given most pregnancies in the us are actually unplanned im not fully sure that doesnt add up if anything it totally checks out to me lol it seems to me that bf loves op a lot and wants to spend forever with her on an emotional level hence being okay if they did conceive but as of right now isnt willing to completely and legally tie himself to her until he knows theyre on the same page child support for someone youve never married vs someone you are married to own a home with etc are definitely two very different worst case scenario financial situations if im taking all emotion out of the situation since im sure youre thinking if hes willing to have a child with her why not be willing to marry her and while i definitely personally agree with that thought process know plenty of people who dont well he was with his ex since they were at the oldest 15 it isnt really that surprising
