like saying a golden retriever isnt a dog its a golden retriever cockatiels are parrots what did you think parrots were thats like saying a golden retriever isnt a dog its a golden retriever what exactly do you think a parrot is yeah its more understandable to get a fake diamond than fake shoes lmao girl just admit you fucked up and apologize stop trying to make him the bad guy here it was you all you and just you probably because shes drunk its her bachelorette party and people have been known to cheat during them and an ex came up to her and some really monogamous people can get really honest with alcohol involved so things dont look shady ive definitely done this before and while i looking back know it can seem more sus it really just came from drunk anxiety brain combined with i dont want to feel like im hiding something totally innocent from my fianc alcohol definitely impairs your cognitive skills i wouldnt read into it much unless you think something more serious happened i would definitely tell my partner if i ran into an ex and i would expect them to do the same the alcohol likely just added a sense of urgency to her wanting you to know info do you sincerely believe youll be happy for life with this man if not dont get married i mean if you can afford it sure but at some point you kinda need to start advocating for yourself unless youre really cool spending all this money its okay to just say im sorry but i cant afford that right now i can do without the giftexperiencewhatever it is damn i cant believe ive lived long enough to become the prude but yeah of course your relationship is going to suffer youre asking for nonmonogamy i would assume most men out there arent going to be okay with it personally you sound waaaay too immature for a serious relationship let alone a long distance one but if you want to start making content again you need to tell him and see if hes okay with it if he isnt you need to make a choice him and monogamy or the content and being single its normal for your age but my god are 21 year old males shitheads sometimes answer with a yes or no have you ever had sex with your stepmother dude has about as strong a grip of sarcasm as he does on the meaning of the word emergency then info are you telling me your sister decided she no longer wanted to get married but never communicated this to her fianc and the father of her kids because if so your sister is definitely an ah ok if you think your relationship will be fine both from your and his perspectives then ask him to write up a lease to sign youre better off moving out its not going to do your relationship with him any favors by moving to such a transactional relationship but hes in his right to decide what hell allow in his own home youre 28 you can definitely start to move towards being an independent adult and living your life the way your want to i mean itll shake out however you decide but you have two options move out or dont have your girlfriend over you are aware that your smoking hurts a lot more people than you right thirdhand smoke has been proven to be cancerous youre literally contributing to the death of not only you people around you but also the people who enter a space after youve left so four hours later youre still arguing how come you havent given us a list of everything you do and everything your wife does in caring for your home and your kids clearly you have the time the morals that marriage is a lifelong commitment you shouldnt just make with people before you know who they are and before youre willing to commit to working things out tell me you dont understand marriage without telling me you dont understand marriage people should consider what marriage means before getting married that means both waiting until you know a person well enough to know there arent red flags hidden and it also means being willing to work through the shitty moments if you cant do it dont get married simple anyone you apparently who doesnt see that isnt really my problem enjoy your future divorce if they actually stopped ignoring red flags and putting up with bullshit they wouldnt marry those people in the first place again if thats your attitude dont get married i already made that clear its not like everyone needs to get married but people have stopped taking marriage seriously and thats why divorce rates are so high you want to be able to walk away at the first issue sure go right ahead dont get married then legally and morally are different just because you can divorce someone for the color of their shirt doesnt mean you should if you think marriage is such a temporary commitment dont make it i mean yes if you just assumed he wanted kids that was incredibly presumptuous and foolish of you generally a 38 year old with no kids who wants kids will mention it especially as youre now 35 and thats generally the end of when most people start trying to conceive its also somewhat reasonable for him to assume an older woman with kids who doesnt mention wanting them also would be on the same page with not wanting anymore i suppose realistically at this point you need to do some tough thinking and potentially get your msh levels checked to get an idea on how easy it would be to conceive with someone else if thats even an option and if natural birth isnt possible if youre willing and able to pursue ivf or other means might be difficult for her to see you treating another woman the way she wanted to be treated but clearly wasnt ive seen similar things with women who ended a relationship with someone who wouldnt marry them when they find out the ex is getting married even if the women are in new and fulfilling relationships and no longer have feelings for the ex rejection and feelings of inadequacy can remain long after the love is gone that being said she needs to handle her own shit and not bring it into your life set a clear boundary and if she cant agree time to put some distance between you and her and at custody swap you can send sky in by herself and you can wait in the car to pick her up color is meh to me but the fit and length are actively bad it looks very grandmothers nightgown to me since you love the color this would be a beautiful piece if you took in and shortened the waist and then hemmed it somewhere above your knee whatever your preference i mean probably says you prioritize being in a relationship rather than being comfortable as if i were allergic to an animal that would be the sort of thing i would ask about on a first date and not have a second with anyone with a cat who hurt you its not crazy its totally understandable if i may give you some advice my parents would always tell me if its meant to be itll be but never dull your shine for someone else you can leave and let him sort himself out if he does and the time is right maybe you two will reconnect in the future but if he wasnt meant to be your future youll move on and find that future every time ive been in a similar situation to yours my mom especially would encourage me to remember that if god intends it itll happen now i dont know if youre religious but i do think you will end up where youre meant to be and if thats with him youll find your way back to one another when he is healthier and if you arent meant to be and honestly i dont think you are then you will be freeing yourself to find that path youre meant to walk i know apologies i just would hate to see such a young and vibrant woman with a bright future ruin it because shes willing to sacrifice herself for a man who would never do the same you deserve much more than this nta if they need to crowdsource their wedding they need to downsize their wedding if they dont need to crowdsource their wedding you dont need to celebrate greedy ass people eh of all the things wrong with this dude drinking problem doesnt come to mind if he really had a drinking problem he likely wouldnt feel compelled to hide it from his wife and kids hed just be drunk well youve done the equivalent and then some in this post and all of your comments arguing already so instead of trying to act like youre too good for writing a 7 paragraph comment just do it prove it actually give us the information so we can see everything you do that shows just how much you deserve that break once you do everyones attitude will change and well all see you deserve this break and your wife is asking too much of you trust me its happened before everyone is calling you an ah so if you really think were wrong answering this will make everyone see what you see the only reason you would have for not is because you know damn well it would show just how little you do so which is it are you going to write out everything you do or are you admitting you do jack shit and leave everything to your wife i mean nah she was extremely clear about not being able to handle you with short hair and you agreed i guess you didnt think that would be a dealbreaker and its an odd dealbreaker to have but thats trauma for you personally i would see if you can have a compromise where your hair is a bit longer than it is now but still short ish or you can decide your journey is worth more to you than your marriage thats okay too but you cant have both its either your wife feeling safe in your marriage or your hair short i would personally not want my wife to feel unsafe over something as superficial as the length of my hair but i also wont call you an ah for changing your mind and wanting autonomy on how you look this might just mean the relationship has run its course it isnt your responsibility or fault that shes reacting like this but that doesnt change the reality that shes extremely triggered and a choice needs to be made here hopefully your wife is in therapy though and can speak to them about this and see if she can work through her feelings in therapy out of curiosity why do you want to mend things with an addict who is just using you as a meal ticket you dont mean anything to him youre just a tool to survive right now maybe he once loved you but his addiction has taken away all of his ability to develop a genuine relationship with you youre 25 youd be frankly an idiot to sink your future investing in someone like this indefinitely cut your losses and save yourself well how about this walk me through a typical week be explicit go morning afternoon and evening walk us through what your wife does and what you do make sure you list every chore each of you does then
