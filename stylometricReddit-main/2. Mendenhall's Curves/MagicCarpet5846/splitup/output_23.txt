you and had someone else lined up than deal with being sad and alone people get better as they get older but also plenty dont unfortunately youll experience this again most likely just know its because theyre emotionally immature not because you did anything wrong you were a young vulnerable kid who fell for the wrong guy it happens to the best of us let it hurt and itll be okay in the end that is literally thousands of dollars to do 1500 the cheapest ive seen for an hour hes fallen on hard times and so that would be crazy stupid to do when his brother has a sports car not saying op needs to agree but renting a sports car is insanely expensive and cost prohibitive out of curiosity if its once a month is this the same rough time of month in relation to its proximity to your period because this may also be due to hormone fluctuations which doesnt solve your issue but may also help to 1 combat it and 2 open up the conversation better so he understands its akin to being extra nice to your gf that has a cold ill be clear now be careful of the comments saying your husband is being ridiculous he isnt its fair to want to compromise it is unfair to continue to be mad at him after he immediately understood his mistake apologized took responsibility and attempted to find a solution let go of the angerbeing upset and instead redirect to finding a feasible solution that both of you are happy with it sounds like you plan to do this in a few days time awesome as far as your language no im not trying to find any personal flaws in you it seems youre misreading things i am simply pointing out a focus of your current dialogue is how you are feeling and while i respect the idea you dont want to speak for your husband its coming off as the opposite and to just be aware of this if it extends beyond this reddit post remember to let him decide what he thinks is feasible for himself he may not be sleep deprived at all i need 46 hours of sleep a night to function at full capacity and my partner needs 910 everyone is different so make sure to remember you thinking something isnt feasible doesnt make it true the number of times ive had people tell me they didnt think i could do something that i was already doing is immeasurable at this point i think our conversation has run its course and i dont want to waste anymore of your time as i think this is getting redundant on both our parts good luck and have a lovely rest of the day well 1 hes allowed to make a mistake he didnt realize he was making a commitment of your time and apologized for that at the end of the day he is human and you need to learn to let it go 2 its not really your place to decide what is and isnt a feasible option to him plenty of people absolutely work those hours and more with no issue 3 if he needs to be making phone calls sunday also realistically wouldnt work either but theres going to be a significant amount of admin work that doesnt rely on phone calls unless they run a call center the jobs theyre laying off arent 100 spent on the phone he can take over some of those responsibilities 4 im noticing a pretty heavy trend of i think and i believe remember you are one half of your marriage and just because you dont agree with something doesnt mean you unilaterally get to make that call i never said you took an extreme view i meant the commenters on here take extreme views and just remember that sometimes the echo chamber that is the comments section can be misleading to how things will play out in your actual relationship it sounds like youre open to compromise so hopefully you go into it remembering that your husband gets to decide what is and isnt feasible for him and you get to decide what is and isnt feasible for you and also remember people mess up in relationships i get being upset but he genuinely apologized and made it clear this was unintentional and wants to take steps to find a solution that works for both of you dont harp on the im upset you did the thing in the first place and instead focus on how are we going to find a solution that works better for both of us solution oriented problem solving which im sure an attorney will be beautifully prepared for so good luck yeah i feel like it matters way less what everyone else thinks is normal and way more about what does she think is normal having her ex in her and her familys life and what are you comfortable with clearly youre not comfortable with having the ex in your or your gfs life you are both entitled to your feelings and someone else on reddit agreeing or disagreeing politely means jack shit this isnt our life its yours and your gfs life you guys get to choose how you each want to live your lives if the way you both pick isnt compatible then you two arent compatible and should end things it seems like you arent comfortable with a girlfriend who has a relationship with an ex thats normal and valid however her relationship isnt so abnormal that it would be fair to expect her to cut him out of her life at this point the choices are accept things or leave but you also cant force yourself to accept things like i said there are still other compromises ie if he still wants to help hell need to wake up 12 hours earlier and do the work then that way itll have little effect on your scheduleneeding a nanny as far as your opinion on the business thats fair to consider a long term solution with his parents and have them discuss when enough is enough as a condition of you giving him a bit of time on the weekends but family isnt simply boiled down to numbers even though to you it makes sense to let them just lose everything now because in your mind its an inevitability that isnt how your husband feels its unwise to not at least make the attempt to compromise ie if he wants to do it wake up an hour earlier and then he can do an hour or two at some point on saturdaysunday then its him who is bearing the majority of the burden while youre also being his life partner and supporting himallowing him the ability to do what he feels obligated to do he may be amenable to letting you talk him out of helping now but thats because he still thinks things will work out and hes in new dad mode if his parents are in financial ruin and facing homelessness that could breed a lot of resentment and guilt and at that point youll no longer have any options for recourse other than hope he gets over it like i said people on here will take very extreme views on how you should operate in a marriage and i mean if thats how you wanna be it is your life but its not usually the most conducive to a long term and healthy relationship good luck i know this is a difficult situation to navigate especially while pregnant well heres the reality as much as players mental health needs to be taken into consideration if he isnt able to perform and theres an alternative that can perform he likely doesnt get to make that choice sen upper management clearly wants results as evidenced by syyko being cut mid split and they arent making decisions to spare the teams feelings this isnt a field where you keep your job just because youre well liked if youre not performing well its really unfortunate but more than just tenzs desire to compete is at play here hopefully the decision is mutual because the alternative really sucks for tenz and id love to see him thriving again but is naive to act like him coming back or sitting out is strictly up to him yeah op needs to understand this is who her boyfriend is and i mean i guess he is allowed to be that way he probably doesnt have bad intentions but he is intentionally trying to keep ops hopes low so they dont get crushed and thats not the sort of dynamic for most people dating is an audition process and its okay to say he isnt fulfilling to roles requirements well enough you should really just say how do you feel about marriage and go from there ask her when she wants to get married if shes ready to think about that with you if she is then say i want the actual ask to be a surprise but i want you to love the ring will you go to a few jewelers with me so we can figure out what you like in a budget that will work out of curiosity if hes really that serious about it why doesnt he bring the admin work with him to his job and work on admin stuff while he eats his lunch thats 5 hours of work right there and then he can wake up early and do 2 hours before you and baby wake up sat and sun that means hes still able to help his family and youre able to spend time together no offense but hes allowed to have 8 hours of time to himself maybe not all in one chunk but he can spread it out he may need to give up a hobby of his it isnt fair of you to say he cant help out his parents and while he seems much better than i i would be really really put off if my partner tried telling me i couldnt spend a few hours a week helping out my parents to ensure they didnt lose everything i love my partner but i wouldnt just leave my parents out to dry like that either there are definitely better compromises out there that you guys need to discuss people on here will downvote but just be aware they tend to be very extreme in their advice and rarely go for the more realistic and moderate routes that are required if you actually want a marriage to last look if she learns that trying stuff and ending up in the hospital means you visit her shell keep doing it if you dont want her to do it again you dont visit her you dont call you dont respond you dont engage at all you leave it to her family and her medical professionals to get her the treatment she needs otherwise shell just learn that if she hurts herself enough youll come back i mean unfortunately plenty of women like op who dont think thats a reason to leave so they unfortunately arent even wrong yep 130 is also not even considered a genius its considered gifted and apparently in this case its gifted in being a jerk not to mention a 130 iq isnt high enough for mensa acceptance on either testing scale and genius doesnt start until like 150 so not only are they silly for thinking iq is a good measure of intelligence they are also incapable of accurately even googling the requirements for what they claim to be which inevitably makes me doubt their claims the ones acting like hes a predatory asshole no hes just a regular entitled asshole sure thats in
