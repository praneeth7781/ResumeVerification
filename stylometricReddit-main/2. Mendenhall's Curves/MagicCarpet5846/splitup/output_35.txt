abledidnt want to and against any medical practice policies that you wouldnt be horrified to go to even most fast food restaurants say you cant wear a ring if itll risk tearing your gloves yet op thinks a cardiologist should have worse hygiene than a burger king warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info i mean if you really want to be real the problem is she accepts it unless i missed something i think ultimately the friend simply isnt going to attend op didnt say anything to me that came off as trying to force her to attend without hans just that she cant attend with him as it would make it so the mother of the groom wouldnt feel comfortable attending her own sons wedding right and as long as op isnt forcing the friend to come without the dog and accepts the friend simply will be unable to attend all is well but its completely fair for op to say i fully understand you cant be without hans unfortunately my mil is uncomfortable around even the most well behaved dogs due to her own trauma as much as i would love to have you there i wont ask either of you to be uncomfortable can we celebrate together the four of us you me hans and groom on our own in public yes 100000 but this isnt public this is a private event where she isnt required to attend if she doesnt feel comfortable going without her service animal she shouldnt but to act as though her being able to attend comes before making sure her husband can have his mom at his own wedding is also an odd take i for one would really be second guessing a marriage where my stbw made it so my mother wouldnt attend my wedding she is nta for ensuring her husbands mother feels comfortable at her wedding over her friend however unfortunately this means the friend should simply not go to the wedding its unfortunate but the friend is not required to go to the wedding and her presence isnt a priority compared to her husbands mother uhm yeah actually your post aside it can 100000 be rude to tell someone something objectively true for example you look really fat in that dress can both be objectively true and rude af to say to someone even your tone can take something from being not rude to rude like id say your attitude was for example hey id prefer to go to the movies alone if thats okay but we can have dinner after vs really you cant possibly think id want to go to the movies with you im going alone its true you dont want to go with that person but the first is polite and the second is rude no you may feel you have to move now because youd prefer to run alone if the option is there but definitely understand that thats a choice youre making not being force to make and you can make that choice silently if you feel uncomfortable fine but no one else needs to hear why youre moving just move she most definitely accosted him you can feel she was justified in doing so and therefore isnt an ah for it but she was 100 accosting him for using the treadmill next to her in the future dont say anything just silently move to another treadmill on the off chance that this guy has unrelated reasons for using that particular machine it prevents you from acting rude and even if he did want to impose on you moving without the confrontation will just annoy him and keep you safer i would say if he made a complaint as is youd be partially in the wrong as he does have a right to use the equipment regardless of if there are other machines free without you acting like he was doing something wrong and guys like that are definitely the type to make a complaint so its better to just get up and move rather than confront it either wasnt on purpose in which case confronting him is an ah move or it was on purpose and youll convey the message loud and clear without ever having to interact win win why not just have your sister text her and see if it goes through on her end thats a pretty surefire way to know if shes blocked you that is not true at all that was true in the peak of covid which is no longer really a concern its a tourist economy the lack of tourism is hurting a number of the locals and the ask was strictly because the hospital infrastructure isnt equipped to handle large influxes of inpatient care and being an island in the middle of the ocean alternatives for those who need it is effectively impossible its 30 not 50 theres 14 guests opgroom and i assume theyll have a slightly nicer setup for themselves as itll double as a honeymoon so 2116 13125 an 30 increase if you assume opgroom dont splurge on themselves and if you assume a linear ppp which most likely shed do a double bed and couch setup for the sister and family making it less than other guests which are presumably primarily couples doesnt change it the flights alone on a last minute trip to hawaii are nuts and why spend that much money you 1 dont havedidnt plan on and 2 on someone who really isnt there to celebrate your relationship just wants a free trip im sorry for not inviting you i figured since you said no due to time away from work and difficulty handling the long travel time with the kids that a longer and harder to get to location would be the opposite of easier for you guys but id still love to have you if youre able to join i can send you the flight and hotel details unfortunately you will need to cover your travelaccommodations as the plans i made were based on those who rsvpd yes only and weve already used our budget if you cant spend the money or the time due to it being your busy season i more than understand and hopefully we can get together once things settle down for us both more if you need to think about it no worries just be sure to let me know by whatever date you want so i can make sure to get extra tickets for the activities i planned your bosss success compared to his bosss doesnt have anything to do with the idea that your potential ex may try to sabotage your career you can also give him some benefit of the doubt especially because you still come to the same conclusion if hes being caused such deep emotional distress that hes ask you to quit your job after seeing just how low you were at one point that means you are just as unhealthy for him as he is for you at that point even if hes being totally genuine in his feelings the conclusion is the same i love you and i dont want to keep hurting you but if itll take me quitting my career for you to not be hurt unfortunately at this point its for the best we part ways we both have our demons and it seems like they cant play nice with each other im not giving up my job but i also will not stick around and trigger you either please get some therapy its a life changer if our paths cross one day and were both in a place to lift one another up maybe things will be different but for now i think i should move out so you can focus on yourself and your well being i hope it isnt true but that was my thought as well either that or im unfortunately guessing he probably isnt the cleanest person to live with because i would definitely notice and clean up any blood left on the floor regardless but especially if caused by something i was ashamed of i have no agenda and a number of oops comments have been deletedremoved and show a very different side of oop he was attacking anyone who disagreed with him insulting them and doubling down on the idea that family should come first after being criticized by multiple people it seems his attitude has softened significantly which is good but multiple people on a number of threads have said the same thing the repeated use of the language blood family should come first and calling an obvious abuse victim spineless doesnt sit right with many people the point is the repeated context in which it was used felt less like you shouldnt allow yourself to be manipulated and more like you should simply side with family because were blood and were here first including in the first few comments that were made on this thread thankfully oop has admitted the wording was wrong and emotions were high but i stand by my statement both generally and in the way many felt it was being used in this context and understand you likely didnt see many of oops earlier comments in this thread as he appeared to be deleting them when they werent well received fair always is dangerous language however i believe that when you take a marriage vow you need to be prepared to make that person and family you make together your priority over your blood family i stand by what i say fully it is disgusting to say you think blood family should be the priority its completely fair to say you think his values which clearly his fiance was in direct opposition to should be his priority but how you phrased it is something i disagree with extensively i fully stand by that dont double down on the context as that only implies you do think blood family takes precedence over a life partner which when that life partner is actually in alliance with you is 100 a disgusting statement quite honestly you honestly seemed to have an air of blaming your brother for not sticking with you simply on principle without recognizing the complexities of abuse and that makes can still be victim to toxic relationships im sorry that youre upset i take issue with that but i do thats good you recognize that a healthy partner should always come before blood family the way you wrote that post definitely indicates otherwise im glad your brother was able to see reason and get out of an unhealthy relationship as much as oop was right that this woman wasnt right for hisher brother im surprised no one has pointed out the idea that blood family should always be the priority over your fiance no matter what is also a disgusting view assuming you and your future life partner are aligned in values you should 100 always pick your life partner over blood family the idea that your sibling should be a priority over a life partner in cases other than such extreme hatred isolation and abuse is horrendous and based on how many times oop brought up the idea of he should stand by his blood family makes me feel like this isnt extenuating circumstance and oop just believes this is what you do i hope oop changes their mind before getting into a ltr if theyre interested in them because my heart hurts for all the people out there in unhappy marriages because their partners hold them in second place to mommydaddywhoever else in the name of family sure but that will probably become apparently relatively quickly and can be addressed then as long as youre not depriving
