how you feel leave if you dont like this truth get some therapy but this is definitely an internal issue you need to resolve if youre unwilling to actually put in the effort here and stop just defaulting to see look its not getting better then theres no point wasting either of your time nta just reply back hey dude i didnt drink more than a fifth of a bottle so im pretty sure my share is covered by the groceries i brought for everyone if you want i can send over an extra 10 but i dont want to start a habit of paying for what i didnt use presumably this is student housing where this sort of switching of apartments is common and accepted by the landlord while not how most adult apartment complexes are run its pretty common practice in college towns make a choice you made vows do they actually mean something to you or is it just words you said the grass is greener where you water it if you actually believe marriage means something you go nc and start focusing on your wife and your marriage communication compromise and couples therapy if you can afford it thats the only acceptable answer he makes you a worse version of yourself why would you stagnate yourself for three years only to stay in a relationship with someone who brings out the worst in you no work on yourself heal move on if you two are right for each other youll run into one another in the future but do not plan for it tell him youre not going to wait for him as its clear you two arent right for each other as you are why are you throwing and paying for a baby shower for your friend and giving her no hard budget to follow unless im sorely mistaken on how baby showers work thats not normal this goes in the face of what a lot of people say but this is also one of those rare times when you really shouldnt communicate to death about this if you need to have one more convo where you two both agree you were both asking for trouble and you will both try to move forward then sure but at the end of the day you asked the question if you cant handle the answer thats a you problem not a him problem and beating this conversation to death is only going to serve to kill your relationship even more stop talking about it after the next conversation either the pain will subside in which case awesome learn your lesson or it wont in which case that sucks but youve learned your lesson on how asking stupid questions can ruin a good thing and then both of you should go your separate ways im all for employees not immediately being fired for the smallest of mistakes but i also wish we as a society could move away from the idea that you should be paid for not doing any work and i mean this for the common office worker and the ridiculously overpaid executive that just golfs all day earn your money it isnt that hard you keep saying i understand if its because of my tardiness and then proceed to not understand that shes cutting you because of the tardiness and because you are stressing her out and trying to make things about yourself and your feelings rather than trying to make things easier for her which is what being a bridesmaid is actually about accept the fact that you messed up and arent in a position to adequately fulfill the role of a bridesmaid and gracefully apologize to her im sorry that i made your wedding about me that was wrong i get why you would be less stressed without worrying about me in the bridal party im still excited to see you get married and i hope you can forgive me because i dont want my bullheadedness to ruin our friendship because if you dont accept your mistakes and you decide not to go youll lose this friendship and it will be because youre unable to put your friends feelings on her wedding day before your own yta a large one if i were your friend id be glad if you didnt go so i could quietly bow out of a friendship with such a selfish person not only that but im pretty sure op is the mean girl the bride said please just accept my decision and lets move on i know thats hard for you to do which says pretty much everything about who op is as a friend and thats before you factor in that the bride correctly calls out op for only caring about herself and not the brides stress and claims that the bride brought up being late as a reason even though it was actually op that straight up asked if it was because of being late to the bridal shower when in reality it was three times during one weekend one time 2 hours late one time 4 hours late and who knows how late she was to the third event she even needed a plan to get her to show up early to the wedding with someone which means its not just feeling off but a general lack of respect for anyone other than herself she also kept saying shed understand if its because of how late she was but then also proceeds to text paragraphs about how hurt she is make half a dozen reddit posts with varying levels of information included to obfuscate her wrongdoings and even flat out denies being late in one of the posts as saying the bride is making it up op you need to do some deep reflection here because youre misrepresenting things heavily and someone who cant take accountability and blames others isnt a good friend or frankly a good person you said you would understand if shes cutting you for being late and she obviously cut you for being late so tell her you understand and are still happy she even wants you at her wedding because if it were me i would be glad you were debating not going so i didnt have to figure out how to polite ghost you thats fair the few times ive ever needed to sob i wore myself out within like 10 minutes maybe 30 if im assuming i grossly am miscalculating the time but i couldnt even physically imagine sobbingscreaming for 90 minutes and still being able to effectively breathe at that point i get stuffed up and a migraine so quickly when i cry also remember if youre basically preparing for them to be unhappy either way might as well wait and enjoy the peace while you can its not like theyll be happy if you tell them early youre just making yourself unhappy all that much sooner and in that same strain plenty of addicts need to cope by completely and totally removing their vice from their life if op has moved forward through moving on it may be true that regardless of the amount of progress made now that this friend needs to always remain in the past much like you would never tell a coke addict they can probably handle having coke in their life again it may be a similar situation here its okay to have limitations it doesnt mean you arent reformed eh it isnt fair to think people can say thats enough with emotions but you definitely can control if youre sobbingscreaming vs just crying uncontrollably and maybe heavy breathing ive had those days where i cant stop crying for hours at a time but silently nta but also you may be shooting yourself in the foot here what does your lease say are you responsible for the rent unless she finds someone else to takeover because if youre on the lease its still your responsibility regardless of if you live there or not i mean yeah personally if my partner was considering ending our relationship because of issues especially something legitimate that ive been doing i absolutely want to know who the heck would genuinely say theyd actually prefer to be left in the dark and give up the ability to save their marriage just because theyre afraid of a hard conversation pretty much everyone ever that i have known who was blindsided wishes their partner wouldve just said when they were starting to think of leaving so it could be fixed good actual communication can overcome way more relationship issues than people give credit to ok so talk to her about that you dont see the blatant hypocrisy in your statement youre just as guilty of the same things she is youre trying to leave her in the dark over a huge thought youre having rather than just telling her what youre thinking stop that be better yeah if youre that bothered youre updating your facebook status in the bathroom my comment stands op was bothered enough to take action if theyre that easily bothered they arent compatible with small office culture unless youre in a mega corporation generally small offices will have talks like this especially since its incredibly benign to say something along the lines of thank god he was looking out for my husband it isnt exactly a controversial statement even atheists often use that sort of language that isnt really true if you cant handle having or even hearing any sort of conversation that isnt strictly about work and nothing else not even something as meaningful as a cancer scare then you need to go work in a giant conglomerate where coworkers arent actually meant to be people and are just meant to be cogs in the machine everywhere else though coworkers are often some form of friends even if its only during work believe it or not but it isnt u professional to have a discussion about a coworker you have a relationship with it isnt like they were trying to convert op they were simply discussing their experiences and how they felt luckylooked out for that their husbands mass was found early maybe a pea coat or a trench would give you what youre looking for but can still have a fitted waist to give you some shape it may just be the dress you have underneath but this doesnt work for me you look like youre drowning in so much fabric or even just dont put glasses on the floor theres obviously a side table right nearby im not sure why this is even a habit at all let alone the act of leaving them the issue isnt really her forgetting the glass out because she does all the chores and people are allowed to forget things once in awhile but also just dont put your glass on the floor and then when you forget it out itll be on the table and not a tripping hazard or he just got fed up and she refused to take any form of accountability and just shifted blame so he decided to leave im not saying either of them are totally at fault but lets also not act like either of them is totally blameless either id say its way more okay to have a half cup of coffee next to the laptop if youre working in the living room than it is to leave a glass of water as a tripping hazard in the direct foot path of people in the house if youre in the wrong for anything its that youre not taking it badly enough thats just how bad it is what he said as much as it was obvious he wasnt performing to standard today i also want to remind people he is a real human being and likely is worried
