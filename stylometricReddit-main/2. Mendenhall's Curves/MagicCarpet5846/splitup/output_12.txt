punishing you after you push back the punishment is the biggest red flag here he may have always treated you amazingly but just keep in mind that no one who ends up in a toxic or otherwise abusive relationship started that way it started out great and then one day something small happened that changed things and they didnt notice and went along with the pressure because they felt like they were wrong as their perfect partner had never reacted this way before and then once theyre really and truly trapped the ugly truth shows itself just be extremely careful and aware moving forward im not saying your fianc is an abuser but i am saying this is how it starts so watch out for any other red flags and do not back down seeing how he handles you firmly telling him no absolutely not and you better walk the fuck back from the you dont trust me language will tell you everything you need to know on if this is a marriage that is even safe to proceed with good luck be careful keep your eyes wide open yeah im way more worried that this would set a precedent for do you trust me to be used as a manipulation tactic to get op to do things she doesnt want to do or isnt comfortable with in the future yeah i meant it both ways the post says they have a date night once a month due to funds yet theyre both doing things separately multiple times a week but also he says they dont ever do expensive hoohar because he doesnt want to spend money in this climate which is valid dont go into debt but it doesnt sound like this is we have absolutely no money it sounds like im prioritizing saving money over facilitating a long lasting and deep foundation to my relationship and in that case its important to ask is a few extra hundred dollars in savings worth a clearly deteriorating relationship with your oh because if this rut is kicked off by the lack of experiences together which based on his comment to her seems like the case the few hundred dollars really might be the difference between her feeling happy and content in her relationship or feeling like he stopped trying to court her or to put effort into their romantic relationship as soon as they had a kid i get wanting to save for your kid i do really but its definitely cheaper to have one household than two its cheaper to just take care of the relationship than pay for therapy once its on the brink of demise personally i am of the mentality that i would rather have my partner than a few extra hundred dollars and i also want to have these memories with my partner lol classic redditor purposefully and completely missing my point no i dont but if you hear your partner saying they feel youre in a rut and dont do anything to change things and bring a spark back dont be surprised if they fall out of love sweet gestures are a really great way of making someone feel loved and guess what even a few hundred dollar dinners is way cheaper than marriage counseling will be if you do nothing until youre on the brink of divorce its a fashion advice sub and just an fyi saying a cut isnt flattering to someones figure is not a comment on their figure its a comment on an article of clothing shes got a perfectly finereally nice figure its the dress that is puckering weirdly which may be resolved by ironing it like i suggested take the overly offended attitude elsewhere definitely iron it but the cut isnt very flattering on your figure it tapers in at the hips and emphasized your midsection what the fuck why would you encourage him to make it work with a cheater the time for changes is done once cheating is involved its over the other person made their choice of course sexual incompatibility is a good enough reason to break up youre 20 years old this is the time for you to go out have a bunch of sex figure out what you want in life and then hopefully find it and settle down in a few years or a decade or whatever if thats what you want please do not stay in a relationship that you arent fully and 100 intensely satisfied in when youre so young it gets worse as you get older and stay with people longer its already wrong it will not become right by staying you should find a new place to stay once your lease is up and once youve signed a lease sit her down and explain to her you dont think the relationship is working long term and youre moving out at the end of the lease give her enough time to find a place but not so much time that it becomes super awkward to live together you should offer to sleep in the living room unless you have a 2 bd apartment but youre 20 so i highly doubt it and do not renew your lease even if you foolishly imo decide not to break up with her you should ask to move out ill say it op handled this like shit and if he wants to stay with this woman until his daughter does move out he needs to hear his partner out ask her what shes missing what can add the spark back or offer some couples therapy and we dont do that expensive hoohar sounds like a big part of the problem i often ask myself is saving a couple hundred dollars worth losing something else i really care about if the answer is no spend the money buy a beautiful bouquet of roses once a month take her out to a really expensive restaurant buy a little heart shaped necklace theres so many under 500 things you can do that are lavish and memorable and really show spontaneity and care nta watching 4 children whos father is dying and 2 which you used to be a step father to is not a good idea if anything happens with these kids itll be on you from a liability standpoint watching 5 kids including a newborn is not a smart idea stand firm and hey even offer to take your son full time im sorry for whats happening with husband but i am unable to take your other kids i would be willing to take my son full time if that would make things easier for you to arrange child care for the other four but thats the extent im willing to go to help out i suggest you look into getting a baby sitter who can take them on short notice and i hope husband gets well soon and fyi if you want more time with your son go petition the court to have full custody right now citing the cancer and frequent hospital stays as the reason explain it would be better for everyone involved if your ex didnt have to worry about another kid right now and if your son could have some stability and not be around such a heavydepressing topic this also makes no sense like every single 28 year old male needs to be in a relationship i know plenty who are and have been single for years nta you arent financially able to help them if this fund is the only money you have because it sounds like you live paycheck to paycheck youre unable to help them its not as though theres a few million in that account its likely a few tens of thousands or maybe low 6 figures which is nice sure but thats barely a down payment on a house nowadays being able to afford it financially means i can pay for everything i wantneed comfortably and still have tons of money left over that i will never even notice that is obviously not the case here they seem to already be dragging it out op posted 3 months ago about not being ready to move and settle down with g and have kids and get engaged after 10 years together if youre not sure you want to marry someone after 10 years man you dont want to marry them and she clearly wants these things and yet despite everyone telling him to break up then he clearly didnt i hope op gets his head out of his ass because hes being incredibly selfish and destructive and potentially going to bring a very expensive life into this world that he clearly doesnt want with a woman that he clearly doesnt like and isnt committed to i have a few questions after 10 years together why arent you two married do either of you want marriage do you even want to get over what she said this relationship sounds really wrong for both of you she said shes disgusted with your body thats not the sort of thing you forget did you mean what you said when you insulted her intelligence is this because shes only interested in seemingly shallow hobbies like reality tv do you want kids because if you dont want kids where you would find a woman who wants kids after you break up with g then do not have a child with g kids needs to be a two yesses decision and if its not a yes without the threat of a relationship dying over your head its not a yes at all fairly certain if he were thinking with the penis instead of the brain he would be out fertility treatments are definitely the least sexy thing a person can do and most of the time you actually arent having much if any sex during them well you can just say that straight up asking me to cut off my best friend because my bil knowing decided to date her is controlling and isolating and im not tolerating this if it were up to me i was never comfortable with them dating in the first place as that puts me in the middle way too much i told you very clearly i am not getting involved if you make cutting off my best friend for doing nothing wrong your hill to die on then we might as well start planning the funeral because i am not going to be pressured into playing this game relationships end he knew she was my best friend if he was unable to handle that fact he should not have dated her this is solely bils cross to bear they were together for 6 months and its clear he came off way too intensely and scared bf off so of course she didnt need very long to fully mourn their relationship i hope i am making myself perfectly clear that i find the implication i cut my best friend off incredibly toxic and if given the choice i am cutting off the toxic people in my life and right now that is not best friend you are very very very obviously not over the rejection you need some serious therapy and get to the place where you can drop the rope youre running around trying to fix everyones problems at the cost of yourself because you are hoping this will finally make your blood family see you as important to them stop they dont they are using you because you consistently begged them to let you be used by them for validation if zach doesnt want to care for his dad guess what your dad reaped what he sowed by neglecting his other kids do not take care of your father stop spending all of your money buying a ton of gifts it isnt getting the
