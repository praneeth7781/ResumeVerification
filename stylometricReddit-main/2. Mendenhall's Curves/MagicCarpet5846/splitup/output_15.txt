you your past and is happy with just your friends this is not the proper takeaway yta dont give expensive gifts if it has strings attached yes expecting a hand written thank you note is a string i guarantee you none of them give a shit about a 300 pen i dont really think its healthy to imply a 21 year old should made huge decisions on their life trajectory based on a teenage sweetheart when i was that age my parents drilled into my head make the decisions you want to make for your future never consider your partner if its meant to be it will be and if it isnt meant to be then you havent changed your life for someone you arent meant to be with and thats 100 accurate at 21 implying hes somehow wrong for moving and following his life path because his girlfriend is elsewhere is shockingly naive and obtuse you uh you know exaggerating is just a roundabout way of saying im a liar and everyone already knows me as a liar so shockingly they thought i was continuing to lie because it made a good story in all fairness its stupid to assume everyone is an exception to the most logical conclusion how about he goes with a family member or friend instead he wants to go and has already put the deposit down if he goes with someone else itll only be 5k total and then it wont be a waste and you wont need to fee terrible on your own vacation then he can go and find someone to go with him yeah i think overanalyzing the nuance of is this just a 23 year old male who is uncomfortable with heavy topics and using humor to break the tensions vs is this person a covert abuser waiting to happen isnt worth it whatever the answer is its perfectly clear that this guy isnt giving op what she needs to feel heard and to feel safe and at that point trying to figure out the exact motives and reasoning behind the action just distract from dealing with the action itself and dealing with it should just be washing her hands of the relationship and leaving very normal also very normal and necessary for op to step in to explain the behavior while normal is unacceptable its how we learn and grow into hopefully functional adults info how old are you because its pretty clear youre at most 23 and have no actual understanding or experience with teenagers and young adult males who think once they turn 18 they no longer need to follow rules the only thing being left out is people with actual life experience and knowledge of what teenagers are like weighing in everyone here saying theres something being left out no way an 18 year old would just be an ah for no reason have no idea that all those times you thought you were justified in your anger at 18 nah just an ah dont worry you usually grow out of it yeah im genuinely so over this trend of theres clearly more to the story youre not telling me on posts like okay buuuut maybe just comment on whats in the postcomments instead what exactly is the timeline here because im confused why youre posting now this sounds like something you found out a long time ago a lot of people on here are very biased against men and also seem to think reasonable compromise in a relationship is a read flag which is simultaneously shocking and also not given how immature a lot of people on reddit seem to be work comes first but this wasnt a choice of working or gaming it was a choice of only working or getting to do both how do you come to the conclusion that he needs to let her work using his equipment rather than her just working on her laptop in the kitchen or bedroom anyone who works from home and has a laptop has used their laptop as a portable computer for work thats the whole point shes just unwilling to compromise or suffer the least bit of inconvenience nta maybe it was as hard for your parents as it was for you it wasnt but lets just say maybe they put themselves in that position you had no choice in the matter why on earth would you subject your child to that same lack of autonomy over their situation do not get a pet if youre so weak willed to rehome them at the behest of a partner simply because they want you to these are living creatures not toys you can just shuffle around as is convenient just tell them straight up yes im absolutely leaving him for a better lifestyle i deserve way more than a cheating distant husband this has nothing to do with money and everything to do with me knowing my worth if stbx thinks thats abandonment then what does he think he has done all this time hes been stepping out on our marriage theres nothing to indicate that theres no mention if op wanted to live with her father no mention of if he paid child support and no mention of if she asked and was turned down to moving in with her father with the absence of any of that information it can only be concluded that she moved out because she wanted to allow her mother to downsize at 18 not because she was kicked out and her step sister never did because they simply live different lives its also not his kid he doesnt have unilateral decision making on kicking out the step sister obviously at 31 hes okay with it but lets not act like her actual birth mother whose home it also is doesnt have a say in allowing her daughter to live there yeah yta you shouldnt resent your father or your step sister for having more than you do you really want to be a 31 year old still living at home if youre still harboring issues over this more than a decade later its time for professional intervention it isnt normal and its hurting your own well being to be resentful over someone having something you didnt have thief is the comparison of joy and you and your step sibling are different with different experiences why didnt you spend any time with your father did he pay child support did you ever ask to move in with him maybe if he said no to you moving in with him after turning 18 i could understand some amount of resentment but at some point you shouldnt resent a 31 year old who still lives at home without any indication of your father very pointedly and directly telling you he wouldnt give you further assistancewouldnt allow you to move in with him you have no basis to resent him and need to understand that your situations are both different and it is also her mothers home and her mother likely has a large say in allowing your step sister to stay in the home for so long the road to hell is paved with good intentions just because you didnt intend to hurt her does not change the fact that you did hurt her stop acting as though not meaning to means you didnt hurt her you hurt her start from that fact and figure out how to make up for it if its even possible seems like in trying to demand everything youll end up with nothing so its a sin for you to live with the person youre going to marry but not for him to live with someone hes been dating a quarter of the time that math doesnt add up ill also point out something when you discovered what her job was she had already started an only fans and the content was out there forever if her current partners have an issue with her career in the present tense she can quit now and this will no longer be an issue if the issue is she ever was a sex worker though no matter what you did in that moment at 18 she still would have been a sex worker for most people its a binary issue have you ever done and regardless of if youd managed to get her to stop that day at 18 the answer would still be the same yes so your supporting her career choice or not supporting it wouldve had no impact on future relationship especially if she has since quit because what she will tell future partners is the same now as it wouldve been then when i was younger i did some sex work i did it for xyz reasons i regret it and im no longer doing it but i want to be upfront so if thats a problem for you we dont waste our time theres a difference between telling someone not to cook ever and saying dont do something you know youre terrible at as a present for your husbands birthday you really have to know that theyre not the same right if she wants to do that have it be a random tuesday or idk practice until she can make something edible its not really the thought that counts if the thought it im not going to put any effort into getting good at this before giving you something i know youll hate but expect you to pretend to love it anyway he hardly did it intentionally its the same situation where someone seeing cant wait to have you inside me again on their partners phone when cleaning up the bedroom isnt snooping if they look at the text chain to discover an affair i mean it nicely but he didnt snoop you knew he was in the room and you were within earshot if there was a breaklull in whatever he was listening to unless he has professional audio equipment most headphones are far from 100 noise cancelling he heard you talking about him and curiosity got the better of him thats just like when a woman sees an inappropriate text pop up on their partners phone and opens it to find them cheating theyre not snooping or invading privacy in that case and unfortunately i dont think he was invading your privacy here this is sorta a situation of what did you expect would happen if you were talking about your partner in a less than ideal way with him within earshot this happens all the time where one person talks smack thinking someone isnt within earshot and then they are the added context of being in a therapy session really doesnt change the lack of betrayal here if anything hes likely feeling quite betrayed have you discussed any of these issues with him or is this the first time hes hearing you might have some doubtsbe afraid of incompatibilities im not trying to make you feel badly we need therapy and safe outlets to work through our feelingsvent but if youre unable to do a session aloneaway from someone you know you really shouldnt mention them i cant reasonably say a 24 year old dude who tried not to hear and then heard you talking about him unfavorably was betraying your privacy by listening in for 2 minutes and then deciding not to and to just talk to you about it instead relationships require communication and this does sound like a fair point of discussion in a relationship having kids is a privilege not a right and its something that honestly with how overpopulated most of the world is most people shouldnt have kids they already had 3 there is no need for them to have had a 4th or 5th kid seems like a lot of people are acting
