show when the copy was created ultimately he either trusts her or he doesnt and i would understand him not being able to trust her ive definitely had this happen if all youre referring to is the date it says when you click on the video sometimes its smart enough to know when the photovideo was actually created and other times it just is whatever the date i saved the videophoto funny because i expect it will go exactly as she expects sex work is a hard line for a lot of people and hes conservative it doesnt take a genius to figure out more likely than not hes not going to marry someone who was a sugar baby it sucks but 1 this is why its important to choose someone who have values compatible with you and your life and 2 the sugar daddy has her number its clear that he isnt above searching her up as soon as he realizes shes married itll come out and its way better for her to get broken up with now 2 years and no commitments in rather than divorced in a few years when theres a house marriage and kids on the line we all make choices in life as much as i believe people can change sometimes those choices will always have consequences but its better to be with someone who accepts everything about you rather than be with someone who you know would leave you if they knew the real you like you said i knew if i told you you would have left shows just how selfish a person really is and frankly means they probably havent really changed as much as they tell themselves if it helps tell yourself youre also going this for her she needs to be able to sort out her relationship issues without you in the picture and its clear that unfortunately youre a stressor and you get the added bonus of doing this for you too because no one deserves to be harassed or name called and remember this isnt your fault okay but stop explaining it and justifying it this is what hes going to do he wants to live with his mom and he wants you at 23 years old to support his mom and him remember easier to leave a mommas boy than divorce one hes a mommas boy you arent going to change that he isnt ever going to pick you over her this is the reality instead of wasting all of your energy justifying explaining and defending what you know spend your energy figuring out what you actually want to do is this a life you want youre on reddit looking for advice so clearly some part of you is fed up i would be honest with yourself if you really think this dude is worth a lifetime of being second place you got together at 1517 ill let you in on a little secret the guys youll find now as a fully independent woman with the world at her feet will be a million times better than the guy you found when limited to your math and english lit classroom youre in the prime of your life at the ideal age to find a way better partner both on paper and in how he treats you know your worth for both of your sake walk away now you still love her so maybe your relationship will heal but if you keep letting her in your life the friendship will sour even more than it has not only will your presence bring up some obviously repressed issues in their relationship but the chances are someone is going to say something unrecoverable neither of them is ready to deal with the fact that dude isnt straight take a step back if you love her let her sort her relationship as youre clearly putting strain on it if you love yourself take a step back because youve been groped and harassed repeatedly and you dont deserve that you do not ever need to accept someone making you feel unsafe i wish you luck i hope she realizes how shitty shes being but do not stick around as if you do youll always be the scapegoat i speak from experience walking away is the best thing for everyone involved keep in mind and im not defending her at all she needs to come to terms with her boyfriend being predatory unfaithful and at least partially a different orientation shes probably struggling with the reality of what she just witnessed actually means and thinks its easier to blame you than deal with things this isnt right this isnt your fault you need to drop her because this isnt right but maybe in the future shell get her head out of her ass and apologize because every one of us including her knows that youre telling the truth and youre not making a mountain out of a molehill shes just hoping she can make a molehill out of a mountain because she doesnt want to accept her relationship is over its up to you if you ever want to entertain a friendship ever again no one blame you if you dont but its pretty clear shes heavy in denial this is your life you only have one it is yours to do with as you please if you want to stay stay if this is who you really want to spend your life with thats a choice you can make but remember no one else should have any say in your life because at the end of the day you need to live your life no one else this guy cheated on you call a spade a spade he lied to you fucked other people manipulated you and got others around you to manipulate you too stop saying he technically did nothing wrong he did he knows it and you know it if he didnt do anything wrong are you telling me lying isnt wrong because he lied to you every day he told you you were the only one its foolish to keep writing things off if hes still unwilling to say i lied i knew what i was doing was wrong and i lied because i knew youd leave otherwise then theres nothing to even save to be fair op seems to have things confused it wouldnt be her leaving if she crosses the boundary itll be him leaving it seems like hes making baseless threats and she knows it hopefully op is prepared to actually walk away otherwise hes setting himself up for a very dark future well actually plenty of nutritionists do advocate for intermittent fasting so the idea that her skipping breakfast means she doesnt understand balanced eating is also absurd its actually a rather old take that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and now theres a much better understanding that nutrition isnt a one size fits all and what works for some might not work for others that being said yes they cook together and she said she monitored the calories and was still gaining weight given that she ruled out medical concerns it would lend itself to he may be doing something while you arent look unfortunately there have been a few posts of feeders who have purposefully made special condiments with huge amounts of calories to stealthily add to their partners meals not saying i really think thats whats happening here but i am saying i dont think op has all the info here while i understand what youre saying she did minutely track her calories so she clearly does understand just how many calories are in what shes eating as nowadays people use an app where you just look up the item and amount and even while tracking she wasnt losing weight which would indicate he may have been doing something to her food while she wasnt looking arranged marriages across continents is just plain risky i understand your faithculture but speak to a match maker or at the very least limit yourself to people you can actually meet in real life the nature of an arrangedaccelerated marriage like youre discussing is going to lead to people ditching you as soon as they think they may have a chance at an even slightly better prospect which realistically thats my guess what happened thats probably unlikely to be an option he has no leverage his dad can pretty easily say marry her before you start the next year or i wont pay tuition do so with the primary goal of you arent giving up your children and you arent allowing them to move anywhere far away i assume that especially being well off half a house and half your savings account isnt worth losing your 4 kids right because ultimately shes never getting child support if she has more money and you have your kids half the time so telling you she wont ask for child support is just emotional manipulation at that point because it wouldnt be something she would get anyway as you dont want her to have primaryfull custody just a heads up there are a lot of people who actually stay with someone they know will be vindictive if they break up because theyre afraid in the back of their head of facing the vindictive ex and figure its easier to deal with whatever the relationship brings yes but she specifically said she was looking forward to them cooking together more often not him cooking for her so youd generally think that that means she can see what hes doing and if shes an athlete she would understand that shit ton of butter means shit ton of calories i totally understand most people dont understand how many calories are in fats like butter but i would expect more from someone who says she eats healthy and is an athlete of a decade well elaborate on the conversation be blunt we met when i was getting out of a sexless marriage im afraid this is a sign our marriage is taking the same direction i hope im wrong but as my husband its both of our responsibility to discuss this as a couple if youre stressed we need to work on things together because i am not prepared to stay in a relationship where excuses run rampant and i feel tossed to the side im happy to work with you but this is something we actually need to talk about you two werent married he didnt commit to stay through thick and thin you both committed some acts that would warrant the other ending the relationship name calling is a pretty fast relationship killer and you said you have a pattern of namecalling now that isnt to say he was an amazing partner he also wasnt but just because you stayed in a shitty relationship doesnt mean he is under any obligation to i think people get this twisted idea of if i stay when you suck you need to stay when i suck but no putting up with bullshit doesnt buy you the ability to also act like that you two clearly never had a fantastic foundation for a relationship and that might be because the two of you dont mesh well or it might be because thats just how he treats the woman hes with either way as much as it hurts be thankful because this wasnt the right guy for you and its pretty obvious you werent going to end it he bit the bullet for you both and did what everyone else can see was the right call it sounds like he honestly never liked you very much and you always put up with less than you wanted because you thought you could convince him to change for you heads up if you
