other reasons at some point you may need to accept you two are two puzzle pieces from completely different sets that you keep trying to force together that were just never meant to you dont seem to have a lot of the necessary fundamentals for a long lasting relationship and then on top of it theres issues of trust and intimacy building up with it theres only so much good communication can fix and you may need to take a good hard look and see how much of these issues are just who you each are and how you two dont work together that honestly means that while the road ahead will be tough and filled with work you two will likely figure this out try to hold onto that hope while you two are navigating the road ahead it may get worse before it gets better because both of you two are clearly on wholly other planets right now but he wants to try and you want to try both of you are willing to genuinely give therapy a try and communication can almost always be improved with hard work and honest selfreflection in some ways you two have already overcome the hardest obstacle deciding to make it work yike im not trying to normalize it no but i am trying to say dont make a judgment strictly about a persons age when if you eliminated the age their feelings would be totally valid because his feelings are totally valid the age gap isnt the issue here look man if you wanna be prejudiced against people how about you say it with your whole chest because otherwise ill continue to look at the actual behavior of the individuals before making someone out to be predatory dont be too hard on yourself your future is so important and as much as it sucks this didnt work out there will be other guys out there your story isnt uncommon at all i did a similar degree and at the start a lot of our class was in relationships and within that first year unless the couples were already engagedmarried not many were able to survive the stress of being a full time professional student not for anything but thats not really an accurate contextualization either most 28 year olds have an established career already its a fully fledged adult and you have been at that point for a few years 40 also isnt really middle aged and if it is its only barely youre naturally trying to make her seem younger and him older but at this point the differences in their age are nowhere near that of a 20 and a 32 year old and again he isnt at all saying she cant do anything outside of him its just a simple fact that its really hard to make meaningful time for a partner when youre doing a medical degree and working full time and still managing to work out and take care of yourself please stop trying to make this about his age almost any other 28 year old would have similar feelings here its completely normal to feel this way in a relationship where your partner is either unable or unwilling to give adequate time to the relationship i dont understand why youre trying to make this about some weird power dynamic when anyone who has gone through a professional degree like nursing doctor lawyer knows that half of your class starts out in a relationship and by the end of that first year a whole heck of a lot of them are newly single because they just cant devote enough time to the relationship to make it work the age gap isnt actually the problem if anything its op thats the problem as she really doesnt have the time right now to properly maintain a relationship and thats why she totally made the right call in recognizing that and recognizing her partner was unhappy and it was unfair i think youre being way too heavily biased by the years theyre born for once i dont see this as an issue of age believe it or not adults partake in the same hobbies at all ages so take age out of the question if these two were the same age you wouldnt really be saying that its completely normal for him to feel alone and unloved in a relationship where they see each other once a week live a decent drive apart and shes going to school in a difficult program while working full time that means she really doesnt have a lot of time to give him and frankly very few people are okay with having a partner with so little time to spare and who blatantly says you arent as important to me as schoolwork even if true and i agree prioritize school that is a statement that is going to sting and be really hard to maintain a positive and supportive relationship with someone he isnt demanding she drop out he is just voicing his extremely valid feelings its hard to imagine anyone wouldnt feel abandoned and unloved in a relationship like op is describing and its understandable that he would struggle to be really supportive while also balancing his career and his own emotions about the relationship op certainly isnt emotionally supporting her ex so its not really hard to see why he wouldnt be emotionally supporting her now shes not in the wrong she needs to focus on school and build her career but that also probably means she needs to do it while single until she actually has enough time to devote to a relationship because just like she needs to spend a lot of time on school you also need to spend a lot of time cultivating a loving and healthy relationship she made the right choice to end things not because of his age but because she doesnt have the time and he was rightfully unhappy with the dynamic it happens op handled things incredibly maturely not surprising since she isnt exactly young and i say this because someone is saying he groomed her at 28 you may want to discuss a prenup if you havent already you two still love each other and want to spend your lives together and shes already looking to maximize her profit at your expense god help you if you two ever dont love each other shell take you for everything youre worth and then some you may trust her now when youre happy but prenups plan for the messy end not the happy beginning so be forewarned make sure you have a solid plan in place for where you will go and who will be there to support you first make sure all of your documents are out of the house and have an overnight bag ready to go and a place to stay before you broach the conversation have a friend who will be on standby in case you need them hes threatened self harm so if that doesnt work he may become aggressive towards you then you just wait until hes home and hasnt had a particularly bad day at workschool and say we need to talk about our relationship because i dont see this working out long term we have different views on sex and you have needs around intimacy i cant meet and im uncomfortable with the expectation physical intimacy needs to lead to sex or else youll be frustrated or unsatisfied its better for both of us to find partners who are on the same page as us with our love languages we need to figure out who will move out when if you have bills that you share whatever joint responsibilities you two have because i think its time for us to part ways i really do care about you but this dynamic isnt good for either of us if he begins to beg just say i know this is really difficult and its difficult for me as well but its clear that after 6 years together we arent right for each other i dont want our fear of the unknown to keep us from actually finding a relationship where we can each have our needs met both of us deserve that and my decision is made i am not open to working on things anymore if he threatens selfharm im sorry i know this hurts if you feel like you need support i can contact your friendsfamily and let them know so you dont have to go through this alone and if you really do have suicidal ideation then please speak to a therapist because i dont want anything bad to happen to you but i cannot and will not be your emotional crutch anymore i am happy to help you out with resources but im not going to entertain any attempts to place the burden of your mental wellbeing on me that isnt fair to do to me id probably have been nicer his wife isnt listening to him and now his best friend isnt listening to him if he has no outlet for these emotions this is why people sometimes end up cheating that never thought they would hear him out at the end of the day losing a parent is traumatic but not a reason to give up on your relationshipstop living forever six months later is long enough that she needs to start at least acknowledging she needs to be working towards normalcy and intimacy in her marriage yes shes grieving but shes had that period of uninterrupted she comes first no matter what already its done and now its time for okay how do we move forward and find the new normal it seems like she isnt even willing to have that conversation with your friend despite him being proactive and trying to communicate which is a serious issue apologies for being harsh but i find ignoring things just because they arent nice to hear is how we end up in situations like yours you knew he didnt love you and stayed anyway because you were hoping you were wrong its understandable but remember the only one youre hurting is yourself youre worthy of love and you seem like a kind and genuine person you can afford to be a little bit stingy with who you give your heartbody to use this as a learning experience for the signs of someone who doesnt really love you and has poor intentions its 100 teenagers and other young adults who think theyve learned how the world works by reading reddit and fail to realize life outside of a computer operates very differently dont worry theyll learn eventually at least i hope or more likely its neither but hes also afraid to be alone so he can use op for the emotional support until he finds someone he connects with physically and emotionally and then he leaves her this is really just monkeybranching with more steps yep hes waiting until he finds someone else he connects with more and once he does itll be im sorry it just happened i didnt mean for it to but im in love with her so obviously this guy sucks he saw an easy lay and he took it he took advantage of you and that isnt okay that being said its common for 18 and 23 year olds to make stupid mistakes and engage in shitty behavior like this its also common for one party to mentally break up long before they come out and say it so yeah i understand what he means by saying hes moved on already it sucks be proud of yourself for asking the question and leaving once he was honest it isnt your fault he didnt communicate hes young hes selfish and it was easier to wait until he was over
