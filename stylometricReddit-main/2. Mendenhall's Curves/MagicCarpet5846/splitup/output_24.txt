40 years people are not talking about in the past 40 years theyre referring to recently the major demographic of reddit and most likely this sub is significantly younger than routinely flew 40 years ago to the extent of would know what the size of seats are like that source is nice but largely irrelevant to the actual argument of in recent years airlines are reducing passenger seat sizes the comment that i was replying to was saying it was just about wanting to touch a woman though so thats the only point i was refuting theres absolutely no indication thats what this was about and more just wanting the person who gave him more space sitting next to him sure but i really dont think this is some creepy he wanted to know the touch of a woman situation this sub isnt about am i in the clear legally literally right in the rules its about the morals of a situation op is giving her sister a huge financial advantage at any age let alone a 19 year old single mom of twin infants the sister needs to know her place and follow the simple rule op has or shell lose the privilege of a free townhouse with enough room for her and her kids something shell quickly find will be virtually impossible for her to maintain otherwise you make choices in life its called being an adult if op really needs to she can just evict the sister so the aspect of technically maybe a tenant wouldnt really matter all that long found the person who doesnt understand sarcasm without the s idk man three years in and hes still this bad you may love him but he clearly doesnt reciprocate in the same ways you do you but weaponized incompetence would make my uterus shrivel up to dust it might also just be a natural consequence of when you have less space you fill less space much like a liquid only fills the container its in its not so much reigning it in as much as you cant really be in a seat occupied by someone else eh you would need to be clinically obese to not physically fit in economy seats believe it or not airplanes cost hundreds of millions of dollars they arent really making seats smaller possibly certain airlines on replacement aircrafts might be because most airplanes in commercial use are over a decade old americans are just getting bigger dont make baseless accusations he wanted to be seated next to the smaller human being who wasnt saying anything about being in her bubble rather than the equally giant man who physically prevented him from spreading out it isnt about gender its about size for 35 its definitely not real leather its polyester check the label to be sure that being said it looks awesome so as long as you think the material and quality of construction is worth the price the fit is awesome ah then yeah thats always a possibility however they arent really violating the custody agreement op is just relying way too much on her ex husband and her ex husband is allowing it literally everyone here sucks the ap for being an ap the ex for cheating and for disrespecting his new gf to the surprise of no one and op for using her ex for emotional support and allowing her ex to do the same thing to the new woman as he did to her namely have one foot out the door i dont really think ops exes current girlfriend can take ops ex to court to force him to respect his and ops custody arrangement op can take him to court the ex can take op to court but the ap cant do anything legally to make her boyfriend do anything with kids that arent hers yeah but at some point you also need to remember youre 33 and mom of the mother of two kids and shes fueling with a 22 year old three years later she needs to learn to let it go move on and form her own support network that doesnt include her cheating ex husband you also need couples counseling because this soon in youre in the honeymoon period and hes still in fixer mode that comes with seeing the woman hes madly in love with cry and be scared when that wears off and it will wear off the disgust and anger will return and those feelings of what you did will resurface talk it out now otherwise i can promise you in the next 5 years this ends your relationship people always act like they can forgive such huge breaches of trust and boundaries at first because theyre scared and then once it fades its never pretty dude sounds like he has a really good head on his shoulders and frankly you dont deserve him with how you behaved and even if you do manage to change theres still a chance that the damage will have been done take steps to minimize that risk good luck deal with your insecurities and need for your friends approval and oh yeah get better friends ok yes cute no but wear whatever feels best it could and it would be foolish to think you could actually treat them the same good on you for recognizing that not every person can be a parent to any kid when you said doctors dont hand out prescriptions for epi pens like stickers and i mean they obviously dont literally but definitely plenty out there will give an epi just in case of escalation but that generalized statement was obviously based on the personal experience you shared in the next comment its almost like your personal experience doesnt actually dictate how every other medical professional handles things ofc yta your girlfriend wants her parents to know you arent using herthem and you basically refused to even give the illusion you arent using them and now your girlfriend is going to think you are using them so congrats on fucking that one up so badly she said i want you to offer because i know he wont accept and if he does accept ill make up for it and you laughed in her face as you refused dont expect this relationship to last much longer well if youre making way more than she does that her income becomes chump change which is obviously the situation she wants to be in but lets be real even the most beautiful of women cant guarantee theyd find a man wealthy enough to sign up for that deal that definitely isnt actually reasonable advice if shes trying to work through the issue at that point you might as well just break up and find a man who has already had a vasectomy or is fine with getting one believe it or not real adults who are almost 40 and engaged dont react well to well if youre not going to do as i say then no more sex nta she was clearly trying to act like some queen bee in front of her other friends and all you did was prove her point shes a sad little mean girl the only thing she wasnt expecting is not everyone wants to be friends with the sad little mean girl just because theyre pretty good for you or he didnt check it for nuts because he wasnt the one who ate it it was on the passenger side and his mom brought the snacks i personally dont police what someone else is eating while im behind the wheel of a car do you it sounds like his mom gave him a bunch of snacks and then his mother opened one and put the trash on the floor and the husband hadnt looked at the snacks either that or that was the only almond one and mil specifically had that for herself as she didnt think it would effect op husband cannot know something he hasnt seen or didnt eat has nuts in it nta obviously but she isnt going to pay it you need to decide if youre willing to go the legal route over this or if youll simply go nc over it until she agrees to pay but i will promise you right now if you dont do either of those things and just accept her refusal to pay she will get way worse because now youve embarrassed her and let her get away with it well do you feel you want to proceed in a marriage knowing this is how hell handle conflict of his own making ultimately thats the real question like i said if this isnt handled to your liking i wouldnt get married unless you also are okay with getting divorced because this is the best your conflict resolution skills will ever be a few years into marriage too many people forget to put their partners feelings into perspective ask him why he lied to you and go from there dont accuse him just say i found out youre still going on labor day weekend im really hurt you lied to me can you help me understand why you felt you needed to lie rather than just talk to me about things if you two cant talk this through i personally would probably rethink getting married unless youre prepared to get divorced because no healthy marriage lasts without healthy communication in a way this is a great test for if this is even a wedding worth having bruh you think a bunch of her friends in college should just go borrow money to go and have fun thats the most irresponsible shit ive seen here today im glad you two seem to have a lovely marriage its important to make sure the emotional intimacy doesnt get replaced with fancy shoes or bags i wish you two many more happy years together even though youve said things have largely blown over you should have a discussion on boundaries dont delete messages if you want to offer something to someone who feel deserves it let me know we are a team and i want to share that with you dont offer people gifts over 500 without discussing it with me whatever it may be that you feel comfortable with but i wouldnt just dismiss this as its blown over now so its all good because like i said this is often how it starts better to catch things and communicate early than be another heartbreak story and good luck in all your future opportunities sure thats the reason the law was written but the law states you dont need to pay for merchandise sent to you doesnt translate to it only applies if the company is trying to bill you for it im not even really arguing the legality of it but i am saying that laws are often used in contexts other than the express context it was written for in fact thats pretty much what being a lawyer in certain fields is all about finding a way to argue why a law applies to you and expanding the interpretation of the penned words eta damn some of yall do not understand that laws are in fact open to interpretation and that is why lawyers judges and other leo are required otherwise a computer could just take everything over also didnt make a claim about how this would play out one way or the other just that this law specifically states you dont need to pay for merchandise sent to you that you didnt order im not going to reply to anyone who thinks basic reading skills are mental gymnastics well doesnt seem speculative seems accurate you said youve been together since high school grew up poor you are used to retail jobs so i presume the businesses you
