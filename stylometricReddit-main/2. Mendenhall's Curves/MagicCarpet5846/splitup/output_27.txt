and simply not worth it it can both be true that he needs help and you cant provide him the help he needs you need to put yourself first because he clearly always has and always will put himself first you cannot thrive in this marriage this marriage is literally killing you slowly pick you you deserve it perfect then i think you should send this or a similarly worded message to gracefully bow out while also directly saying i understand you felt obligated to ask me and i am not comfortable with that so i will be the fall guy rather than going to route of making up a conflict its to the point but it doesnt make her feel like the bad guy as youre saying you dont feel comfortable being in such an intimate place with someone who clearly that intimacy isnt there yet and thats okay a year isnt long at all so i wouldnt use shes never shown any behavior like this before as justification or an excuse its super easy not to show your true colors for a year youre an older established guy who owns a 3 story house dating a younger woman im not calling you out on anything but you really cant expect much more from her and you would be very foolish to continue dating someone who has shown you the ugly truth of herself the minute things didnt go her way and let me guess you wouldnt have her pay much if any rent right youre being taken for a ride tbf if he wasnt a deadbeat dad this would be completely normal dynamic for a kid and his father youre really telling me you never did anything with your parents and a friend or even with any of your friends growing up because i definitely did the issue is still the fact that the father never sees his son making it so the few times he does step up precious father son time but it shouldnt be it should just be another weekend together but this time his son wants to bring a friend yeah when your self esteem is this low youre going to sabotage any genuine attempts to lose weight as well because you feel you dont deserve to look and feel good either so you really need to deal with the self esteem before you can even lose the weight and keep it off explain to me why youd want a cheater and a hypocritical deadbeat dad as friends anyway you are the company you keep op and neither of these people are winners tell adam and if that ruins the friendships with everyone then good riddance the brother dropped out of high school and refused to get a job presumably its because he thought now that he was 18 he could do what he wanted and what he wanted to do was nothing while i dont agree with his parents giving him 3 days bare minimum of 30 days like you would a tenant seems like the bare minimum here i do think its fair for his parents to have the attitude of if you think because youre 18 you can make the adult decision to drop out of high school and not listen to anything we have to say then you can also live like an adult and be on your own while uncommon it does happen and it happened to my sibling before where they expected to just stay at home all day doing nothing because theyre an adult and also having mommy and daddy do everything for them still not every parent will enable that behavior even a little talk to your husband first and make sure he has your back once you know that he is on your side just send a text message sil while im honored that you wouldve thought to include me in your special day i dont feel comfortable being included in such an intimate part of your day simply because im your brothers wife i would love to be there as your guest but i need to step down as bridesmaid if theres anything i can do from afar please let me know as i want this day to be very special for you if stepping down is going to start ww3 with your husband and his family its probably better to just tell her youre busycant make it to any smaller events and just suck it up for the wedding day this isnt really that unusual of a situation and as uncomfy as it is if this isnt your hill to die on and your husbandhis family wont be supportive its probably not worth it to make this your hill to die on not to doubt your relationship seeing as youre already pregnant but next time you should both wait a decent period of time before introducing your partners to your kid you need to make sure you guys know and are comfortable with who your new partners are and after 7 and 8 months it really doesnt seem like enough time has passed for either of them to be taking on any sort of parental role or going on trips or things like that moving on takes time rushing it can lead to some really crappy outcomes its harder when you have a kid but her well being and safety needs to come before either of your desires to have a new happy family let yourself be sad cry if you need to do something to get your mind off her even if that means having less work time itll be better to have 18 hours of good work time than 40 hours of horrible work time so make sure to take care of yourself one night too you cant just shove the feelings down and expect to move on overnight you will make it through the course i know it feels like the end of the world if you dont do great on one assignment but i can tell you i have had my fair share of crappy weeks and i survived multiple top technical programs in the world it wont affect anything in your life in the grand scheme of things even if you need to take a few days to take care of yourself before sitting down to work on your final projects do your best you will make it through the only unreasonable bit is you trying to force yourself to be okay in a marriage where your partner doesnt pull his own weight and cant be arsed to spend time with you you deserve and can get way better his poor wife holy shit look heres the reality hes built up an idea of who you will be as his partner in his head and that idea is likely very different from who you actually are this man is successful and going to divorce his wife for you only to discover the real you isnt actually as good as he imagined in his head im sure youre lovely but youre real and human you two both clearly know from experience that marriages and real life are hard and even though you go into things loving a person that doesnt mean itll work out and now that he has all these unrealistic ideas of what being with you is like and he realizes thats not the case itll end ugly your boyfriend is blaming ocd on what is him being an abusive asshole you cant turn it off on command if you could ocd wouldnt be a disorder perhaps he genuinely has ocd but the actual behaviors caused by his ocd would still remain everything that he turned off in the past week is who he is it isnt a disorder thats an excuse flat out and plainly it was bullshit meant to get you to accept poor treatment from him he lied to you he is abusive he doesnt trust you he is both unwilling and unable to change i understand its scary to be without someone youve spent so long with and have shared so much with but 3 years is nothing in the grand scheme of forever you will meet someone you will be with much longer than him and instead of having a pervasive theme of lies abuse and fear youll feel happiness and youll wonder why the hell you stayed with such a crappy partner for so long and why you put up with such obvious bullshit for so long when you couldve had this a happy and loving relationship all this time this is the end of a chapter its okay to grieve but put down the horror story and pick up a romance novel with someone else or hell even just yourself you misread the story the last time the kids looked at the box was 6 years ago the half brother has asked to look at the box but this isnt a situation where the kids are constantly stealing this box he just carries it everywhere and a 5 year old is naturally curious the insider information i have is being even somewhat familiar with how a 15 year old boy acts towards siblings they arent exactly nice siblings are viscous to each other at times then add in lost mom and blended family it doesnt take a rocket scientist to see this is a normal teenage boy acting out but that doesnt mean that its not op and his fathers job to teach him that you need to learn patience and cruelly lashing out isnt okay you need to stop being so forgiving youre being a pushover your wife is turning into the equivalent of a redpilled tater tot as the internet likes to call them for the sake of your children and society at large you need to start pushing back on this way harder than you are youre operating as though what she is doing isnt tantamount to racism or homophobia i take it you wouldnt tolerate that attitude so why are you tolerating an attitude that is propagating hatred against men when youre raising two little boys stop giving her a pass on her hatred prejudice and bigotry just because shes a woman that in and of itself is sexist hold her to the same standard you would hold a man who told his wife that she needs to take care of all chores childrearing be a sex slave who never says no to any sex act and never speaks unless spoken to hold her to the same standard you would if a man dared to in public try to humiliate and shame his wife who is doing everything like she did to you i get that you think youre being prowomen but you dont be prowomen by being antiman this isnt behavior you should be tolerating because youre afraid to be coming off as controllingsexistwhatever it is that youre clearly afraid of seeming because this behavior is truly abhorrent and i cant imagine a man as progressive as you are genuinely believing this attitude should be okay for anyone of any gender sit him down and tell him youve been going too far with the criticism lately im not okay with it from now on you either need to learn to keep your opinions of how you want things done to yourself or you need to be prepared to do it your way by yourself the next time something like what happened last night at dinner happens again i am stopping what im doing regardless of where i am in the process and you will be fully taking over i will not be putting things away i will not be cleaning up anything i need you to understand loud and clear just how serious i am about this not continuing if theres something that bothers you
