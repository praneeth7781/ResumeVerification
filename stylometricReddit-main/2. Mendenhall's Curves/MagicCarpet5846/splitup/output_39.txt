tie your self worth into being able to convince shitty men to treat you better because youre worth it youll always be disappointed get your own therapist learn to love yourself outside of how a man treats you and then reflect on what you want in a relationship and find someone who is naturally like that as soon as you need to convince someone youre worth being treated well they arent worth your time there are definitely other issues going on here you sound like you may have some body image issues and he may sound like hes doing something to your food i would recommend you proceed with caution because while i dont want to tell you whats going on i get a weird feeling you are missing something here both of your reactions just feel off you probably need to just send a message saying its pretty clear you either dont want or arent ready for a relationship with me anymore so i just wanted to make sure were both on the same page this is over and i wish you the best yeah personally id make it whenever the lease it up oh 100 agree i said elsewhere if them growing apart wasnt enough to ruin the marriage his actions and behavior surely will that information isnt included in the post so we cant really tell maybe there is and maybe there isnt perhaps she has other views where she believes tattoos are unclean or against her faith or she just doesnt like the look of them perhaps her ocd would manifest in another way where having a mark on her may trigger her in other ways perhaps shes afraid of needles or has a clotting disorder or a million other things that we cant know but presumably all her loved ones would know im not saying that any of this is the case but im just posing scenarios where it would be legitimate to intervene in someone making a decision fueled by mental illness that wouldnt necessarily be included in a reddit post all this to say sometimes if everyone with first hand knowledge of a situation including a medical professional is in agreement theres a chance that they have more informations than we do ill say this if i were going to make a permanent decision i usually wouldnt make and my loved ones knew that and knew i was going through a mental health crisis i would want them to intervene everyone else can feel differently but i would personally rather not make a permanent mistake if someone around me could stop that usually 1 of 2 things either the person knows youre not right for them deep down but is also afraid to be alone or hurt you but once forced to be alone actually finds the one and immediately realizes theyve found what was missing all this time prompting them to take the plunge they always dragged their feet on before or sometimes you have to learn the hard way it isnt that the person loved you any less or didnt genuinely want to be with you its just that they really thought they had time they didnt really see what the big deal was and figured you agree that as long as it happens eventually its all good but as soon as theyre reminded that love isnt enough and actually women are willing to leave without that commitment as soon as they find someone they feel that same way about they dont want to lose it again so they act fast i dont necessarily disagree but her therapist is presumably more educated than you about mental illness and ocd and advised her against getting the tattoo because she clearly felt there was ample evidence of it being fueled by the ocd to some extent if it wasnt fueled by ocd it wouldnt make a difference if she got it on her 5th 6th or any other memorable date it would really just matter that shes permanently honouring her mother this is a classic case of commenters assuming that the poster has just as much information as they do rather than having way more information including the opinion of a medical professional specifically trained and informed of ops gfs mental health and her current state of mind lmao what the fuck youre not immature for just wanting to get married thats absurd you know whats even more of a special kind of stupid thinking that your boyfriend who makes the same as you and has more assets than you actually would be with you for your money its pretty obviously a joke and the fact that she cant realize she is the one with less money in the relationship so obviously he isnt with her for money just goes to show that she isnt ready for a serious relationship yet well most notably she thinks im with her for her money and then we make the same as one another and i have more assets than she does like fam this is not a woman to start a life with you have kids you need someone stable and trustworthy not a woman looking to bail any time you make a joke a joke that anyone smart enough to be a fucking doctor should realize is a joke you literally have more money than her you can emigrate to another country then as it seems yours doesnt really care about peoples actual happiness either that or be unhappy it seems like you get the choice of being unhappy and rich or unhappy and poor it doesnt matter i hate people who act like someone needs to justify why they want something shes allowed to just want to be married she doesnt need to explain it no one needs to explain why they want kids or get married or have a monogamous relationship youre allowed to just want that and youre allowed to end an otherwise great relationship with someone who doesnt i understand i hope you dont think i was implying you would cheat but understand insecurity is a hell of a thing that being said your weight is definitely not the only thing different about you you said yourself youve made a lot of big changes in the past few years its disingenuous to act like the only change is your weight not only will that many changes come with a natural shift in your personality you also said you two no longer have a big thing in common your love for games and more likely than not if youre gymming that much the way you spend your free time has also changed significantly perhaps you no longer enjoy the same foods or restaurants you once did you would almost need to or else you wouldnt have lost so much weight maybe you like to go hiking whereas before you two would watch a movie instead i get its hard for you to see how much you changed because to you youre still you but as someone who has had their partner undertake huge changes like youre describing i can promise you its way more than just your weight youre practically a new person and that can be scary for him and he also may not feel like you two are on the same page anymore like i said in a previous comment just because you think everything is fine and you dont care about how different you two are now doesnt mean he doesnt care and based on everything youre saying its clear he cares time to put on your big girl pants and say the scary thing i know you havent given it much thought but after 4 years you need to start im not willing to wait as long as youre saying you want before marriage is even on the table to discuss you need to think long and hard now about if you want to marry me because the option isnt going to be on the table forever and its not even going to be on the table for another year im sorry to put you in a difficult spot but this is a dealbreaker for me if four years isnt enough time for you to be sure then no amount of time will be and im not willing to wait any longer to find that out i love you and i want us to be together but i love me more i know what i want in life and i wont be a girlfriend for a decade its just not something i have any interest in the thing is you dont need to know the details of their relationship not everyone wants to be a girlfriend for 67 years its the same thing as one person wanting kids and another not even if the rest of the relationship is everything you ever hoped youd find this is a deal breaker and thats before factoring in theres no way to know if he really will ever marry her or is just kicking the can down the road like so many men do and why so many women are not willing to be a girlfriend for 67 years yeah i mean i think its easy for us to sit from our chair and tell op to leave but i agree if she wants to feel like she gave him a chance she needs to be brutally honest with him too that timeline doesnt work for me if you dont see yourself getting engaged or married for a few years we need to part ways i want a relationship that is working towards marriage and if after 4 years that isnt a step youre willing to take with me yet im not willing to wait until you are you need to think about if this is really how you feel because if so we need to be having a very different conversation i honestly think everyone acting like he took advantage of her is making too big of an assumption more likely than not he got someone who he felt comfortable with and now is afraid that shes gotten hot and successful and will want to upgrade her partner its pretty common from both men and women and isnt as malicious or intentional as people think its just that some people arent able to handle jealousy and insecurity and purposefully choose a partner that doesnt flare that insecurity and arent prepared for such a huge shake up that combined with i stayed by my partner when they were fatpoorno bodyetc and then they became hotrichfamous etc and the first thing they did was leave me for someone they met at the gymworkwherever is way more common than people want to admit do i think thats op no not at all but its silly to pretend that exactly what this guy is afraid of isnt something that happens all the time it happens so often that its a running troupe of people in professions like doctors lawyers tech and professional sports i think you are being naive yes because the reality is hes making these comments because youve already grown apart for you maybe you dont care but for him it seems he cares he wants a woman who shares the same hobbies with him who is lower maintenance and doesnt care about how she looks or making a ton of money im not saying this to criticize you strong independent women are amazing and we need more of them in this world but not everyone wants a gym rat girl boss tm some people want a cozy gamer and that isnt you anymore and thats okay but its naive to act like if you think its fine so does he and clearly he doesnt think its fine he clearly feels like hes already lost the woman he fell in love
