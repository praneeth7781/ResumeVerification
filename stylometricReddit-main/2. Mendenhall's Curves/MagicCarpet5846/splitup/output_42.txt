is practically a mom whatever the fuck that means no it isnt weird at all have you ever had a newborn sometimes youre so desperate for adult interaction youll hold up the mailman thats not a sign of abuse thats a sign of parenthood especially parenthood with a rather absent partner at the end of the day that was his decision not to actually pursue any means of getting the money back if heyour step sis were unwilling to even try to get the money back from the actual person who stole it theyve pretty much lost the right to even ask anyone else to provide it i think jumping to clearly an abuser because hes a bad partner is a stretch hes a bad partner and bad father for sure but this is another example of bad person abusive person hey also depends on the kind of partner youre trying to attract too hopefully this has revealed to you a truth about your husband youll stop ignoring as based on your previous comments this behaviorside of him is nothing new what example are you setting for your son by tolerating this behavior you probably need to think about the grander scheme of your marriage when you find a place to stay because this doesnt sound like a good place for you at all understood is in quotes so op clearly doesnt actually feel like he understands you can say you understand and still not actually take the action required to back that up the likely fact is in order to change the agreement his dad may need to go to court and his mom may not let him go so easily if his dad isnt willing to deal with thatsimply isnt willing to be ops full time guardian understanding or not op is 14 years old and really doesnt have much of a choice on where he lives which sucks but hes 14 he cant just move out is that actually an option though ops father called him selfish so perhaps he wont let him move in full time not only that it may require a custody battle for that to actually happen if the mom wanted to put up a fight about it if you do consider her a friend id send in a text message so you have this in writing if she goes off the deep end something you the effect of hey name im sorry i made you feel worse in an already tough time for you im happy to help you out but i need to be clear about a few things i have no interest in you romantically or sexually i consider you a friend and nothing more i want to be really clear that you dont have to worry about my having any ulterior motives because that simply isnt how i see you and im not comfortable with you implying otherwise while youre living at my place that being said while im happy to give you a place to crash while you get back on your feet i am also not comfortable fully supporting you youll need to take care of food and anything else you need on your own if you havent been paid in 5 weeks thats illegal and you need to talk your boss or file a complaint but im sure im not the only person in your support network so if you need to youll need to lean on more than just me ive been busy lately so im going to continue taking advantage of part of my compensation at work since the food is better than anything i can cook but youre more than welcome to stock the fridge with whatever you want and i wont take any of it if you feel uncomfortable staying with me for whatever reason please dont feel obligated and be upset if you want to stay with someone else but if you do plan to stay moving forward we need to be clear on boundaries i dont want any implications im trying to get with you and you need to start providing the basics for yourself im only here to give you a place to stay nothing more fam stop resenting him and start resenting yourself because youre the problem here you ten respecting yourself at all this man has no loyalty to you stop spending time on someone who has told you he isnt loyal im pretty sure he meant you dont get paid every day not that you dont get paid when the company tells you hey ultimately that might be what ends up happening but i think people sometimes underestimate how difficult it is to connect with that one person who fits all the criteria especially as a 32 year old new father if he doesnt even have time to hang out with existing friends alone its pretty unlikely he will have time to find and vet random people who are okay with hanging out with a baby especially because unfortunately there is a higher chance of someone any gender biting at the gambit to hang out with a man with an infant potentially being not suitable to have around said infant we like to say that you should wait around and not take shit and only surround yourselves with the people who are perfectly suited for you but if thats your attitude you also need to be prepared to simply end up alone which when youre a new dad newly in your 30s which is definitely a shock for plenty of people myself included it sucked no longer being in your 20s and old and lost touch with a lot of old friends being alone can be really isolating and isnt actually as healthy advice as you think tldr yes the advice of find friends who are okay with being a dad is great but it fails to consider just how hard that process often is when youre a brand new dad i am assuming 500 is a lot less than a hotel wouldve cost for the time you stayed in light of that id probably say something to the effect of the full day sounds awesome i am really sorry but right now i only have enough room in our savings for the half day thats my fault for not specifying im hoping we get a second income source within the next few months or else were really going to need to figure out some different moves and if youre willing to wait for our thanks until we have a steady income id be happy to set up the full day but otherwise if you do want the full day and are willing to pay the difference i can send over a gift card for the amount and let you decide if you would like to upgrade just let me know im really thankful you let us stay with you and want to make sure you know how grateful i am a completely normal and healthy one lmao believe it or not its an extremely unhealthy mentality to have that close family should leave each other high and dry for what amounts to no really good reason reddit is actually pretty toxic in the other direction with family owes you nothing and expect to do everything 100 on your own or else youre a toxic failure we have family for a reason and quite frankly its an extremely eurocentric view that many cultures would have a serious issue with family helps family family shows up for family and honestly outside of redditextenuating circumstances if your family cant rely on you to follow through that says more about you than your family again if this were an issue shouldve been raised when he was asked to be the best man the brother is going to be close enough where if anything happens hell just be able to leave its a local wedding he leaves them alone for work he can leave them alone to be the best man he agreed to yeah you generally speaking do get to expect your brother who agreed to be your best man at your child free wedding follows through he absolutely can decide not to but the brother is the asshole not op its fine to not expect family to bend over backwards and set themselves on fire to keep you warm but reddit has gone way too far in the opposite direction family does owe family some grace especially if no abuse or other factors are at play these are normal siblings the brother would 10000 be an asshole for dropping out because he cant be away from his wife and kid for half a day especially when he agreed knowing it was a child free wedding and likely knowing the intimate details of why its childfree most og influencers actually worked as well you can be serious about something and still understand you also cant leech off other people i mean hell johnny depp only became an actor because he wanted to finance his music career hes ops best man presumably he was aware of the no child wedding for a long time he would absolutely be an ah to back out of a commitment made understanding the rules of the commitment just because hes being held to those rules not only would he be an ah to op hes also be being an ah to his kid as our society is by and large moving away from tolerating overgrown toddlers and mommas boys correct but as i said look at things from kates perspective how would she know that jamie wanted op there so he could propose she couldnt all she saw was jamie begging for op to attend his birthday party and with all the other info she had thats definitely going to breed insecurity in most people jealousy is a human emotion and as much as it would be nice to tell her to get over it i see why she felt the way she did i mean not really look at literally every female celebrity ever they were hot before and theyre hot now honestly id argue most looked better without the surgery its definitely not accurate to say hotter more likely its just different its all about self perception sometimes and yeah but also if she looked how she did but was a horrid person she wouldnt be with him either so it isnt just looks attraction is important but its not everything im sure she knows that its different if she thought thats the only reason her husband is with her of course before you dig yourself into too deep of a hole she said shes struggled with this even as a teen meaning the surgery isnt what made her the hot one she always was she just had surgery to make herself feel better about how she looked but clearly shes always been beautiful to everyone around her even without the surgery and that friends is body dysmorphia in a nutshell it probably doesnt help that jamie and op do have so much more than just him finding her attractive theyre really good friends to the point where he was begging op to rearrange her schedule to be at the party im not saying hes in love with her at all but from the perspective of kate i understand where the insecurities lie you cant just write it off as physical attraction in the moment and nothing more they have an emotional bond as well now i know well enough that you can be friends with someone and not want to marry them but putting yourself in kates shoes it can be hard to say that confidently i feel for op though it sucks to lose friends for something you cant control fair enough you date enough people unfortunately youll encounter plenty
