cant really be standard practice or else everyone would have asked her yeah dont expect this person to be your friend moving forward i cant imagine ever wanting someone who suggested getting rid of the baby i really wanted in my life just because they thought it was too soon that isnt fair at all she seems to just want an equal and thats going to be near impossible with someone 15 years older than her are you actually shocked she was unhappy or are you just shocked she would actually leave because the fact that youre shocked is the problem she told you what she needed and you ignored her if youre genuinely so emotionally stunted that you can have all that information and still be shocked that shows just how terrible of a partner you are every time you say im just so shocked makes you look that much worse thats like someone seeing a lit fire and then saying theyre shocked when it burns someone that dumb probably shows it in other ways as well and for you the issues definitely showed in other ways so be honest are you actually shocked or are you just shocked she would actually leave nta but most likely theres a background there and you hit a nerve you didnt know about let it go im sure it doesnt really have anything to do with you i will say i think it is a bit personal after knowing someone less than 4 months to be effectively asking about if they had an indepth conversation about marriage or if it was a surprise i can understand how that might strike a nerve with some people im sure you meant it pretty innocently though so youre not really an ah for that i say nta since if she does have a nerve to strike probably shouldnt be sharing things at work but to each their own you are just making crap up now they met at a mutual hobby youre aware that it is genuinely possible to just get on with someone right like holy hell are you deluded to act as though someone has to yes i am aware they often do but to act as though thats the only option is insane seek out some young woman and it isnt genuinely possible for two adults to meet and hit it off and for age not to come up until later believe it or not in the adult world you dont often say hi how are you my name is blank and i am xx years old how about you oh sorry youre too old for me to talk to they didnt meet on a dating app they met in the real world over shared interests its mind numbing to me someone can be so bigoted to just blindly ignore all other possibilities because yes often age gaps are bad do you think other stereotypes are okay to blindly follow too heads up they arent the only dodgy behavior here is yours because im not the one arguing to blindly judge a person and their intentions based solely on their age not only that but youre infantilizing a fucking 28 year old soon to be nurse do you have any idea how disrespectful that is to women in general just ludicrous just reply i bought the ticket for my date that was meant to be you but clearly you had other plans so i found a new date i think ultimately you just need to stop caring why are you walking on eggshells you are legally 100 within your rights to do what youre doing he cant complain about the noise youre making youre legally allowed to use your apartment even with reasonable disruption to others most landlords cant actually make rules like no cookingusing laundry machine after 10 pm because that infringes on your legal right to use your space youre paying for so just stop caring so what if he bangs not your problem youre not doing anything wrong tune him out keep your door locked if you need to report anything simply say to the landlord in writing the neighbor below me has been banging on the walls at all hours of the day in response to my normal living habits i am not making any excessive noise and have taken every precaution to minimize my disruption to neighbors to what is reasonable while still allowing me to live in the space im paying for i know i am not doing anything wrong here so i am alerting you of the issue in case this escalated further and in case youre able to speak with neighbor to understand that apartment building arent always completely silent and im legally entitled to walk to the bathroom if i wake up and need to pee but other than that stop caring girl real talk if you think two years of being miserable and being 28 before you can even start to find a real partner is worth less than 3k you need some therapy this is so worth 3k that id even say its worth going into credit card debt over but obviously if you can take a loan from family a nolow interest balance transfer find a cheaper place etc etc etc do that first but genuinely your mental health and happiness is worth so much more than 3k and if youre already paying 70 of the rent find a cheaper place and the money youll save from only needed to care for one adult will more than make up for it nta this isnt the standard my cousin doesnt respect my serious relationship that is longer than hes been dating his fiance you always see where id probably say your gf would be valid in feeling hurt you left her behind as thats a direct insult to your relationship but he is famous and presumably if he never gets privacy somewhat significantly famous where paparazzi may be trying to snoop your girlfriend only wanting to come because of the experience famous person cool wedding is exactly the kind of person your cousin is trying to avoid attending his wedding no offense to your girlfriend i get how she feels but your cousin is allowed to want privacy in one of the most intimate milestones in his life and making sure only close friends and immediateactual family is the best way to ensure that nta sepsis has a 2050 mortality rate that then increases by something like 57 every hour you go without treatment its quite frankly one of the worst medical outcomes you can have short from a horrifyingly traumatic injury and some ultra aggressive cancers your bil either hates your brother or is a massive idiot because chances are better than not that your brother isnt fine and if he is itll be its own little miracle given he probably was ignoring the symptoms for a bit of time if he thought it was just a bad virus that isnt a lie even in a court of law learn how the english language works better because those statements are 100 accurate and would hold up to any intelligent scrutiny im done with this conversation now bye bye no it isnt its not a lie to not give everyone a play by play reenactment of every decision youve ever made its not even a half truth its just a truth op saw her on sm and figured theyd get along whether or not you agree its definitely because they have mutual friends that op came to that conclusion op would not have felt that way if it were just a complete and total stranger who happened to live in the same city and again definitely a small world because lets do this with actual strangers if i rolled up in la and decided i liked random influencer i could swipe for months and never find them that statement is plain and simple truth remember no one is entitled to every single thought youve ever had in the name of integrity thats foolish have a good day now youre contradicting yourself youre essentially saying if it ever comes up she should continue to lie about not knowing they had mutual friends rather than saying i was a little embarrassed because i figured you had no idea who i was if she asks about it rather than being technically 100 truthful if you advocate transparency then thered be nothing wrong with this as it would technically be clearing up the only actual lie op has told i certainly would never bring it up but youd be surprised how many stupid conversations couples who are newly in love will have its better to have a thought out way to frame things than just word vomiting because youre flustered and caught off guard and coming off like the next joe its not a lie there is no mention of the temporality of those events and to some extent that is a large part of why op figured theyd like her personality sm is a shit reflection of who a person really is but the fact that they had mutual friends lent a lot of credence to the conclusions op was making and it is a small world or else ops plan would not have worked sure its carefully curating the truth to give the best perspective on the situation but theres no lie so theres no concern of breach of integrity i purposefully avoided any language that would indicate a temporal correlation between seeing her on sm and matching on the dating app to make sure that there wasnt any lies yes for everyone out there an esa is a pet that is legally effectively all they are the only luxuries having an esa allows you is having them in nopet housing and being able to fly with them on some airlines and you need extensive paperwork outside of those two very specific and limited instances theyre no different than any other dog out there they can be forbidden from public spaces and do not have any other protections they arent working and thus the whole do not pet a working dog doesnt apply it is a crime to claim an esa is a service animal by the way two very different legal definitions now you should always use caution when petting a dog you dont know as you dont know if the dog will bite but at that point thats fully the fault of the owner for not restraining their pet in public sometimes its all in how you package things we matched and i realized id seen you in friends socials and i figured hey if they fuck with you maybe i would too and here we are crazy how its such a small world huh sounds way better than before you even knew i existed i decided wed be a good couple so i downloaded all the apps because that makes my intentions the most clear and just swiped until i found you and hoped for the best easy really now that i think about it doesnt it the only thing i would ever admit to is i had seen you on sm before and seeing you on whatever app made me want to shoot my shot small world huh and if she ever pressed just say nah i never thought about sliding into your dms but i saw a cute girl who i knew my friends fucked with and figured hey if they fuck with you i might too and here we are makes it waaaaaay less stalkery than what your post implies best of luck just remember you and him vs the problem hes committed to being a team to figure this out you guys got this there is the fourth issue of you two are also incompatible for
