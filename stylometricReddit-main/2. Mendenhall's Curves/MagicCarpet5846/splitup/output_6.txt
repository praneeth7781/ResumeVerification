done from hurtful info his location his sm anything else that gives insight into his life moving forward it will only hurt that is definitely not true i have known a number of people who meet a partner or fling or whatever you want to call it online playing video games never leaving their house is she taking on the mental load or is she just a type a personality and controlling because remember controlling people do exist and they can be women and it definitely sounds way more im doing things my way and you dont get a say rather than the typical nothing ever happens if i dont do everything and he never gives any input you see here typically holier than thou redditor ego seeing as any rational human being knows having your car towed from a private property like that is going to be at least a few hundred bucks which unless youre quite wealthy is going to hurt at best and seriously endanger your financial wellbeing at worst dont park illegally but we also have no idea if this person got lost or what and the idea that we should treat any mistake as if its the end of the world acts as though people dont routinely make mistakes and they do some kindness and grace should be afforded for what is a normal human experience because even though you think well i would never do xyz that probably isnt as true as you think you should sit him down outside of these moments and ask to talk about something with him honestly then say ive noticed a pattern lately well be talking and out of nowhere it seems like youll say im not funny and should stop trying to be funny but the reality is im not trying to be funny i have never tried to be funny this is just my personality and how i talk so it feels like youre not only criticizing my humor but also who i am its made me think and ive realized youve never even laughed at anything ive said and while i meant it when i said i never try to make you or anyone else laugh its made me think you dont enjoy me or my company much and thats becoming an issue for me we need to address so im hoping we can have an open discussion about whats been going on eh its also been 3 months i dont really think you can conclusively say anything about what this other woman does or doesnt know well have the conversation again and next time she replies with that just say okay then its clear the relationship isnt working out lets part ways shes either bluffing in which case you need to call it out or she isnt bluffing and its only a matter of time before she breaks up with you so might as well beat her to it and leave with your dignity you literally just tell her plainly if this is how you feel we need to break up if you still want to stay together you need to stop the comments which one and make her pick and hold her to whatever she picks if she refuses to pick tell her youve picked for her and its over stop being so passive and firmly shut the behavior down and if she doesnt back down you end it pretty easy way to show someone what you will and wont tolerate i think you just need to communicate with her are you really this unsure about our relationship because if you are i think we should end things now it isnt fair to either of us to stay in a relationship where youre having this much doubts and if you arent that unsure you need to really be mindful of your language because its starting to feel like you dont want to be with me and at this point its honestly making it difficult for me to want to continue seeing you and then see where the conversation goes but really if she doesnt say hey youre right this was super uncool behavior im sorry and ill work on it you probably should just end things sooner rather than later as its pretty obvious this isnt a relationship made to stand the test of time so if marriage is a goal of yours why even bother here anymore move on to someone who will be sure of you lmao props to you for not even blinking at the ultimate manipulation your family tried to play and just shutting it down so hard even the cops breaking up a house party would be impressed he was also very likely getting ready to end it if op hadnt im unhappy in our relationship means if you dont change im out youre aware your opinion doesnt change how courts sometimes handle these situations right no it isnt okay but generally unless the kids are in physical danger courts try to keep both parents in their life the husband wouldnt be able to get her deemed unfit and take them out of the country this isnt a comment on how things should be but a reminder that unfortunately no she is not unfit to be a mother and unfortunately if the husbands support system is in another country he wont really be able to take his kids with him unless the wife will allow it and she doesnt seem the type to do so freely you did though what do you think saying someone is unfit to be a mother means also 300 m2 isnt really big enough for two separate families i dont know if you are currently or ever plan to have a family or even just a partnerpet but while 300 m2 is good for you and your needs it isnt really a two family house as a permanent set up which this obviously would be that is definitely not how it works plenty of parents work until 6 pm 5 days a week and arent forbidden from seeing their kids thats insane to suggest and even her abuse means nothing if it isnt provably directed towards her children family custody battles unfortunately are notorious for failing to take into consideration abuse of a partner when deciding custody if she gets even partial custody he cant just move them out of the country might not be an option abusive partners often dont just let you walk away with their children and i dont think he would legally be able to just take them without a custody arrangement to another country unfortunately leaving an abusive relationship isnt always easy and there isnt always an easy solution when someone wants to make your life miserable and willing to use your children as pawns just to hurtcontrol you sure but theres also plenty of free porn too that doesnt stop people from paying the thousands of gothwhatever other category of girl on of out there does abuse actually change things though its an unfortunate situation but i dont think it changes the issue of op wants time alone with his family and doesnt want to be paying for things for harper like a father figure would thats an acceptable boundary to have yes even if abuse is at play after all if jennifer is aware enough to tell amber there is abuse at play shes aware enough to also know that she shouldnt be staying and exposing her kid to that environment you do you but its unreasonable to suggest you wont even leave your house until your long term boyfriend is where he said he would meet you trying without any belief it will change isnt trying its going through the motions therapy is a joke because youve decided its a joke of course if you go into something convinced it will never help it wont help thats like thinking everyone will break up with you you make yourself so miserable to be around it becomes a selffulfilling prophecy he cheated on you and feels guilty op said she was living with this guy talking about fantasies of marriage and shes also extremely close to this cousin the cousin knew op had a pregnancy scare with her summer fling she just didnt have a name or a face apparently which feels so weird to me possible absolutely just so weird ok pause youre saying youre still not over the ex you had at 22 its time for therapy no you arent unlovable but you are stagnating yourself its okay not to be over him but you need help its time to love yourself enough to get it i think you need to be honest with her and be very very blunt hey friend sorry to message but i didnt want to wait until closer to the wedding i love you and want to support you as much as i can on your special day but i have a very hard budget for how much i can spend in total on the wedding its x ive already contributed y i wanted to be really clear that from now on i cant contribute anything else and i am not comfortable asking people who dont know you to come to any paid events if you no longer want me to be a bridesmaid i will step down and be a regular guest because i dont want to be a source of stress for you but ive felt a lot of pressure to spend more than i am able to and while i understand its unintentional i want to be really transparent with you and then go from there you would be incredibly selfish to message him knowing he is in a relationship let him move on if they break up and youre still single and feel this way reach out but know your place do not invite that sort of bad karma into the world id do it over facetime in your backyard garage or even walking to a park just tell him then i want a kid and that hasnt changed if youve changed youre mind thats youre right but were no longer compatible i hope we can split quickly and amicably as i wish you no ill will but am firm on what i want in life for either side shes allowed to be willing to die on this hill but honestly if she knew her sibling was at risk and knew she was offering a safe haven that should have been a conversation she had with her boyfriend long before it came to fruition then they couldve had the discussion and had a plan and he wouldnt have felt like an outsider in his own home to be honest i would figure out if you can move on from this if you cant and no one would blame you simply tell her you found her notes and want a divorce but decide beforehand i would either accept it and leave it be or tell her youre looking for a divorce but i wouldnt tell her what you found and expect your marriage to survive i mean hey if youve decided how you want to handle it go ahead i hope it goes as well as it can well she very realistically may be sacrificing her relationship she seems okay with it but she shouldve been more upfront about her priorities look fam if youre willing to be dumped over this go ahead but fully understand that youre in the wrong here not him you always communicate beforehand even if the answer is i am helping my sibling and if you are unwilling to support me in this its a dealbreaker but you need to have that conversation first hed be a fool to propose to a woman who cant even respect him enough to give him
