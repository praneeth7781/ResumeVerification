make it clear this isnt consensual and protect your boyfriend because this is how false accusations usually arise your sister may not take the rejection well seeing as any semi sane individual wouldnt tell her sister shes going to pursue her boyfriend of 4 years so youre already dealing with someone who isnt all there when it comes to following social norms be careful and protect yourself and your boyfriend the sooner someone can step in and knock some sense into her the better as much as i understand you dont think its weaponized incompetence it is definitely still incompetence i have never ruined a single dinner timer or not because i am paying attention to the meal i would never walk away from a kitchen appliance thats turned on i have never messed up a load of laundry like that because i always check to make sure to fully check hands inside the machine that it is empty before and after a load of laundry ive never had any furniture tvs or anything of the sort break on me because i test to make sure things are installed properly after i finish he cant prevent the actions of others the late drivers and rear end accidents arent him but youre allowing him to blame way more than he should on this nebulous im cursed idea when the reality is he simply isnt going through life intelligently especially because if you know youre that unlucky youll learn quickly ways around it you two have been together years and perhaps even live together if youre eating the same food the fact that you dont get food poisoning and he does probably means he isnt using good food hygiene for the food only hes eating as bacteria doesnt selectively decide to attack him and leave you alone this is a classic example of one crappy encounter happens two is unlucky is every encounter sucks the problem is you not them i get it you love him you want to believe this person you love is totally helpless to do anything to stop this unfortunate string of events but he isnt until and unless he understands that hes allowing himself to a victim more than he needs and why given he seems so predisposed to the inevitable and takes steps to course correct youd be fully within your right to leave someone who doesnt understand something so basic as dont leave cooking food unattended that i learned that when i was 8 years old and started cooking probably didnt see the context of he was sleeping on an air mattress in someone elses room i was initially thinking he was the ah for making a big deal over 200 but given he doesnt even get an actual place to stay yeah its time to put the foot down imo its probably an overreaction to say quit him but i agree op needs to simply put her foot down i am not quitting my etsy store if the time comes where i need to go back to being a waitress i will but being a waitress is a dead end job and one i can get at any time with any resume i am going to put my focus where i am happy and making more money until that changes i understand your concerns so if my business starts to fail ill definitely figure something else out but you do not get to unilaterally tell me to quit my business especially not to go back to waitressing of all jobs its utter ridiculous of you to suggest such a foolish business move it likely doesnt take much luck if you a come from a rich family or b have the mother of the child do all of the child care while you focus on school and then your career the kids were all by the same woman it seems you have no idea if that woman was well off or what but its definitely possible people seem very unaware that in the franchisedascension league teams are no longer free to make changes whenever they want but yes the rosters are as they are unless there is some emergency transfer allowed by riot which would only be for extenuating circumstances this is a good thing for the scene overall though as rosters that just make a change after any bad performance are going to perform worse than the teams that work at chemistry and accept that the path to success is rarely ever straight up to me thats hard to say he might absolutely but he just as easily might not theres 5 teams currently and will be 6 teams by next year im sure changes will be made to franchised teams no doubt but its a combination of depends on what his salary and geographic requirements are combined with what the scene looks like by then a lot can happen in a year in fact yay went from relatively unknown to dominant superstar in less than a year there is nothing to stop that happening again to someone else and based on the trajectory of the scene thus far i actually bet it does happen again the issue is when theres only 30 franchised players and only 56 slots for your particular role it probably isnt a great risk to take saying eh ill just take a year off and come back later because frankly you may not have that option yay has a very particular role he fills with a very particular play style he excels in and he does it well but when youre the best in a niche field you need prominence to ensure relevance and that doesnt happen in a world where he doesnt compete and rarely streams i mean he hasnt even updated his twitch to remove c9 from the about tab and frankly unless yay has a backup plan for his career lined up that isnt a risk id personally want to take when were talking about his actual livelihood here it may not be as glamorous as he would want but it definitely beats becomingstaying unemployed well i think people on here in the comments have knee jerk reactions as a result of the people in the posts ignoring numerous red flags the problem is they see where the red flags tend not always of course lead and as a result have a hairpin trigger on convincing people to expect more for themselves and stop ignoring such blatant issues however if the people on here were always really intuned with how much these red flags can turn into relationship enders and instead only ever came here for advice on i messed up i forgot my wifes birthday how do i make it up to her or my partner and i disagree on how to handle xyz how do we come to an agreement people would probably be a lot less likely to jump to this relationship is unhealthy you see the issue instead this guy is recognizing the dynamic is unhealthy right away and opting out which is the smarter way to go about dating it means that when the issues do arise they tend to be manageable issues and with someone who hopefully will be able and willing to work on those issues with you yay wins because he wont be knocked out of the competitive scene for a year ranked is terrible for practicing for pro play and being out of practice with scrims meta and competitive performances could really hurt him in the long run valorant is a game where recency plays a huge role in your value and in a year of franchising with no yay and however many other newupcoming players dominating he could find himself with no prospects again definitely yay has an incentive to be playing and be showing the world he is still very much a top performer compared to all the other talent out there and he does that by competing not by sitting and playing ranked well believe it or not most likely the getting all up in his over his eye color had to do with his race her brother getting hostileaggressive could be taken as borderline abusive and ops lack of either a warning about her familys behavior nor any attempt to run interference or set boundariesstand up for him show an unhealthy dynamic that can easily turn toxic its not silly for someone to see the red flags for what they are right away and not wait for the silly to turn unbearable in fact if everyone acted the way this guy did people would both be happier in general and also those who refuse to make changes in their lives that would protect their so would be forced to because theyd just keep ending up alone otherwise yes and no anger will consume you if you let it learning emotional maturity is learning how to not allow your emotions to rule you and often part of that is learning how to since you seem to like frozen let things go so while yes its a nuanced topic moving on from something does often involve choosing and actively working on not allowing those emotions to control you anymore sure if you think about it you might still feel those things but its semantics to make the argument about whether or not active or passive feelings of anger are still being angry about something in short yes being an adult means you need to be able to choose when to actively feel emotions vs accepting that you do feel a certain way about something but refusing to allow that emotion to control your life the attitude of she should remain angry forever is frankly unhealthy and lacks any sort of emotional maturity she can be angry but she ultimately needs to decide if shes going to let that anger rule her life or not and yes most adults are 100 capable of choosing not to be so angry about something anymore if youre unable to consider you may not have adequate emotional control imo it isnt worth it for her to remain angry because the ring was given to her cousin without conditions and regardless of its alterations op wasnt given the ring so there is no additional loss to her as already the ring wasnt and wouldnt be hers it sucks she can mourn the loss of a beautiful ring get it remade for her if she so chooses now free of guilt well people can actively to choose to move on from a situation theyre hurt about the point of the comment is a very pragmatic one either make this a hill to die on and cause familial tensions or accept that whats done is done it was technically given to her without conditions of keeping it as is and as much as it hurts that hurt can remain a personal one forgiveness is often a choice someone actively makes not one that simply happens and its one that is often made not for the person being forgiven but for themselves yes its hard but part of being an adult is being able to manage your emotions that doesnt mean to just get rid of them but you should be able to manage them enough to be able to move forward even the 2030 lbs tvs of today could definitely kill a toddler if it fell the wrong way that poor child but thank god oop lives in a country with strong intervention for at risk children i assume the most likely reason for his overreaction was he may be unaware pancada has said he finds playing smokes boring despite being really good at it and thus assumed this was being done against his best interest my guess this was brought up and syyko is enabling pancada in a way even loud wasnt
