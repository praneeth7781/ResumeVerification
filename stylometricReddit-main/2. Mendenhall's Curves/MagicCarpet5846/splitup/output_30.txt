the table mine was in the midhigh 6 figures all said and done and that was just me so middle class is defined as up to the top 83 of earners if we said upper middle class is the next 10 of earners supported by 14 of people reporting they are upper middle class that would be just over 300k of income being up to upper middle class middle class and upper middle class are not the same and upper middle class is beyond the middle class it allows for things like retiring early paying part of your kids education and nice day to day lives but it is hardly rich its just that unfortunately so many people do without what should be way easier to attain upper middle class is a shockingly uncommon level of wealth yes and thats because of how much you need to earn to achieve it youre supporting my point 300k with multiple kids and a plan to retire early puts you in the upper middle class not rich and for reference i am referring to actual upstate new york as in close to the canadian border for anonymity im not referring to westchester or any area nearby like i said youd be surprised no middle class isnt defined on what you earn its defined on your lifestyle thats why more people live in poverty than the bottom lets just say 10 of income earners it works both ways unfortunately there are more people in the lower bracket than the higher but that is exactly why people say the middle class has largely been eliminated if it were just by your earnings definitionally there would always be a middle class that never grows nor shrinks but its clear most people agree that thats not the case its just the unfortunately what it takes to actually be middlemiddleclass in this country is insane now but the two while related are different not at all but being comfortable and not having to worry about your bills and being able to enjoy life doesnt mean youre rich it means youre middle upper middle class just because the middle class has larger lot been wiped out due to a lot of societal factors people are discussing doesnt change the fact that that is middle class it just feels like it shouldnt because thats now the top 510 of the country but just like you wouldnt call someone who lives paycheck to paycheck and cant afford a big enough house for their kids or save for retirement solidly middlemiddle upper class just because theyre in the 50 of american incomes you wouldnt call someone living what is a upper middle class lifestyle rich just because of the percentile of income theyre two different concepts people are misunderstanding povertylowmiddleupperrich has to do with lifestyle not percentile and thats why way more people live in poverty than those in the bottom 10 of income earners in the us it works both ways yeah i think a lot of people here are considering rich to be doesnt need to worry about money for the minimums but it definitely is way more than that id describe can afford a nice home nice cars fill the retirement funds college funds vacation funds and savings as upper middle class at best rich is tons of luxury goods the 1 million dollar closet vacations that cost tens of thousands of dollars and you dont even need to really save for it way more than just a nice life everyone i knew who made 250k450k even in upstate ny was still upper middle class money doesnt go as far as you think when it comes to being rich in order to be rich thats more than has a nice house nice car and can pay for their kids school and vacations every year which after taxes thats around the lifestyle were talking about in most places except the rural thats 150k in disposable income after taxes and then youd need to pay your mortgage your cars retirement health insurance which can be well over 10kpp a year put away money for multiple kids college pay for their necessities food etc it definitely adds up and once all that is said and done youre definitely comfortable but youre definitely not rich rich is way less than the top 1 in the us i know that its hard for most to understand because they would feel rich with that much money but thats right up until you have that much and realize how money doesnt really go that far when youre talking about living a luxurious lifestyle which is definitely a necessity if were talking about considering someone rich rich is more than just can comfortably pay bills and afford vacations true but youre also making the assumption that just because people survive on less means this is enough to make someone rich 300k still makes them upper middle class when you factor in savings the cost of kids taxes college funds retirement funds people define their wealth based on the lifestyle they can afford and i can promise theyre living an upper middle class life at best 300k even in san fran isnt enough to have a mansion and eat at nobu every day it may be enough to not worry about your bills but id argue thats middle class not being rich he was directly asked a question about it he didnt complain shes just one of the most insecure women out there and was looking for some reason to hate herself part of this definitely falls into she needs therapy for the insecurity otherwise shell ruin any relationship shes in you can simply contact the police its your home he legally actually cant lock you out the police will escort you personally while you collect your belongings be sure to mention the fact that hes been abusive in the past and youre afraid of him escalating if you try to get your belongings back also i do want to remind you just because your contractions were false doesnt mean hers will be by assuming her experiences will be the same as yours you may be obfuscating a serious health concern that she should go to the hospital for you mean well but you arent a doctor and having 1 pregnancy gives you about as much insight into what might be going on with her pregnancy medically as a man would have and that is to say almost nothing you can sympathize with her discomfort but keep your assumptions on her medical status to yourself i think the real question is did he actually stalk you to fabricate your relationship or was that text message just a joke that he sent to friends after he happened to meet you by chance because ive definitely had moments like that happen where ive talked to my friends about something but never actually meant it and then it happened by chance and i joke about making it happen even though i didnt though nothing quite like this i can see this being just a series of bad coincidences but if you feel like this man even a bit fabricated your meeting run far and run fast because thats some you level of stalking and obsession yeah no casual restaurants that are sit down dinner for an average of 12entree dont operate that way at all id probably get divorce papers drawn up and get a plan for a new bedroom being set up and once he inevitably goes to cost her move everything out from your room and into the new space for yourself get a lock and just leave the house and have the papers sitting on the bed and a note saying im aware of how you feel about woman i am not going to be second place in my own marriage whatever you wish to happen between you two youre now free to explore and then i would leave for a hotelspa for a night just to make him wonder where you are and also to avoid the immediate reaction hes bound to have and its pretty shitty that op and her sibling are putting her brother in a position to need to make that call either way he needs to be unfair to one of his kids unless everyone is trying to imply if you dont share blood you cant consider someone your child yeah its pretty terrible of op and aunt imo to put their own sibling in the position of choosing between ensuring his bio daughters future and staying by his chosen family i still think its their money to do with as they please but i personally would go with my brother has two kids if i cant treat them equally i wont treat them especially if stepniece doesnt have a bio dad in her life and sees brother as her father figure but i understand their choice as well perhaps he didnt mature he just thought youd changed enough to put up with it this may not be your forever relationship op and thats okay we grow from high school i mean if you dont want to see him again dont but i will say as youre describing it that doesnt sound implausible for him to also have had that experience dad jokes arent exactly copy righted and sitting by the tv making a dumb sex joke to your kid sounds like the sort of thing hundreds if not thousands of teens could talk about warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment it is strongly recommended to use async praw see for more info i didnt say i dont know any sibling who choose to i know plenty i just said none who are required to collegeschool is still on the parents not the siblings even if the siblings choose to save up which i will point out they made sure to do so quietly as this is the first time the fund was mentioned to the parents i mean niece isnt the familys obligation either no ive never heard of it being on the siblings to pay for high schoolcollege for someone elses kids that in mind they already arent responsible for but are choosing to provide for niece that kindness can extend only as far as they wish in fact its only because its siblings with no obligation that this is okay otherwise id argue if after 10 years youre unable to treat both of his kids like his kids regardless of blood thats wrong well because he is clearly at a minimum her emotional apbest friend well you see op is acting as though no one will ever be good enough for her little baby boy she seems to have a pattern of ostracizing her sons partners and subtly trying to make them feel less than yeah and good for her for respecting herself enough not to put up with that crap and good for her fiancthe son to love her enough to stand up to his mom his mom is giving off major no woman but me is good enough for my son vibes which is a major ick factor then start acting like one because youre acting like a misogynist with a jocasta complex towards your son this is a troll because you are very clearly not a bot account just because the weed itself may not pose a threat thats foolish to think someone who got incredibly and unexpectedly high as a kid wouldnt be in any danger being intoxicated always poses a risk for accidents i think they dont mean it literally as if theres no active mods the subreddit will be shut down its against reddit policy to have an unmoderated subreddit it honestly sounds like youve decided it cant work and are looking for a reason it doesnt if thats
