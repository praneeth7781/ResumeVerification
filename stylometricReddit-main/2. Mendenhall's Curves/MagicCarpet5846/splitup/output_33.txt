much this really means if the next most watched game without 4 of the most popular female streamers playing in it was less than 10k viewers i also think hes probably putting the blame on the cat when he should be looking at himself uimpossiblesign6754 if you are noticing your wife is relying more on a cat than her own husband for emotional support instead of trying to get rid of the cat start asking yourself why you arent the one giving her the emotional support more likely than not youre not actually there for your wife so of course shes going to rely on the cat who is you should just tell her im happy to pay for you but anything your sister wants how about you cover yourself good compromise they definitely left because they were homophobic not because they were blindsided you can be surprised someone has two fathers but if youre not homophobic your first thought will definitely not be to get up and leave with absolutely no explanation if for no other reason than because you know how homophobic it looks and generally wouldnt want to come off as such i could maybe see this being a topic of conversation after dinner but no semitolerant person storms off like that without even saying anything to the effect of wow i feel like you were purposefully hiding something from me i feel like you may be hiding other things and i dont think its a good idea for us to have a dinner right now ok but heres the issue if the money is just meant to be passed along generation to generation no one ever is going to use it right if thats the case 1 the kids shouldnt be upset as it wouldnt have been money they intended to use and 2 thats foolish because hoarding money so you can say you have it but never actually doing anything with it is part of the reason theres so much wealth disparity in the world money should be spent responsibly of course but him enjoying the rest of his life and making sure hes able to care for himself is why the money exists if his kids dont want him to rely on them then they shouldnt rely on him to give a full inheritance independence goes both ways gunna be honest both of you sound toxic and are trying to hide behind jokes and quick wit when the reality is you are both just bitter and bad partners you probably arent good for each other because and especially neither of you seem ready to be with anyone you cant control him but you can control yourself do some selfreflection and work to undo the unhealthy behaviors youre forming so you can find and keep a partner who will also not treat you like shit im also going to add never once have i looked down into my cup and seen anything looking back at me while insulting your family is so far out of line i cant even begin i also cant say i wouldnt also be disgusted if my partner was drinking from a straw with crap growing in it maybe tell her its clear this is becoming an issue and you want to discuss this constructively before it causes permanent damage to your marriage so youve booked an appointment with a couples therapist if you cant do that are you prepared to be the one putting in 100 of the effort again because those are the options he likes you because you dote on and borderline worship him if you stop doing those things he isnt going to chase after you it sucks but thats the reality pick whatever you perceive as the lesser of two evils but just remember as much as you feel like you cant do it you can and the sooner you start the sooner you realize wow how did i ever think losing him was that hard dont make yourself miserable because youre afraid of your family thinking less of you its okay to make mistakes its okay to want the best from those you love but it isnt okay to be miserable because youre afraid of potential judgement your family may just be happy youre finally rid of him so dont stay because youre afraid of what others will think if you leave i would maybe consider that you also arent who you think you are either im not saying this was your fault but you show a shocking lack of awareness of what id consider the basic status of both your relationship and partners general life its very possible this is all your partners doing but id probably guess you could also do some work on yourself so you can be a better partner in a future relationship with a woman who hopefully will deserve that trust i like the pants but the top throws off your proportions you have a wider waist and smaller chest so you probably want a top that creates a more flared illusion sweetheart necklines or even a ruffled top would help to even out your proportions a bit well he clearly thought she loved him more than she loved herself the unfortunate thing is for at least three years he was right men and women need to remember that if you arent your own priority youre doing something wrong within reason please dont be selfabsorbed just know your worth yeah especially since presumably she was dating the exfianc for some length of time meaning this couldve potentially gone down only a few months before they met its definitely better for jj oops husband thinks jj is immature for not having a boyfriend thats not the kind of energy i would want in my life everything else not even considered not really saying we need to start working on this and making progress because i know this is an issue i cant live with forever but im still willing to work on it now is different than an ultimatum which is effectively make this dramatic change right now or were done honestly to answer your question yeah i do think youd be a monster to issue an ultimatum of let me cheat or ill leave you instead tell him i cant stay in a relationship without intimacy we either need to work on this together or we need to reevaluate our marriage because this isnt working for me if he offers an open relationship then sure but to coerce him into an open marriage nah fam if youre unhappy you leave you dont do that honestly i think this fit will come down more to your size than your height it looks good because of her figure did you ever pause and think maybe your son doesnt respect you two because you dole out a harsher punishment for speaking out against racism than the racism itself id say no offense but i actually mean offense when i say if you arent racist get your shit together because youre coming off very racist right now just in the i have a black friend of course im not racist kind of way that 21st century racists all seem to thrive people seem to think refusing to use a slur means you arent racist and trust me its a lot more complicated than that most likely because you understand that actions have consequences and anyone can push things too far she likely thought after 5 years they were essentially one so even if he didnt like what she was doing he wouldnt stop it which is a bold choice if shes lucky 50k year at 27 with no working history and no info on what her degree would be a godsend it never ceases to amaze me how someone can so confidently refuse to compromise because they firmly believe they hold all the power and so quickly backtrack when they realize theyll lose everything over being unwilling to lose anything you should really only use force as a last resort you should try bribesmasking before you resort to shoving the pill down their throat i dont recommend this but at least in your head say there may be many women who would ask for less but there are also many men who will give so much more you deserve better yeah im so so so sorry that this is happening to you but its very clear that he thinks youre trapped now there is no changing him and given everything youve just told me i think its most likely he will both cheat and turn physical make a decision without him i understand this is hard to come to terms with so if it takes you time to come to the decision thats okay but if you decide to leave him and i would seriously consider it make sure you have everything lined up and never mention a word to him you may need to ask family for help friends make new accounts whatever it takes to ensure he doesnt find out youre honestly very likely in danger right now secrecy is your best friend be careful op if you need resources i can link you to someone who will be able to help more than me i also think the title is misleading she isnt actually saying maria cant be vegan but shes saying that maria needs to stop demanding specialty vegan items like fake meat fake cheese fake butter etc if shes vegan on principle good for her but she needs to decide between a plain old saladpasta with tofu or going hungry because its ridiculous to expect everyone else starve and get inadequate nutrition just so maria can have the fancy vegan foods make sure to check the reviews i always raise an eyebrow at affordable dresses that require decent construction to look good would suck to waste a couple hundred on a dress that ended up looking cheap the reality is your husband wants a traditional wife he wants a woman whos sole existence is to serve him and his family your role is to cook for him take care of him bear and rear as many or as few kids as he desires and put up with whatever he wants he makes a bunch of money and he feels as though thats his right as not only a man but a successful man i get everyone on reddit telling you not to tolerate it and you shouldnt but you need to be hyper realistic about the situation youre in he isnt going to change there is no point in trying to convince him if you try to change him one of two i guess three things is going to happen he will leave you cheat on you or become violent hes already become angry with you for beginning to challenge him so do not doubt the possibility that he will become physical you need to simply decide if your and his views on what a marriage should be are compatible and they very well may not be but if this isnt what you want you need to make plans to leave not plans to stand up for him otherwise you may be in physical danger or at a minimum left in a situation with no plan he may become vengeful in a divorce and do everything he can to take everything from you and leave you with even less than you came into the marriage with i cant impress upon you that the choices are either accept the marriage he wants or do not say anything until youre in a position to quickly and safely leave youd be very wise to involve your father not only for your sisters safety but for your boyfriends safety you need to tell anyone and everyone what your sister is doing and
