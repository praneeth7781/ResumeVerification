to inflate it to as bad a crime as indirectly leading to someones death worthy of the same punishment thank you for proving my point too many people dont know how to differentiate nta this is when you say family doesnt take advantage of other family you used grandma and im not letting you use me too if you dont knock it off im blocking you all and any breaks you or your kids have been getting from me will end and just stick to it be firm your uncle is a leech and will bleed you dry if you arent firm and willing to follow through with cutting him out entirely you wont keep that inheritance for long as hell find a way to suck it from you too info its legal in your state why did he feel the need to hide this information if hes at the point where he feels shame for his habit its an addictiondependency and he needs professional intervention otherwise there is no reason to hide information with no legal repercussions from medical staff well remember that not everyone is responsible and only spends the money they have this is how people end up with payday loans or tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt you act like people are responsible and only spend money they have you can take out loans to pay for a wedding or go into credit card debt the weekends were something she asked for in the future that isnt happening now you need to go and read the post again she works 66 5 days a week its not an abnormal work schedule and i repeat working until 6 pm doesnt make you an unfit parent yes even getting home at 7 pm fighting with your husband does not make you an unfit parent does it make you a good parent no but you seem to think if you arent a perfect parent a court will say oh nope you cant see your kids anymore they should go with their dad and that just isnt how it works understand this being a bad parent and an unfit parent are not the same thing and this woman is a bad parent but she is not an unfit mother the courts will not take her right to see her children away from her and make it so the father can leave the country with them hopefully the caps will get through your thick skull and if not im not going to keep explaining to you the basic concept of wanting something to be true does not make it true nah she sounds 19 definitely dont text him again im not judging for casual sex but dont let yourself be used for sex like that he isnt that interested and he would only agree to hang out because eh i guess she isnt bad enough not to fuck and i am horny and not because of you as a person you can use your hand or a toy and have a better time than that sorry he isnt interested it will likely happen with most guys you sleep with if it isnt an established relationshipclose to beforehand its okay to decide you are or arent okay with that reality but proceed accordingly in the future to what youre okay with it could be idk but i am unfortunately familiar with excessive gaming being because of an affair so i wont project but definitely a thing a way more common than i ever wanted to know thing but the rest of my comment stands affair or no affair doesnt seem to change the heart of the issue and her unwillingness to change said issues you can choose yourself and allow yourself to be happy shes chosen to be miserable it would seem you dont need to go along for that ride though trauma bonding and codependency are definitely a thing and wouldnt surprise me if it played a role here i feel for oop but i wish she treated herself better than to keep putting up with this much drama for what can be at best considered a difficult relationship i hope the wedding is uneventful for her sake hahaha well the idea of her cheating or not aside i think if you view your partner having an affair as an improvement you should take that as a pretty big sign that something is fundamentally broken in your relationship and if your partner is unwilling or unable to see and work towards fixing that then maybe the relationship isnt meant to work out its okay btw for you to leave youre right you dont deserve this and you cant make someone get help if shes refusing to make any changes it seems as though there is only two paths forward you both stay miserable or only she stays miserable maybe one day shell choose happiness but you cant choose that for her you can choose it for yourself though yeah op said there was nowhere else to park in the post and it was 2 am and they were tired plus honestly i personally wouldnt go the confrontation route too many crazy people in the world she literally works until 6 pm in the post most people get off work at 5 its an hour different most people arent unfit or unable to be there for their kids so the hour isnt going to change that she is absolutely abusive to her husband but none of that is directed at her kids you want to make it the same thing as being abusive to her kids and i get it really i do but it just isnt in the eyes of the law shes completely fit to be a mom this isnt about me saying she isnt abusive this is about me pointing out she is abusive to her husband not her kids there is no way she will be deemed unfit by a court so his choices are either stay in an abusive situation or leave to his home country if she wont willingly give up her kids then there may be a tough choice to be made i cant tell you how many tragic stories ive heard of women in the same positions who needed to escape abuse and their partners used the kids as a pawn if you dont understand this sad reality idk what to tell you absolutely be kind to yourself you can and should allow yourself to feel how you feel the panic attacks crying not eating thats real heartbreak even the constantly checking his location it isnt healthy but it is totally normal you can allow yourself to give into it for a bit but make sure to give yourself a hard deadline for fully indulging your sadness because you dont want to lose yourself in this you will survive this you will find someone else and they will make you forget the pain youre feeling now thats life and just remember youll make it through this whatever happens working until 6 pm and having a shitty marriage is not child abuse not by any legal definition which is all that will matter im sorry but youre just factually wrong about how a custody battle would look you can say what you think should happen until youre blue in the face but it just isnt how it works no judge will say this is abuse because it isnt working until 6 pm isnt not having time for your kids its called having a job its delusional to imply thats abusive its a fucking extra hour on the normal work schedule plenty of people work until 5 and have a 115 hour commute i just cannot fathom how you can intelligently argue working until 6 pm means you dont have time for your kids his support system is in another country he may not be able to afford to live in this country alone with his kids that means yes the options are either stay in an abusive situation or leave because unless his wife willing allows him to take the kids he cannot take the kids you want the world to work a certain way and i get that but it doesnt lmao yeah the sub that notoriously has a huge gender bias against men having a huge gender bias against men is shocking your partner telling you no planning a bunch of activities to prevent you from being able to and then using your kids as a pawn to prevent you from having any free time to go see your friend because shes not comfortable going on the activities alone isnt controlling to you wtf of course that is the wife always plans the trips again imagine its because she forces herself in that role and doesnt allow op to plan things which is a pretty fair assumption with her blatantly telling him no when he asks to plan something here op asks to make time for his friend she flat out just says no and then makes it virtually impossible for him to actually go and do it on his own otherwise hell be the reason why his kids cant go do xyz for fun you cannot genuinely tell me if a man did that to his wife you wouldnt be waving the red flag and honestly if you cant see how easily this is just a controlling partner then this conversation is pointless anyway because its pretty apparent to anyone who looks at behavior more than gender have a good day now really you think thats less evidence of her being controlling that is the evidence for her being controlling just because hes a man and shes a woman lets not act like that changes anything they very obviously only invited op because they know shes really good at planning and researching for these sort of trips it was about what she provides not her presence its a road trip they clearly arent driving to get to a destination theyre driving to enjoy and experience the journey so its not the same as lets get a bit of sustenance its lets see what x city has to offer thats not a reason why they couldnt plan things though its a 20 hour road trip at that point it seems rather obvious that part of the vacation is the driving and in that case yes i think its fair to want something more than mcdonalds you dont go to hawaii and do nothing but eat fast food ya know with gas car rentals hotels and food its definitely cheaper to fly if its a 20 hour trip so for sure this is supposed to be part of the experience for them and experience which they absolutely only invited op on to plan things for them and they need to be adults and ya know plan things themselves its good you recognized this is most likely heading towards a breakup i think its best to prepare yourself for it being a breakup and all of your emotions are natural you can give yourself a few weeks to grieve a 5 year relationship and make sure that next week you are firm in we are either together and you are in therapy working towards sorting yourself out or we are done and nc because anything else is going to destroy you and you need to look out for your mental health he might be happier right now hes got friends around booze and feels a lot less pressure to be happy or act a certain way it sucks it isnt your fault you need to trust that this is part of his journey and isnt a reflection of you necessarily im sorry youre going through this be careful to let yourself feel the hurt while also cutting yourself off once its officially
