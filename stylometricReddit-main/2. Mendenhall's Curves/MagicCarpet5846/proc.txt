tell your next closest friend shes the new invite op representative because clearly old friend cant handle it 

obviously word it way more professionally than that but seriously tell them to stop letting him invite you because he isnt and you want to join them next time so ask someone else to take up the reigns
you literally just tell the girls hey i would love to join you guys next time looks like friend keeps not inviting me for some reason how about next time you all want me to join you invite me and ill be there

stop letting your friend be the gatekeeper of your invite you were clearly getting invited by someone else before have them take the lead back up unfortunately you learned this guy isnt your friend anymore but youre his boss you gotta be professional i would just distance yourself and make sure to keep being the cool boss to everyone else this reeks of i want to sabotage you and take your job
i mean you really just have to pick your girlfriend or your friends because if you dont break up with the girlfriend immediately after this none of these people will ever her over again and most likely will distance or drop you entirely
my point was if hes getting tested regularly it seems without a doubt he made sure she was tested early on and was negative
i never said you shouldnt but the reality is most dont so anyone who is subscribing to regular texting even in a relationship would be conscious enough to ask a partner about their std status early on and make sure they were tested recently
idk man if hes getting tested while in a relationship you would think hes the type to ask about stds beforehand
she sounds racist i know your type ill bet op is not white and the kids are potentially mixed and more white passing than she is
im assuming its racism not classism
maybe call the police and actual professionals rather than posting on reddit
it just makes it so you can fully focus on moving on you dont have a reminder in your life of what you lost or what could have been you wouldnt be constantly putting yourself through little moments of longing and sadness no contact is definitely meant for times like this because otherwise youre never going to be able to fully let the past be the past if it really isnt past
yeah shes going to totally fuck up her relationship with her kid by tracking her losing trust when she inevitably breaks the rules and potentially ends up in legal issues or needing to call the police 

some damage cant be undone she shouldnt risk it because shes already playing with fire saying shell show up randomly at her daughters job especially because it sounds like this may be or turn into an abusive or otherwise toxic relationship not enabling it while preserving the relationship as much as possible is the smartest and most parental action to take
you likely need to simply take the car away from her in its entirety dont track your 22 year old daughter simply say its really clear youre not okay with following these rules and i dont want my trust in you to be damaged when you break them so you need to find a new way to get to work from now on because youve both lost access to the car im sorry but im not letting this situation escalate further

you can seriously damage your daughters trust in you  by tracking her and im sure it wont feel nice to be confronted with how far your daughter is willing to lie to you over a guy she just met dont make things worse make sure she can trust in you as much as possible should anything happen with this guy just dont enable her to be taken advantage of but be her mom not a police warden
would
she was a 362434 55 and 118 lbs at 19 which would probably make her a size 24 on todays standards at least when she was a teen i would imagine she filled out a little bit as she grew and ended up maybe a 68 which is still a perfectly healthy and beautiful size
you dont need a tourist visa for us or canada just a passport
i would be very honest with her that you cant stop her from going through with it but if she does that you cant promise it wont lead to divorce it sounds like shes scared as id make the argument you two were actively trying for kids if you werent using any actual birth control and actively were discussing kids i dont see this changing in a few years she can make the choice but she should do so understanding that it will end the marriage it does you both a disservice to pretend to be more supportive than you are itll make her feel blinded and could potentially influence her into a decision you are all unhappy with in the end you can make your feelings known so she can make an informed decision
wanting to murder someone is not normal just because youre 90 lbs and a teenager does not make anything youre saying okay get help i am not engaging in this anymore
you need help he will break up with you and if you dont speak to a therapist youll end up in jail because it wont be anyone manipulating him itll be him realizing hes dating a deeply unwell person
if hes joking why didnt he apologize
nothing youre feeling right now is normal please speak to a professional or at least a trusted adult about how youre feeling
and if youre wrong what if he breaks up with you what will you do to him
i wouldnt entertain that mindset most relationships at 17 dont last forever theres a very real prospect of you not being with him your life should continue beyond that
okay you definitely need some therapy because that attitude is deeply disturbing get some help youre only 17 so i get it but you wont be well if you keep entertaining such an exceptionally toxic mindset what will you do if he breaks up with you
that doesnt work the way you think it does in the real world youll end up dead if you have that attitude
wild that youd risk tax fraud for the same money either way
he cant work in japan with the proper visa if he plays theres no way it doesnt catch the attention of japanese officials and eg gets in trouble sure if he needed to do a business meeting for an hour with 5 people he might be able to get away with it but not an international televised event
it was more like we arent getting results worth the price we are paying so they dropped him cant really give a guy a demotion its either keep paying the salary or cut him and they clearly made the right call im sure if the org was totally flush with cash they wouldnt have made such a fast decision but multiple people in the org have also said the team wasnt doing well leading up to the decision either
because they are all teenagers who fail to understand that an expenditure report isnt just reporting pure salaries its reporting the cost to the company which will be at least 50100 more than the employee salaries and could be 34x depending on other overhead costs involved
i will also remind you that when running a company expenses tend to run 50100 of the salaries of your employees meaning you can likely half the expenditures if youre trying to figure out what portion of the total cost is on pure salaries the players see rather than the overhead involved in taxes benefits lawyers offices equipment etc

the number seems wrong because youre assuming that 100 of the cost of a team is player salaries and it typically isnt not from the perspective of the company theyll factor in at a minimum the taxes benefits and other comp package costs and theyll also need to have some additional overhead to keep everything running that will be summed in these expenditure reports
nta but youre going to need to tell them youre changing the password on x date before the change takes effect and theyll either need their own account or lose the service then as you dont want to run the risk of unknown numbers of households being charged to your account if anyone shares the password so no one but you will have it from now on
if youre inclined to say anything and only if youre an active part of the conversations i would just respond with its not that we suck youre just really good at hitting some insane shots im good for a casual player but those are some shots even the pros struggle to hit consistently

kill them with kindness reframe things as beginners luck and encourage them to keep it up more than them really sucking and you lying about your skills
best advice is telling anyone involved not to give you any information about his life you can always give the gf a heads up and say you dont have any proof so you just want to give her a heads up so she is cautious about any other red flags and then keep doing what youve been doing the sad thing is good doesnt always prevail sometimes evil wins the best we can do is try to combat it and not feed into it
if you have any articles or police reports or arrest records id probably anonymously send it to her and then let her make her own decisions
my guess is she found it funny or acceptable before but youve essentially described yourself as an asshole people like being around shes 18 i assume shes growing up and realizing she really doesnt want to be the person that loves hanging out with assholes and thats why shes putting some distance ill give you a heads up there are definitely people out there that find what you are describing totally normal and acceptable behavior but as you get older especially in modern society the number of people who do find that acceptable will rapidly dwindle if i were you id keep that in mind im not saying to completely shift your personality overnight but youre only 18 if you can try to be the person who grows up with their peers and doesnt get stuck in the assholes are cool phase of life
what are you on about not many employers would let you take off 3 days during busy season with a few weeks notice
in the case of you being weak then i really would not default to violence like this as youre essentially running the risk of if that hair pin doesnt make them back down you have no further defensive options and youve just royally pissed someone off youre putting yourself in significantly more danger this way be safe
i mean i think the sad reality is if you turn to violence any time a dude disrespects your boundaries youre going to find yourself in trouble or seriously hurt i would probably default to less violent means but taking selfdense classes and knowing how to properly defend yourself against a genuine attack rather than a standard creep is good 

i understand how unfair it is but the reality is women are going to be subjected to an onslaught of creepy guys who will push boundaries and touch you without consent like that violence is sending a very clear message you arent okay with it and where high school boys are concerned yeah theyll probably be shocked someone is so forceful and leave you alone but other people might call the police against you and the reality is if theyre the one bleeding you might get a cop that sides with them even worse unless youre fully able to defend yourself you may make someone angry enough to seriously hurt you or teach you a lesson you said in a comment youre weak but fast so please be smart and safe about when to act in self defense
people can change dont act as though what someone said three years ago is what theyre beholden to for life
i mean why do you have an issue with him giving an ultimatum you two did discuss it and you responded by essentially saying well i can still meet someone i like more than you even if its a closed relationship so we might as well keep it open not exactly comforting 

hes laying out his boundaries on what he needs to feel like a long distance relationship will work the discussion really is that simple i need xyz and you either say i can agree to that and you two continue dating or i cant agree to that and you break up it really sounds like what you want is a chance to convince him that an open relationship while living in portugal is fine otherwise whats the difference in how he opened up the second conversation hes being clear and expediting the discussion it can be really damaging to trust to try to convince someone why you still want an open relationship and he wants a closed one 

at this point the ball is in your court if youre telling the truth that youre fine with closing the relationship then you should have no issue with his ultimatum because ultimately it isnt an ultimatum its just him communicating and establishing really clear boundaries which is the only way an open relationship has even lasted thus far
lowkey would expect her to just move to a major city which i mean thats probably what they should do
you should consult about the actual eviction process and start it that means giving notice in writing usually and being aware of next steps if they refuse itll be different since you live there as well and own so a lawyer specializing in landlord tenant disputes will help you out
i mean you just tell him i will not be getting pregnant until we have a baby name picked out if you really are this stubborn i will be going to get an implant in this week this is a hard boundary for me i am not going to endanger my life with a stressful pregnancy because youre too stubborn to compromise like an adult and i refuse to bring a child into the world with someone who thinks thats acceptable behavior
i think he thinks now that youre married youre not going to leave its normal and common for military to cheat on their spouses not everyone but obviously your husband is one of them you can choose to be a stereotype or refuse to partake but sounds like those are your only options
sean isnt on 100t im pretty sure hes on corrected to shopify rebellion as a content creator
i think you need to accept that not being okay with something isnt just grumbling about it and going along with what he says in the end its making a clear statement with actions behind it if i am only paying my share if that isnt okay with you we need to split because at the end of the day you are okay with it because youve stayed for four years of this love yourself more youre definitely being taken advantage of again
this isnt really a case of being wrong so much as you need to start respecting yourself is this really what you want in a life partner someone who is using you to subsidize their life despite making more than you i mean hes selfish at best and totally and plainly using you at worst
your friends were directly asked not to tell you your exs business you never asked your friends to keep info from your ex in the same manner it isnt really fair to say they chose her i also assume that since everyone of them knew they were dating these may have started out as your friends but along the duration of your marriage and you moving they became mutual friends to both of you
tell her she deserves to know shes being pursued by a cheater you owe him nothing and by telling her itll hopefully give him a reason to stay tf away from you
holy shit nta im not going to diagnose anyone but you probably should not remain in contact with a woman who has even less control over her own behavior than you she likely has her own unaddressed struggles but you need to look out for you and i cant imagine it would be easy to modulate your behavior well when someone is constantly forcing perfection or utter insanity upon your life
i would honestly think of it this way you would inevitably lose him anyway its better to lose him and gain a kind hearted man in your boyfriend than lose your boyfriend only to become bitter when your dad inevitably abandons you in the future
i mean i think its her right to decide if she wants to share that information with you or not people saying their loyalty is to her and not you isnt really that fair as she directly asked them not to tell you whereas i dont think you did something similar the only person i think its fair to have an issue with is m28 as he was in a situation to tell you himself or to ask your ex to tell you 

i personally would just say to m28 hey im not mad at you for dating ex but i gotta be honest that it makes me uncomfortable that you listened to me talk about my experiences knowing you were with my ex i just want to clear the air so we can move forward without it being awkward you can decide you want to ditch the whole friend group but that seems like its punishing you more than them id just chalk this up to what happens when you have a lot of mutual friends it isnt their place to share news that they were explicitly told not to share
well were you aware your husband was wearing that jersey or did you genuinely have no idea this was a jersey let alone a signed jersey until after he got upset with you

if you were aware beforehand ofc youre the ah your kid vomiting doesnt suddenly shut down all higher level thinking in your brain you cant possible argue it isnt your fault for not having the common sense of i need to get a towel because my husbands jersey isnt an appropriate vomit rag
nta fhv is highly transmissible and can cause tons of issues in kitties you have to know if either of your cats has it before moving in together and if only one does you two shouldnt move in together
im gunna take a guess and say youve made similar comments in the past because calling this a lie is a pretty strong word it seems pretty clear you dont trust him especially since you just said its fair he wants someone who trusts him and not that he has someone who trusts him if you dont trust him and he knows you dont trust him why wouldnt he call of the wedding
most likely women in his culture say similar things too and once theyre stuck in marriage kowtow to tradition idk where hes from but i have seen it in some other cultures so he pretended to be okay with everything youre saying because he figured it wouldnt matter when you were stuck in the marriage 


now its up to you to decide was he right
its common yeah are the guys youre attracted to very different from you or something because i mean i can imagine this happening if youre going after the sort of guy who goes after different girls and this is just a we have very different types situation
probably would see what you can do to reduce your hours so that you can show her with action that youre serious about making a change the issue is you work too much so work less make a change give her quality time not fancy gifts or expensive dates she wants to go on hikes or weekend beach trips with you she wants to make dinner together and fall asleep together not get fancy jewelry or a giant bouquet of roses sure thats nice too but if you try to throw money at the problem rather than make actionable changes in your behavior shes gone for good
i mean you said hes an immigrant is this normal in his culture because it could also just be that this is what having a wife means to him and if thats the case run
out of curiosity why are you not asking your fianc to handle this youre taking care of 95 of wedding planning and youre the one that needs to move in to care for his grandma girl you gotta make sure this man is an actual adult and capable of taking control of his own life his own family and his own relationship and not just throwing everything on you because it he isnt mark my words your marriage will end you will not be able to withstand being the manager of both of your lives forever
being understaffed on a particular night doesnt mean anything about retaining staff someone who worked in a restaurant should know the difference it was a saturday night having 12 people call off sick could and often does make a restaurant understaffed says absolutely nothing about the ability of the restaurant to maintain staff
ah yes please mansplain how people who say i take home well over 6 figures somehow know less about their own salary than you because you happened to have worked in a restaurant even though im talking about a fine dining restaurant on the level of 1600 meals being normal on not just servers in general 

but go off i guess you know more than people do about their own jobs guess what was also a restaurant manager some make over 6 figures its not unrealistic or even that uncommon in fine dining
sorry fam he isnt changing for you or your kid accept him as he is or decide you want something different changing someone isnt happening especially not after 5 months
you may understand tipping but you dont understand math if you are making 100hour you need to work less than 20 hours a week to make 6 figures shes making well over 100 an hour because this is just one table and if you dont believe me google it the articles are out there it is 100 realistic and common in fine dining waitresswaiter makes 6 figures a year hundreds of threads and articles and amas pop up immediately
dang fam you got rejected by the person you let walk all over you and begged for more i would take this as a wake up call that youre really struggling with your self esteem and having any amount of selfrespect for yourself

if i were you i would be asking myself why on earth i still want this to be salvaged because i mean shes never been loyal to you never never wanted to never will and is now isnt even getting enough from this to want to stay it sucks but wake up man you deserve better
you cant be that dense shes making at least 100hour on one table and no server at a high end restaurant handled one table at a time waitresses do not care if their money comes from the job itself or customers and there is no way theyre complaining about the pay because frankly theyre highly overcompensated here

servers at even slightly fancy restaurants let alone one of this level routinely say the real reason they dont want tipping culture to change is because they make 6 figures and know damn well the job isnt a job worth 6 figures and if it were changed to a salaried position paid for by the employer theyd be making 2025hour flat rate instead of potentially hundreds of dollars an hour
nta its insane anyone would think a waitress should be making well over 150hour and if theyre serving a normal number of tables the real figure would be at least double that yeah they should get a livable wage it isnt a job worth more than engineers lawyers and even some doctors are paid sorry but the expectations of someone without any qualifications being entitled to that kind of salary is utterly insane to me
waitresses dont need to be making 100 dollars an hour for shitty service and thats assuming that was her only table which it obviously wasnt if them being busy and understaffed was the underlying reason for poor service 

sorry but a waitress even at the highest end of restaurants and the best of service should not be making more than most lawyers engineers and even some doctors make
we dont know if sil made the rule or if family did we at least know sil isnt putting a stop to it though
reaffirming this isnt how men are this is how shitty unhappy people are 

how to address it be honest i have a feeling youre planning on proposing soon and before we discuss marriage we need to have a serious conversation i am and have been unhappy and have not felt like my needs are being met for awhile now ive tried to delicately bring it up to you and it ended really tensely so i dropped it but i cant marry someone i dont feel loves me and isnt putting in effort in maintaining the spark i know weve been together awhile and its easy to get comfortable but i want more for my life than that i hope you do too i would love to go to a couples therapist if youre open to it so we can try to talk and find ways to reconnect but this isnt a dynamic i will be happy in forever and i want our marriage to last forever
were you tested for hiv because i looked up all of those drugs and they seem to be commonly used in treating secondary infections associated with hiv i would likely have your partner get a full and i mean full std panel and have him show you the results assuming he is fully clean then you can decide if you think your unhappiness is truly just a state of mind or not i cant tell you to choose happiness but i will remind you your daughters are learning from the example you set so act accordingly to what youd want them to do in the same situation
zitrolin appears to be azithromycin most commonly used to treat chlamydia and gonorrhea flucoral appears to be fluconazole and most commonly used to treat yeast infections or secondary infections with hiv herclov seems to be used for genital herpes in immunocompromised patients with hiv 

given the fact that two of these are given to treat secondary infections due to hiv and one is a general wide spectrum antibiotic your partner having a history of shady behavior at best and they all treat different genital infections your partner very well may have and is hiding hiv from you or had an unsafe exposure and went to the doctor to get treatment for a number of sexually transmitted pathogens this is all information ive gathered from looking up the drugs and isnt medical advice but you need to be very concerned because i do not imagine this combination of drugs being given just because of an old herpes flare up im not familiar with how drugs are prescribed in the regions it says these drugs are available though
 you didnt ask him if he was clean and when he was last tested before sleeping with him lady no offense but youre way too old to be so dumb and fast and loose with your own health at this point you need to decide if youre happy in this relationship exactly as it is or if you arent if you arent i would recognize you are a 44 year old woman and old enough to be able to stand up for yourself and say im not happy its better for us to go our separate ways and stop teaching your daughters that this is the relationship that they should aim for
lol oh my god i only lied to you once and i cant believe youre doing this you dont love me

youre damn fucking right i do not love someone who would so willingly endanger the lives of mothers and children on the road because youre too much of a fuck up to call an uber home the fact that completely sober he has no remorse and can say that to a nurse who very well may have real trauma surrounding the consequences of drunk driving shows that if anyone in this world is actually unloveable it might be him  

i would honestly question the moral integrity of anyone who told me they actually did still love someone who pulled this sort of shit
nah i disagree rather strongly a girlfriend of 3 years absolutely gets to say if you want this relationship to continue you need to divorce your wife and i need to see proof

do you know how many women believed the whole bullshit of were separated well get a divorce eventually she doesnt even live around here to find him married with a baby on the way not saying thats the case here but the gf would and frankly is for letting it go on so long be an idiot for not wanting the divorce to be official by now and for wanting to know without a doubt that it is a real divorce i mean you need to give your partner some faith and trust but 3 years into a relationship and 5 years after a separation sorry theres trust and then theres being a fool she still shouldnt force herself to be at the courthouse but this is absolutely 100 her business this isnt a new relationship this is in the territory of trying to decide if i can or want to spend my life with this person territory and at that point yeah a major decision of hmmmm should i continue being a married man with a serious girlfriend becomes your business as said serious girlfriend 

utterly ridiculous to claim it isnt her business or that its at all similar to her influencing his will
 i really dont think its fair to say a gf of three years should have no say and should keep out of the fact that shes dating a legally married man she definitely is fully within her rights to wonder why after 5 years neither of them has finally said hey this marriage is obviously over lets make it official because even knowing and believing op that theres no feelings i am wondering how five years later and multiple state moves this hasnt been made official i mean shes had to get licenses and file for new jobs completely divorced is saying shes married it is definitely weird it would definitely get a side eye and some questions from any rational selfrespecting person

lets not make a completely valid concern of the girlfriend into an issue of insecurities because thats also harmful to women if i was dating someone separated and three years later they were still just separated omg everyone in my support system would be shaking me to snap out of it and leave
i would just say this is a legal process and the lawyers have advised me to only have us and a lawyer there to take care of things as amicably and quickly as possible i will see you immediately after and we can celebrate but im going to take their advice here to make sure this happens and happens quickly i am ready to close this chapter fully
 could be how
i dont think youre breaking up for your son and you need to stop framing it that way youre breaking up because of you and knowing youre unhappy its also true that youre putting your son in the middle of a seemingly unhealthy relationship but you should not make your child bear the burden of ending your relationship own that decision yourself
nta but you need to handle this very delicately so i am glad youre excited and willing to support me in this journey and i am willing to pay up to 4kmonth for our home we can get a really nice place for 4kmonth and i would be willing to pay the entirety of the rent because im so happy to have you join me on this adventure but if you want a place thats more than 4k you need to be willing to pay the difference because i am not willing to spend any more than 4k if the place you want is 5k or 10kmonth i dont really care you need to pick a place where youre comfortable with paying that difference otherwise it feels like you want to spend all of the extra money im making and that would make this move totally pointless for me i want to save and i want to continue being responsible i need to know that you are i are on the same page here financially before we make this move because otherwise i honestly dont see the relationship working out long term if we are on such different wavelengths when it comes to finances


also not to be that guy but you can definitely get a nice place in a good part of town for 45kmonth in any city i lived in a good part of la for 3kmonth in a giant 1bd apartment with high ceilings and i lived overlooking the river in manhattan in a luxury small but extremely nice and plenty for a couple that isnt working from home apartment for 5kmonth and had a 2 bd apartment in the upper east side for 6kmonth again luxury building 

yeah youre still living like a normal well off person you arent getting a mansion with 8 bathrooms but holy shit you dont need that especially if you her arent making enough to afford it and i specifically picked the prices for la and nyc because i know its two of the most expensive cities you can live in so absolutely bullshit you need an 810kmonth apartment for a couple with no kidspets where a 1 bed would be plenty and a 2 bd is excess if you want guests in order to live in a nice place without high crime your budget is plenty assuming you arent looking to live like a millionaire finding his trophy wifes lifestyle 

she needs to learn to make choices she cant have everything
have you just say her down and said hey ive noticed this pattern and every time i try to talk to you about it you shut it down so the options are we either address it now or we need to break up because this isnt fair to me nor is the lack of communication an attractive trait to me
i think the issue is asking at all is going to damage your rep the same amount as trying to force her at this point if you no longer have any mutual in common no worries but otherwise i wouldnt
i mean that just mean another day of childcare instead sending the message after she had to leave of hey daughter is lovely but im not comfortable having a child in my home unsupervised for safety reasons and i cant guarantee ill be home all day while youre here so if youre unable to find childcare for daughter i dont mind you taking the day off with just a heads up thanks for understanding
thats probably the whole my toddler is still a toddler and isnt 100 perfect but we do try very hard to make sure they understand how to behave thing op was getting on yeah a baby is still going to be a baby sometimes but that doesnt mean good parenting and bad parenting wont produce on average wildly different behavior in children
youre not an ah but you do need to bite the bullet next time they ask just say im sorry but every time our toddler and their kids get together toddler gets sick we need to look after her health first so until all of them are older and have stronger immune systems ie better behaved or you have time to find a better reason we dont feel comfortable doing hang outs
you can also use olive oil followed up by her face wash to remove the oil then you can teach about skin care routines to promote natural beauty as thats a super diy two step cleanse the oils help gently break up the makeup and then the face wash removes the oils
i mean youre both being childish blowing up his phone is also the immature response because a mature and selfrespecting woman would simply say when youre ready to talk let me know so we can arrange to give each other back the stuff at our places and never tolerate this behavior from a boyfriend
this is not a friend is it because if he is genuinely just a friend you honestly need to back off youre coming off like a clingy gf
ok well if you genuinely believe that you are delusional because this was absolutely meant to be malicious and controlling

you need to snap out of whatever trance this dude has put you on before you end up a shell of yourself
nta just say her name wont be anything after your mom you can either sit here and figure out a name we both agree to or i will be taking your refusal as permission to unilaterally choose the name as i am her mother and carried her in my womb for 9 months you can pick whatever you want of those two options but those are your only two options compromise or get no say
i mean hes naturally a flirt he seems not to think of you as the special woman in his life but as though all women need to be blessed by his attention 

ill say i have known people like this and yes they ended up all cheatingleaving for someone else that isnt a comment necessarily on your boyfriend but what ive seen from people who are flirty and everyone likes them
 nta you asked what to do you do nothing remind him if you want to care for your brother i will get a job to support us and you can take care of baby and him thats your options i am unable and unwilling to take on that role and i have made that very clear it will go very poorly for you if you try to force this on me and will not end how you intend
it also reveals something about you your comments are coming off very obtuse at points you two are very obviously not on the same page yet you for some reason are unwilling to talk to him and get on the same page that sort of expectation will kill any marriage you do get around to so you may wanna up your ability to have difficult and awkward convos with your partner
give the cops a call
heads up your fiance is pretty willing to straight up lie to your face thats uh something you should look into before you marry her good intentioned or not thats not wife material right there
i mean did you actually ask him if he had any stds before having unprotected sex with him what he did is still likely illegal as usually hiv is a legally reportable disease to any sexual partners typically before any intercourse has occurred regardless of viral loading but also too many people assume a partner theyre exclusive with is automatically clean without asking the following 
do you have any stds or stis
when was the last time you were tested
before i feel comfortable having unprotected sex i want us to both get retested and send each other the results are you okay with that 

last one is optional but i have always done this it ensures that both of us were actually tested tested for everything not just chlamydia and gonorrhea and that no one is lying or asymptomatic or whatever and as an added bonus makes it really clear that if you ever do contract an std from them they without a doubt cheated and there is no well maybe it didnt show up yet crap
nah fam if he was able to remember you giving him a hall pass he was able to remember the three rules you gave him in the same conversation thats just a straight lie to try to blame it on the adhd
i dont even think a month has passed since hes left this sounds like it happened a few days ago
okay fam youre focusing on the wrong things here him wanting kids in the past is irrelevant he said he didnt want them now people change for a number of reasons if someone says i dont want kids you gotta focus on what theyre telling you not what you hope theyll want in the future and not what they wanted in the past you see how you messed up there

and unfortunately heres some more tough love if youre moving every 6 months to a new place every time i wouldnt picture yourself finding a long term relationship until youre able to settle down in one place guys are less likely than women to make a long distance thing work indefinitely that might also be playing a factor did this guy end things with you around when you had to move again is this info you tell the guys
he wanted kids with he because he was madly in love with her and not with you because he wasnt in love with you i get it hurts but youre not doing yourself any favors here
could be yeah might not be that either its impossible to know if he didnt tell you i dont think its worth your energy to figure out i think the big takeaway should be just because one particular individual was unable to love you does not mean you are unlovable in general and also dont date men who tell you they dont want kids

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

i mean a spark in the beginning can fade quickly and a spark for you is not a spark for him guys can also seem really excited for you when really they just like a new experience it can also just die for random reasons its called ick you are super into someone and then they do something could be as innocuous as bad breath fighting with a waitress stopping wearing makeup or a million other things and all of a sudden the physical chemistry is just dead 

but yes absolutely if you want kids and he doesnt that is enough for any man to immediately dip you need to be smart here and leave as soon as a man says he doesnt want kids because he isnt going to give you one and hell just dump you if you push it or happen to get pregnant kids are one of the biggest dealbreakers out there and can instantly kill a persons attraction to you

you will find a long term partner but it start by realizing dating is about finding someone youre compatible with and wasting time on someone you arent compatible with for instance someone who doesnt want kids or someone who isnt showing you any affectiontaking you on dates just means youre losing out on the possibility of finding the person you should actually end up with
ill give some tough love because youre 26 and its probably a lesson youd benefit from learning being wrong for a specific person does not necessarily mean there is something wrong with you in general yes i am sure there was a reason why he didnt fall in love with you maybe you did something that annoyed him maybe you have a different view on kids or retirement or whatever other fundamental goalbelief maybe you two just didnt have that spark physically whatever it is that is particular to him and your potential relationship with him not a comment on your worth as a person you kinda see the difference 

i know that i am an utterly amazing catch but i also know that i am wrong for a heck of a lot of people out there and they would never fall in love with me if we dated because we just arent right for each other does that make me as a person unloveable no definitely not it just means i found someone who wasnt my person thats what dating is though and unfortunately sometimes it takes a few months or years to figure out that someone isnt your person be glad it was only a few months and remember that someone deciding you arent whatwho they want is usually an individual thing and not a comment on your general worth
honestly i wouldnt be okay with my partner doing this either
lol yes blame the abuse victim for going back to his support system because hes a man
thank you for proving you cannot read because there was not a single curse in that comment 

no one said verbal abuse between parents doesnt affect kids i simply said abuse directed at the parents isnt treated as abuse directed at kids in the eyes of the law but you have made it crystal clear you have some utterly abhorrent reading comprehension so at least that makes sense why you dont understand the difference have a good day now
he is probably disenchanted with serious dating right now and likely wasnt very interested in you either if i had to take a guess he is having trouble finding and keeping someone he feels that intense chemistry with and has decided to only look for casual sex now its his journey and his burden to bear i wouldnt let it weigh too much on you youll find someone who treats you well but i would start by setting a higher bar for yourself than 6 months in and never being on a date
theres an exceptionally large difference between parking illegally in a private residential spot and an emergency services access area and you know it the issue is exactly that people who take a mild inconvenience and definitely ah behavior like taking someones assigned spot in an apartment and trying to inflate it to as bad a crime as indirectly leading to someones death worthy of the same punishment thank you for proving my point too many people dont know how to differentiate
nta this is when you say family doesnt take advantage of other family you used grandma and im not letting you use me too if you dont knock it off im blocking you all and any breaks you or your kids have been getting from me will end

and just stick to it be firm your uncle is a leech and will bleed you dry if you arent firm and willing to follow through with cutting him out entirely you wont keep that inheritance for long as hell find a way to suck it from you too
info its legal in your state why did he feel the need to hide this information if hes at the point where he feels shame for his habit its an addictiondependency and he needs professional intervention otherwise there is no reason to hide information with no legal repercussions from medical staff
well remember that not everyone is responsible and only spends the money they have this is how people end up with payday loans or tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt
you act like people are responsible and only spend money they have you can take out loans to pay for a wedding or go into credit card debt
the weekends were something she asked for in the future that isnt happening now you need to go and read the post again she works 66 5 days a week its not an abnormal work schedule and i repeat working until 6 pm doesnt make you an unfit parent yes even getting home at 7 pm fighting with your husband does not make you an unfit parent does it make you a good parent no but you seem to think if you arent a perfect parent a court will say oh nope you cant see your kids anymore they should go with their dad and that just isnt how it works 

understand this being a bad parent and an unfit parent are not the same thing and this woman is a bad parent but she is not an unfit mother the courts will not take her right to see her children away from her and make it so the father can leave the country with them 

hopefully the caps will get through your thick skull and if not im not going to keep explaining to you the basic concept of wanting something to be true does not make it true
nah she sounds 19
definitely dont text him again im not judging for casual sex but dont let yourself be used for sex like that he isnt that interested and he would only agree to hang out because eh i guess she isnt bad enough not to fuck and i am horny and not because of you as a person you can use your hand or a toy and have a better time than that sorry he isnt interested it will likely happen with most guys you sleep with if it isnt an established relationshipclose to beforehand its okay to decide you are or arent okay with that reality but proceed accordingly in the future to what youre okay with
it could be idk but i am unfortunately familiar with excessive gaming being because of an affair so i wont project but definitely a thing a way more common than i ever wanted to know thing 

but the rest of my comment stands affair or no affair doesnt seem to change the heart of the issue and her unwillingness to change said issues you can choose yourself and allow yourself to be happy shes chosen to be miserable it would seem you dont need to go along for that ride though
trauma bonding and codependency are definitely a thing and wouldnt surprise me if it played a role here i feel for oop but i wish she treated herself better than to keep putting up with this much drama for what can be at best considered a difficult relationship i hope the wedding is uneventful for her sake
hahaha well the idea of her cheating or not aside i think if you view your partner having an affair as an improvement you should take that as a pretty big sign that something is fundamentally broken in your relationship and if your partner is unwilling or unable to see and work towards fixing that then maybe the relationship isnt meant to work out

its okay btw for you to leave youre right you dont deserve this and you cant make someone get help if shes refusing to make any changes it seems as though there is only two paths forward you both stay miserable or only she stays miserable maybe one day shell choose happiness but you cant choose that for her you can choose it for yourself though
yeah op said there was nowhere else to park in the post and it was 2 am and they were tired plus honestly i personally wouldnt go the confrontation route too many crazy people in the world
she literally works until 6 pm in the post most people get off work at 5 its an hour different most people arent unfit or unable to be there for their kids so the hour isnt going to change that 

she is absolutely abusive to her husband but none of that is directed at her kids you want to make it the same thing as being abusive to her kids and i get it really i do but it just isnt in the eyes of the law shes completely fit to be a mom this isnt about me saying she isnt abusive this is about me pointing out she is abusive to her husband not her kids there is no way she will be deemed unfit by a court so his choices are either stay in an abusive situation or leave to his home country if she wont willingly give up her kids then there may be a tough choice to be made i cant tell you how many tragic stories ive heard of women in the same positions who needed to escape abuse and their partners used the kids as a pawn if you dont understand this sad reality idk what to tell you
absolutely be kind to yourself you can and should allow yourself to feel how you feel the panic attacks crying not eating thats real heartbreak even the constantly checking his location it isnt healthy but it is totally normal you can allow yourself to give into it for a bit but make sure to give yourself a hard deadline for fully indulging your sadness because you dont want to lose yourself in this you will survive this you will find someone else and they will make you forget the pain youre feeling now thats life and just remember youll make it through this whatever happens
working until 6 pm and having a shitty marriage is not child abuse not by any legal definition which is all that will matter im sorry but youre just factually wrong about how a custody battle would look you can say what you think should happen until youre blue in the face but it just isnt how it works no judge will say this is abuse because it isnt working until 6 pm isnt not having time for your kids its called having a job its delusional to imply thats abusive its a fucking extra hour on the normal work schedule plenty of people work until 5 and have a 115 hour commute i just cannot fathom how you can intelligently argue working until 6 pm means you dont have time for your kids 

his support system is in another country he may not be able to afford to live in this country alone with his kids that means yes the options are either stay in an abusive situation or leave because unless his wife willing allows him to take the kids he cannot take the kids you want the world to work a certain way and i get that but it doesnt
lmao yeah the sub that notoriously has a huge gender bias against men having a huge gender bias against men is shocking
your partner telling you no planning a bunch of activities to prevent you from being able to and then using your kids as a pawn to prevent you from having any free time to go see your friend because shes not comfortable going on the activities alone isnt controlling to you wtf of course that is the wife always plans the trips again imagine its because she forces herself in that role and doesnt allow op to plan things which is a pretty fair assumption with her blatantly telling him no when he asks to plan something here op asks to make time for his friend she flat out just says no and then makes it virtually impossible for him to actually go and do it on his own otherwise hell be the reason why his kids cant go do xyz for fun 

you cannot genuinely tell me if a man did that to his wife you wouldnt be waving the red flag and honestly if you cant see how easily this is just a controlling partner then this conversation is pointless anyway because its pretty apparent to anyone who looks at behavior more than gender have a good day now
 really you think thats less evidence of her being controlling that is the evidence for her being controlling just because hes a man and shes a woman lets not act like that changes anything
they very obviously only invited op because they know shes really good at planning and researching for these sort of trips it was about what she provides not her presence
its a road trip they clearly arent driving to get to a destination theyre driving to enjoy and experience the journey so its not the same as lets get a bit of sustenance its lets see what x city has to offer thats not a reason why they couldnt plan things though
its a 20 hour road trip at that point it seems rather obvious that part of the vacation is the driving and in that case yes i think its fair to want something more than mcdonalds you dont go to hawaii and do nothing but eat fast food ya know with gas car rentals hotels and food its definitely cheaper to fly if its a 20 hour trip so for sure this is supposed to be part of the experience for them 


and experience which they absolutely only invited op on to plan things for them and they need to be adults and ya know plan things themselves
its good you recognized this is most likely heading towards a breakup i think its best to prepare yourself for it being a breakup and all of your emotions are natural you can give yourself a few weeks to grieve a 5 year relationship and make sure that next week you are firm in we are either together and you are in therapy working towards sorting yourself out or we are done and nc because anything else is going to destroy you and you need to look out for your mental health 

he might be happier right now hes got friends around booze and feels a lot less pressure to be happy or act a certain way it sucks it isnt your fault you need to trust that this is part of his journey and isnt a reflection of you necessarily im sorry youre going through this be careful to let yourself feel the hurt while also cutting yourself off once its officially done from hurtful info his location his sm anything else that gives insight into his life moving forward it will only hurt
that is definitely not true i have known a number of people who meet a partner or fling or whatever you want to call it online playing video games never leaving their house
is she taking on the mental load or is she just a type a  personality and controlling because remember controlling people do exist and they can be women and it definitely sounds way more im doing things my way and you dont get a say rather than the typical nothing ever happens if i dont do everything and he never gives any input you see here
typically holier than thou redditor ego seeing as any rational human being knows having your car towed from a private property like that is going to be at least a few hundred bucks which unless youre quite wealthy is going to hurt at best and seriously endanger your financial wellbeing at worst dont park illegally but we also have no idea if this person got lost or what and the idea that we should treat any mistake as if its the end of the world acts as though people dont routinely make mistakes and they do some kindness and grace should be afforded for what is a normal human experience because even though you think well i would never do xyz that probably isnt as true as you think
you should sit him down outside of these moments and ask to talk about something with him honestly then say ive noticed a pattern lately well be talking and out of nowhere it seems like youll say im not funny and should stop trying to be funny but the reality is im not trying to be funny i have never tried to be funny this is just my personality and how i talk so it feels like youre not only criticizing my humor but also who i am its made me think and ive realized youve never even laughed at anything ive said and while i meant it when i said i never try to make you or anyone else laugh its made me think you dont enjoy me or my company much and thats becoming an issue for me we need to address so im hoping we can have an open discussion about whats been going on
eh its also been 3 months i dont really think you can conclusively say anything about what this other woman does or doesnt know
well have the conversation again and next time she replies with that just say okay then its clear the relationship isnt working out lets part ways shes either bluffing in which case you need to call it out or she isnt bluffing and its only a matter of time before she breaks up with you so might as well beat her to it and leave with your dignity
you literally just tell her plainly if this is how you feel we need to break up if you still want to stay together you need to stop the comments which one and make her pick and hold her to whatever she picks if she refuses to pick tell her youve picked for her and its over 

stop being so passive and firmly shut the behavior down and if she doesnt back down you end it pretty easy way to show someone what you will and wont tolerate
i think you just need to communicate with her are you really this unsure about our relationship because if you are i think we should end things now it isnt fair to either of us to stay in a relationship where youre having this much doubts and if you arent that unsure you need to really be mindful of your language because its starting to feel like you dont want to be with me and at this point its honestly making it difficult for me to want to continue seeing you 

and then see where the conversation goes but really if she doesnt say hey youre right this was super uncool behavior im sorry and ill work on it you probably should just end things sooner rather than later as its pretty obvious this isnt a relationship made to stand the test of time so if marriage is a goal of yours why even bother here anymore move on to someone who will be sure of you
lmao props to you for not even blinking at the ultimate manipulation your family tried to play and just shutting it down so hard even the cops breaking up a house party would be impressed
he was also very likely getting ready to end it if op hadnt im unhappy in our relationship means if you dont change im out
youre aware your opinion doesnt change how courts sometimes handle these situations right no it isnt okay but generally unless the kids are in physical danger courts try to keep both parents in their life the husband wouldnt be able to get her deemed unfit and take them out of the country this isnt a comment on how things should be but a reminder that unfortunately no she is not unfit to be a mother and unfortunately if the husbands support system is in another country he wont really be able to take his kids with him unless the wife will allow it and she doesnt seem the type to do so freely
you did though what do you think saying someone is unfit to be a mother means
also 300 m2 isnt really big enough for two separate families i dont know if you are currently or ever plan to have a family or even just a partnerpet but while 300 m2 is good for you and your needs it isnt really a two family house as a permanent set up which this obviously would be
that is definitely not how it works plenty of parents work until 6 pm 5 days a week and arent forbidden from seeing their kids thats insane to suggest

and even her abuse means nothing if it isnt provably directed towards her children family custody battles unfortunately are notorious for failing to take into consideration abuse of a partner when deciding custody if she gets even partial custody he cant just move them out of the country
might not be an option abusive partners often dont just let you walk away with their children and i dont think he would legally be able to just take them without a custody arrangement to another country unfortunately leaving an abusive relationship isnt always easy and there isnt always an easy solution when someone wants to make your life miserable and willing to use your children as pawns just to hurtcontrol you
sure but theres also plenty of free porn too that doesnt stop people from paying the thousands of gothwhatever other category of girl on of out there
does abuse actually change things though its an unfortunate situation but i dont think it changes the issue of op wants time alone with his family and doesnt want to be paying for things for harper like a father figure would thats an acceptable boundary to have yes even if abuse is at play after all if jennifer is aware enough to tell amber there is abuse at play shes aware enough to also know that she shouldnt be staying and exposing her kid to that environment
you do you but its unreasonable to suggest you wont even leave your house until your long term boyfriend is where he said he would meet you
trying without any belief it will change isnt trying its going through the motions
therapy is a joke because youve decided its a joke of course if you go into something convinced it will never help it wont help  thats like thinking everyone will break up with you you make yourself so miserable to be around it becomes a selffulfilling prophecy
he cheated on you and feels guilty
op said she was living with this guy talking about fantasies of marriage and shes also extremely close to this cousin the cousin knew op had a pregnancy scare with her summer fling she just didnt have a name or a face apparently which feels so weird to me possible absolutely just so weird
ok pause youre saying youre still not over the ex you had at 22 its time for therapy no you arent unlovable but you are stagnating yourself its okay not to be over him but you need help its time to love yourself enough to get it
i think you need to be honest with her and be very very blunt hey friend sorry to message but i didnt want to wait until closer to the wedding i love you and want to support you as much as i can on your special day but i have a very hard budget for how much i can spend in total on the wedding its x ive already contributed y i wanted to be really clear that from now on i cant contribute anything else and i am not comfortable asking people who dont know you to come to any paid events if you no longer want me to be a bridesmaid i will step down and be a regular guest because i dont want to be a source of stress for you but ive felt a lot of pressure to spend more than i am able to and while i understand its unintentional i want to be really transparent with you

and then go from there
you would be incredibly selfish to message him knowing he is in a relationship let him move on if they break up and youre still single and feel this way reach out but know your place do not invite that sort of bad karma into the world
id do it over facetime in your backyard garage or even walking to a park
just tell him then i want a kid and that hasnt changed if youve changed youre mind thats youre right but were no longer compatible i hope we can split quickly and amicably as i wish you no ill will but am firm on what i want in life
for either side shes allowed to be willing to die on this hill but honestly if she knew her sibling was at risk and knew she was offering a safe haven that should have been a conversation she had with her boyfriend long before it came to fruition then they couldve had the discussion and had a plan and he wouldnt have felt like an outsider in his own home
to be honest i would figure out if you can move on from this if you cant and no one would blame you simply tell her you found her notes and want a divorce but decide beforehand i would either accept it and leave it be or tell her youre looking for a divorce but i wouldnt tell her what you found and expect your marriage to survive
i mean hey if youve decided how you want to handle it go ahead i hope it goes as well as it can
well she very realistically may be sacrificing her relationship she seems okay with it but she shouldve been more upfront about her priorities
look fam if youre willing to be dumped over this go ahead but fully understand that youre in the wrong here not him you always communicate beforehand even if the answer is i am helping my sibling and if you are unwilling to support me in this its a dealbreaker but you need to have that conversation first hed be a fool to propose to a woman who cant even respect him enough to give him a phone call before agreeing your sibling can wait another 20 minutes
yeah but even before all that how did op know her cousin was in the same school and major yet never mention his name to the cousin or so much as a picture i know my closest friends partners names and faces well enough that i would definitely recognize them if they showed up in my physics class
dont even wait 3 days tell her she needs to get a job and start contributing let her start the divorce herself
if you want to protect yourself you get in front of it dont just wait for him to decide hes built a strong enough case instead strike first
info have you contacted the school and asked for an exception because most schools will give out more than the two tickets if you ask
i mean the reality is what other choice does she have live in her car she has no family or friends around is attending a school with poor resources and doesnt make enough to easily afford a new place sometimes you have to act ignorant for self preservation not everyone has the luxury to immediately and shamelessly leave shitty situations
idk man the facts here i see no way for op to go hey you need to pay for a new place for me and the grandma to go oh okay here you go i mean like i guess maybe she could but i very much doubt it especially because ops boyfriend would likely step in and even if he didnt i dont really see a world where a landlord is legally required to provide alternative accommodation and legally unable to simply terminate the lease hence it being a situation that would likely require a legal battle if theres even any chance of success which im dubious of i dont really care to get into a back and forth on hypothetical legal situations though suffice to say ops housing situation sounds on borrowed time so shes better off focusing on that right now and only then looking into anything else if shes so inclined because im sure if she tried anything legal with her boyfriends elderly grandmother unless she has backup accommodations right then and there he isnt going to continue living with her as she tries to sue his grandma or even send a strongly worded legal letter
definitely op needs to learn renters rights and how to protect herself but at this point in time she probably has much more pressing matters than any potential recourse rethe old apartment sometimes unfortunately you learn lessons the hard way long expensive and complicated legal battles arent always the answer
theres a good chance it wouldnt go anywhere landlords are under no obligation to inform you about renters insurance thats your own responsibility to limit your own liability some places landlords can require it but ive never heard of anywhere saying a landlord needs to usually the way the law is written a landlord either needs to repair the damage or if the place is uninhabitable they can terminate the lease which it sounds like is what she likely did i obviously dont know the law everywhere but dont feel bad about not wanting to pursue anything legally as i cant imagine a judge seeing i didnt know i needed insurance why didnt anyone tell me as a very good excuse
im sure it depends but if the place is uninhabitable the landlord is allowed usually to just end the lease which is what it sounds like she did typically landlords are only under obligation for their home to be habitable and in the case where it isnt end the lease not to provide adequate housing elsewhere if their accommodations are uninhabitable renters insurance is what provides accommodation if yours is unavailable and its definitely not the responsibility of the landlord to tell you about renters insurance thats on you to do research and decide some places require it but thats mostly for their own protections op can definitely try to double check but given her situation her time money and effort would probably be better spent finding a place to live that meets her needs and she can afford on her own as i suspect this friend wont let op stay much longer much less past when the bf inevitably lets the beans spill
you probably dont want to hear it but unless you have a backup plan no i would not say anything to him right now things are only somewhat fine because hes under the impression youre none the wiser as soon as you let him know there is no reason to pretend theres a goooood chance things get very ugly and at this point it seems like the people youre living with are only letting you stay because of your boyfriend you gotta look out for yourself number 1 so take this information and plan find an apartment on your own and get a move in date of asap only then should you bring it up as most likely once you do hell be honest with you and good chance you get kicked out of where youre staying
probably would send them a were so happy you want to celebrate officially becoming a family but we are holding off on the big celebration with a dress and photos until baby is old enough to be a part this is important to us and hope you will respect our feelings as they wont change that being said wed love to have you and fiances parents said this was as your husband should be sending the message not you over for dinner to celebrate all of the good fortune in our lives lately
did you buy or sell i dont know if the person who boughtsold it did so maybe the real estate agent honestly i have no idea how it works and id say it usually is pretty accurate but it definitely can be inaccurate and i suspect it has to do with someone incorrectly reporting it fringe case for sure but zillow definitely isnt getting the info from the government for every sale thats for sure

but yes i saw the price and was a bit annoyed i wish i didnt have to spend that extra 100k but i definitely did
500k in lottery winnings comes with a minimum 125k in federal taxes and a potential additional 44k in state taxes that means he only got a maximum of 330375k thats still a lot of money but it isnt buy my family a house money or retire early money and thats assuming he was in a position to save all of it but most likely he had some debts or large purchases he was able to make with that money like student loans credit card debt maybe he paid off a mortgage or bought a new car 

it sucks but money doesnt go anywhere near as far as people think it does especially when you factor in taxes so just remember even with that huge leg up you probably canshould still have sympathy for him for all that stuff
yep and for mine it shows a completely and wildly inaccurate price thats more than 100k less than i paid and a price that was never even remotely possible so while yes its a good starting point it isnt always 100 accurate
just a heads up those arent accurate and must be selfreported by someone the house i bought was listed as being sold for well over 100k less than i paid and since i know how much i paid i know that zillow was very much not correct
well theyre only 22 now so i would probably say theres not a huge difference between discussing it when theyre 1819 the ages they actually were as they met at 15 and were together for 3 years and at 22 its really only 3 years different and yes you change in that time but idk if youre really ready for marriage at that point where you werent before ya know but also i just find it so hard to understand how op can be madly in love with him and living with him but her cousin who shes really close to and is in the same major and school as had no idea nor did kenny how did you not say anything all my friends knew about my partner within a few dates certainly 3 years and marriage talks would never happen without showing a picture or giving a name especially if i knew someone knew my partner from outside of me and then how can you have that sort of heartbreak its rather obvious kenny ended things and not say anything to your cousin about it like hey dont date him im not over him idk man sounds really weird
again doctors are more than just mds and even so yes the starting average salary is 211k for medical doctors thats after residency but you can complete your residency in your midlate 20s especially if you do medical school in another country or take advantage of a number of accelerated programs that pretty much every med school offers 

remember just because you havent had this experience doesnt mean it hasnt and cant happen to someone else my niece has just graduated as a doctor yes being vague to illustrate my point and makes 185k at 24 with a signing bonus of over 10k and my sibling who graduated a few years ago was able to purchase a 4 bedroom home in a really nice area at 23 this one not a doctor but in a well paying field i wouldnt call it a mansion but its an impressive achievement at 23 

it happens it might not be common but personal experiences on reddit arent supposed to be the average experience theyre supposed to be what happens to you so try to open your perspective on what you see as possible more and dont discount something as an obvious trollfake just because you personally havent seen something happen but in the end totally up to you what to think of what you read on the internet
its grossly selfish to stay in a relationship with the intention of thinking you can change her mind so assume she is 100 serious on never wanting kids if you know wanting kids is a must have in your life to the best of your abilities you two are fundamentally incompatible and the only honorable thing to do is leave her to find someone who doesnt want kids either 

if you think the right person is worth not having kids for i would be very honest with her so she is allowed the choice as well i have always wanted kids but i also feel a very strong connection with you i am not asking you to change your mind but more i am open to seeing if our relationship develops into something more where i accept not being a father but i also want to give you the choice on if youre on board because i cant guarantee how i will feel in the future and dont want to put you in an unfair position if we ultimately do disagree

now chances are she probably will also say hey lets call it here and save us the potential heartbreak but at least youre being open and respecting this woman enough to communicate openly with her so many guys hear a woman say i do not want children and think it means i dont want kids right now or think to themselves well its too early to think about kids anyway so lets reevaluate in a few monthsyears but no do not do that this is why people bring it up early because they dont want to be in love with someone and have to break up they know if theres a fundamental incompatibility its just not worth pursuing the relationship further because you can be on the same page in everything and a relationship still fail why pursue one where its break is inevitable
 uhm yes lol it is the pandemic completely changed the game for salaries in fields with burnout and high demand

dentists average starting is 123k with source 

doctors sources vary pretty widely depending on specialty but average entry level doctor salary is 211k with source 

vets 107k average starting salary with source 

and this is average starting meaning a lot of people make substantially more than this right out of the gate i know a number of people who were graduating this year and had 150k offers with starting bonuses just because they were well educated and theres such a high demand right now and not enough supply i dont really know why its so surprising to see why a specialized field in medicine would start out low six figures even nurses right now are making 100k starting in certain areas location matters your education matters the experience you gained in school matters heck even your connections matter but its definitely not a crazy idea to me at all that someone out there could be a doctor and have a nice ass house before theyre 30
girl come now dont be so dense hes 8 years older than you and already trying to isolate you he wants you to move in with him and is displaying an issue with your job he wants you to be financially reliant on him to survive and if you are then you cant go back to school to finish your degree hes doing his best to make you his good little housewife and youre playing right into it
youre going through something serious and something scary you are looking for support and youre not getting it you and your boyfriend are both so young that its no surprise he isnt equipped to handle this well but neither of you are handling the stress too well 

you shouldnt need to make up anything as you did nothing wrong ultimately even though it hurts you need to accept that he is entitled to feel how he feels and if hes unable to be understanding and supportive of his sick and scared girlfriend he isnt the right one for you
i mean no lol they are definitely also doctors and its also the internet its not super uncommon for people to be intentionally vague about personal details but anyway like i said its definitely an unusual path but totally possible to be a doctor in your mid 20s and have a really nice house
i was the one who added the med school the other person just said a doctor you can become a doctor a number of ways without going to med school

so i reiterate you can definitely be a doctor in your mid 20s and have a really nice house maybe uncommon definitely doable though
its not even an okay marriage and youre thinking of staying man you do you but youre only 30 if just okay is your standard you can find just okay with someone who isnt going to cheat on you
not residency thats totally true but could be a vet or a dentist which makes 6 figures right out of school and are still doctors
no hes over it at this point and moved on to someone else most likely trying to fix things is going to make you seem creepy and desperate at this point just let it go youve learned something about dating and about yourself and take that with you for future experiences
i agree here but she also shouldnt have sex with him if shed feel used if it was just sex because its very possible thats how it ends too and she shouldnt have sex if it will harm her mental health just to potentially keep someone around either
am i the only one who thinks its at least a little bit wrong to effectively try to manipulate someone into a relationship by using sex as a bargaining chip im not saying its wrong to wait to have sex at all but based on the post it very much feels like she was only waiting because she was playing a game
true could easily be a dentist or vet which are doctors no residency required and both have six figure starting salaries like i said definitely possible even if not the path most take

as for student loans i know when i was in school more people than you would think graduated without substantial student loans either trough scholarships help from parents or working through school but that also was very heavily influenced by my going to a top school where most of my class was well off im just a proponent of even if something isnt possible for you doesnt mean it isnt possible for anyone lol
question why were you on your laptop and taking calls when hosting a number of friends in your home you hadnt seen in a bit that seems to break a lot of hosting etiquette rules and while im not calling you an ah for it does seem like if you werent on your laptop or taking calls in the first place this wouldnt have happened
fam youre clearly way too young to be on the internet if you think the employees would ever call the cops and in the event they did that the cops would do anything more than generally gesture to take a look into it and never follow up
i mean its not actually as wild as you think you graduate from school at around 2425 if you go straight through and your starting salary can easily be 175k with the demand right now with large starting bonuses and even more if you go into criticalemergency care you could feasibly be 2526 and with that level of income afford a 500k600k house which in the right area could absolutely be a mansion or pretty close and yes i am talking about in todays day and age not 25 years ago

definitely not the path most take but if you prioritize buying a home over renting i know plenty of mid 20s who own homes and they dont have nearly the income a new doctor today would have

eta true med school requires residency but dentists and vets dont require residency and are making 100175k right out of school so like i said comment still stands just because something is uncommon doesnt mean its entirely impossible
did we get an age on the friend he could be older and away at college and in an apartment rentedowned by family oop being 18 doesnt necessarily mean all of his friends are his age and i knew plenty of people who lived in apartmentshouses their family owned while away at school
thats why it was so crazy everyone was blaming oop for simply saying to leave her out of this one i mean hes a parent to two children and it should be on him to manage his own relationship with his daughter rather than relying on the stepmom to always be the manager i feel like its super common for people to give the advice stop fixing things for xyz otherwise theyll never learn how to deal with it on their own yet here when oop simply comes to the conclusion of i wont be fixing things this time he needs to learn shes in the wrong just interesting how differently people can perceive the exact same behavior based on if it was advice they gave or just naturally how a person decides to handle a situation there was no easy answer here but i get oop wanting to be able to not always be the decision maker
did she delete some posts because the ones i see now while clearly paint her as deeply unhappy in the relationship shows shes more of the problem than him or at least theyre equally the problem
hahaha you mean like a teenager would be upset hes told he needs to finish his chores before he goes out with his friends
theyre definitely not that much anymore unless youre trying to find something expensive i went to a show a few months ago and it was 200 for the most expensive seats there were and plenty of options in the 50 range if you want to do a broadway show it doesnt need to be break the bank expensive
op is an electrical engineer engineers are pretty unanimously across the us excluded from overtime pay as it is a professional and has the advanced degree exemption
i mean he clearly picked her when he yelled at you for your behavior so i wouldnt test this any further if i were you and would just apologize and offer to step down from the wedding party or wear whatever dress they pick whatever they prefer 

otherwise kiss your friendship with mark goodbye
you should try to repair the relationship but also be aware some of them may not want an enabler in their lives anymore

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

i mean her behavior in this story alone should be enough to tell you its entirely possible she cut them all off for not doing exactly as she said
id just send one message saying if you truly feel badly about what you did let me move on and stop contacting me i have no ill will towards you anymore but i also have no desire to have you in my life in any capacity
oh no it gets worse later it can start very young though
if op says he doesnt love her thats totally fair but a month is plenty of time for love for plenty of people she definitely needs some help but she doesnt appear to be looking for a victimsupply she sounds like any other insecure 22 year old who doesnt know how to self regulate their emotions and is hoping a guy will do it for her try not to have the darkest outlook possible on peoples intentions when there is a way more common and way more likely answer in that shes just emotionally immature and struggling with her own demons
you should be encouraging her to get some therapy because you dont like hearing someone you love say such things
well this was a new partner and you frankly arent entitled to know about a deeply personal letter like that you said this happened in the beginning of your relationship
hes 7 good chance hes using sky because it pisses his mom off tell her to lay off and take away the appeal of sky being the rebellious name and then maybe hell change his mind in time or he wont but telling a little boy they cant do something only ever makes them want to do it more
how long was that stick
correct but this is an established thing tm in the horse world
you dont sound like youre a big horse person horse people flock to horse people and can be as cliquey as high school mean girls its no surprise the two of them would gravitate to one another when they share such a massive hobby and love of horses it also sounds like youre projecting your feelings of loneliness onto the man instead talk to your wife tell her you miss one on one time and ask to carve out some time for a date night and her horse back riding communication is key and a marriage takes work on both parties if you communicate your needs and ask her to help problem solve on how to make time to reconnect im sure these feelings youre projecting onto the friends husband will dissipate because the real issue here is you dont feel like youre spending enough alone time with your wife
this is only 3 months in the fuck just send him a message back you keep trying to guilt me about who loves who more yet you dont even feel strongly enough about me to be in a genuine relationship at this point its really clear everything you say is just manipulation to keep getting in my pants and i respectful myself enough to stop allowing the disrespect i dont think its a good idea for us to be friends after this its clear you dont have my best interests at heart and are only interested in getting your dick wet dont worry im sure someone other than me can fill that role goodbye and goodluck

then block him hes just using you and thinks you have no self esteem prove him wrong
interesting i see the opposite on reddit everyone says that you should be willing to love your partner regardless of weightappearance i definitely disagree there within reason 510 lbs whatever a significantly change in appearancelifestyle that now clashes with yours though is as much an incompatibility as anything else

but yes i agree especially before youre in a relationship if youve struggled with weight its totally understandable not wanting to be with someone you think wouldnt be able to handle fluctuations in weight never put yourself in a relationship you think might weigh on your own mental well being
i mean you can decide not to date someone for literally any reason yes
no were talking about exactly the same thing people who think weight doesnt matter and attractionlack thereof isnt a valid reason not to date someone are delusional but its also fair to not want to date someone who rejected you before solely because of your weight or even just someone who rejected you before but now cant get anyone better and is desperate this is one of those no one is wrong but actions have consequences moments
we can not judge them and also recognize that someone you rejected for any reason probably wont want to be a second choice
where do you live id like to read into this
i mean he said in more words that he was an ah for the sake of being an ah because the elderly couple did something a little sneaky too seems like no one is amazing here though i cant blame the elderly couple for giving a try something they probably saw online and had no idea it wouldnt work
am i the only one not believing hes actually bad at giving gifts and its just that op thinks anything other than exactly what she wants is terrible i mean a terrible gift giver doesnt just come up with a thoughtful gift like this and the coaching more sounds like her just telling him exactly what to get and since she clearly didnt this year he still got a lovely gift and put together a sweet day for her
it probably wouldnt be a bad idea to just know if you have toxic plants on the property not sure if theyre toxic just to pets or to kids as well or even if you ever invite kids over but just being able to quickly know in an emergency is never a bad idea even if its something as simple as asking the gardener to text you when he plants something new
get the annulment and then sue her in civil court for the cost of things you may not win but you might its easy to represent yourself
fam youre the problem here not the ex and not the boyfriend
it depends on what vibe youre going for is this a new partner or an established relationship you dont look cute but you do look ready to hike if youre the type who want someone who loves you even with no effort this is fine because youre dressed for the activity if you still want to look cute and functional there are hikingathletic skirts you could do two braids in your hair and a cuter more fitting tank topsports bra and matching socks instead

and a lot of sunscreen
its either couples therapy or divorce but he isnt an intentional abuser who would use therapy only to find new ways to abuse op hes just letting his own issues be taken out on op theres a difference the bigger issue is with op just working in a call center and both having extreme health issues and him being unemployed they likely cant afford couples therapy anyway
well ask him if moving in together would help otherwise move on
bury his head in the sand the same way you are to the fact that your boyfriend very obviously doesnt want to marry you
he doesnt want to propose to you and he doesnt want to marry you if he would marry you with no one watching he wouldve been happy to let you propose hes lying to you and youre letting him because that hurts less than the reality that he doesnt want to marry you but is fine enough to continue dating you indefinitely
i mean at this point your choices are stay as just a girlfriend and drop the desire to be engaged or wait until you piss him off and he dumps you
i mean by staying youve just told him he actually never needs to propose and youll just stay giving an ultimatum you dont really mean is a deaths blow for ever getting the thing in this case marriage you want he is never proposing he is never asking your father for your hand in marriage you either get over it and accept it or you leave but youve totally screwed yourself over for any chance of him ever proposing now because youve proven your words and threats are meaningless
honestly esh learn to say no and leave it at that stop adding qualifiers and allowing yourself to be walked all over let the 100 go but also just tell him that you dont want to hire him and let that be it no reasons no chance to change your mind
so you want this to happen again i mean do you think itll get easier if this keeps happening
the space will be helpful because itll help distinguish between himyou actually wanting to work on things together or you two just being afraid of being alone if hes holding on because hes just afraid of the unknown then once he gets over that the marriage will be done anyway taking that space makes it more likely that if you move forward its genuine and it also just helps to emphasize what being without you would be like rather than giving him a nice easy transition to leaving you
the first question you need an answer to is does he want to work things out with you the second question you need an answer to is do you want to work things out with him if you can both answer yes  he needs to cut her out and send a message saying i feel our friendship is starting to cross a boundary that isnt appropriate for either of us to continue speaking outside of work it isnt about you but i am going to focus on my marriage

the next thing is he needs to block her you both need to sign up for marriage counseling and likely individual counseling too then you two should take a break from one another sleep in separate rooms for at least 6 weeks while youre working through your feelings and how to move forward distance does make the heart grow fonder and often our desire to latch on even tighter in these moments makes it less likely the relationship survives 

he needs to be honest with you about what he thinks she gets that you dont and be willing to say the things he thinks are too hurtful you need to be willing to hear him say some really painful things too only once all the issues are out in the open can you two begin to assess if this relationship is fixable but it starts by deciding if you two are both willing to make it work and you are both willing to make serious changes otherwise theres no real point in trying itll only hurt you more
i mean plenty of people are shit heads throughout their entire 20s so theres still help there it isnt a magic switch when you turn 25 its just that the brain is finally developed but theres plenty of people that dont even start to grow up until that point so hopefully theres hope for her
nta if this man were anyone other than your husband youd be the ah you are fully within your rights to tell your husband another woman has a crush on him to ensure proper boundaries are always maintained doesnt matter if the other woman is family or not
it was a mothers day meal i would hope she wouldnt be a teenager
info you guys are married 

did you forget that once you get married its no longer mine and yours but ours it makes no difference which one of your cards were used
youre giving him way too much leniency and its going to bite you in the ass and hard
unless you want to follow in her footsteps you need to set down some iron clad expectations with your husband because hes your issue here if he isnt willing to put your comfort first you probably wont stay married very long
its not the idea of someone asking you to choose its the idea of two separate peoples entire family asking them to choose despite knowing and getting along with one another for 7 years and three other completely unrelated people to op 

once believable twice kinda weird but sure no less than seven people from five different upbringings nah unless you were raised in a cult but op already said they werent
well think about it this way do you think people who made mistakes are unable to ever change if you do know people can change and learn from poor choices theyve made why dont you think giving someone a chance is the right call hes a meth addict itll be easy to spot if hes still involved in shady shit and then if youre making a judgment based on current behavior go for it but at least give someone a chance to see if it is truly in the past or not
its the internet if you wanna act like a dumbass and say something blatantly incorrect and easily googleable dont be shocked when someone treats you like a dumbass

if you think someone correcting you is rude dont have such a fragile ego you cant take being wrong
that isnt the analogy you think it is and i already said elsewhere its birds belonging to the psittacine family dont comment correcting someone on something a quick google searches will give you the answer to there isnt really an excuse for misinformation in the age of the internet
apparently people in the sub about animals dont know what animals are but parrots are any bird in the psittacine family cockatiels are parrots budgies are parrots cockatoos are parrots macaws are parrots theres dozens of other species that are also parrots 

think of it the same way youd think of a golden retriever golden retrievers are all dogs but not all dogs are golden retrievers same thing here
cockatiels are parrots what did you think parrots were thats like saying a golden retriever isnt a dog its a golden retriever
cockatiels are parrots what did you think parrots were thats like saying a golden retriever isnt a dog its a golden retriever
what exactly do you think a parrot is
yeah its more understandable to get a fake diamond than fake shoes lmao
girl just admit you fucked up and apologize stop trying to make him the bad guy here it was you all you and just you
probably because shes drunk its her bachelorette party and people have been known to cheat during them and an ex came up to her and some really monogamous people can get really honest with alcohol involved so things dont look shady ive definitely done this before and while i looking back know it can seem more sus it really just came from drunk anxiety brain combined with i dont want to feel like im hiding something totally innocent from my fianc alcohol definitely impairs your cognitive skills i wouldnt read into it much unless you think something more serious happened

i would definitely tell my partner if i ran into an ex and i would expect them to do the same the alcohol likely just added a sense of urgency to her wanting you to know
info do you sincerely believe youll be happy for life with this man if not dont get married
i mean if you can afford it sure but at some point you kinda need to start advocating for yourself unless youre really cool spending all this money its okay to just say im sorry but i cant afford that right now i can do without the giftexperiencewhatever it is
damn i cant believe ive lived long enough to become the prude but yeah of course your relationship is going to suffer youre asking for nonmonogamy i would assume most men out there arent going to be okay with it personally you sound waaaay too immature for a serious relationship let alone a long distance one but if you want to start making content again you need to tell him and see if hes okay with it if he isnt you need to make a choice him and monogamy or the content and being single
its normal for your age but my god are 21 year old males shitheads sometimes
answer with a yes or no have you ever had sex with your stepmother
dude has about as strong a grip of sarcasm as he does on the meaning of the word emergency then
info are you telling me your sister decided she no longer wanted to get married but never communicated this to her fianc and the father of her kids because if so your sister is definitely an ah
ok if you think your relationship will be fine both from your and his perspectives then ask him to write up a lease to sign
youre better off moving out its not going to do your relationship with him any favors by moving to such a transactional relationship but hes in his right to decide what hell allow in his own home 

youre 28 you can definitely start to move towards being an independent adult and living your life the way your want to
i mean itll shake out however you decide but you have two options move out or dont have your girlfriend over
you are aware that your smoking hurts a lot more people than you right thirdhand smoke has been proven to be cancerous youre literally contributing to the death of not only you people around you but also the people who enter a space after youve left
so four hours later youre still arguing how come you havent given us a list of everything you do and everything your wife does in caring for your home and your kids clearly you have the time
the morals that marriage is a lifelong commitment you shouldnt just make with people before you know who they are and before youre willing to commit to working things out

tell me you dont understand marriage without telling me you dont understand marriage 

people should consider what marriage means before getting married that means both waiting until you know a person well enough to know there arent red flags hidden and it also means being willing to work through the shitty moments if you cant do it dont get married simple anyone you apparently who doesnt see that isnt really my problem enjoy your future divorce
 if they actually stopped ignoring red flags and putting up with bullshit they wouldnt marry those people in the first place
again if thats your attitude dont get married i already made that clear its not like everyone needs to get married but people have stopped taking marriage seriously and thats why divorce rates are so high you want to be able to walk away at the first issue sure go right ahead dont get married then
legally and morally are different just because you can divorce someone for the color of their shirt doesnt mean you should if you think marriage is such a temporary commitment dont make it
i mean yes if you just assumed he wanted kids that was incredibly presumptuous and foolish of you generally a 38 year old with no kids who wants kids will mention it especially as youre now 35 and thats generally the end of when most people start trying to conceive its also somewhat reasonable for him to assume an older woman with kids who doesnt mention wanting them also would be on the same page with not wanting anymore 

i suppose realistically at this point you need to do some tough thinking and potentially get your msh levels checked to get an idea on how easy it would be to conceive with someone else if thats even an option and if natural birth isnt possible if youre willing and able to pursue ivf or other means
might be difficult for her to see you treating another woman the way she wanted to be treated but clearly wasnt 

ive seen similar things with women who ended a relationship with someone who wouldnt marry them when they find out the ex is getting married even if the women are in new and fulfilling relationships and no longer have feelings for the ex rejection and feelings of inadequacy can remain long after the love is gone 

that being said she needs to handle her own shit and not bring it into your life set a clear boundary and if she cant agree time to put some distance between you and her and at custody swap you can send sky in by herself and you can wait in the car to pick her up
color is meh to me but the fit and length are actively bad it looks very grandmothers nightgown to me since you love the color this would be a beautiful piece if you took in and shortened the waist and then hemmed it somewhere above your knee whatever your preference
i mean probably says you prioritize being in a relationship rather than being comfortable as if i were allergic to an animal that would be the sort of thing i would ask about on a first date and not have a second with anyone with a cat
who hurt you
its not crazy its totally understandable if i may give you some advice my parents would always tell me if its meant to be itll be but never dull your shine for someone else you can leave and let him sort himself out if he does and the time is right maybe you two will reconnect in the future but if he wasnt meant to be your future youll move on and find that future every time ive been in a similar situation to yours my mom especially would encourage me to remember that if god intends it itll happen now i dont know if youre religious but i do think you will end up where youre meant to be and if thats with him youll find your way back to one another when he is healthier and if you arent meant to be and honestly i dont think you are then you will be freeing yourself to find that path youre meant to walk
i know apologies i just would hate to see such a young and vibrant woman with a bright future ruin it because shes willing to sacrifice herself for a man who would never do the same you deserve much more than this
nta if they need to crowdsource their wedding they need to downsize their wedding if they dont need to crowdsource their wedding you dont need to celebrate greedy ass people
eh of all the things wrong with this dude drinking problem doesnt come to mind if he really had a drinking problem he likely wouldnt feel compelled to hide it from his wife and kids hed just be drunk
well youve done the equivalent and then some in this post and all of your comments arguing already so instead of trying to act like youre too good for writing a 7 paragraph comment just do it prove it actually give us the information so we can see everything you do that shows just how much you deserve that break once you do everyones attitude will change and well all see you deserve this break and your wife is asking too much of you trust me its happened before everyone is calling you an ah so if you really think were wrong answering this will make everyone see what you see 

the only reason you would have for not is because you know damn well it would show just how little you do so which is it are you going to write out everything you do or are you admitting you do jack shit and leave everything to your wife
i mean nah she was extremely clear about not being able to handle you with short hair and you agreed i guess you didnt think that would be a dealbreaker and its an odd dealbreaker to have but thats trauma for you personally i would see if you can have a compromise where your hair is a bit longer than it is now but still short ish 

or you can decide your journey is worth more to you than your marriage thats okay too but you cant have both its either your wife feeling safe in your marriage or your hair short i would personally not want my wife to feel unsafe over something as superficial as the length of my hair but i also wont call you an ah for changing your mind and wanting autonomy on how you look this might just mean the relationship has run its course it isnt your responsibility or fault that shes reacting like this but that doesnt change the reality that shes extremely triggered and a choice needs to be made here 

hopefully your wife is in therapy though and can speak to them about this and see if she can work through her feelings in therapy
out of curiosity why do you want to mend things with an addict who is just using you as a meal ticket 

you dont mean anything to him youre just a tool to survive right now maybe he once loved you but his addiction has taken away all of his ability to develop a genuine relationship with you youre 25 youd be frankly an idiot to sink your future investing in someone like this indefinitely 

cut your losses and save yourself
well how about this walk me through a typical week be explicit go morning afternoon and evening walk us through what your wife does and what you do make sure you list every chore each of you does then we can all see exactly how not true it is that you dont do shit
or you could offer one
the rich and poor sure better or worse no thats often one or both people being a prick to the other no one stays married forever and isnt a prick to their partner at some point in time if its abuse obviously leave but theres a normal level of married couples are inevitably going to be shitheads at some point you cant just walk away the first time it happens
the divorce happened several years before he posted and hes still taking his kids on his time so i dont know if thats a fair comment to make
i dont think this is abusive which i think i made pretty clear but i do think op should not back down as shes already said she feels like maybe she should and i also am simply telling her to be hyper aware of if theres any additional red flags 

i am also one of those people who doesnt like everything to be called abuse so i did say this itself does not mean he is an abuser but its definitely how a lot of people say it starts so shes better off keeping this in the back of her mind and finding nooner red flags than ignoring this one and looking back 5 years from now and realizing it started here
its up to you realistically your high school girlfriend doesnt last through college anyway so you can follow the normal path and break up once she leaves
or break up now
it takes people different times to know if they want to marry someone and marriage is a lifelong commitment he could very well be telling the truth that he isnt sure yet and he may be sure later he also could be hiding a reason he doesnt think he wants to marry you you can try to have a conversation about it he ultimately wont tell you if he doesnt want to i wouldnt ask if you already are fed up with waiting and its okay if after 3 years you want someone who is sure 

i would personally decide if youre willing to wait for him to be sure or not if you arent everything else is irrelevant and its time to move on if youre willing to wait you need to decide how long youre willing to wait and then its time to sit down and talk to him ask him if theres some concern in his mind that he is keeping to himself if he says no just tell him plainly i understand it takes some people time and i understand marriage is a huge commitment i dont want us to get married unless both of us are sure but im going to be really upfront with you that if by x date next year 5th anniversary 30th birthday whatever line it is for you youre still no closer to being sure about us i cant wait any longer marriage is important to me and while i want it to happen with you im not going to wait around forever for you to feel the same way around me im not going to bring it up further so i dont pressure you into a decision one way or the other but i want to set clear expectations so neither of us are blindsided in the future
black white looks cheap and see through
it genuinely looks great if youre uncomfortable with the bottoms i would suggest a swim skirt as the flared skirt will really flatter your curves
he can talk to her and see what she wants to do like a rational adult find a compromise and see if maybe the fact that theyre on two different continents despite being married is causing her to feel pretty unconnected with him and shes fixating on the wedding as a symbol of their life together who knows but just because he cant give her a wedding doesnt mean he shouldnt talk to her
yep i mean im not saying everyone needs to get married but if you see marriage as something that could and should end at the drop of the hat dont get married then theres not really a ton of benefits to marriage anymore and any of them can easily be achieved with a contract that can be unilaterally terminated so if you dont see it as an actual serious commitment through good and bad times dont do it
it isnt an excuse though are you trying to tell me you think op did cheat because something was wrong with lauren because thats kinda bullshit too
you look amazing in this dress
you want to stay because you dont know anything different which is totally normal but youll find much better and be way happier
hes getting his phd still and clearly cant afford the wedding she wants so its highly unlikely hes got much to worry about 
no they make you look incredibly blocky a low rise would look better
yeah actually they kinda are marriage rules lol thats the whole richer or poor better or worse health and unhealthy stuff you say when you get married 

like i said if your rule is any time you do something i dont like im done dont get married seems pretty simple really if you dont see marriage as something worthy of doing the work to preserve dont do it its a lifelong commitment you want to be able to exit easily theres no reason someone needs to get married
once you marry someone youre kinda obligated to at least try to work through issues unless it involves cheating or abuse if you think you should just jump ship the moment someone saysdoes something you dont like you probably arent the type who should get married

sure it will get harder if they buy a house and have kids together but it isnt going to fundamentally change at this point if they sit down and have a conversation or go to a few therapy sessions first
theyre legally married it isnt exactly easy to just move on at this point
theyre already legally married lol abandon ship probably isnt the best advice they should at the very least have a conversation about expectations of lifestyle and maybe some counseling sessions
is this the same girl you just started dating like a month ago because dude cut your losses you were also dating someone else just two months before this girl maybe take some time alone you seem to be a serial monogamist
heres the two most likely outcomes you end things because you can see he isnt equipped to handle dating someone with your impairments or you dont end things and he inevitably gets frustrated and dumps you in a few weeksmonthsyears and then it hurts even more leaving now when its obvious you two arent a good match saves you the additional heartbreak that comes with being with someone even longer when things go south because at the heart of this is he simply doesnt have the patience to have a partner with an impairment like this
honestly i can see him being annoyed not many people like being constantly bumped into however that means he isnt right for you he cant handle his space being invaded while hes also stressed or irritated its okay but your discomfort is also 100 valid because even if it isnt coming from a place of violence it is coming from a place of i cannot handle what it means to date you and you deserve someone who can handle what it means to date you you two just arent right for each other

people on here have some assbackwards high horse morals the people saying youre an ah are insane if you didnt buy it someone else would have sure you bought the bracelet because it gave you a bit of control over a situation where you dont have much but that doesnt make you an ah it makes you a 16 year old kid who has been tormented and oppressed by people who shouldve been family keep the bracelet say nothing when youve moved out and can objectively assess how you feel decide what you want to do if you miraculously repair your relationship you can always say you found a bracelet in a vintage shop and thought it looked familiar and wanted to give it to replace the previously lost bracelet but theres no benefit to telling them now that you have the bracelet
being petty to a racist who has tormented you for years by legally buying a bracelet that was legally sold to a pawn shop isnt an ah move
it isnt normal and yes you need to leave you have two children to take care of and this is no longer a safe environment for them its time to find a friend or even contact a church to find someone to stay with file for divorce and start dusting off the resume to find a job you can even look for jobs at day care or a play center if you cant affordfind child care 

your husband has decided for whatever reason he no longer wants to adult fine no one likes to work but you do not should not and cannot stick around and let him put your children in danger understand youre a mom first and you need to act in their best interest right now and make sure theyre taken care of
i respect your opinions on pet care but youll need to respect my ability to make proper decisions about my own pet if you cant accept that we feel differently about this and dont think i should be allowed to interact with my pet as i see fit so long as im not causing bodily harm to her maybe this isnt going to work out we need to be able to respect differences of opinion and you cant expect me to just go along with everything you think i am my own person with my own beliefs just like you
nah her parents are right a useful degree will provide a statistically better life for their daughter than a passion degree like history you can be successful with a history degree but youre not successful because of the history degree a majority of the time ive looked up the jobs you can do with a history degree and most of them can use but wouldnt require the degree 

i think it would be helpful to encourage niece to have a backup plan maybe minor in something she can use if she changes her mind or isnt finding success in history but its also nice of you to support her passions but life is just getting harder for people as time goes on and college degrees are getting less and less useful unless theyre in highly specialized fields spending a bunch of money on a passion degree without a strong plan for the future isnt really advisable unless you have family money to fall back on from an completely pragmatic perspective you can still study what you love while also pursuing a more stable and prosperous career
you should be extremely concerned because while this could absolutely be your fianc trying to do something nice and just totally fucking up this is absolutely how and when a lot of abusers show their colors 

youre planning your wedding he thinks youre trapped and figured you wont leave he starts out small something thats a gift for you planning a honeymoon that will be a show of love hes using manipulative tactics to get you to agree and punishing you after you push back the punishment is the biggest red flag here 

he may have always treated you amazingly but just keep in mind that no one who ends up in a toxic or otherwise abusive relationship started that way it started out great and then one day something small happened that changed things and they didnt notice and went along with the pressure because they felt like they were wrong as their perfect partner had never reacted this way before and then once theyre really and truly trapped the ugly truth shows itself 

just be extremely careful and aware moving forward im not saying your fianc is an abuser but i am saying this is how it starts so watch out for any other red flags and do not back down seeing how he handles you firmly telling him no absolutely not and you better walk the fuck back from the you dont trust me language will tell you everything you need to know on if this is a marriage that is even safe to proceed with good luck be careful keep your eyes wide open
yeah im way more worried that this would set a precedent for do you trust me to be used as a manipulation tactic to get op to do things she doesnt want to do or isnt comfortable with in the future
yeah i meant it both ways the post says they have a date night once a month due to funds yet theyre both doing things separately multiple times a week but also he says they dont ever do expensive hoohar because he doesnt want to spend money in this climate which is valid dont go into debt but it doesnt sound like this is we have absolutely no money it sounds like im prioritizing saving money over facilitating a long lasting and deep foundation to my relationship and in that case its important to ask is a few extra hundred dollars in savings worth a clearly deteriorating relationship with your oh because if this rut is kicked off by the lack of experiences together which based on his comment to her seems like the case the few hundred dollars really might be the difference between her feeling happy and content in her relationship or feeling like he stopped trying to court her or to put effort into their romantic relationship as soon as they had a kid 

i get wanting to save for your kid i do really but its definitely cheaper to have one household than two its cheaper to just take care of the relationship than pay for therapy once its on the brink of demise personally i am of the mentality that i would rather have my partner than a few extra hundred dollars and i also want to have these memories with my partner
lol classic redditor purposefully and completely missing my point no i dont but if you hear your partner saying they feel youre in a rut and dont do anything to change things and bring a spark back dont be surprised if they fall out of love sweet gestures are a really great way of making someone feel loved and guess what even a few hundred dollar dinners is way cheaper than marriage counseling will be if you do nothing until youre on the brink of divorce
its a fashion advice sub and just an fyi saying a cut isnt flattering to someones figure is not a comment on their figure its a comment on an article of clothing shes got a perfectly finereally nice figure its the dress that is puckering weirdly which may be resolved by ironing it like i suggested 

take the overly offended attitude elsewhere
definitely iron it but the cut isnt very flattering on your figure it tapers in at the hips and emphasized your midsection
what the fuck why would you encourage him to make it work with a cheater the time for changes is done once cheating is involved its over the other person made their choice
of course sexual incompatibility is a good enough reason to break up youre 20 years old this is the time for you to go out have a bunch of sex figure out what you want in life and then hopefully find it and settle down in a few years or a decade or whatever if thats what you want 

please do not stay in a relationship that you arent fully and 100 intensely satisfied in when youre so young it gets worse as you get older and stay with people longer its already wrong it will not become right by staying you should find a new place to stay once your lease is up and once youve signed a lease sit her down and explain to her you dont think the relationship is working long term and youre moving out at the end of the lease give her enough time to find a place but not so much time that it becomes super awkward to live together you should offer to sleep in the living room unless you have a 2 bd apartment but youre 20 so i highly doubt it and do not renew your lease even if you foolishly imo decide not to break up with her you should ask to move out
ill say it op handled this like shit and if he wants to stay with this woman until his daughter does move out he needs to hear his partner out ask her what shes missing what can add the spark back or offer some couples therapy 

and we dont do that expensive hoohar sounds like a big part of the problem i often ask myself is saving a couple hundred dollars worth losing something else i really care about if the answer is no spend the money buy a beautiful bouquet of roses once a month take her out to a really expensive restaurant buy a little heart shaped necklace theres so many under 500 things you can do that are lavish and memorable and really show spontaneity and care
nta watching 4 children whos father is dying and 2 which you used to be a step father to is not a good idea if anything happens with these kids itll be on you from a liability standpoint watching 5 kids including a newborn is not a smart idea stand firm and hey even offer to take your son full time im sorry for whats happening with husband but i am unable to take your other kids i would be willing to take my son full time if that would make things easier for you to arrange child care for the other four but thats the extent im willing to go to help out i suggest you look into getting a baby sitter who can take them on short notice and i hope husband gets well soon

and fyi if you want more time with your son go petition the court to have full custody right now citing the cancer and frequent hospital stays as the reason explain it would be better for everyone involved if your ex didnt have to worry about another kid right now and if your son could have some stability and not be around such a heavydepressing topic
this also makes no sense like every single 28 year old male needs to be in a relationship i know plenty who are and have been single for years
nta you arent financially able to help them if this fund is the only money you have because it sounds like you live paycheck to paycheck youre unable to help them its not as though theres a few million in that account its likely a few tens of thousands or maybe low 6 figures which is nice sure but thats barely a down payment on a house nowadays being able to afford it financially means i can pay for everything i wantneed comfortably and still have tons of money left over that i will never even notice that is obviously not the case here
they seem to already be dragging it out op posted 3 months ago about not being ready to move and settle down with g and have kids and get engaged after 10 years together if youre not sure you want to marry someone after 10 years man you dont want to marry them and she clearly wants these things and yet despite everyone telling him to break up then he clearly didnt i hope op gets his head out of his ass because hes being incredibly selfish and destructive and potentially going to bring a very expensive life into this world that he clearly doesnt want with a woman that he clearly doesnt like and isnt committed to
i have a few questions 

after 10 years together why arent you two married do either of you want marriage

do you even want to get over what she said this relationship sounds really wrong for both of you she said shes disgusted with your body thats not the sort of thing you forget 

did you mean what you said when you insulted her intelligence is this because shes only interested in seemingly shallow hobbies like reality tv

do you want kids because if you dont want kids where you would find a woman who wants kids after you break up with g then do not have a child with g kids needs to be a two yesses decision and if its not a yes without the threat of a relationship dying over your head its not a yes at all
fairly certain if he were thinking with the penis instead of the brain he would be out fertility treatments are definitely the least sexy thing a person can do and most of the time you actually arent having much if any sex during them
well you can just say that straight up asking me to cut off my best friend because my bil knowing decided to date her is controlling and isolating and im not tolerating this if it were up to me i was never comfortable with them dating in the first place as that puts me in the middle way too much i told you very clearly i am not getting involved if you make cutting off my best friend for doing nothing wrong your hill to die on then we might as well start planning the funeral because i am not going to be pressured into playing this game relationships end he knew she was my best friend if he was unable to handle that fact he should not have dated her this is solely bils cross to bear they were together for 6 months and its clear he came off way too intensely and scared bf off so of course she didnt need very long to fully mourn their relationship i hope i am making myself perfectly clear that i find the implication i cut my best friend off incredibly toxic and if given the choice i am cutting off the toxic people in my life and right now that is not best friend
you are very very very obviously not over the rejection you need some serious therapy and get to the place where you can drop the rope youre running around trying to fix everyones problems at the cost of yourself because you are hoping this will finally make your blood family see you as important to them stop they dont they are using you because you consistently begged them to let you be used by them for validation 

if zach doesnt want to care for his dad guess what your dad reaped what he sowed by neglecting his other kids do not take care of your father stop spending all of your money buying a ton of gifts it isnt getting the result you want they dont care about you they only tangentially care about everything youre giving them but if you take that away none of them will ever call you except for maybe rob 

so please get some therapy and become okay with having a waaaay more distant relationship with your blood family they do not care about you and you jumping up and down throwing stuff at them is just telling them youre desperate for their attention and love and the more they dont give it to you the more they can take advantage of you with love and affection dangling like a carrot on a stick in front of you but they dont and never will stop doing so much for people who clearly will never return the favor
one potential way is to call the non emergency police line and tell them whats going on and ask if theres anyway a cop can come over and facilitate the discussion where you ask the photos to be deleted and also to have it on record as youll be dumping him afterwards and are afraid for your safety they may not do it but they also might make sure you mention this has all been done nonconsensually if you happen to know any police officers you can also ask if theyll do you a favor and do this as well in uniform 

if youre able to get a cop to come make sure to delete the photos from his recently deleted photos and to also make sure theyre deleted from his icloud and then at the end of it make sure you ask the cop to put this on record so if somehow he managed to keep any photos if he ever distributes them itll be a very clear case of revenge porn as he is the only one with these photos and was told by a police officer to delete them
nta this is like someone calling you an ah for calling the police because you were stabbed this is why hoas exist youre not an ah for calling the correct people you didnt call the hoa because the color of their house was the wrong shade of white you called because they were causing both property damage and psychological damage by keeping you up at night 


and just as an fyi theres almost no way that a 25 bouncy castle was legal either you couldve likely called the police too as you need permits and safety people for something that large and its usually not allowed in residential areas period a family friend does the carnivals in my area and the larger slides etc were all kiiiiinda illegal but they relied on the its only for 4 hours so no one will really care or know mentality
your husband is right its time to completely cut all three of them off
sure but that doesnt happen in engineering literally the definition in most states is make more than 600week and be in a job where an advanced degree is required this isnt some weird field engineering is pretty universally known to be exempt stop trying to make this something it isnt shes exempt she needs to decide what she wants and if shes cut out for a field where what shes being offered is as good as it will ever realistically get im done having this conversation if you dont believe me do a quick google search this is like the most easily verifiable information about labor laws out there
bruh read the fucking post she is exempt she has clearly stated it stop trying to argue about something that is literally stated in the post as true its coming off as extremely argumentative take the antiwork attitude to the antiwork subreddit
its 50 hours not 60 she started 3 months ago and this is her first job 

i can assure you in this instance no its almost 100 not a good career move to leave now if she can do a year that would be the least likely to impact her career and would be a good use of job hopping personally most of the recruiters i know want at least 2 years but 1 at least a year they will still interview a really good candidate and will definitely ask why the short tenure no company wants to employ a brand new professional train them only for them to leave a few months or a year later its just not worth it for them 

and again the company isnt taking advantage of her theyre paying her they are legally not required to pay her you do understand this right this is what the field entails theyre giving her more than most employers woulddo if she genuinely cant handle this reality shes simply not cut out to do engineering like i said you cant be a cpa and say you wont work overtime during tax season its just not how it works you come off as someone who thinks things should work how you want and dont actually understand how the professional world actually operates
its not iffy im very familiar with the laws for engineers theyre exempt no overtime required and op has very explicitly stated this same thing in the post this is how it is for engineers unless you do consulting work
honestly if op is a woman she should go through ivf and simply tell her partner if you dont want kids then we need to end things but this is nonnegotiable for me and im proceeding with it 

i recognize this is a terrible idea in reality but if shes a woman she should take autonomy over her own desire to have children and make it happen
lmao youre aware op is 30 and would be instantly snapped up by another wonderful woman right its not as though his wife is his only chance at love sure hell have no wife for a few years while he gets to know someone else but hes young has a great job and wants a family hes a ton of womens dream man right there as long as he takes care of himself and knows how to wash a dish the idea that if he ends things hed be alone is almost as absurd as the people who imply a womans only worth is to procreate
op is exempt they legally are not required to pay her anything and this is an issue shed find in most any company in the electrics engineering field she needs to be very realistic about what she wants her career path to be moving forward and take this info into consideration because shes definitely exempt and while a company that pays time and a half probably does exist it may not be easy to find and get a job there especially if she leaves her first job so soon shes only 23 and paying your dues is definitely necessary sometimes
yeah exactly but op is an electrical engineer and an exempt employee depending on if shes a software vs a hardware side of ee she could just need to accept the nature of the job you work until a project is finisheda deadline is met in these fields a lot of the time you get paid well for it but sometimes thats just the cost of the business ya know my partner was a software engineer and some weeks were really chill and other weeks when something was due or there was an issue theyd be working 1618 hour days every day for a few weeks made good money but thats just the nature of the industry make sure you can handle it before pursuing a career in that field
lmao op needs to recognize getting paid for her time is more than shes legally entitled to then and be happy
sure but im also just stating that if shes in a salaried professional position she most likely legally is not entitled to overtime pay and in fact is getting more than the legally required payment she needs to do research absolutely but a number of people dont realize that a lot of occupations that make good money also arent entitled to any overtime pay now that doesnt mean every single occupation but thats the whole look it up be aware you may not be entitled to what youre asking disclaimer i was giving
you definitely can i think you think im saying an employer can take someone from an hourly to salaried employee at will to avoid overtime but thats not what im saying im saying a company can choose to employee people either as a salary or hourly employee in a number of professional positions where in an hourly structure they would need to pay per hour worked but as a salaried employee it would be a flat rate regardless of if you worked 40 or 50 hours and yes legally this varies by state so its important to know your states labor laws and its also important to ask the right questions and set clear expectations when accepting a position on hours expected overtime etc but its 1000000 an employers decision to hire people on either an hourly or salaried basis and then depending on the local laws whether particular positions are entitled to overtime or not
i mean you can definitely decide what you want but depending on your field that just isnt an option youll have theres plenty of industries where if youre unwilling to do what needs to be done to get a project done on time you wont survive in that industry for instance you cant be a cpa and tell your firm that you are only going to work 40 hour weeks during tax season and expect to keep your job you cant tell the hospital that youre not going to help out with a massive outbreak or accident or whatever it may be because youve worked 40 hours that week if that isnt for you totally fair just be realistic when choosing a career path then

dont get taken advantage of but also people do sometimes take it too far for the principle of things without understanding it just isnt how it works in some fields
everyone handles trauma differently but i have never heard of anyone man or woman to take selfies of themselves doing things to their rapist and looking happy while doing it that sounds like he cheated on you and thinks youre dumb enough to believe his story
its unfortunate because op is only 23 and she just started it can definitely look poorly on her to already be searching for a new job
well you absolutely can and many do make employees salaried so as not to pay ot but thats on the employee to carefully weigh job expectations and compensation packages before accepting a position
it depends on the state laws in california salaried professionals arent entitled to overtime pay doesnt matter if youre an entry level or management level individual employers can do whatever they want but legally they dont have to pay anything if youre a salaried professional employee
that actually isnt how it works in the professional world usually a number of states labor laws explicitly state professionalsalaried employees arent entitled to any overtime pay as in not even just normal time but 0 for any extra hours worked you usually are getting compensated well if youre in a position that might require overtime think if you work as a cpa or a surgeon but its important to understand laws and payment structures vary and theres definitely a lot of professions and jobs where you may be required to work overtime for your job description but you are not legally entitled to compensation for it this isnt true in most hourly positions and lower skilled jobs like retail workers but yeah just be aware of the labor laws in your state
yeah cant say telling the rest of her kids they cant go have fun at a water park with their cousins because their sister thinks shes fat is a good way to help her body image issues knowing kidssiblings they just might use that against the daughter in the future
i think youre going to drive yourself nuts trying to understand this its simple he wants a partner who is close to their family you are not close to your blood family he thought maybe he could accept it and hes realizing after 3 years he cannot thats the only thing you need to understand and now its time to respect it and more importantly start respecting yourself and stop trying to make it work with someone who doesnt want to make it work
no i cant i am not him youd need to ask him i can only give you perspective on he is allowed to have any dealbreaker he wants and he isnt wrong for having them i could guess maybe if he doesnt have a close relationship hes always wanted one and thus wants a partner who does have that big happy family but youd need to ask him
well in asking him to be flexible you are asking him not to care about what he cares about and in him asking you to consider forgiving your abusive family he isnt respecting your boundaries either but thats the thing he cares about this regardless of if you think its a valid thing to care about and theres no fixing the fact that this is his hill to die on make your hill to die on finding a partner who treats your chosen family just as well as he treats his own
you cant ask me because im not him i dont really care about family and in fact prefer a partner who isnt very close to family my whole point is just because you disagree with what he finds important doesnt make it unimportant thats why we date to find someone who were compatible with 

if this is all true you need to come to terms with the fact that you cant give him what he wants and stop torturing yourself you dont deserve staying in a relationship with someone youre clearly on such wildly different pages you will find someone much better suited to you who treats you way better just like a close relationship with family may be his dealbreaker you should make wants me to forgive my family a dealbreaker for you
no im not missing that you see them as your family and i think thats great but he is very clearly meaning family as in blood family and in that regard you dont have that your family is chosen but he very specifically wants the family lineage not just friends and thats okay too i am a person who thinks family means very little but even in my own perspective i am able to recognize that i do not get to tell others what they should and shouldnt think about family and thats something i think you need to recognize as well 

for you they are your family for him theyre your friends not your family and he wants someone who has a close relationship with their family which is where they incompatibilities come into play both in your definitions of family and the relationships he expects of them
and i understand that but chosen family and the family you grew up with and raised you arent the same for him thats something you need to respect just as much as youuu need someone who respects and is fine with you have a chosen family and not a blood family thats an incompatibility though thats not one person being right or wrong you may be really hurt and youre 100000 valid in your story he is the wrong one and i get that but from an objective vantage point neither of you are the villains you just want different lives and neither of you can give the other what you each deserve
no they arent thats him communicating his doubts people talk about things they think are incompatibilities all the time he has never suggested she forgive her family hes only communicating about he doesnt know if he can accept them not being in her life i have had dozens of conversations over the years when dating with people like this it was never pressure it was im struggling with this and am talking to my partner about it rather than blindsiding you i would always take someone telling me im reconsidering our relationship because of xyz over just ending things for seemingly no reason 

3 years in op needs to realize he obviously isnt going to accept it and hes obviously never treated her very seriously because deep down he knows he cant start a life with her but he isnt pressuring her him communicating his feelings shouldnt be villianized
it isnt wrong it would be wrong of him to say you need to forgive your family and be close to them for you and i to stay together but it is not wrong for him to say you arent close with your family and thats really important to me and regardless of if you have a really good reason i dont see a future with someone who isnt close to their family trying to change someone is wrong wanting something different from someone no matter what it is isnt wrong 

based on your post he isnt trying to change you hes just saying you two are incompatible and he isnt wrong for that no one is the easy example to understand is disagreeing on kids completely unacceptable behavior i want kids and even though you dont im not accepting that answer and will force you to have kids with me completely acceptable behavior i want kids and even though you have really good reasons for not wanting them this isnt something i can compromise on i think its better we find people we are both more compatible with

in both cases everything else in the relationship can be fine but having a big close family is very integral to the life your boyfriend wants and realistically he isnt alone in that this isnt some foreign cult like desire is everyone you meet going to care no absolutely not but plenty of people choose their partner based on if they can have the life they want with them or not and thats about everything kids pets financial goals retirement anything and everything you can think of someone out there finds that thing really important to them and will absolutely break up with any partner that doesnt align well with them in that regard 

so please stop calling him wrongunreasonable for having his own vision of his life hes entitled to that just like you are entitled to not keep toxic people in your life just like you may not want to date someone in the future who is extremely close to their family these are all things we can and frankly should consider while dating if you wouldnt truly be happy making a life with someone are you saying you should still stay because you should be happy with them no of course not
but its not the appearance if it were hed be pressuring op to forgive her family he isnt hes saying he doesnt think they have a future he doesnt want the appearance of family he wants the actual close family why is everyone purposefully misunderstanding that
i actually dont see anywhere where he says op should have a relationship with her family hes simply saying regardless of if its for a good reason i dont want to marry someone who doesnt have a good relationship with their family which is fundamentally different hes saying op and him will not work because she doesnt have a relationship with her family and he isnt going to change the future he wants because op has a good reason but guess what thats totally his right and theres nothing wrong there it sucks but people dont need to accept anything about you and hes allowed to want any future he does and he isnt wrong for finding someone who aligns with that op doesnt 

now op sounds wayyyyyy better off without this guy in her life as well but he isnt wrong for wanting a partner who has a strong relationship with their family
i actually dont see anywhere where he says op should have a relationship with her family hes simply saying regardless of if its for a good reason i dont want to marry someone who doesnt have a good relationship with their family which is fundamentally different hes saying op and him will not work because she doesnt have a relationship with her family and he isnt going to change the future he wants because op has a good reason but guess what thats totally his right and theres nothing wrong there it sucks but people dont need to accept anything about you and hes allowed to want any future he does and he isnt wrong for finding someone who aligns with that op doesnt 

now op sounds wayyyyyy better off without this guy in her life as well but he isnt wrong for wanting a partner who has a village
it happens all the time though if he wanted kids and you didnt that would similarly be throwing away your relationship for people he doesnt know yet people have ideas of the futures that they want and are allowed to find a partner who meshes well with that future he shouldnt have to compromise on wanting a future where he and his wife can have all the in laws over for a bbq or whatever and you shouldnt have to compromise on not allowing harmful relationships in your life 

i understand it hurts but your bf isnt in the wrong here either if hes just saying you two arent compatible and he isnt insisting you mend your relationship with your family
it honestly doesnt it just sounds like he knew they would never work out long term and so he never took the relationship very seriously
heres the thing though it actually isnt an easy thing to work out its a dealbreaker for him to not have a close relationship with both his and his partners family unless youre telling me its easy because youll go and have a relationship with your family please dont then there isnt an easy fix at all youre at an impasse as much as you would be if he wanted kids and you didnt 

telling someone you shouldnt care about the thing you care about is not an appropriate way of working things out and its totally reasonable for him to want a partner that everyone can have this big huge family where everyone gets along its absolutely heartbreaking for you as i understand how much it hurts to be judged for reasons outside of your control but its 100 reasonable for someone to consider their partners family when deciding to marry someone i personally wouldnt marry someone with an exceptionally toxic family that they hadnt cut out everyone has different lines unfortunately for him his line is i want my partner to have a good and close relationship with her family and regardless of if you think thats reasonable he is fully entitled to that dealbreaker and you need to recognize that youre simply unable to provide that for him much like if you didnt want kids you could never give him a son 

im sorry for this but it sounds like he isnt that great of a boyfriend anyway and youd be much happier finding someone who accepts you your past and is happy with just your friends
this is not the proper takeaway
yta dont give expensive gifts if it has strings attached yes expecting a hand written thank you note is a string i guarantee you none of them give a shit about a 300 pen
i dont really think its healthy to imply a 21 year old should made huge decisions on their life trajectory based on a teenage sweetheart when i was that age my parents drilled into my head make the decisions you want to make for your future never consider your partner if its meant to be it will be and if it isnt meant to be then you havent changed your life for someone you arent meant to be with and thats 100 accurate at 21 implying hes somehow wrong for moving and following his life path because his girlfriend is elsewhere is shockingly naive and obtuse
you uh you know exaggerating is just a roundabout way of saying im a liar and everyone already knows me as a liar so shockingly they thought i was continuing to lie because it made a good story
in all fairness its stupid to assume everyone is an exception to the most logical conclusion
how about he goes with a family member or friend instead he wants to go and has already put the deposit down if he goes with someone else itll only be 5k total and then it wont be a waste and you wont need to fee terrible on your own vacation then he can go and find someone to go with him
yeah i think overanalyzing the nuance of is this just a 23 year old male who is uncomfortable with heavy topics and using humor to break the tensions vs is this person a covert abuser waiting to happen isnt worth it whatever the answer is its perfectly clear that this guy isnt giving op what she needs to feel heard and to feel safe and at that point trying to figure out the exact motives and reasoning behind the action just distract from dealing with the action itself and dealing with it should just be washing her hands of the relationship and leaving
very normal also very normal and necessary for op to step in to explain the behavior while normal is unacceptable its how we learn and grow into hopefully functional adults
info how old are you because its pretty clear youre at most 23 and have no actual understanding or experience with teenagers and young adult males who think once they turn 18 they no longer need to follow rules the only thing being left out is people with actual life experience and knowledge of what teenagers are like weighing in everyone here saying theres something being left out no way an 18 year old would just be an ah for no reason have no idea that all those times you thought you were justified in your anger at 18 nah just an ah dont worry you usually grow out of it
yeah im genuinely so over this trend of theres clearly more to the story youre not telling me on posts like okay buuuut maybe just comment on whats in the postcomments instead
what exactly is the timeline here because im confused why youre posting now this sounds like something you found out a long time ago
a lot of people on here are very biased against men and also seem to think reasonable compromise in a relationship is a read flag which is simultaneously shocking and also not given how immature a lot of people on reddit seem to be
work comes first but this wasnt a choice of working or gaming it was a choice of only working or getting to do both how do you come to the conclusion that he needs to let her work using his equipment rather than her just working on her laptop in the kitchen or bedroom anyone who works from home and has a laptop has used their laptop as a portable computer for work thats the whole point shes just unwilling to compromise or suffer the least bit of inconvenience
nta maybe it was as hard for your parents as it was for you it wasnt but lets just say maybe they put themselves in that position you had no choice in the matter why on earth would you subject your child to that same lack of autonomy over their situation
do not get a pet if youre so weak willed to rehome them at the behest of a partner simply because they want you to these are living creatures not toys you can just shuffle around as is convenient
just tell them straight up yes im absolutely leaving him for a better lifestyle i deserve way more than a cheating distant husband this has nothing to do with money and everything to do with me knowing my worth if stbx thinks thats abandonment then what does he think he has done all this time hes been stepping out on our marriage
theres nothing to indicate that theres no mention if op wanted to live with her father no mention of if he paid child support and no mention of if she asked and was turned down to moving in with her father with the absence of any of that information it can only be concluded that she moved out because she wanted to allow her mother to downsize at 18 not because she was kicked out and her step sister never did because they simply live different lives its also not his kid he doesnt have unilateral decision making on kicking out the step sister obviously at 31 hes okay with it but lets not act like her actual birth mother whose home it also is doesnt have a say in allowing her daughter to live there
yeah yta you shouldnt resent your father or your step sister for having more than you do you really want to be a 31 year old still living at home if youre still harboring issues over this more than a decade later its time for professional intervention it isnt normal and its hurting your own well being to be resentful over someone having something you didnt have thief is the comparison of joy and you and your step sibling are different with different experiences 

why didnt you spend any time with your father did he pay child support did you ever ask to move in with him maybe if he said no to you moving in with him after turning 18 i could understand some amount of resentment but at some point you shouldnt resent a 31 year old who still lives at home without any indication of your father very pointedly and directly telling you he wouldnt give you further assistancewouldnt allow you to move in with him you have no basis to resent him and need to understand that your situations are both different and it is also her mothers home and her mother likely has a large say in allowing your step sister to stay in the home for so long
the road to hell is paved with good intentions 

just because you didnt intend to hurt her does not change the fact that you did hurt her stop acting as though not meaning to means you didnt hurt her you hurt her start from that fact and figure out how to make up for it if its even possible
seems like in trying to demand everything youll end up with nothing
so its a sin for you to live with the person youre going to marry but not for him to live with someone hes been dating a quarter of the time


that math doesnt add up
ill also point out something when you discovered what her job was she had already started an only fans and the content was out there forever if her current partners have an issue with her career in the present tense she can quit now and this will no longer be an issue if the issue is she ever was a sex worker though no matter what you did in that moment at 18 she still would have been a sex worker for most people its a binary issue have you ever done  and regardless of if youd managed to get her to stop that day at 18 the answer would still be the same yes so your supporting her career choice or not supporting it wouldve had no impact on future relationship especially if she has since quit because what she will tell future partners is the same now as it wouldve been then when i was younger i did some sex work i did it for xyz reasons i regret it and im no longer doing it but i want to be upfront so if thats a problem for you we dont waste our time
theres a difference between telling someone not to cook ever and saying dont do something you know youre terrible at as a present for your husbands birthday you really have to know that theyre not the same right

if she wants to do that have it be a random tuesday or idk practice until she can make something edible its not really the thought that counts if the thought it im not going to put any effort into getting good at this before giving you something i know youll hate but expect you to pretend to love it anyway
he hardly did it intentionally its the same situation where someone seeing cant wait to have you inside me again on their partners phone when cleaning up the bedroom isnt snooping if they look at the text chain to discover an affair
i mean it nicely but he didnt snoop you knew he was in the room and you were within earshot if there was a breaklull in whatever he was listening to unless he has professional audio equipment most headphones are far from 100 noise cancelling he heard you talking about him and curiosity got the better of him thats just like when a woman sees an inappropriate text pop up on their partners phone and opens it to find them cheating theyre not snooping or invading privacy in that case and unfortunately i dont think he was invading your privacy here 

this is sorta a situation of what did you expect would happen if you were talking about your partner in a less than ideal way with him within earshot this happens all the time where one person talks smack thinking someone isnt within earshot and then they are the added context of being in a therapy session really doesnt change the lack of betrayal here if anything hes likely feeling quite betrayed have you discussed any of these issues with him or is this the first time hes hearing you might have some doubtsbe afraid of incompatibilities 

im not trying to make you feel badly we need therapy and safe outlets to work through our feelingsvent but if youre unable to do a session aloneaway from someone you know you really shouldnt mention them i cant reasonably say a 24 year old dude who tried not to hear and then heard you talking about him unfavorably was betraying your privacy by listening in for 2 minutes and then deciding not to and to just talk to you about it instead relationships require communication and this does sound like a fair point of discussion in a relationship
having kids is a privilege not a right and its something that honestly with how overpopulated most of the world is most people shouldnt have kids they already had 3 there is no need for them to have had a 4th or 5th kid seems like a lot of people are acting like having as many kids as they want is a right and it simply is not
eh i think its pretty callous to suggest theyre only having kids because they want to fuck over op they probably do want these kids plenty of people always dreamed of a large family and i understand it can be frustrating to have a great job and still struggle to afford the basics but thats their reality and many others reality they need to make the decision to have kids based on their current situation and also based on if they can afford it should anything change 

just like op should probably have a full time job because if her ex lost his job tomorrow shed either no longer get child support or get a significantly reduced amount if her current income isnt enough to at least mostly pay for expenses thats probably not ideal everyone needs to live within their means not the means of others
idk if this is true everywhere or even anywhere but i thought that child custodychild support court cases are typically where possible handled by the same judge because it prevents finding a judge to rule how you want and also because it ensures someone at least somewhat familiar with the details of youyour case will be able to make more consistent ruling as life situations change
and if it happens that op doesnt have enough income for her expenses shell need to figure it out but theres a good chance child support wont end until 21
idk i would tell my boyfriend about being groomed and her husband everything shes ever done and not told him and id add blackmailing her own sister on to that list
yeah if everyone is just going to make up a narrative under the assumption the op must not be telling the truth then theres no point to this sub anyway just make a judgement based on the actual information given even if you personally dont think thats all the info
oooor they really do just hate jim because they see it as a replacement for their father i mean to some extent we need to take op at face value shes the only person who was actually there if theres missing information then obviously any advice here wouldnt work regardless
if the kids are happy with their dad thats all that matters but i will challenge you that depending on the circumstance cheating on a parent absolutely can impact your ability to be a good fathermother my parents both know very clearly that if either cheated on the other even if its the parent i dont really like getting cheated on i will not forgive the offender and they would be dead to me and im definitely not a rare case 

but what your wife is doing is not the way if the kids are happy to be with their dad thats all that matters cheating doesnt have to impact your ability to be a good parent but i just want to point out it 100 can
yeah its extremely hard to say they very well may have had that conversation so i dont want to absolve this man of accountability buuuuut ive seen a number of men and women post on here about issues that arise because they assume theyre in an official relationship when the other person doesnt agree i can easily see this being a similar situation where he expected it to be maybe a week or so and now a few months in hes decided hes just not feeling it anymore and theres no real commitment so hes just letting it fade out
i mean he did break up with you tell him he can pick either you broke up with me and i didnt cheat on you so drop it or you didnt break up with me in which case i am breaking up with you now because i sure as hell am not staying with someone who thinks its at all acceptable to ghost their girlfriend for 3 months which is it because im not doing this bullshit i didnt cheat on you and if you think i really did cheat on you then this relationship is done

and make him pick once he picks dont let him unpick and frankly i would leave anyway because this asshat actually thinks its okay to ghost someone for 3 months with no consequences fuck that i would brea up with someone who didnt answer for 48 hours and i have im not exaggerating here with no warning or explanation let alone 3 months
honestly the selfish bit is just not communicating about it though i honestly suspect theres a chance they arent actually bfgf and this is another case of assuming what they are rather than having the explicit conversation if so he isnt even really a jerk for just slow fading and losing interest if im wrong and they did explicitly say we are boyfriendgirlfriend and in a committed relationship then he is selfish for failing to communicate the relationship no longer working for him but outside of that its no surprise he doesnt want to invest a ton of time getting to know someone who he cant even really get to know seeing as they really dont get to see each other much
yeah or could have just said i didnt have patience back then to put up with teaching and didnt want to give you a bad learning experience it was because i wasnt a good teacher to you not because you were a bad student
i dont think you can fix this she doesnt love you anymore and she doesnt seem to be attracted to you either you cant make someone love you and you cant make someone want to work on things it sounds like she ended up with you because you saved her and then once she was finally back on her feet the love wasnt there enough to survive all the misfortune in your post 

your post has an almost unbelievable series of bad events in it if this really did all happen in the past two years its honestly no surprise she no longer loves you losing your money your jobs depression leaving her alone in a pregnancy being so unwilling to help clean your house developed a fungal infection and even more acts of bad luck would probably kill most marriages that young 

i get it hurts but youre both 24 you were married for only a year before she decided she wanted a divorce it sounds like she recognizes shes still young and would be happier in a different relationship and frankly i agree with her you would both be better off divorcing and you working on yourself and focusing on being the best father you can be and then making sure youre in a place where you can handle a relationship again 

good luck but you need to start mourning the relationship and give your wife a divorce if thats what she wants i would tell her if you want a divorce you need to be the one to take steps and file because i want to work this out but i also recognize i cant make you stay
its definitely normal when a man 10 years older than you and richer than you is trying to take you on luxury vacations 4 months in yes 

theres a saying be with a man for money you earn every cent im not saying you were with him for money but i am trying to illustrate that men who provide their partners with lots of moneyfinancial supportluxury experiences do often expect exactly what your boyfriend did they think money should be enough to earn them an obedient and supportive gf 

now i firmly disagree and its clear you two arent compatible with one another both of you should be glad you found out early but beware in your next relationship that older rich men typically arent paying for their younger girlfriend to go on crazy vacations right after meeting out of the goodness of their heart sometimes they do this isnt an all men statement but it is something that happens and if you dont want it to happen id stick to men closer in age to you and be more firm about equal contributions financially in the relationship so there isnt anything to try to use as leverage against you
you can love and be a good parent to your son without being this much of a doormat to your wife divorce her and go for split custody
dating at 30 isnt much different than dating in your 20s however dating at 40 50 and so on after that long with one person is definitely not ideal so use that info to stand strong in ending things now and moving on end it move out if you live together and just block her if she tries to convince you shes just asking for permission to cheat and that is ridiculous she thinks she can brow beat you into agreeing to that
i mean its been two weeks and youre 20 he honestly owes you nothing now do i believe he really forgot no not really dude isnt worth your time based on that alone but in a straight up hook up situation i dont really see it as reasonable to expect them to read your mind you clearly wanted him to come with you but that isnt what you said and you are expecting him to care about your wellbeing and honestly handle a potential pregnancy with more care than most peoples actual committed boyfriends would 

if you dont like this reality dont have unprotected sex with guys you arent in a relationship with otherwise its not really fair to be upset that they arent handling things the way you think they should it sucks for sure and this guy isnt anyone id want to have sex with but i dont see where this is anything out of the normal for a 20 year old male hooking up with someone for a couple of weeks
i mean id love to be a billionaire too that doesnt mean its going to happen if you dont trust someone drunk or sober they probably arent someone you shouldnt date

it is weird and creepy just keep to im not interested in younger men romantically

you know how all the waaay older men with young women say shes the one who heavily perused me ok but you also agreed so
it is weird and creepy just keep to im not interested in younger men romantically
i will mention this could very easily be a rule put in place to explicitly exclude your kids without outright saying it just be prepared in that case to graciously now out from attending and say you wont be able to make it dont turn things into a fight theres likely a reason they are making the wedding difficult to attend and its likely so they can have excuses not to include those they dont really want to be there
i wouldnt bring it up the conversation isnt going to make you feel better you know how he really feels about you hes either going to lie to your face and beg for forgiveness or even worse he isnt going to deny any of it and will confirm this is how he really feels about you regardless of what he says youre going to feel like shit instead leave with your head held high instead bright side you dont live together and havent merged lives i get its scary to start over but its better to move on at 31 and find that person than have to start over at 41 after youve given him another 10 years to tear down your self esteem
i mean yeah actually i have when youre in that level of crisis you can make some big strides does that mean everything is totally fine after 11 days no definitely not but you can definitely make enough progress in a few sessions to at a minimum know you both want to and are willing to work on things i doubt they went to 2 sessions and stopped for good it sounds like hes just giving an update on we are working things out and therapy has been helpful which isnt at all unbelievable
yes i understood that but im saying youd be surprised just how quickly someone who is now free to do something can suddenly have all sorts of outings lined up she may not as well but im saying dont stay because youre afraid she cant socialize well she clearly can if she wants to
did you do the right thing about what exactly she broke up with you for being an alcoholic you are a 28 year old dating a 21 year old no i dont really think you did the right thing and i think she tried to encourage you to be a better person but you can only change if you want to change and so i hope you want to and are able to change because at least at the beginning of your relationship you sounded like a creepy alcoholic dude who went out with someone really young and are surprised they actually have some standards granted her age is showing by not completely blocking you and moving on but its no surprise a 21 year old doesnt think an older alcoholic is really who she wants to spend time with
she wants to keep being your friend because bullying you makes her feel good about herself youre the undesirable one of the two of you if you cut her off of course shes going to be upset because if someone like you doesnt even like her what does that say about her

now im speaking in her perspective you sound lovely and way too patient here but its clear she only keeps you around because tearing you down and you tolerating it makes her feel that much bigger and better about herself 

yes you should absolutely cut her off i would simply tell her the next time she says anything even mildly passive aggressive ive tried hard not to say anything because at one point our friendship meant a lot to me but im done being your punching bag and am done with our friendship i dont want to talk to you anymore and i hope you learn to treat your friends a lot better than youve treated me

and then block her just block her dont even wait for the reply tell your parents before sending the message so they dont let her in and make sure they support you in this block her on all socials if you think she might be really petty maybe wait for a reply for her to say some nasty shit to you screenshot it for ammo if she spreads rumors about you and then blockmute her
at the end of the day thats really all you can do you cant fix her you can only try to make sure someone who cares about her will try to look out for her 

and idk man seems like her socializing well is the problem here so shell probably be more fine than you realize once she actually is allowed to do as she pleases once shes single
exactly and i am sorry that you will need to go through this discomfort if youre able to just remember that it will be better in time and lead to better things
nah being concerned about your kids safety is never something i will call someone an ah for much like a similar post the only people who i think are maybe ah is the neighbors who spread around the info that this person was responsible but theyre also allowed to be upset that their kids are losing out on a sweet tradition ultimately if she brings it up again i would just say i heard your concerns about your childs safety and i would never put a parent in an uncomfortable position regarding something so serious that being said it isnt up to me to decide how other parents are going to feel about their own children losing out on a tradition that the neighborhood has always really enjoyed if you change your mind and understand this isnt about luring kids into anything other than a joy of curiosity and exploration of nature im happy to continue but im not going to get involved in others being unhappy with you for this were all adults and can manage our own relationships
her friends are fine too just someone you trust who will look out for her if they see her getting worse you arent trying to fix her youre just looking to tell someone youve noticed some things that are concerning and you want them to know in case they see it too so someone can be there for her dont even ask them to get her help just tell them to be on the lookout for any signs
hey i totally get it when i was your age i thought that relationship would be my one and only it felt so amazing and like all my prayers were answered and then we grew up and who we were was no longer who we are and it was no longer right i learned so much though and you have too dont lose those principles your grandfather taught you just because something doesnt work out doesnt mean that the idea isnt good life just has other plans sometimes but youll find that person maybe next week and maybe next year or the next decade but youll find them and itll be worth it just remember that the heartbreak will be necessary to find that relationship youre meant to be in
yeah this is definitely a case where having only one side of the story means any advice other than talk about it is probably not great he says he feels like shes prioritizing this friend over him but she may feel like he doesnt like when she does anything without him its really impossible to know which person is being reasonable or if maybe theyre both being reasonable but they simply arent compatible 

regardless of the answer i still maintain showing up when explicitly told not to come is never the answer unless youre looking to end the relationship
i would personally reach out to her family instead of her if shes genuinely suffering from mental health issues that are undiagnosed shes unlikely to be equipped to address them if youre close to anyone in her life id just reach out to them right after you end things and say youve ended it for reasons you dont want to get into but you still care for her and want whats best for her and think shes been showing some signs of some mental issues that you dont want to go unaddressed if they persistworsen
and thats a 100 understandable reaction personally i think there is a reason most relationships at 18 dont last anyway i know losing a relationship thats lasted this long is still painful but you deserve and will find someone who will not betray your trust like this i wish you well it will hurt but know that good will come from this pain
on the one hand i think its pretty difficult to be fully committed to someone for life at 18 on the other hand if she couldnt be satisfied in her relationship just with you she shouldve broken up with you i think you need to ask yourself if you could move on and have a life with someone who did this to you do people change yeah but that doesnt mean she has yet and it doesnt mean just because shes said sorry you need to accept
i honestly probably wouldnt do this they need to talk and resolve the issue if i were the girlfriend in that situation id feel like my boyfriend was jealous and controlling and couldnt let me have a trip by myself im not saying thats what op would be doing at all but that is definitely how i would feel if i told my boyfriend i wanted to do this trip alone with a friend and he explicitly went behind my back to be in the same city at the same time
i mean just cut contact and tell her before you will discuss anything with her you want to submit a blood paternity test through the lab of your choosing without that retain a good lawyer in preparation for her to sue for child support do not contact her in anything other than writing and do not respond to anything unless its an agreement to take a paternity test

but also no offense if you did get her pregnant you deserve the consequences as unprotected sex with a friend youre not attracted to and you know has mental health issues is just plain stupid youre too old to be acting like that
i mean would you rather be that girl or the girl who was so afraid of looking like that girl that she allowed her boyfriend to blatantly disrespect her and cheat on her for the entirety of their relationship instead because honestly its way worse to be the second one than the first at least that girl has a shred of selfrespect but right now youre acting like you dont even like yourself
idk i wouldnt be able to look at her the same if she didnt give you the money what is a marriage if your word to your partner means nothing
if youre already over her what 2448 hours later yeah it was definitely the right call
he was on mushrooms thats pretty par for the course with drugs of that nature its rather silly to try to diagnose someone on heavily mind altering substances with a serious mental illness from a reddit post that being said sober or high he doesnt sound like a life partner and if thats what op is looking for shed be best served moving on
that wasnt in the post though i did see the comment you mentioned op has fertility issues and will likely need fertility treatments to conceive definitely still a risk but not quite the same risk as would be those otherwise healthy having unprotected sex which for a reference is only about 30 i kiiinda see what youre saying but given most pregnancies in the us are actually unplanned im not fully sure that doesnt add up if anything it totally checks out to me lol it seems to me that bf loves op a lot and wants to spend forever with her on an emotional level hence being okay if they did conceive but as of right now isnt willing to completely and legally tie himself to her until he knows theyre on the same page 

child support for someone youve never married vs someone you are married to own a home with etc are definitely two very different worst case scenario financial situations if im taking all emotion out of the situation since im sure youre thinking if hes willing to have a child with her why not be willing to marry her and while i definitely personally agree with that thought process know plenty of people who dont
well he was with his ex since they were at the oldest 15 it isnt really that surprising they didnt get married as they were likely around 2324 when they broke up i understand 10 years sounds like a lot but once you actually consider the majority of their relationship if not all of it comprised of middlehigh schoolcollege its not really a factor 

and we definitely have enough info from ops biased perspective to see why someone wouldnt want to marry her just yet you can love someone like crazy and still be able to recognize that someone with terrible credit poor spending habits and payday loans all things op readily admits to isnt someone to marry right away marriage is both an emotional and a logical decision and it definitely sounds like the logical part of the decision has entirely valid reasons to want to wait and make sure this isnt a disaster waiting to happen as differences in finances are the number one reason couples divorce
just remember your ability to get an appointment and others experiences arent going to be the same this occurred during lockdown when everything was done online so options werent limited by location and zoom therapy opened up a lot of options for people that werent previously available for example ive never had to wait longer than 2 weeks for an appointment ive needed new patient or old therapy or any other doctor but that doesnt mean i would tell anyone else they didnt try hard enough if they werent able to find an appointment as quickly 

if your only reason for doubting the veracity of this story is the idea that someone was able to get a therapy appointment quickly and hire someone during a time where plenty of people werent able to work due to the lockdowns id urge you to remember your experiences wont be the same as everyone elses
oooor its really obvious op was way too immature for marriage until very recently and he isnt readywilling to make a huge and lifelong commitment to someone who only recently had poor credit and payday loans

why does it always need to be the guy is lying to op about wanting to get married and bullshitting her with his super valid concerns about proceeding
i mean your relationship isnt serious hes said as much if hes already planning who hes going to fuck when you break up he clearly isnt very committed or interested in you if hes already prepared for how hell get over your breakup and which friends hell find comfort inside literally break up with him and you probably need to break up with that friend as well because i dont know how shitty of a person someone needs to be to sleep with their friend of 4 years fwb at a minimum pseudo boyfriend more accurately thats a pure trash move from both parties and most 2223 year olds will know better than to behave like this men and women
i mean now youve learned how your husband will treat your kid ifwhen you divorce him and he finds some other younger woman to start a family with 

red flag if ever i saw one
at that point just leave otherwise its just an attention seeking endeavor please notice me withdrawing rather than organically just matching the energy it wouldnt be noticeable otherwise and then youre brought back to my initial comment easier said than done when you live together and if youre at the point of needing to be petty to be heard the relationship clearly isnt working
you moved and said no one you know is in your area how is your ex a genuine concern he wouldnt know where you live
well you have no idea what shes in therapy for this is clearly either an obvious crush on bil and a bs sexist ploy to get close to himhave an affair or genuine anxiety but that doesnt mean that either have been adequately brought up in therapy you can be in therapy for things and not be in therapy for everything or even the right things
sounds like she looked up the wine and saw the price for a case not a bottle as a case of 12 is around 200 and figured you wouldnt know the difference
ok well neither of you sound grown up enough to get married
thats probably much easier if you dont live and have pets together like op at that point its pretty difficult to pull back in any meaningful way without being seen as really petty
you can be upset your girlfriend went to a con topless thats a pretty standard boundary for most people but you dont say you feel she crossed a line by being topless youre upset because she embarrassed you because you dont like how her body looks after beating cancer and thats what makes you ta
its a small company there likely is not hr
ok but i very much doubt she was overcompensating for the past 45 years this has likely been an issue for at least a few years no
talking about this issue is the start but if you guys arent able to actively resolve these issues within the next 3 months i would cancel the wedding i would accelerate that timeline depending on whenif you need to cancel by a certain date to get refunds on whatever you can 

chances are you arent able to resolve these issues you would be extremely foolish to push forward into a marriage where resentment is already blooming because even canceling an expensive wedding will be much cheaper than a divorce
the fact that its taken you 5 years to even begin to question such a glaring and obvious incompatibility is mind numbing to me 

this isnt fixable she isnt going to suddenly going to start wanting sex as much as you do youre signing up for a lifetime of disappointment which seems unwise
yeah im really not surprised that attraction is at the core of this im sorry to kick you while youre down but in the absence of kids or seriously debilitating health issues there are honestly few people out there who wont start to lose attraction for such a massive change in appearance before marriage somehow everyone on reddit claims to be that minority and im sure most people wouldnt say anything but attraction and effort is also very important to a long lasting relationship and you will find that like i said there are plenty of people out there who really dont care and will find you beautiful at any weight or type of clothing its now just time to find them  good luck
to be honest i do not understand this your brothers 30th milestone birthday is the same night and you wanted to go as a couple and obviously were planning to attend so how did this conversation of am i invited and ill get a sitter even happen

how was the conversation not it is my brothers birthday that same night you are either attending with me or youre staying and watching the children but going to a 21st birthday of a friend isnt an option like i just dont get how you didnt bring up your brothers birthday and how you were just ready to ditch your brothers birthday if you were invited to this persons 21st
yeah and its foolish to think that will never happen because of course as soon as you bank your life on that wont happen it does without fail
sadly doesnt seem like he cares about losing op too much as he left the house even after noelle told him to get lost and didnt deny it or try to work things out all things considered though op is better off with him not fighting because at least shell be able to leave much sooner and with much less pomp and circumstance
uhm whoever that they is is an idiot because it isnt true alcohol isnt a truth serum it just lowers your inhibitions and sometimes those inhibitions are all thats stopping people from saying something absolutely wildly untrue but just pops into their head and sound goodfunnyshocking
a 45 lb weight gain in less than 2 years as an otherwise healthy assuming here since nothing to indicate otherwise 20 something year old is definitely really concerning honestly reddit hates to address it but that would definitely put a strain on attraction for most people the other obvious issues aside that being said not everyone and you deserve a partner who is attracted to you as you are now and loves you and wouldnt leave you even if someone better came along
idek if this is about him being insecure so much as about him wanting to be able to do better than op and the reality is things change in peoples lives all the time that open up previously unavailable dating options people get rich start to take skin care or fitness or eating healthy more seriously all the time health issues or fixes can completely change a person promotion at work lottery win inheritance or an investment that pays off some insecure 23 year old with daddy issues comes along


as soon as that happens op is getting dumped immediately and remorselessly
it isnt about her its about him he pretty outright told you if a woman like her were interested in me i wouldnt be with you i would be with her he might love you but ifwhen a woman in her league likes him hell be the type who cant resist you really want to be one of those my husband left me when i was pregnant with our second child for a woman 10 years younger than me stories because he is the man who leaves his wife for a woman 10 years younger than him because he never thought hed have a chance with the hot young woman and now that he does hes willing to blow up his life for the chance

he can nuke this relationship with his friend to the ground and it doesnt matter because she isnt the woman who will give him a chance but someone someday probably will and if you cant trust your partner to turn down any woman young old hot rich smart poor stupid etc why are you with them
you love who you thought he was not who he is are you telling me you think so little of yourself to fall in love with someone whom you know is only with you because he thinks he cant do any better he thinks youre fat thinks you cant cook and thinks hes also poor and not worth a better woman thats not what i look for in a dream man honesty
do you regret having your son because this definitely sounds like you regret having your son and cant genuinely fathom someone wanting to be a parent as a 1 goal in life remember people can want different things and if you keep up this attitude your son is going to realize you clearly regret becoming a mother
probably because he loves his wife and also because regardless of how unhappy you are not many people want to be the guy who divorced his wife after she beat cancer youd be surprised by how much guilt probably made him stay as long as he did
a marriage is more than sex but a marriage is not more than any form of intimacy with absolutely no form of intimacy and affection you arent married youre just legal roommates why have all of the liability for none of the benefits that isnt a partner at that point
it isnt just sex its all form of love and intimacy how can you expect a marriage to last if youre unwillingunable to do any of the things that actually make a marriage a marriage they arent kissing cuddling pleasing each other or even hugging each other no back massages or showers together or any form of intimacy she isnt willing to go to therapy with him and has made it clear she expects this to be permanent she has made her choice and its a choice anyone would respect but just because you respect someones choice doesnt mean you need to accept it 

her choice affects him as well and hes allowed to decide that thats not the life he signed up for stop acting as those refusing all forms of intimacy and affection and being unwilling to work on or compromise about it is just about sex
i mean does she need to be worried about it because its a choice to remove all intimacy and romance from a marriage and thats a choice that was made separate from the lack of libido if you remove everything that makes a marriage unique from a friendshiproommate its unreasonable to expect someone to want to continue being in that marriage

if ops wife wants op to stick around in a marriage with no intimacy at all thats very different from libido issues and a lack of piv
i think you should just say this at this point it isnt about the cake its about you 1 saying you would do something repeatedly and then not following through 2 you not being able to handle being called out on not staying true to your word and 3 the fact that you can see clearly now that it is that important and youve shown no remorse or sense of accountability and havent even apologized or tried to make it up to me this isnt the kind of person i want to be with im glad i found this out only 10 months in at least 

because really this isnt the kind of person you want to be with
while thats fair enough they definitely do upgrade only one person on the same reservation when its free upgrades had it happen a number of times to me
theres a substantial difference between giving someone on your locator number an upgrade and a stranger though
i get it but yeah relationships that go through so many bumps honestly arent stronger yes you need to be able to work through issues but relationships that constantly have bumps are just rocky and eventually someone is going to decide they dont want to deal with the rockiness forever i think a lot of people in rocky and unstable relationships think theyre stronger because well weve always worked though things before but i think most people outside of the relationship can see the opposite is really true because people just dont want to constantly be trying to work things out with someone as nauseam forever 

if youre constantly fighting with someone even small spats but especially bigger spats that almost always means that relationship isnt right at least not without something major changing
i think the sad thing is people like that actually are often really loyal to the person they actually want and end up getting left by those people leading to them being in general super disrespectful of others time
honestly i wouldnt even say that i would just say i realized i dont see this being a long term thing and dont want either of our time to be wasted so its best we part ways now rather than later

why would you admit to knowing some pretty messed up info just say you dont feel it anymore and make her think its because of her not because of op not being enough for her
nta just sit your parents down and say i am feeling like i dont matter as much to you as ana is this true let them answer once they do say every year you treat me like a second class citizen giving me a 10 minute meal i dont even really love to celebrate and giving everyone else the ability to choose whatever they want on their birthday i am willing to compromise and give ana our actual birthday but do you really think thats fair because im only 16 and i realize how blatantly unfair that is can we please as a family sit down and can you please listen to me expressing myself and come to a compromise listen for their answer if their answer isnt yes of course just say this i love you which is why im being really honest with this if you guys arent able to recognize the blatant favoritism and disrespect thats going on dont be surprised if in a few years our relationship looks very different if you guys arent willing to show all of your children the same love in the same ways thats going to really damage our relationship and im not saying this as a bratty teenager im saying this as your hurt daughter who doesnt want to believe that her parents would be so calloused to not realize that a 16 year old still needs the same love and joy around her birthday even if she has a younger sister i didnt stop existing when ana was born

just be mature about it dont yell or throw a tantrum and remember youll be 18 in a few years and can decide how much this truly affects the relationship with your parents then
i dont think one month is the standard either
i know this is hard to hear but i dont think this is as quick a switch up as youre making it out to be sounds like there were a lot of issues throughout your relationship and a lot of incompatibilities thats not really a sudden problem its a bit misleading and naive to tell yourself this is sudden because even in your post i can tell this was a long time coming as a stranger and i didnt live this relationship you may benefit from being honest about the past 4 years to learn the signs of a doomed relationship because i bet upon reflection they will be there
tbh its very possible they got notice and disregarded itmissed it i know i dont read a lot of mail that looks like junk
i mean just remember people really do find out about their cheating spouse this way
i think it really depends on where you are and how diligent you are a lot of times i think people are unfamiliar with how to find people to call which results in everyone calling the top few results and leading to insane wait times and inevitably people give up after a number of we have an appointment x months away but ive never had an issue getting an appointment when i needed one it was only ever a question of how many doctors would i need to call to get one im sure everyones experience is different though but there are definitely more resources available than a lot of people realize unfortunately
so you arent saying she needs to include sil but the issue is you also arent saying she doesnt need to include her and frankly i do not want my wife to include someone who so deliberately excluded her from their own wedding 

inaction is action here you think just because you arent saying to include her youre in the clear but you arent you need to tell your family she doesnt and shouldnt include her understand the difference
ok and to be fair you know your fiance did feel excluded you couldve spoken about it to the brother you are very very close to but you didnt so yes it is your not our your bad for for communicating this at the time two years ago and now lisa will learn actions have consequences even if those actions are somewhat reasonable 

just explain to anyone who asks if you didnt feel comfortable having my wife in your wedding party you cant expect her to feel comfortable having you in hers just like we respected your decision to choose who to include in your wedding party and your wedding photos you need to respect our decision this isnt up for discussion anymore i am not going to allow my wife to feel uncomfortable about anything surrounding the happiest day of our lives are we clear

time to be a big boy and stand up for your wife and your marriage if you dont this is the sort of pattern that rots a marriage inside out take notes
its the current standard of care for fractious cats in vet med easier said than done really shouldnt apply to doing your job properly not only that but its pretty simple to have the vet just place the towel over the cats body that the tech can then secure with the bits of his armtorso that are available sure if there was one person doing this you might have a point but not with two sets of hands available
there are definitely way better restraint methods that are meant to be used for fractious cats like this for example placing a towel over the cats face which will help to calm the cat and also prevent the cat from reading back to bite like that
you mean building a successful team doesnt happen overnight they actually gasp need time to bring everything together and dominate 

im shocked s
heads up if youre actually a doctor you need to be smart enough to tell the difference your wife has a genuine problem with the frequency and amount of your drinking if youre unwillingunable to have a serious conversation about your alcohol consumption while youre both sober you probably arent making it to too many more anniversary celebrations shes getting fed up this isnt her humor this is her genuine annoyance and frustration you would be an utter fool not to see this for what it is and address your pretty clear problem

men your age are not getting wasted every friday unless theyre alcoholics
i mean definitely depends it wouldnt surprise me if op is an alcoholic i had another beer because thats just what i do on a friday night despite being visibly drunk already sounds like binge drinking and it sounds like something his wife isnt okay with and probably even had a conversation with him about please dont embarrass me at our anniversary or whatever wording it was asking him not to get so drunk and shes annoyed as shes been putting up with it for so long
can confirm from experience anyone who says it wont affect things and says itll still be a friendship trip is lying the only reason it wont affect ops trip is because the friend and her boyfriend will never be around which in and of itself completely ruins the point of the trip unless op wanted to be alone the whole time very much not worth and ruined the friendship i will add
yeah this is a reminder that unless you get some mega asshole people arent going to be commenting on this sort of thing its all about if youre comfortable enough to have that part of your body be seen
ignore her if you really want a clear message sent block her account if ever you need to say anything just say i have no interest in being friends with someone like you i have way more respect for myself than to keep someone in my life who would purposefully flirt with my boyfriend in front of me just to prove a point that says a lot and everything that it says is appalling stop contacting me
yes but they also pretty commonly get it when they themselves arent clean enough and bacteria from their butt gets into too close contact with their vagina during sex any uti you get using a condom is likely due to your own hygiene rather than the covered condom it definitely isnt just men who can have poor hygiene and its important to recognize that maybe they are both in need of a good scrub for the others comfort its never easy to bring up concerns so he may have a legitimate concern as well that he didnt know how to tactfully bring up 

they canshould both be taking showers before sex
yeah but im sure you immediately saw his reaction and apologized clearly that did not happen here
then you wouldnt be saying teehee idk when your partner asks what youll do you say i took it so hed leave me alone but ill delete it when were home
lmao look she can absolutely have a hotwifecuck fetish and if her partner is on board like her ex obviously was thats totally cool im not shaming two individuals who have fully consented to whatever in their relationship but no you arent jealous for having a problem with your girlfriend saying i dont know what shes going to do about the dude who wants to fuck her and shes playing along with it thats like her trying to say youre jealous for being mad she has another dude inside of her there are some pretty well established boundaries within monogamous relationships that while its always best to discuss anyway are go without saying rules and expectations not entertaining dudes who very clearly want to get in your pants is pretty bare min 

your girl has something wrong with her if she genuinely doesnt see how without express consent from you playing this behavior that its just not okay
usavevideo
i would honestly just say your attitude is atrocious if i waited for you you can wait for me it was a few minutes im extremely disappointed in you for trying to turn something good in my life about yourself we need to talk about this because im absolutely not going to tolerate this sort of behavior but i think its best we both take some space from each other to collect our thoughts so we can hopefully have a productive conversation about this because right now im having a hard time seeing how to move forward in a relationship with someone who cant be happy when something good happens

because this is either a habit of hers or this is the first time its happened and either way you need to make it crystal clear that if she thinks this is okay you two arent compatible why would you willingly stay with someone who would burst your bubble like this over seven fucking minutes ive literally taken shits that last longer
did he actually not have sex with someone for 7 years im honestly doubtful of that because if it took him a few months to ask you to be exclusive you were presumably having sex while not in a relationship a guy who goes 7 years without sex doesnt really do things that way

i dont know if youre taking didnt date anyone for 7 years to be the same as didnt have sex or see anyone at all for 7 years because they arent quite the same now obviously if he explicitly said the words youre the first person ive slept with since my ex 7 years ago then ofc
also to op she feels the love has started growing since nov to him it didnt even start until they made things official which was only a few months it takes people awhile to fall in love sometimes especially if its been 7 years since he last was i assume he wasnt celibate during that time so it lends itself to the idea of he isnt one to fall in love easily or quickly 

op if youre offended i think you need to look inward and assess you say i love you because you want someone to feel good not because you want the emotional validation of hearing it back
well because believe it or not it actually doesnt solve the problem to say omg wow he suuuuucks if we want to be high school girls gossiping in the lunch room well focus on the negative behavior but if youre actually trying to problem solve you focus less on the actions of the past and more on the actions to do in the future to address the behavior and in order the address it op needs to communicate how shes feeling
well its not really a family vacation she specifically said to him i want to see this city and i want you to spend time with your teacher that can very reasonably be interpreted as two separate vacations that are going on at the same time with obvious time spent together but this isnt the same thing as a family vacation where the only intent is to have fun together as a family op wants to see the city and in trying to make that happen explicitly told her husband she wanted him to be able to spend time and hang out with a friend mind you this is the first time theyve ever met and its presumably in a country that speaks the language husband has been learning its completely understandable how meeting a friend for the first time you can get lost in the time and being exposed to a culture for the first time and being able to apply everything youve been working hard to learn could also just be so new and exciting for ops husband 

now is it right what hes doing no hes married to a mother and he needs to understand that there are certain limitations with that but this isnt a family vacation in the traditional sense and so its very easy to see how husband doesnt understand op would have a problem with him hanging out with his friend when he was explicitly told the purpose of the trip was so he could do so so communication is key and no not some condescending communication like thats some fucking ridiculous concept actual adult communication
i have a feeling the fact that its not his daughter is playing a role he rather obviously doesnt really consider himself a father and while i dont think he should have to he also is married to a mother and with that comes an understanding of there will be natural changes and limitations to what you can do on vacation 

going out past 10 pm only to go out again at 3 am and not be back till after 7 am is definitely one of those things you really cant do
yeah the longer she waits the more likely its completely over i dont see how a relationship recovers after this much time dead in the water honestly  i had a friendship end pretty similarly and i was open to repairing it for like a few weeks and after they didnt reach out i was over it when they finally did reach out i just ignored it
honestly given its been a few weeks since theyve spoken allie may not be keeping op in her life either if op wants to save that friendship she needs to reach out and apologize and ask how she can best support allie and respect her boundaries while doing so because if she doesnt reach out the relationship with allie is done for
are you telling me that youre happy now
idk everyone says that but they either dont know the people around them or just have a selection bias because if you are honest enough and live long enough you realize that like i said 95 of the population says catty things to their close confidants and humans as a whole really are not immune from having crappy thoughts its incredibly naive of people who claim not meeee must be you

hell i can look at most peoples comment histories and see plenty of catty comments the only difference is being able to at least acknowledge it
gently prodding for more details like the people asking for each of their exact salary i gotta say i side with him on that one hes asking for advice about a particular situation and attitude
i mean he said slightly and its negligible at that point if you think negligible is 2x nothing then you also just think nothing op is saying is reliable in which case advice is pointless some people arent comfortable sharing specific details on the internet for anonymity

 imagine being so hungry for info on strangers you block someone for calling out how weird it is
uhuh thats what everyone says its like someone saying they dont owe in the shower its more likely theyre lyingin denial about it than they dont actually pee in the shower 

most people dont realize just how catty private conversations really are to an outsider
just tell her youll cover this month if she covers next and if she puts up a fight just say if you dont see the issue in your attitude we need to have a more serious conversation about our relationship in general because its not okay for you to expect me to cover the burden of your mistakes without so much as having a conversation or asking me about it im not okay being with someone who thinks thats okay regardless of if this is over 30 or way more
dude stop asking about ops personal salary info
i think the issue is she said im not paying this month because i already made my budget kinda hard assed imo but i guess and im not paying extra the month after either shes basically saying you need to pay for my fuck up and im not accepting any other answer over 5 or 5k or 50k that sort of attitude is really bad for any relationship
well you also said youve only been dating a few months youd be surprised at how well people are at hiding their true nature for months and even years at a time but now youve seen a side to her and while its possible she means what she said to you more likely than not she just doesnt like confrontation and is spinning things to sound nicer to you now that you called her out either she is going to dump you or youre going to dump her but theres very little chance this person is your person im sorry i know it sucks to find out someone isnt who you thought they are
no offense as well but its also really naive to think 95 of people dont have a mean side in some regard people are not known for being saints if you had to show strangers your worst private conversation with your closest friends and families we would all think every single person in this thread is vain judgmental and shallow
i mean the whole point of the post was centered around a superficial perception of worth not surprising he would only bring up the direct comparisons that are relevant not only that but if he actually spent half the post talking about all the reasons he likes her outside of on paper youd be saying hes overcompensating and shes not really that great 

i think if you described your partner to a complete and utter stranger most would say similar things youre not going to go on about he gives the best head ive ever had youll say things like hes smart funny handsome etc

unless this happened yesterday this person was clearly able to easily find an ob that didnt ask so it cant really be standard practice or else everyone would have asked her
yeah dont expect this person to be your friend moving forward i cant imagine ever wanting someone who suggested getting rid of the baby i really wanted in my life just because they thought it was too soon
that isnt fair at all she seems to just want an equal and thats going to be near impossible with someone 15 years older than her
are you actually shocked she was unhappy or are you just shocked she would actually leave because the fact that youre shocked is the problem she told you what she needed and you ignored her if youre genuinely so emotionally stunted that you can have all that information and still be shocked that shows just how terrible of a partner you are every time you say im just so shocked makes you look that much worse thats like someone seeing a lit fire and then saying theyre shocked when it burns someone that dumb probably shows it in other ways as well and for you the issues definitely showed in other ways so be honest are you actually shocked or are you just shocked she would actually leave
nta but most likely theres a background there and you hit a nerve you didnt know about let it go im sure it doesnt really have anything to do with you i will say i think it is a bit personal after knowing someone less than 4 months to be effectively asking about if they had an indepth conversation about marriage or if it was a surprise i can understand how that might strike a nerve with some people im sure you meant it pretty innocently though so youre not really an ah for that i say nta since if she does have a nerve to strike probably shouldnt be sharing things at work but to each their own
you are just making crap up now they met at a mutual hobby youre aware that it is genuinely possible to just get on with someone right like holy hell are you deluded to act as though someone has to yes i am aware they often do but to act as though thats the only option is insane seek out some young woman and it isnt genuinely possible for two adults to meet and hit it off and for age not to come up until later believe it or not in the adult world you dont often say hi how are you my name is blank and i am xx years old how about you oh sorry youre too old for me to talk to they didnt meet on a dating app they met in the real world over shared interests its mind numbing to me someone can be so bigoted to just blindly ignore all other possibilities because yes often age gaps are bad do you think other stereotypes are okay to blindly follow too heads up they arent 

the only dodgy behavior here is yours because im not the one arguing to blindly judge a person and their intentions based solely on their age not only that but youre infantilizing a fucking 28 year old soon to be nurse do you have any idea how disrespectful that is to women in general just ludicrous
just reply i bought the ticket for my date that was meant to be you but clearly you had other plans so i found a new date
i think ultimately you just need to stop caring why are you walking on eggshells you are legally 100 within your rights to do what youre doing he cant complain about the noise youre making youre legally allowed to use your apartment even with reasonable disruption to others most landlords cant actually make rules like no cookingusing laundry machine after 10 pm because that infringes on your legal right to use your space youre paying for so just stop caring so what if he bangs not your problem youre not doing anything wrong tune him out keep your door locked if you need to report anything simply say to the landlord in writing the neighbor below me has been banging on the walls at all hours of the day in response to my normal living habits i am not making any excessive noise and have taken every precaution to minimize my disruption to neighbors to what is reasonable while still allowing me to live in the space im paying for i know i am not doing anything wrong here so i am alerting you of the issue in case this escalated further and in case youre able to speak with neighbor to understand that apartment building arent always completely silent and im legally entitled to walk to the bathroom if i wake up and need to pee but other than that stop caring
girl real talk if you think two years of being miserable and being 28 before you can even start to find a real partner is worth less than 3k you need some therapy 

this is so worth 3k that id even say its worth going into credit card debt over but obviously if you can take a loan from family a nolow interest balance transfer find a cheaper place etc etc etc do that first but genuinely your mental health and happiness is worth so much more than 3k and if youre already paying 70 of the rent find a cheaper place and the money youll save from only needed to care for one adult will more than make up for it
nta this isnt the standard my cousin doesnt respect my serious relationship that is longer than hes been dating his fiance you always see where id probably say your gf would be valid in feeling hurt you left her behind as thats a direct insult to your relationship but he is famous and presumably if he never gets privacy somewhat significantly famous where paparazzi may be trying to snoop your girlfriend only wanting to come because of the experience famous person cool wedding is exactly the kind of person your cousin is trying to avoid attending his wedding no offense to your girlfriend i get how she feels but your cousin is allowed to want privacy in one of the most intimate milestones in his life and making sure only close friends and immediateactual family is the best way to ensure that
nta sepsis has a 2050 mortality rate that then increases by something like 57 every hour you go without treatment its quite frankly one of the worst medical outcomes you can have short from a horrifyingly traumatic injury and some ultra aggressive cancers your bil either hates your brother or is a massive idiot because chances are better than not that your brother isnt fine and if he is itll be its own little miracle given he probably was ignoring the symptoms for a bit of time if he thought it was just a bad virus
 that isnt a lie even in a court of law learn how the english language works better because those statements are 100 accurate and would hold up to any intelligent scrutiny im done with this conversation now bye bye
no it isnt its not a lie to not give everyone a play by play reenactment of every decision youve ever made its not even a half truth its just a truth op saw her on sm and figured theyd get along whether or not you agree its definitely because they have mutual friends that op came to that conclusion op would not have felt that way if it were just a complete and total stranger who happened to live in the same city and again definitely a small world because lets do this with actual strangers if i rolled up in la and decided i liked random influencer i could swipe for months and never find them that statement is plain and simple truth

remember no one is entitled to every single thought youve ever had in the name of integrity thats foolish have a good day now
youre contradicting yourself youre essentially saying if it ever comes up she should continue to lie about not knowing they had mutual friends rather than saying i was a little embarrassed because i figured you had no idea who i was if she asks about it rather than being technically 100 truthful if you advocate transparency then thered be nothing wrong with this as it would technically be clearing up the only actual lie op has told
i certainly would never bring it up but youd be surprised how many stupid conversations couples who are newly in love will have its better to have a thought out way to frame things than just word vomiting because youre flustered and caught off guard and coming off like the next joe
its not a lie there is no mention of the temporality of those events and to some extent that is a large part of why op figured theyd like her personality sm is a shit reflection of who a person really is but the fact that they had mutual friends lent a lot of credence to the conclusions op was making and it is a small world or else ops plan would not have worked 

sure its carefully curating the truth to give the best perspective on the situation but theres no lie so theres no concern of breach of integrity i purposefully avoided any language that would indicate a temporal correlation between seeing her on sm and matching on the dating app to make sure that there wasnt any lies
yes for everyone out there an esa is a pet that is legally effectively all they are the only luxuries having an esa allows you is having them in nopet housing and being able to fly with them on some airlines and you need extensive paperwork outside of those two very specific and limited instances theyre no different than any other dog out there they can be forbidden from public spaces and do not have any other protections they arent working and thus the whole do not pet a working dog doesnt apply it is a crime to claim an esa is a service animal by the way two very different legal definitions 

now you should always use caution when petting a dog you dont know as you dont know if the dog will bite but at that point thats fully the fault of the owner for not restraining their pet in public
sometimes its all in how you package things we matched and i realized id seen you in friends socials and i figured hey if they fuck with you maybe i would too and here we are crazy how its such a small world huh sounds way better than before you even knew i existed i decided wed be a good couple so i downloaded all the apps because that makes my intentions the most clear and just swiped until i found you and hoped for the best easy really now that i think about it doesnt it
the only thing i would ever admit to is i had seen you on sm before and seeing you on whatever app made me want to shoot my shot small world huh and if she ever pressed just say nah i never thought about sliding into your dms but i saw a cute girl who i knew my friends fucked with and figured hey if they fuck with you i might too and here we are 

makes it waaaaaay less stalkery than what your post implies
best of luck just remember you and him vs the problem hes committed to being a team to figure this out you guys got this
there is the fourth issue of you two are also incompatible for other reasons at some point you may need to accept you two are two puzzle pieces from completely different sets that you keep trying to force together that were just never meant to you dont seem to have a lot of the necessary fundamentals for a long lasting relationship and then on top of it theres issues of trust and intimacy building up with it theres only so much good communication can fix and you may need to take a good hard look and see how much of these issues are just who you each are and how you two dont work together
that honestly means that while the road ahead will be tough and filled with work you two will likely figure this out try to hold onto that hope while you two are navigating the road ahead it may get worse before it gets better because both of you two are clearly on wholly other planets right now but he wants to try and you want to try both of you are willing to genuinely give therapy a try and communication can almost always be improved with hard work and honest selfreflection in some ways you two have already overcome the hardest obstacle deciding to make it work
yike im not trying to normalize it no but i am trying to say dont make a judgment strictly about a persons age when if you eliminated the age their feelings would be totally valid because his feelings are totally valid the age gap isnt the issue here 

look man if you wanna be prejudiced against people how about you say it with your whole chest because otherwise ill continue to look at the actual behavior of the individuals before making someone out to be predatory
dont be too hard on yourself your future is so important and as much as it sucks this didnt work out there will be other guys out there your story isnt uncommon at all i did a similar degree and at the start a lot of our class was in relationships and within that first year unless the couples were already engagedmarried not many were able to survive the stress of being a full time professional student
not for anything but thats not really an accurate contextualization either most 28 year olds have an established career already its a fully fledged adult and you have been at that point for a few years 40 also isnt really middle aged and if it is its only barely youre naturally trying to make her seem younger and him older but at this point the differences in their age are nowhere near that of a 20 and a 32 year old and again he isnt at all saying she cant do anything outside of him its just a simple fact that its really hard to make meaningful time for a partner when youre doing a medical degree and working full time and still managing to work out and take care of yourself please stop trying to make this about his age almost any other 28 year old would have similar feelings here its completely normal to feel this way in a relationship where your partner is either unable or unwilling to give adequate time to the relationship i dont understand why youre trying to make this about some weird power dynamic when anyone who has gone through a professional degree like nursing doctor lawyer knows that half of your class starts out in a relationship and by the end of that first year a whole heck of a lot of them are newly single because they just cant devote enough time to the relationship to make it work
the age gap isnt actually the problem if anything its op thats the problem as she really doesnt have the time right now to properly maintain a relationship and thats why she totally made the right call in recognizing that and recognizing her partner was unhappy and it was unfair
i think youre being way too heavily biased by the years theyre born for once i dont see this as an issue of age believe it or not adults partake in the same hobbies at all ages so take age out of the question if these two were the same age you wouldnt really be saying that its completely normal for him to feel alone and unloved in a relationship where they see each other once a week live a decent drive apart and shes going to school in a difficult program while working full time that means she really doesnt have a lot of time to give him and frankly very few people are okay with having a partner with so little time to spare and who blatantly says you arent as important to me as schoolwork even if true and i agree prioritize school that is a statement that is going to sting and be really hard to maintain a positive and supportive relationship with someone he isnt demanding she drop out he is just voicing his extremely valid feelings its hard to imagine anyone wouldnt feel abandoned and unloved in a relationship like op is describing and its understandable that he would struggle to be really supportive while also balancing his career and his own emotions about the relationship op certainly isnt emotionally supporting her ex so its not really hard to see why he wouldnt be emotionally supporting her 

now shes not in the wrong she needs to focus on school and build her career but that also probably means she needs to do it while single until she actually has enough time to devote to a relationship because just like she needs to spend a lot of time on school you also need to spend a lot of time cultivating a loving and healthy relationship she made the right choice to end things not because of his age but because she doesnt have the time and he was rightfully unhappy with the dynamic it happens op handled things incredibly maturely not surprising since she isnt exactly young and i say this because someone is saying he groomed her at 28
you may want to discuss a prenup if you havent already you two still love each other and want to spend your lives together and shes already looking to maximize her profit at your expense god help you if you two ever dont love each other shell take you for everything youre worth and then some you may trust her now when youre happy but prenups plan for the messy end not the happy beginning so be forewarned
make sure you have a solid plan in place for where you will go and who will be there to support you first make sure all of your documents are out of the house and have an overnight bag ready to go and a place to stay before you broach the conversation have a friend who will be on standby in case you need them hes threatened self harm so if that doesnt work he may become aggressive towards you 

then you just wait until hes home and hasnt had a particularly bad day at workschool and say we need to talk about our relationship because i dont see this working out long term we have different views on sex and you have needs around intimacy i cant meet and im uncomfortable with the expectation physical intimacy needs to lead to sex or else youll be frustrated or unsatisfied its better for both of us to find partners who are on the same page as us with our love languages we need to figure out who will move out when if you have bills that you share whatever joint responsibilities you two have because i think its time for us to part ways i really do care about you but this dynamic isnt good for either of us

if he begins to beg just say i know this is really difficult and its difficult for me as well but its clear that after 6 years together we arent right for each other i dont want our fear of the unknown to keep us from actually finding a relationship where we can each have our needs met both of us deserve that and my decision is made i am not open to working on things anymore

if he threatens selfharm im sorry i know this hurts if you feel like you need support i can contact your friendsfamily and let them know so you dont have to go through this alone and if you really do have suicidal ideation then please speak to a therapist because i dont want anything bad to happen to you but i cannot and will not be your emotional crutch anymore i am happy to help you out with resources but im not going to entertain any attempts to place the burden of your mental wellbeing on me that isnt fair to do to me
id probably have been nicer his wife isnt listening to him and now his best friend isnt listening to him if he has no outlet for these emotions this is why people sometimes end up cheating that never thought they would hear him out at the end of the day losing a parent is traumatic but not a reason to give up on your relationshipstop living forever six months later is long enough that she needs to start at least acknowledging she needs to be working towards normalcy and intimacy in her marriage yes shes grieving but shes had that period of uninterrupted she comes first no matter what already its done and now its time for okay how do we move forward and find the new normal it seems like she isnt even willing to have that conversation with your friend despite him being proactive and trying to communicate which is a serious issue
apologies for being harsh but i find ignoring things just because they arent nice to hear is how we end up in situations like yours you knew he didnt love you and stayed anyway because you were hoping you were wrong its understandable but remember the only one youre hurting is yourself 

youre worthy of love and you seem like a kind and genuine person you can afford to be a little bit stingy with who you give your heartbody to use this as a learning experience for the signs of someone who doesnt really love you and has poor intentions
its 100 teenagers and other young adults who think theyve learned how the world works by reading reddit and fail to realize life outside of a computer operates very differently  dont worry theyll learn eventually at least i hope
or more likely its neither but hes also afraid to be alone so he can use op for the emotional support until he finds someone he connects with physically and emotionally and then he leaves her this is really just monkeybranching with more steps
yep hes waiting until he finds someone else he connects with more and once he does itll be im sorry it just happened i didnt mean for it to but im in love with her
so obviously this guy sucks he saw an easy lay and he took it he took advantage of you and that isnt okay that being said its common for 18 and 23 year olds to make stupid mistakes and engage in shitty behavior like this its also common for one party to mentally break up long before they come out and say it so yeah i understand what he means by saying hes moved on already it sucks be proud of yourself for asking the question and leaving once he was honest it isnt your fault he didnt communicate hes young hes selfish and it was easier to wait until he was over you and had someone else lined up than deal with being sad and alone people get better as they get older but also plenty dont unfortunately youll experience this again most likely just know its because theyre emotionally immature not because you did anything wrong you were a young vulnerable kid who fell for the wrong guy it happens to the best of us let it hurt and itll be okay in the end
that is literally thousands of dollars to do 1500 the cheapest ive seen for an hour hes fallen on hard times and so that would be crazy stupid to do when his brother has a sports car not saying op needs to agree but renting a sports car is insanely expensive and cost prohibitive
out of curiosity if its once a month is this the same rough time of month in relation to its proximity to your period because this may also be due to hormone fluctuations which doesnt solve your issue but may also help to 1 combat it and 2 open up the conversation better so he understands its akin to being extra nice to your gf that has a cold
ill be clear now be careful of the comments saying your husband is being ridiculous he isnt its fair to want to compromise it is unfair to continue to be mad at him after he immediately understood his mistake apologized took responsibility and attempted to find a solution let go of the angerbeing upset and instead redirect to finding a feasible solution that both of you are happy with it sounds like you plan to do this in a few days time awesome

as far as your language no im not trying to find any personal flaws in you it seems youre misreading things i am simply pointing out a focus of your current dialogue is how you are feeling and while i respect the idea you dont want to speak for your husband its coming off as the opposite and to just be aware of this if it extends beyond this reddit post remember to let him decide what he thinks is feasible for himself he may not be sleep deprived at all i need 46 hours of sleep a night to function at full capacity and my partner needs 910 everyone is different so make sure to remember you thinking something isnt feasible doesnt make it true the number of times ive had people tell me they didnt think i could do something that i was already doing is immeasurable 

at this point i think our conversation has run its course and i dont want to waste anymore of your time as i think this is getting redundant on both our parts good luck and have a lovely rest of the day
well 1 hes allowed to make a mistake he didnt realize he was making a commitment of your time and apologized for that at the end of the day he is human and you need to learn to let it go 2 its not really your place to decide what is and isnt a feasible option to him plenty of people absolutely work those hours and more with no issue 3 if he needs to be making phone calls sunday also realistically wouldnt work either but theres going to be a significant amount of admin work that doesnt rely on phone calls unless they run a call center the jobs theyre laying off arent 100 spent on the phone he can take over some of those responsibilities 4 im noticing a pretty heavy trend of i think and i believe remember you are one half of your marriage and just because you dont agree with something doesnt mean you unilaterally get to make that call 

i never said you took an extreme view i meant the commenters on here take extreme views and just remember that sometimes the echo chamber that is the comments section can be misleading to how things will play out in your actual relationship 

it sounds like youre open to compromise so hopefully you go into it remembering that your husband gets to decide what is and isnt feasible for him and you get to decide what is and isnt feasible for you and also remember people mess up in relationships i get being upset but he genuinely apologized and made it clear this was unintentional and wants to take steps to find a solution that works for both of you dont harp on the im upset you did the thing in the first place and instead focus on how are we going to find a solution that works better for both of us solution oriented problem solving which im sure an attorney will be beautifully prepared for so good luck 
yeah i feel like it matters way less what everyone else thinks is normal and way more about what does she think is normal having her ex in her and her familys life and what are you comfortable with clearly youre not comfortable with having the ex in your or your gfs life 

you are both entitled to your feelings and someone else on reddit agreeing or disagreeing politely means jack shit this isnt our life its yours and your gfs life you guys get to choose how you each want to live your lives if the way you both pick isnt compatible then you two arent compatible and should end things it seems like you arent comfortable with a girlfriend who has a relationship with an ex thats normal and valid however her relationship isnt so abnormal that it would be fair to expect her to cut him out of her life at this point the choices are accept things or leave but you also cant force yourself to accept things
like i said there are still other compromises ie if he still wants to help hell need to wake up 12 hours earlier and do the work then that way itll have little effect on your scheduleneeding a nanny 

as far as your opinion on the business thats fair to consider a long term solution with his parents and have them discuss when enough is enough as a condition of you giving him a bit of time on the weekends but family isnt simply boiled down to numbers even though to you it makes sense to let them just lose everything now because in your mind its an inevitability that isnt how your husband feels its unwise to not at least make the attempt to compromise ie if he wants to do it wake up an hour earlier and then he can do an hour or two at some point on saturdaysunday then its him who is bearing the majority of the burden while youre also being his life partner and supporting himallowing him the ability to do what he feels obligated to do he may be amenable to letting you talk him out of helping now but thats because he still thinks things will work out and hes in new dad mode if his parents are in financial ruin and facing homelessness that could breed a lot of resentment and guilt and at that point youll no longer have any options for recourse other than hope he gets over it 

like i said people on here will take very extreme views on how you should operate in a marriage and i mean if thats how you wanna be it is your life but its not usually the most conducive to a long term and healthy relationship good luck i know this is a difficult situation to navigate especially while pregnant
well heres the reality as much as players mental health needs to be taken into consideration if he isnt able to perform and theres an alternative that can perform he likely doesnt get to make that choice sen upper management clearly wants results as evidenced by syyko being cut mid split and they arent making decisions to spare the teams feelings this isnt a field where you keep your job just because youre well liked if youre not performing well its really unfortunate but more than just tenzs desire to compete is at play here

hopefully the decision is mutual because the alternative really sucks for tenz and id love to see him thriving again but is naive to act like him coming back or sitting out is strictly up to him
yeah op needs to understand this is who her boyfriend is and i mean i guess he is allowed to be that way he probably doesnt have bad intentions but he is intentionally trying to keep ops hopes low so they dont get crushed and thats not the sort of dynamic for most people 

dating is an audition process and its okay to say he isnt fulfilling to roles requirements well enough
you should really just say how do you feel about marriage and go from there ask her when she wants to get married if shes ready to think about that with you if she is then say i want the actual ask to be a surprise but i want you to love the ring will you go to a few jewelers with me so we can figure out what you like in a budget that will work
out of curiosity if hes really that serious about it why doesnt he bring the admin work with him to his job and work on admin stuff while he eats his lunch thats 5 hours of work right there and then he can wake up early and do 2 hours before you and baby wake up sat and sun that means hes still able to help his family and youre able to spend time together 

no offense but hes allowed to have 8 hours of time to himself maybe not all in one chunk but he can spread it out he may need to give up a hobby of his it isnt fair of you to say he cant help out his parents and while he seems much better than i i would be really really put off if my partner tried telling me i couldnt spend a few hours a week helping out my parents to ensure they didnt lose everything i love my partner but i wouldnt just leave my parents out to dry like that either there are definitely better compromises out there that you guys need to discuss

people on here will downvote but just be aware they tend to be very extreme in their advice and rarely go for the more realistic and moderate routes that are required if you actually want a marriage to last
look if she learns that trying stuff and ending up in the hospital means you visit her shell keep doing it if you dont want her to do it again you dont visit her you dont call you dont respond you dont engage at all you leave it to her family and her medical professionals to get her the treatment she needs otherwise shell just learn that if she hurts herself enough youll come back
i mean unfortunately plenty of women like op who dont think thats a reason to leave so they unfortunately arent even wrong
yep 130 is also not even considered a genius its considered gifted and apparently in this case its gifted in being a jerk
not to mention a 130 iq isnt high enough for mensa acceptance on either testing scale and genius doesnt start until like 150 so not only are they silly for thinking iq is a good measure of intelligence they are also incapable of accurately even googling the requirements for what they claim to be which inevitably makes me doubt their claims
the ones acting like hes a predatory asshole no hes just a regular entitled asshole
sure thats in 40 years people are not talking about in the past 40 years theyre referring to recently the major demographic of reddit and most likely this sub is significantly younger than routinely flew 40 years ago to the extent of would know what the size of seats are like that source is nice but largely irrelevant to the actual argument of in recent years airlines are reducing passenger seat sizes
the comment that i was replying to was saying it was just about wanting to touch a woman though so thats the only point i was refuting theres absolutely no indication thats what this was about and more just wanting the person who gave him more space sitting next to him
sure but i really dont think this is some creepy he wanted to know the touch of a woman situation
this sub isnt about am i in the clear legally literally right in the rules its about the morals of a situation op is giving her sister a huge financial advantage at any age let alone a 19 year old single mom of twin infants the sister needs to know her place and follow the simple rule op has or shell lose the privilege of a free townhouse with enough room for her and her kids something shell quickly find will be virtually impossible for her to maintain otherwise you make choices in life its called being an adult if op really needs to she can just evict the sister so the aspect of technically maybe a tenant wouldnt really matter all that long
found the person who doesnt understand sarcasm without the s
idk man three years in and hes still this bad you may love him but he clearly doesnt reciprocate in the same ways you do you but weaponized incompetence would make my uterus shrivel up to dust
it might also just be a natural consequence of when you have less space you fill less space much like a liquid only fills the container its in its not so much reigning it in as much as you cant really be in a seat occupied by someone else
eh you would need to be clinically obese to not physically fit in economy seats believe it or not airplanes cost hundreds of millions of dollars they arent really making seats smaller possibly certain airlines on replacement aircrafts might be because most airplanes in commercial use are over a decade old americans are just getting bigger
dont make baseless accusations he wanted to be seated next to the smaller human being who wasnt saying anything about being in her bubble rather than the equally giant man who physically prevented him from spreading out it isnt about gender its about size
for 35 its definitely not real leather its polyester check the label to be sure that being said it looks awesome so as long as you think the material and quality of construction is worth the price the fit is awesome
ah then yeah thats always a possibility however they arent really violating the custody agreement op is just relying way too much on her ex husband and her ex husband is allowing it literally everyone here sucks the ap for being an ap the ex for cheating and for disrespecting his new gf to the surprise of no one and op for using her ex for emotional support and allowing her ex to do the same thing to the new woman as he did to her namely have one foot out the door
i dont really think ops exes current girlfriend can take ops ex to court to force him to respect his and ops custody arrangement op can take him to court the ex can take op to court but the ap cant do anything legally to make her boyfriend do anything with kids that arent hers
yeah but at some point you also need to remember youre 33 and mom of the mother of two kids and shes fueling with a 22 year old three years later she needs to learn to let it go move on and form her own support network that doesnt include her cheating ex husband
you also need couples counseling because this soon in youre in the honeymoon period and hes still in fixer mode that comes with seeing the woman hes madly in love with cry and be scared when that wears off and it will wear off the disgust and anger will return and those feelings of what you did will resurface talk it out now otherwise i can promise you in the next 5 years this ends your relationship people always act like they can forgive such huge breaches of trust and boundaries at first because theyre scared and then once it fades its never pretty dude sounds like he has a really good head on his shoulders and frankly you dont deserve him with how you behaved and even if you do manage to change theres still a chance that the damage will have been done take steps to minimize that risk good luck deal with your insecurities and need for your friends approval and oh yeah get better friends
ok yes cute no but wear whatever feels best
it could and it would be foolish to think you could actually treat them the same good on you for recognizing that not every person can be a parent to any kid
when you said doctors dont hand out prescriptions for epi pens like stickers and i mean they obviously dont literally but definitely plenty out there will give an epi just in case of escalation but that generalized statement was obviously based on the personal experience you shared in the next comment
its almost like your personal experience doesnt actually dictate how every other medical professional handles things
ofc yta your girlfriend wants her parents to know you arent using herthem and you basically refused to even give the illusion you arent using them and now your girlfriend is going to think you are using them so congrats on fucking that one up so badly 

she said i want you to offer because i know he wont accept and if he does accept ill make up for it and you laughed in her face as you refused dont expect this relationship to last much longer
well if youre making way more than she does that her income becomes chump change which is obviously the situation she wants to be in but lets be real even the most beautiful of women cant guarantee theyd find a man wealthy enough to sign up for that deal
that definitely isnt actually reasonable advice if shes trying to work through the issue at that point you might as well just break up and find a man who has already had a vasectomy or is fine with getting one

believe it or not real adults who are almost 40 and engaged dont react well to well if youre not going to do as i say then no more sex
nta she was clearly trying to act like some queen bee in front of her other friends and all you did was prove her point shes a sad little mean girl the only thing she wasnt expecting is not everyone wants to be friends with the sad little mean girl just because theyre pretty good for you
or he didnt check it for nuts because he wasnt the one who ate it it was on the passenger side and his mom brought the snacks i personally dont police what someone else is eating while im behind the wheel of a car do you
it sounds like his mom gave him a bunch of snacks and then his mother opened one and put the trash on the floor and the husband hadnt looked at the snacks either that or that was the only almond one and mil specifically had that for herself as she didnt think it would effect op husband cannot know something he hasnt seen or didnt eat has nuts in it
nta obviously but she isnt going to pay it you need to decide if youre willing to go the legal route over this or if youll simply go nc over it until she agrees to pay 

but i will promise you right now if you dont do either of those things and just accept her refusal to pay she will get way worse because now youve embarrassed her and let her get away with it
well do you feel you want to proceed in a marriage knowing this is how hell handle conflict of his own making ultimately thats the real question like i said if this isnt handled to your liking i wouldnt get married unless you also are okay with getting divorced because this is the best your conflict resolution skills will ever be a few years into marriage too many people forget to put their partners feelings into perspective
ask him why he lied to you and go from there dont accuse him just say i found out youre still going on labor day weekend im really hurt you lied to me can you help me understand why you felt you needed to lie rather than just talk to me about things

if you two cant talk this through i personally would probably rethink getting married unless youre prepared to get divorced because no healthy marriage lasts without healthy communication in a way this is a great test for if this is even a wedding worth having
bruh you think a bunch of her friends in college should just go borrow money to go and have fun thats the most irresponsible shit ive seen here today
im glad you two seem to have a lovely marriage its important to make sure the emotional intimacy doesnt get replaced with fancy shoes or bags i wish you two many more happy years together even though youve said things have largely blown over you should have a discussion on boundaries dont delete messages if you want to offer something to someone who feel deserves it let me know we are a team and i want to share that with you dont offer people gifts over 500 without discussing it with me whatever it may be that you feel comfortable with but i wouldnt just dismiss this as its blown over now so its all good because like i said this is often how it starts better to catch things and communicate early than be another heartbreak story and good luck in all your future opportunities
sure thats the reason the law was written but the law states you dont need to pay for merchandise sent to you doesnt translate to it only applies if the company is trying to bill you for it im not even really arguing the legality of it but i am saying that laws are often used in contexts other than the express context it was written for in fact thats pretty much what being a lawyer in certain fields is all about finding a way to argue why a law applies to you and expanding the interpretation of the penned words

eta damn some of yall do not understand that laws are in fact open to interpretation and that is why lawyers judges and other leo are required otherwise a computer could just take everything over also didnt make a claim about how this would play out one way or the other just that this law specifically states you dont need to pay for merchandise sent to you that you didnt order im not going to reply to anyone who thinks basic reading skills are mental gymnastics
well doesnt seem speculative seems accurate you said youve been together since high school grew up poor you are used to retail jobs so i presume the businesses you own are driven by him and you supporthelp him but arent the driving force and you said he has insecurities about his appearance but at least now is a good looking wealthy dude 

this is generally speaking how fairy tale romance ends with him trading me in for a woman half my age stories begin its easy to get sucked into something new and fresh and that feeling of being flattered by being wanted by someone seemingly unattainable now im not saying hes got bad intentions yet but you probably need to be aware that this is a concern like i said you guys should focus on reconnecting and making sure that your emotional bond is strong the gifts are nice and all but outside of material goods make sure you two are in a good place and keeping the flame alive talk to someone about what are healthy boundaries and how you can praise those around you and be generous without crossing a line being with the same person for 30 years is hard and requires a lot of active work to keep that love alive he seems to love you so im sure youll work it out but i definitely wouldnt ignore this
out of curiosity is he extremely wealthy because this definitely sounds like looking for an upgrade territory you two probably could benefit from a trip to a couples therapist to discuss appropriate boundaries and how you two are feeling about each other in general and given the vibe im getting from the post a romantic trip to reconnect
well technically someone with your correct address on it and not a human beings name on it would qualify unless you think loft on hold is ops next door neighbors name
you got the ick once you catch it you only cure it by breaking up and moving on
it doesnt typically and it shouldnt if youre unwilling to share the actual life youve built with a person during marriage dont marry them its fair to want to protect the assets given to you by family and assets you gained before the marriage but if you are even worried about sharing the assets youll gain during the marriage take that as a glaring sign that this isnt the woman for you a marriage is merging lives with someone that includes finances
well shes 22 and just had a baby so shes hormonal and emotionally immature theyre not exactly a great combo and id take a guess and say it wasnt planned so shes also probably extremely confused on what the fuck she wants to do with her life now if you can reach out to the aunt make sure she has someone in her corner looking out for her she either is struggling with ppd or shes just another young and unprepared mom trying to figure things out and handling it poorly but either way you probably cant fix her so just make sure she has someone around her that is looking out for her
honestly fashionova has great jeans for curvy women
yikes so in your world a father cant just be a good dad and a daughters preferred parent
a judge wants both parents in a kids life but im sure there is a solution in here where they are both in her life just not in a weekly capacity its pretty standard in these situations to spend the school year with the primary custodian and then breaks and summer with the other parent the mom can fly up to see the daughter and the daughter can fly once a month all that combined and thats a significant amount of time between both parents while still respecting what the daughter wants and without expecting her to fly by herself every single weekend
controversial but nta your daughter wanted to go with you shes 14 her opinion is going to heavily be taken into consideration even in a court but it should be 1month for a long weekend she can afford to miss a day of school and then she should spend breaks with her mom she still needs to see her mother and get quality time with her but youre right traveling by plane every week is ridiculous perhaps tell your ex shes welcome to fly up as well to spend time with daughter
youre making excuses for him and keep focusing on the ex the issue isnt the ex the issue is him and how he reacted to your hurt and not for anything but youve seen how he treated his ex who was his supposed love of his life so why do you think you will end up any differently

you wont thats the answer so stop distracting yourself by focusing on the ex and start reflecting on how he is treating you
the issue here isnt actually that he called her the love of his life the issue is 1 why is he telling his girlfriend of a year a story of his ex of over a half decade and 2 he responded to your hurt not with compassion and care but with an insult 

thats the issue youre not insecure any selfrespecting person will question why someone years later is speaking in present tense about their feelings for an ex its just plain idiotic to not see how that isnt a giant red flag so short of your boyfriend being an idiot hes doing so because he either does have feelings for her eh probably not if what youre saying is true even though i do doubt the veracity of that 5 years nc and as soon as he meets you shes begging for him back eh not that convinced or he is unable to take accountability for his missteps and refuses to apologize for hurting you his supposed love of his life thats the issue here thats what you need to be thinking about your boyfriend called you insecure and ridiculous for having a valid concern that anyone with a brain would have frankly you would be insecure if you didnt question him because it would show youd put up with such obvious bullshit
nta the reality is you saved m from staying another 5 years and not having a real engagement ring you either got t to take his head out of his ass long enough to realize he cant keep putting off this commitment and expecting m to stay or you havent gotten through to t and now m is realizing that this isnt what she wants after this long with a man either way youre nta and thank you for saying what m was very clearly thinking but was trying to convince herself she was crazy for if she breaks up with t its because of t not you and if anything you saved m from a lifetime of unhappiness with t maybe next time t wont assume he has unlimited time to string along women he loves or he actually proposes either way win win for everyone involved
idk man i have to think you enabling him is part of why hes never changed
idk what rich people you know but every one i know has a substantial life insurance policy
the more money a person has the better and greater the insurance they tend to have i dont know why youd think someone with money wouldnt have massive life insurance and other policies its poor people with families who actually need the money that often have to forgo the backup plan
 go reread the fourth paragraph of the post its literally right there in quotes and all
id probably get your head out of your ass and realize material things dont make someone a good grandparent and who you allow in your childrens life will have a huge impact on who they grow up to be you know your parents arent good people and arent good influences for your children why would you compromise your values and your kids upbringing just so they can have someone well off in their lives
i am not it literally says in the post the friend has said op will change her mind on not wanting marriage or kids and will often use the exact words when youre a mom when talking to op about her own pregnancy that is not the kind of shit you do to your friend who 1 doesnt want kids 2 has always supported you and 3 is going through a fresh breakup because of 1 reread the post if that isnt at all clear to you but it is directly in the main post im not making anything up or putting my own spin on anything

nta just tell the moh and anyone else who comes for you i have a medical condition sister can decide if me being a bridesmaid in an altered dress or me not being a bridesmaid at all will be the best option for her that is available but i have a medical condition unfortunately what she wants in a perfect world is no longer possible in this world where i have a medical condition if sister has decided shed rather her own family stand beside her than have a perfect photo im still happy to get the dress altered so i can wear it but those are sisters only two options plans change what was an option a few months ago no longer is and thats just a part of life
generally when speaking your best friend who has done so much for you talking about her heartbreak and losing someone she cared about because she doesnt want kids is not the time to start bullshit like when youre a mom op doesnt want kids she doesnt need yet another person in her life who refuses to respect the fact that a womans worth isnt solely dependent on their decision to carry a life in them

her best friend isnt respecting her or her decisions about her life and her body yeah thats definitely not harsh and frankly id have been way harsher
eh you can definitely see cellulite but everyone has it no matter how thin or fat i am i have it its just genetic and even super models have it theyre just better at hiding it like you said nothing wrong with it though since 99 of people have it and all those use this one trick to destroy cellulite for good stuff you see is just a gimmick
yes it does
so you probably dont want to come to terms with this but your wife isnt over her ex because she doesnt feel the same way about you as she did him shes with you because you didnt leave her not because shes head over heels in love with you if she were head over heels in love with you the same way she was her ex shed have forgotten about him thats often how we really move on from those heartbreaking losses we find the next person that makes us feel the sameeven better sometimes we have relationships in between that we still mourn the ex and we say oh we arent over him were not ready to date anyone else etc etc and yeah in part that is true but also its true that generally you meet that person when you are ready that youre just crazy about and suddenly those dreams stop the tears you barely even remember why you were crying you remember how much better off you are and how wrong that relationship was 

but instead of moving on from you like would usually naturally do at 18 and finding that person she clearly struggles with rejection being alone and wanting to feel wanted so she stayed with you and you were head over heels in love with her so of course youd never be the one to leave shes been shoving these feelings down for an eternity because she feels guilt over these feelings but thats what it comes down to she just doesnt feel the way about you as she does about her ex and if you told her this shell cry and shell beg you to stay because shes never actually progressed beyond that 18 year old girl who cant deal with rejection or being alone so shell cling to whoever is around and willing to give her that love even if it isnt actually the love she wants
pick anything you want then you seem to think im specifically talking about antisemitism and fail to understand what an analogy is so pick cheaters cheaters dont actively threaten your safety at all but plenty of people will choose not to invite someone to their wedding because they cheated on their spouse and morally object to that behavior that also is their sex life and shouldnt be any of your business that also doesnt have any actual affect on you but youd still agree someone is fully in their right to decide they are morally opposed to cheaters and dont want them around them right

because newsflash they definitely have that right and newsflash same thing applies here
why is the argument his sex life has nothing to do with you a reason hes not allowed to disagree would you say the same if this was a person who cheated on their spouse of 10 years while pregnant and op was saying i dont agree with your morals so im not inviting you because i dont support cheaters because its the same exact thing that pertains to their sex life and doesnt actually affect op but i can guarantee you everyone on here would say op is nta for not inviting the brother then the reality is people are allowed to choose not to be around people who have different morals than them even if you dont agree with those morals and yes people are allowed and i would fully argue should choose to uphold their values even if they dont directly affect them like why do you actually want that to be the standard because thats like saying as a white person youre an asshole for uninviting someone racists against whomever because well youre white so it doesnt even affect you but the fuck of course you should stand up for your values of not being racist and in fact if it were race being the issue here everyone would be saying you need to stand up for your morals even if it doesnt affect you otherwise youre being hypocritical 

you can have different morals and views to op about sexual freedom and still recognize that op is allowed to have that view and not want to be around someone who acts like his brother just because they happen to share blood
i mean its completely fair and valid not to invite someone you dont agree with their morals and life choices to your wedding lets not act like just because you dont agree with someones decision doesnt mean it isnt their right to make that decision thats like not inviting someone because they are antisemitic and you dont approve of nazis even though you yourself arent jewish it has no bearing on you and no impact on your life personally but youre still allowed to say this isnt behavior or choices i am okay or comfortable being around its really easy to agree that the people getting married have that right when its something you can clearly agree is wrong isnt it but thats the thing everyone has the right to make that choice and yes even people with views you dont agree with 

that being said its definitely important to recognize that he wont have a relationship with his brother and much like op can post about this on the internet so can his brother especially when he sent a freaking letter and op needs to accept that however for anyone saying hell lose his brother with this behavior honestly do you actually think he cares it sounds like hes pretty emphatically throwing the brother out so i dont think that statement is likely to affect op at all
hes either asexualon the asexual spectrum or hes not attracted to you either way no i dont think he comes around if sexual compatibility is a dealbreaker for you you should end the relationship sooner rather than later because lying to yourself is only going to hurt you in the long run
well fuck that guy then hes guy a boring old misogynistic hypocrite
where is that i didnt see that anywhere in the postcomments if i missed it and this isnt a standard hes also holding himself to then fuck that guy regardless end result is the same he isnt the person for op
yeah there is pretty much no part of a heathy happy and functional relationship here theres no intimacy no respect no trust and sounds like your feelings for him are very quickly waning you cant really tell me this is what you imagined in your husband is it if not respect and love yourself in a way he is never going to and find that relationship
i mean you cant really trust a man who isnt worth trusting unless youre going to brow beat yourself into accepting being treated like trash is that really what you want to do to yourself because he isnt worthy of being trusted thats why you dont trust him
i think you need some harsh truths 

yes you need to give her space if you refuse to give her the space shes asking for her feelings are going to very quickly succumb to the resentment that will quickly build but in giving her that space most likely shes going to feel relief shes going to feel the weight that is being in a relationship with a man like you lifted and then your relationship will truly be over 

its hard but i think you need to learn this being grumpy isnt some cute personality quirk its fucking annoying and not something anyone selfrespecting wants in a life partner no one wants to be with a man who acts like they dont even like their partner and ive been there it sucks and yeah most likely her feelings for you are pretty done and dusted women try and try and try and once they get to the point where theyre telling you theyre falling out of love and need space 99 of the time they are out of love with you already but just cant admit it to you or themselves yet you may need to genuinely feel this loss to understand that you dont get to just suck for three years and then finally decide to see a problem with how youre acting you shouldnt be putting loved ones through your tantrums youre 27 its time you grow up and learn to be a kind respectful patient person and yes that likely will mean doing it single for a long while and getting a therapist to work through things with you to make sure you dont prematurely jump back into dating and someone who can hold you accountable to yourself
depends how exactly did this come up its been three years together did you ask some hypothetical or did he out of the blue just tell you hes never going to let you see his phone because if this came up naturally in conversation it probably means nothing and id just respect his feelings if this came up unprompted out of nowhere id be getting highly suspicious
it sounds like hes a virgin hes allowed to want to share that experience with his partner however if its a dealbreaker for him and hes said it is then you need to walk away you arent what he wants and its totally wrong of him to shame you for not being his perfect made to order bride hes a coward for not telling you this himself but you need to move on the right person will come along who wont care about your extremely limited past but the reality is this person does care and thats okay but it isnt okay to stay with someone who doesnt accept you as you are
i mean there are plenty of 25 year old virgins in religious circles and even more still who just havent found that person or are waiting for personal reasons i dont think its really fair to say he wont find a virgin if thats something important to him it sounds like he himself is a virgin as well however he needs to recognize if he wants a virgin and thats an actual dealbreaker that he needs to share that one and only experience with his partner he needs to stop dating someone who he clearly cant have that with its completely wrong to shame someone for not being who you want over something they cant control 

its like saying dating someone who is under 6 tall is a dealbreaker and then continuing to go out with someone who is 56 they arent going to grow and if thats what you want in a partner okay thats fine but then dont waste someones time who is clearly also looking for a serious partner
you and your husband should go to counseling and you personally need some help to accept that your ils will never accept you and will never like you i get its hard but you need to make peace with this fact so you can move forward your husband will also need to come to terms with how that will affect his family dynamic so he can make sure hes okay with that it very much sounds like he is but you need to stop they arent going to like you it is what it is it hurts absolutely but you need to get the idea of if only i did xyz they might finally like me they wont unless youre able to suddenly turn into a good korean housewife theyll never like you thats okay your husband married you not them but you arent doing yourself or your marriage any favors by trying to get people who simply never will like you to like you drop the rope live your life be happy stand up for yourself stop accepting hatred in your life
idk the party was a lie so sounds like the alcohol was merely a coverin order to soothe the nerves she had about cheating
you remind your brother her behavior isnt normal it isnt healthy and while you support him and will always be there for him you arent going to enable toxic behavior from her and just remind him that youre there for him if he realizes this isnt what he wants in a relationship anymore
just remember it may be his choice to put up with controlling borderline abusive behavior in silence but that doesnt mean he gets to choose for you how youll react its pretty clear he knows this is ridiculous and probably is putting up with it either because of the idea women can do no wrongcant controlabuse a man or because he thinks he cant do better than this woman either way its not your job to keep the peace in someone elses toxic relationship
dont feel badly that it affecting your finances was the final straw be so proud of yourself for even having that straw because you know deep down you shouldve had a final straw long ago and just be proud youve finally found it and then stick to it because youre right hes abusive and plain and simply not worth it
it can both be true that he needs help and you cant provide him the help he needs you need to put yourself first because he clearly always has and always will put himself first you cannot thrive in this marriage this marriage is literally killing you slowly pick you you deserve it
perfect then i think you should send this or a similarly worded message to gracefully bow out while also directly saying i understand you felt obligated to ask me and i am not comfortable with that so i will be the fall guy rather than going to route of making up a conflict its to the point but it doesnt make her feel like the bad guy as youre saying you dont feel comfortable being in such an intimate place with someone who clearly that intimacy isnt there yet and thats okay
a year isnt long at all so i wouldnt use shes never shown any behavior like this before as justification or an excuse its super easy not to show your true colors for a year youre an older established guy who owns a 3 story house dating a younger woman im not calling you out on anything but you really cant expect much more from her and you would be very foolish to continue dating someone who has shown you the ugly truth of herself the minute things didnt go her way 

and let me guess you wouldnt have her pay much if any rent right youre being taken for a ride
tbf if he wasnt a deadbeat dad this would be completely normal dynamic for a kid and his father youre really telling me you never did anything with your parents and a friend or even with any of your friends growing up because i definitely did the issue is still the fact that the father never sees his son making it so the few times he does step up precious father son time but it shouldnt be it should just be another weekend together but this time his son wants to bring a friend
yeah when your self esteem is this low youre going to sabotage any genuine attempts to lose weight as well because you feel you dont deserve to look and feel good either so you really need to deal with the self esteem before you can even lose the weight and keep it off
explain to me why youd want a cheater and a hypocritical deadbeat dad as friends anyway you are the company you keep op and neither of these people are winners tell adam and if that ruins the friendships with everyone then good riddance
the brother dropped out of high school and refused to get a job presumably its because he thought now that he was 18 he could do what he wanted and what he wanted to do was nothing while i dont agree with his parents giving him 3 days bare minimum of 30 days like you would a tenant seems like the bare minimum here i do think its fair for his parents to have the attitude of if you think because youre 18 you can make the adult decision to drop out of high school and not listen to anything we have to say then you can also live like an adult and be on your own while uncommon it does happen and it happened to my sibling before where they expected to just stay at home all day doing nothing because theyre an adult and also having mommy and daddy do everything for them still not every parent will enable that behavior even a little
talk to your husband first and make sure he has your back once you know that he is on your side just send a text message sil while im honored that you wouldve thought to include me in your special day i dont feel comfortable being included in such an intimate part of your day simply because im your brothers wife i would love to be there as your guest but i need to step down as bridesmaid if theres anything i can do from afar please let me know as i want this day to be very special for you

if stepping down is going to start ww3 with your husband and his family its probably better to just tell her youre busycant make it to any smaller events and just suck it up for the wedding day this isnt really that unusual of a situation and as uncomfy as it is if this isnt your hill to die on and your husbandhis family wont be supportive its probably not worth it to make this your hill to die on
not to doubt your relationship seeing as youre already pregnant but next time you should both wait a decent period of time before introducing your partners to your kid you need to make sure you guys know and are comfortable with who your new partners are and after 7 and 8 months it really doesnt seem like enough time has passed for either of them to be taking on any sort of parental role or going on trips or things like that moving on takes time rushing it can lead to some really crappy outcomes its harder when you have a kid but her well being and safety needs to come before either of your desires to have a new happy family
let yourself be sad cry if you need to do something to get your mind off her even if that means having less work time itll be better to have 18 hours of good work time than 40 hours of horrible work time so make sure to take care of yourself one night too you cant just shove the feelings down and expect to move on overnight you will make it through the course i know it feels like the end of the world if you dont do great on one assignment but i can tell you i have had my fair share of crappy weeks and i survived multiple top technical programs in the world it wont affect anything in your life in the grand scheme of things even if you need to take a few days to take care of yourself before sitting down to work on your final projects do your best you will make it through
the only unreasonable bit is you trying to force yourself to be okay in a marriage where your partner doesnt pull his own weight and cant be arsed to spend time with you you deserve and can get way better
his poor wife holy shit  


look heres the reality hes built up an idea of who you will be as his partner in his head and that idea is likely very different from who you actually are this man is successful and going to divorce his wife for you only to discover the real you isnt actually as good as he imagined in his head im sure youre lovely but youre real and human you two both clearly know from experience that marriages and real life are hard and even though you go into things loving a person that doesnt mean itll work out and now that he has all these unrealistic ideas of what being with you is like and he realizes thats not the case itll end ugly
your boyfriend is blaming ocd on what is him being an abusive asshole you cant turn it off on command if you could ocd wouldnt be a disorder perhaps he genuinely has ocd but the actual behaviors caused by his ocd would still remain everything that he turned off in the past week is who he is it isnt a disorder thats an excuse flat out and plainly it was bullshit meant to get you to accept poor treatment from him 

he lied to you he is abusive he doesnt trust you he is both unwilling and unable to change i understand its scary to be without someone youve spent so long with and have shared so much with but 3 years is nothing in the grand scheme of forever you will meet someone you will be with much longer than him and instead of having a pervasive theme of lies abuse and fear youll feel happiness and youll wonder why the hell you stayed with such a crappy partner for so long and why you put up with such obvious bullshit for so long when you couldve had this a happy and loving relationship all this time 

this is the end of a chapter its okay to grieve but put down the horror story and pick up a romance novel with someone else or hell even just yourself
you misread the story the last time the kids looked at the box was 6 years ago the half brother has asked to look at the box but this isnt a situation where the kids are constantly stealing this box he just carries it everywhere and a 5 year old is naturally curious the insider information i have is being even somewhat familiar with how a 15 year old boy acts towards siblings they arent exactly nice siblings are viscous to each other at times then add in lost mom and blended family it doesnt take a rocket scientist to see this is a normal teenage boy acting out but that doesnt mean that its not op and his fathers job to teach him that you need to learn patience and cruelly lashing out isnt okay
you need to stop being so forgiving youre being a pushover your wife is turning into the equivalent of a redpilled tater tot as the internet likes to call them for the sake of your children and society at large you need to start pushing back on this way harder than you are youre operating as though what she is doing isnt tantamount to racism or homophobia i take it you wouldnt tolerate that attitude so why are you tolerating an attitude that is propagating hatred against men when youre raising two little boys

stop giving her a pass on her hatred prejudice and bigotry just because shes a woman that in and of itself is sexist hold her to the same standard you would hold a man who told his wife that she needs to take care of all chores childrearing be a sex slave who never says no to any sex act and never speaks unless spoken to hold her to the same standard you would if a man dared to in public try to humiliate and shame his wife who is doing everything like she did to you 

i get that you think youre being prowomen but you dont be prowomen by being antiman this isnt behavior you should be tolerating because youre afraid to be coming off as controllingsexistwhatever it is that youre clearly afraid of seeming because this behavior is truly abhorrent and i cant imagine a man as progressive as you are genuinely believing this attitude should be okay for anyone of any gender
sit him down and tell him youve been going too far with the criticism lately im not okay with it from now on you either need to learn to keep your opinions of how you want things done to yourself or you need to be prepared to do it your way by yourself the next time something like what happened last night at dinner happens again i am stopping what im doing regardless of where i am in the process and you will be fully taking over i will not be putting things away i will not be cleaning up anything i need you to understand loud and clear just how serious i am about this not continuing if theres something that bothers you so deeply that you want to just take over from now on now is the chance to tell me are we on the same page

if he gets at all angry walk away and say this is what i mean im leaving the conversation until you can continue this like an adult in a healthy relationship if you cant figure out how to have a conversation without belittling me then this relationship isnt going to work out find me once youve decided and leave go read a book go for a walk take a bath whatever it is that you want but show him that you mean business because right now he plain and simply doesnt respect you you need to demand respect and make it clear that if he doesnt start respecting you you are prepared to walk away
out of curiosity if your husband is the one who is all dont disagree with anyone unhealthy bottle stuff in crap have you ever tried telling him not to speak to you that way i mean thats his preferred method of communication after all unless theres some hidden hierarchy youre not addressing where as the man of the household youre meant to follow him vibes going on
of course women are allowed to speak its not about her gender at all try not to make things that arent about gender about gender its about the person who did bring it up did so with no intention to actually change the relationship at all she basically dangled a relationship carrot in front of op who was eagerly awaiting the moment they would become official which idk why he didnt bring it up himself since he clearly wanted it only for her to say aaaactually im still fucking and plan to continue to fuck other dudes 

you really gunna tell me that isnt humiliating unless shes denser than a bag of rocks she knows damn well what soooooo what are we on a romantic dinner out implies it is meant to progress the relationship forward not to literally say hey i just want to make sure youre clear that this isnt going anywhere and i also wont stop seeing other people she raised up ops hopes waited to make sure that he was happy about the offer of something more only to assure him that wasnt at all what she wanted or planned to do thats about as humiliating as it gets in terms of rejection in a situationship
wait until it actually is truth before youre patting yourself on the back there bud one bad map does not months of mediocre tape make sure if he is consistently on the bottom of the leaderboard you may have a point but you also have no way of knowing yet if he wont drop 30 every map next week
its an unhealthy behavior to develop of staying in a relationship only because you or he loves the other love isnt enough and you should always base your decision on whether to continue a relationship based on how your partner is treating you in the moment not in the past and not how you want him to treat you in the future  youll save yourself from a lot of toxic and crappy relationships if you remember those two rules
unfortunately if rachel thought finding a man with a family to provide for her kids was so important to her she should not have married your father she needs to either accept the incredibly sad and i entirely sympathize with her and her kids reality that they just dont have any family outside of their parentshalf siblings or she needs to divorce your father and go find a man who has family who will accept nonbio kids with open arms it sucks but this is the family she chose to marry into and youre under no obligation to cater to her wishes this is just like someone complaining about their crazy inlaws and trying to get them to changecut them out of their lives adults need to realize you dont just marry the man youre marrying the family if you arent happy enough with the total package as it is you dont proceed with the marriage just like you dont marry a man for their potential you marry them for who they are

and let this be a life lesson for you too youre marrying a man but also youre marrying into a family and you need to consider those dynamics when evaluating if this is a something you will be happy in forever
definitely remain nc the fact that she brought it up even knowing she didnt want exclusivity is pretty humiliating  that being said dont wait for the woman to bring it up next time when youre ready you should be bringing it up i can only assume its insecurityfear and thats also probably not an attractive trait 

if it were me even if i did want a serious relationship i would quickly lose interestrecalibrate my feelings if after 5 months this conversation wasnt brought up just an fyi
not in this day and age
im going to be honest its decently fucked up she would bring up the what are we talk while actually not wanting anything to change about your relationship and in fact not wanting exclusivity it almost feels as though she knew you thought you two were heading towards exclusivity and felt extremely guilty about seeing and sleeping with other people and was attempting to clear her conscience take this as a sign she isnt ready or worth another serious thought and cut your losses definitely remain nc because its very clear she doesnt want a relationship and the fact that she would so callously mess with your feelings by asking you what are we while fully knowing she didnt want you to be anything is just not worth any more time
yeah definitely dont invest your time money and effort into a woman whos shown you shes only looking for someone to provide for her and benefit her she wants a one sided relationship and that cant last forever once things get hard the relationship will fall apart and if you marry her while being an executive she may show you just how selfcentered she really is and take you for all youre worth its a really common story
i dont think its unfair i think both 5050 and proportional are valid payment schemes but you do need to decide what works best for youyour values and stick to it if she was always down for 5050 then id say thats just as fair even though shes getting more free money now but its pretty clear her values arent we are equal partners5050 or we should each be contributing equal parts relative to our skills proportional to income her values are quite simply i expect the man to take care of me which is also a fair enough desire but op needs to understand her partners values and decide if thats the role he wants to fill not every man does and thats okay
i honestly do think they both cheated emotional affairs are affairs and he said he accused her of one during their marriage and then theyre married within a year of the divorce that definitely screams emotional affair

he cheated as well so at that point its clear you two both moved on from one another but im not sure how anyone can see the facts and the timeline and not think that there were mutual feelings involved long before the divorce was signed otherwise you just dont get married within a year to your ex husbands best friend
if she cant afford to move out then you assess how insane you think shell be in the breakup if shell be mature you ride it out maybe one of you sleeps on the couch if you think shell handle it poorly you get a new apartment and you ride it out for the 6 months left on your lease or whatever it is and a few weeks before move in you tell her thats pretty much your only option she clearly did something before you two lived together so she can figure someone out after too 

moving forward dont move in with people youve known less time than some of the food in your fridge
some people think it makes themselves sound bad ass rather than weak she obviously isnt 100 sure if steve really did have feelings for daisy or not so i take it as the human equivalent of puffing yourself up in the face of danger so hopefully the predator will run away
people on reddit like to encourage others to do what will entertain strangers the most but this is your actual life you are living dont blow something up with someone you love because a bunch of strangers on the internet have nothing better to do than encourage more people to be miserable with them
thanks fam guess im the ass carry on 
did you mean to reply to this comment because it makes no sense and makes you sound like a pompous ass in context
he would be correct if you decide to stay love yourself more than that
heres what you reply to every single person if standing up against the disrespect of the relationship with the woman i plan to spend my life with is something small to you that you think i should get over then god bless your marriage because no relationship will ever last with that attitude i will protect my relationship and back up the woman i love before i will anyone else
you seem to be making excuses for her this is a thing people do to defend themselves no one wants to admit they werent enough for their partner no one wants to admit they had a bad judge of character when they committed to someone but look its okay to make mistakes good people fall for bad ones all the time but your fianc has shown you a lot of flaws 1 she wont communicate with you when shes feeling down and has unaddressed needs in the relationship 2 she wont turn down the attention of another guy in at least some circumstances 3 your fianc is of so low class to get with a married man 4 your fianc doesnt respect you enough to come clean before you gave up a lucrative career and your future for her she shouldve told you then so you could make an informed decision shes trying to trap you 5 your fianc didnt even tell you because she finally realize just how fucked up this is she only told you because someone else made her feel guilty about it 6 youre with a woman so good at lying to you she can carry on a whole other relationship for months and youll be none the wiser and lie to your face for years and youll be none the wiser 


now all this really taken into consideration are you going to tell me you can lay next to this woman every day for the rest of your life and feel peace if not its time to call off the wedding
have you ever met a 15 year old boy with any form of siblings they can be viscous its almost like redditors dont understand what teenagers are like form an objective perspective siblings say crap like this all the time without any trauma
i dont think they are asking him hes just saying it the daughters told op that he said it out of nowhere and according to op the one step sister who showed interest was told 6 years ago to knock it off it genuinely reads like the 15 year old is going through normal 15 year old growing pains combined with grieving his mom and being in a mixed family and just lashing out and those around him and saying something he knows will hurt but i dont actually see anywhere where anyone is even remotely provoking him unless youre going to count the five year old asking to take a look and at that point its time for both parents to step in and address the fact that he needs to have some patience for a five year old

this is somewhat normal for teenagers even without all the stressors in his life siblings can say some awful stuff to each other but thats when its time for the parents to step in as the adults and guide their growing humans in the right direction
girl why are you trying so hard to lie to yourself hes already doing a good enough job for you you cant both disrespect yourself this much
nothing he said is really wrong though you come into a good amount of money the smart move is pay off any interest accruing debt and invest in something else to grow your money
no one has tried to get their hands on it the step siblings havent tried touching it since op was married six years ago and his half brother alec is a 5 year old and asked to take a look believe it or not but a 15 year old does need to learn some patience for his 5 year old brother its bad parenting to act like his attitude is at all acceptable
depends is your long term goal to be in a place where you two can be friends or is your long term goal to both be in a place to fully move on with your lives without one another in it if this was taken as the end no i wouldnt if the goal was to get space to get over the relationship so you two could maintain a friendship indefinitely something as simple as no need to reply but i hope you have a nice birthday would probably be fine more likely than not though one or both of you wanted this to simply be the end
i dont think this is actually meant to convey the idea of what he would do in an emergency its meant to bluntly and hurtfully convey the idea that his stephalf siblings mean nothing to him and hes doing so by conveying that even a lifeless though important object means more to him than them and that sort of needless cruelty from a 15 year old repeatedly to a 5 9 and 11 year old is definitely the sort of thing you can and should step in to address
if you are afraid of there being a time limit its pointless to even give it one last try hes essentially telling you we need to figure this out because im at the end of my rope and i dont want to leave but i will have to if you cant get it together quickly call it now this probably is hurting him a lot guys are also capable of leaving someone they love that it isnt working with just because hes told you this doesnt mean hes manipulating you it means hes trying to get you to care that youll lose him 

unfortunately at this point unless theres a miracle involved you two are unlikely going to be able to just stop and fix things but it is possible if youre both willing to try and put in the work
also a reminder it isnt all or nothing he can say i cant pay for everything but i want to help you out i can pay 510kyear towards your tuition which i will pay directly to the school or whatever amount he decides depending on what tuition is like in his country if she freaks out he knows shes just looking for a free ride if shes grateful then maybe they can have at least some semblance of a relationship
youll get nowhere if you dont accept the fact that your husband isnt loyal doesnt prioritize you and would frankly rather be with someone else i get denial is strong but the only person who suffers from your stubbornness is you not him he gets two women fighting for him someone to put his bills keep his home still have plenty of sex and feel no guilt because at this point you are well aware of who he is and are choosing to stay thats essentially you saying im okay with this in his mind
youre definitely giving him way too much credit he needs to say the words assistant youre crossing professional boundaries right now you need to stop behaving like this its unprofessional and not okay the fact that hes never shut her down is a problem and it isnt remedied by you simply being sure he wont cheat on you he needs to be ready willing and able to actually tell this woman her behavior is entirely unprofessional and whatever her feelings for him are or are not she needs to learn what it means to be someones assistance in a place of work
it would be an incredible overreaction if this were the first time an issue with money has come up but it isnt theyve been clashing about their views on money ever since and perhaps even before they pooled their money this isnt just one example of spending money without discussing it its a pattern of disregarding ops wishes failing to communicate stonewalling and mismanaging money the problem is people are human we arent endless wells of patience that never run out after monthspotentially years of trying to get his gf on board with discussing finances and having a plan and her never taking his concerns seriously or even hearing him out hes used up all of his patience on maintaining the status quo that its all gone for anything beyond that and while it can definitely be fixed its hard and it takes both people realizing theyre both going about things the wrong way and seriously changes all around will be needed to fix the gap and resentment thats formed
all of those concern two babies born to the same generation though this isnt stealing a baby name this is simply using a name and if you really wanted to use the analogy the baby name in this case is hope and the sil would be the one stealing it by trying to make it so op cant use it
i think theyre acting as though its so distant because op said she and her brother have a strained relationship so it isnt like theyre meeting up for weekly family dinners where theyll realistically always be getting confused its more like having to worry about it during thanksgivingchristmas and even then thats probably not every year if they celebrate with ops family as well so it amounts to the same level of inconvenience as youd have if you shared a name with a distant cousin
the point is op would only be changing the name to appease sil but if ever her and her partner break updivorce shed have changed her daughters name for someone who was no longer her concern so her priority should be honoring her family rather than respecting sil
im not moving any goal post everyone else is and theyre moving it down the bare minimum for not in poverty is being able to afford a roof over your head and food on the table bare minimum for middle class is being able to provide enough of a roof over your head and good food and the occasional take out and maybe saving for a vacation bare minimum for upper middle class is being able to afford a nice car a nice home and having savings for retirementeducationrainy day bare minimum for rich is having an excess of wealth that can freely be spent on luxury goods and not having to worry about the costs of any education things like luxury cars privateexclusive vacations mansionmcmansions having the closet of designer clothes newest devices buying your kids houses etc are common place and not a concern for those who are rich and yes the dollar sign it takes to be rich has drastically increased but no the goal post for what being rich means hasnt
she said itll affect the relationship with her brother not the kid they already dont have a good relationship though so idk why she thinks theyd prioritize an already crappy relationship over that of the mother of the baby getting to honor her great grandmother 

realistically speaking regardless of the name she wasnt going to be very present in the babys life anyway as as it stands shes barely in her brothers life most people dont suddenly invest into the lives of a kid to a person they barely talk to she thinks that statement bears any weight but frankly it makes her argument worse not better as it just illustrates how little they lose by ignoring her wishes and how much they gain
2 years older shes 22 and dying of stage 4 cancer i get its an adult but i stand by my point
yeah the price of kids and a good education in the us is no joke and if youre making that much money you really arent getting much if any help for the costs i had scholarships and it still ended up being that much im in a great place in life dont get me wrong but it takes a lot of money to raise kids in an ideal fashion people can of course make it work with way less but anyone who grew up poor can attest its better to grow up with more than less
well the way i see it rich should be a higher standard of living than what everyone should be capable of not having to live paycheck to paycheck affording retirement vacations and at least somewhat of a college fund are all things i think everyone should be able to comfortably achieve youd need to go significantly above and beyond that basic standard of living to me to be considered rich which i see specifically as an excess of wealth not just enough
shes practically a child dying of stage 4 cancer to some extent you cant expect her to be rolling in money for a wedding
youre aware your dad is effectively trying to replace you with his daughters and to pretend like those are the kids he had with his late wife right i dont mean to put a damper here but that would really make me rethink having any form of close relationship with him
someone that insecure doesnt accept that answer they keep pressing until they get something to fixate on
yes its a relative term but its one that implies luxury it isnt actually a luxury to have a comfortable life i understand societal factors make it so that is something most for without but it shouldnt be the standard is able to live a comfortable life the problem is so few of us are able to but the standard for what we should be able to achieve didnt suddenly decline just because it got harder to achieve

i know what its like not to have those savings but that still doesnt change the fact that being able to comfortably achieve a bare minimum doesnt mean youre rich it means youre middleupper middle class depending on if maybe there are some luxuries or if everything is fairly average
that they are people are severely underestimating just how much more money it takes to go from nice life to amazing life when you also have multiple kids and even intend to pay for half of their education if grad school might be on the table mine was in the midhigh 6 figures all said and done and that was just me
so middle class is defined as up to the top 83 of earners if we said upper middle class is the next 10 of earners supported by 14 of people reporting they are upper middle class that would be just over 300k of income being up to upper middle class middle class and upper middle class are not the same and upper middle class is beyond the middle class it allows for things like retiring early paying part of your kids education and nice day to day lives but it is hardly rich its just that unfortunately so many people do without what should be way easier to attain
upper middle class is a shockingly uncommon level of wealth yes and thats because of how much you need to earn to achieve it youre supporting my point 300k with multiple kids and a plan to retire early puts you in the upper middle class not rich

and for reference i am referring to actual upstate new york as in close to the canadian border for anonymity im not referring to westchester or any area nearby like i said youd be surprised
no middle class isnt defined on what you earn its defined on your lifestyle thats why more people live in poverty than the bottom lets just say 10 of income earners it works both ways unfortunately there are more people in the lower bracket than the higher but that is exactly why people say the middle class has largely been eliminated if it were just by your earnings definitionally there would always be a middle class that never grows nor shrinks but its clear most people agree that thats not the case its just the unfortunately what it takes to actually be middlemiddleclass in this country is insane now but the two while related are different
not at all but being comfortable and not having to worry about your bills and being able to enjoy life doesnt mean youre rich it means youre middle upper middle class just because the middle class has larger lot been wiped out due to a lot of societal factors people are discussing doesnt change the fact that that is middle class it just feels like it shouldnt because thats now the top 510 of the country but just like you wouldnt call someone who lives paycheck to paycheck and cant afford a big enough house for their kids or save for retirement solidly middlemiddle upper class just because theyre in the 50 of american incomes you wouldnt call someone living what is a upper middle class lifestyle rich just because of the percentile of income theyre two different concepts people are misunderstanding 

povertylowmiddleupperrich has to do with lifestyle not percentile and thats why way more people live in poverty than those in the bottom 10 of income earners in the us it works both ways
yeah i think a lot of people here are considering rich to be doesnt need to worry about money for the minimums but it definitely is way more than that id describe can afford a nice home nice cars fill the retirement funds college funds vacation funds and savings as upper middle class at best rich is tons of luxury goods the 1 million dollar closet vacations that cost tens of thousands of dollars and you dont even need to really save for it way more than just a nice life
everyone i knew who made 250k450k even in upstate ny was still upper middle class money doesnt go as far as you think when it comes to being rich in order to be rich thats more than has a nice house nice car and can pay for their kids school and vacations every year which after taxes thats around the lifestyle were talking about in most places except the rural thats 150k in disposable income after taxes and then youd need to pay your mortgage your cars retirement health insurance which can be well over 10kpp a year put away money for multiple kids college pay for their necessities food etc it definitely adds up and once all that is said and done youre definitely comfortable but youre definitely not rich rich is way less than the top 1 in the us i know that its hard for most to understand because they would feel rich with that much money but thats right up until you have that much and realize how money doesnt really go that far when youre talking about living a luxurious lifestyle which is definitely a necessity if were talking about considering someone rich
rich is more than just can comfortably pay bills and afford vacations
true but youre also making the assumption that just because people survive on less means this is enough to make someone rich 300k still makes them upper middle class when you factor in savings the cost of kids taxes college funds retirement funds 

people define their wealth based on the lifestyle they can afford and i can promise theyre living an upper middle class life at best 300k even in san fran isnt enough to have a mansion and eat at nobu every day it may be enough to not worry about your bills but id argue thats middle class not being rich
he was directly asked a question about it he didnt complain shes just one of the most insecure women out there and was looking for some reason to hate herself part of this definitely falls into she needs therapy for the insecurity otherwise shell ruin any relationship shes in
you can simply contact the police its your home he legally actually cant lock you out the police will escort you personally while you collect your belongings be sure to mention the fact that hes been abusive in the past and youre afraid of him escalating if you try to get your belongings back
also i do want to remind you just because your contractions were false doesnt mean hers will be by assuming her experiences will be the same as yours you may be obfuscating a serious health concern that she should go to the hospital for you mean well but you arent a doctor and having 1 pregnancy gives you about as much insight into what might be going on with her pregnancy medically as a man would have and that is to say almost nothing you can sympathize with her discomfort but keep your assumptions on her medical status to yourself
i think the real question is did he actually stalk you to fabricate your relationship or was that text message just a joke that he sent to friends after he happened to meet you by chance because ive definitely had moments like that happen where ive talked to my friends about something but never actually meant it and then it happened by chance and i joke about making it happen even though i didnt though nothing quite like this 

i can see this being just a series of bad coincidences but if you feel like this man even a bit fabricated your meeting run far and run fast because thats some you level of stalking and obsession
yeah no casual restaurants that are sit down dinner for an average of 12entree dont operate that way at all
id probably get divorce papers drawn up and get a plan for a new bedroom being set up and once he inevitably goes to cost her move everything out from your room and into the new space for yourself get a lock and just leave the house and have the papers sitting on the bed and a note saying im aware of how you feel about woman i am not going to be second place in my own marriage whatever you wish to happen between you two youre now free to explore

and then i would leave for a hotelspa for a night just to make him wonder where you are and also to avoid the immediate reaction hes bound to have
and its pretty shitty that op and her sibling are putting her brother in a position to need to make that call either way he needs to be unfair to one of his kids unless everyone is trying to imply if you dont share blood you cant consider someone your child
yeah its pretty terrible of op and aunt imo to put their own sibling in the position of choosing between ensuring his bio daughters future and staying by his chosen family i still think its their money to do with as they please but i personally would go with my brother has two kids if i cant treat them equally i wont treat them especially if stepniece doesnt have a bio dad in her life and sees brother as her father figure but i understand their choice as well
perhaps he didnt mature he just thought youd changed enough to put up with it this may not be your forever relationship op and thats okay we grow from high school
i mean if you dont want to see him again dont but i will say as youre describing it that doesnt sound implausible for him to also have had that experience dad jokes arent exactly copy righted and sitting by the tv making a dumb sex joke to your kid sounds like the sort of thing hundreds if not thousands of teens could talk about

i didnt say i dont know any sibling who choose to i know plenty i just said none who are required to collegeschool is still on the parents not the siblings even if the siblings choose to save up which i will point out they made sure to do so quietly as this is the first time the fund was mentioned to the parents
i mean niece isnt the familys obligation either no ive never heard of it being on the siblings to pay for high schoolcollege for someone elses kids that in mind they already arent responsible for but are choosing to provide for niece that kindness can extend only as far as they wish in fact its only because its siblings with no obligation that this is okay otherwise id argue if after 10 years youre unable to treat both of his kids like his kids regardless of blood thats wrong
well because he is clearly at a minimum her emotional apbest friend
well you see op is acting as though no one will ever be good enough for her little baby boy she seems to have a pattern of ostracizing her sons partners and subtly trying to make them feel less than
yeah and good for her for respecting herself enough not to put up with that crap and good for her fiancthe son to love her enough to stand up to his mom his mom is giving off major no woman but me is good enough for my son vibes which is a major ick factor
then start acting like one because youre acting like a misogynist with a jocasta complex towards your son
this is a troll because you are very clearly not a bot account
just because the weed itself may not pose a threat thats foolish to think someone who got incredibly and unexpectedly high as a kid wouldnt be in any danger being intoxicated always poses a risk for accidents
i think they dont mean it literally as if theres no active mods the subreddit will be shut down its against reddit policy to have an unmoderated subreddit
it honestly sounds like youve decided it cant work and are looking for a reason it doesnt if thats how you feel leave if you dont like this truth get some therapy but this is definitely an internal issue you need to resolve if youre unwilling to actually put in the effort here and stop just defaulting to see look its not getting better then theres no point wasting either of your time
nta just reply back hey dude i didnt drink more than a fifth of a bottle so im pretty sure my share is covered by the groceries i brought for everyone if you want i can send over an extra 10 but i dont want to start a habit of paying for what i didnt use
presumably this is student housing where this sort of switching of apartments is common and accepted by the landlord while not how most adult apartment complexes are run its pretty common practice in college towns
make a choice you made vows do they actually mean something to you or is it just words you said the grass is greener where you water it if you actually believe marriage means something you go nc and start focusing on your wife and your marriage communication compromise and couples therapy if you can afford it thats the only acceptable answer
he makes you a worse version of yourself why would you stagnate yourself for three years only to stay in a relationship with someone who brings out the worst in you

no work on yourself heal move on if you two are right for each other youll run into one another in the future but do not plan for it tell him youre not going to wait for him as its clear you two arent right for each other as you are
why are you throwing and paying for a baby shower for your friend and giving her no hard budget to follow unless im sorely mistaken on how baby showers work thats not normal
this goes in the face of what a lot of people say but this is also one of those rare times when you really shouldnt communicate to death about this if you need to have one more convo where you two both agree you were both asking for trouble and you will both try to move forward then sure but at the end of the day you asked the question if you cant handle the answer thats a you problem not a him problem and beating this conversation to death is only going to serve to kill your relationship even more stop talking about it after the next conversation either the pain will subside in which case awesome learn your lesson or it wont in which case that sucks but youve learned your lesson on how asking stupid questions can ruin a good thing and then both of you should go your separate ways
im all for employees not immediately being fired for the smallest of mistakes but i also wish we as a society could move away from the idea that you should be paid for not doing any work and i mean this for the common office worker and the ridiculously overpaid executive that just golfs all day earn your money it isnt that hard
you keep saying i understand if its because of my tardiness and then proceed to not understand that shes cutting you because of the tardiness and because you are stressing her out and trying to make things about yourself and your feelings rather than trying to make things easier for her which is what being a bridesmaid is actually about 

accept the fact that you messed up and arent in a position to adequately fulfill the role of a bridesmaid and gracefully apologize to her im sorry that i made your wedding about me that was wrong i get why you would be less stressed without worrying about me in the bridal party im still excited to see you get married and i hope you can forgive me because i dont want my bullheadedness to ruin our friendship

because if you dont accept your mistakes and you decide not to go youll lose this friendship and it will be because youre unable to put your friends feelings on her wedding day before your own yta a large one if i were your friend id be glad if you didnt go so i could quietly bow out of a friendship with such a selfish person
not only that but im pretty sure op is the mean girl the bride said please just accept my decision and lets move on i know thats hard for you to do which says pretty much everything about who op is as a friend 

and thats before you factor in that the bride correctly calls out op for only caring about herself and not the brides stress and claims that the bride brought up being late as a reason even though it was actually op that straight up asked if it was because of being late to the bridal shower when in reality it was three times during one weekend one time 2 hours late one time 4 hours late and who knows how late she was to the third event she even needed a plan to get her to show up early to the wedding with someone which means its not just feeling off but a general lack of respect for anyone other than herself she also kept saying shed understand if its because of how late she was but then also proceeds to text paragraphs about how hurt she is make half a dozen reddit posts with varying levels of information included to obfuscate her wrongdoings and even flat out denies being late in one of the posts as saying the bride is making it up 

op you need to do some deep reflection here because youre misrepresenting things heavily and someone who cant take accountability and blames others isnt a good friend or frankly a good person you said you would understand if shes cutting you for being late and she obviously cut you for being late so tell her you understand and are still happy she even wants you at her wedding because if it were me i would be glad you were debating not going so i didnt have to figure out how to polite ghost you
thats fair the few times ive ever needed to sob i wore myself out within like 10 minutes maybe 30 if im assuming i grossly am miscalculating the time but i couldnt even physically imagine sobbingscreaming for 90 minutes and still being able to effectively breathe at that point i get stuffed up and a migraine so quickly when i cry
also remember if youre basically preparing for them to be unhappy either way might as well wait and enjoy the peace while you can its not like theyll be happy if you tell them early youre just making yourself unhappy all that much sooner
and in that same strain plenty of addicts need to cope by completely and totally removing their vice from their life if op has moved forward through moving on it may be true that regardless of the amount of progress made now that this friend needs to always remain in the past much like you would never tell a coke addict they can probably handle having coke in their life again it may be a similar situation here its okay to have limitations it doesnt mean you arent reformed
eh it isnt fair to think people can say thats enough with emotions but you definitely can control if youre sobbingscreaming vs just crying uncontrollably and maybe heavy breathing ive had those days where i cant stop crying for hours at a time but silently
nta but also you may be shooting yourself in the foot here what does your lease say are you responsible for the rent unless she finds someone else to takeover because if youre on the lease its still your responsibility regardless of if you live there or not
i mean yeah personally if my partner was considering ending our relationship because of issues especially something legitimate that ive been doing i absolutely want to know who the heck would genuinely say theyd actually prefer to be left in the dark and give up the ability to save their marriage just because theyre afraid of a hard conversation

pretty much everyone ever that i have known who was blindsided wishes their partner wouldve just said when they were starting to think of leaving so it could be fixed
good actual communication can overcome way more relationship issues than people give credit to
ok so talk to her about that you dont see the blatant hypocrisy in your statement youre just as guilty of the same things she is youre trying to leave her in the dark over a huge thought youre having rather than just telling her what youre thinking stop that be better
yeah if youre that bothered youre updating your facebook status in the bathroom my comment stands op was bothered enough to take action if theyre that easily bothered they arent compatible with small office culture unless youre in a mega corporation generally small offices will have talks like this especially since its incredibly benign to say something along the lines of thank god he was looking out for my husband it isnt exactly a controversial statement even atheists often use that sort of language
that isnt really true if you cant handle having or even hearing any sort of conversation that isnt strictly about work and nothing else not even something as meaningful as a cancer scare then you need to go work in a giant conglomerate where coworkers arent actually meant to be people and are just meant to be cogs in the machine everywhere else though coworkers are often some form of friends even if its only during work
believe it or not but it isnt u professional to have a discussion about a coworker you have a relationship with it isnt like they were trying to convert op they were simply discussing their experiences and how they felt luckylooked out for that their husbands mass was found early
maybe a pea coat or a trench would give you what youre looking for but can still have a fitted waist to give you some shape
it may just be the dress you have underneath but this doesnt work for me you look like youre drowning in so much fabric
or even just dont put glasses on the floor theres obviously a side table right nearby im not sure why this is even a habit at all let alone the act of leaving them the issue isnt really her forgetting the glass out because she does all the chores and people are allowed to forget things once in awhile but also just dont put your glass on the floor and then when you forget it out itll be on the table and not a tripping hazard
or he just got fed up and she refused to take any form of accountability and just shifted blame so he decided to leave im not saying either of them are totally at fault but lets also not act like either of them is totally blameless either id say its way more okay to have a half cup of coffee next to the laptop if youre working in the living room than it is to leave a glass of water as a tripping hazard in the direct foot path of people in the house
if youre in the wrong for anything its that youre not taking it badly enough thats just how bad it is what he said
as much as it was obvious he wasnt performing to standard today i also want to remind people he is a real human being and likely is worried about more than just this match with everything going on with kyedae and to keep the flaming to a minimum it isnt going to help him improve and it honestly cant feel good for him to hear people shitting on him everyone has bad days and even if you think hes inconsistent it could be due to his entire world turning upside down within the past month
ok op you need to realize there is no saving the kids it sucks but both of their parents are literal nazis the kids either will or wont take after their parents but unless youre going to do away with the nazi father which do not im trying to simply illustrate you need to accept the kids will turn out how they are destined to turn out then you need to accept that the kids got fucked with their parents 

reach out to the kids when theyre older if youre so inclined to protect them but at this point you cant do anything you need to just accept tank your cousin is now and stand up for your values
a little late is definitely 15 minutes not over an hour i would definitely be more than a little annoyed if someone showed up to a meal over an hour late without explicitly stating that theres almost no restaurant ive ever been to where an hour and 15 minutes in i havent gotten and eaten my food already at that point honestly just dont come if youre going to be that late as it defeats the whole purpose of going out for food especially if it was just brunch and not like brunch and shopping or something else afterwards 

that being said the friends still fucked up and glad they took responsibility for it
im proud of you youve come to this decision a lot easier than most wouldhave it isnt fixable and its ultimately a waste of time that you could spend with someone who actually loves you to even try to fix this just make arrangements for a divorce lawyer and you should legally be allowed to use your joint money to pay but check on your area and serve him with papers make sure to keep a friend or some family in the loop and have an emergency crash on the couch arrangement if you really need just in case if youre able to start applying for jobs or disability or some form of income 

and if he suddenly starts with i want to make this work then you can simply reply if you were ever interested in being a good husband you shouldve done that from the beginning not once ive decided ive had enough
is there anyone with knowledge who can explain to me how an arranged marriage can happen where the groom and his entire family hate the bride and her family because i still find that part so confusing
you should speak to a professional theres a lot of things that could be going on and youre right if you dont solve this youll end up either unhappy alone or both a therapist will help if youre willing to put in the work
has he actually said that though because devils advocate in me thinks theres a chance he also just might have work you still dont need to go ofc
also consider that youre violating your ex by showing someone else a sex tape of her with her face in full view personally that would be my bigger issue as now id be terrified of any nudes or videos wed takensent being something you either have or might share 

delete everything you have of any other woman on your phone tell her you understand that this was a violation on multiple levels of multiple people and you understand you were a fool and youve gotten your ass handed to you and are never going to do something like that again and then dont because holy shit your poor ex
1 youre assuming he doesnt want kids and knew he never wanted them that isnt actually stated 2 hes allowed to change his mind hes allowed to withdraw consent everyone is its crazy to argue that because shell lose out on something that his consent no longer should matter imagine making that argument for a woman its gross same thing here morally he can just as easily get a sperm donor or do ivf with a sperm donor and implant that embryo
well the problem is you didnt tell him because you were afraid of him wanting your money you now know its not a fear its reality you do sound naive because you are failing to realize even if you couldve worked through the issues before you cant and shouldnt work through my boyfriend is a gold digger or potential financial abuser interested in taking or controlling my money
sure maybe she cant but to be clear theres nothing saying she cant sue and win for the cost of ivf but the answer isnt to take any another persons consent in creating a life that doesnt yet exist
which is why i said regardless of the legal aspect morally he should be given the right to withdraw consent
well remember that youve made these changes for yourself and your marriage not to be praised
it fell off in the house and you noticed within 30 minutes text him and ask for help looking when he comes home at the end of the day if your partner is upset over a one time accident that says more about him than you 

that being said just a tip whenever i put on jewelry with a clasp the first thing i do is give it a little tug to make sure its really on properly and not just appearing to be secured necklaces can be clasped just the wrong way where they stay on but once you tug it it slipped out of the clasp good habit to form to minimize unfortunate accidents but at the end of the day its still just an unfortunate accident
to be honest i never understood people who say dont accuse someone because for all you know theyre using the condoms for masturbation

thats pretty uncommon and frankly if thats the case as long as you dont accuse someone like a maniac theyll simply respond to the accusation with the real reason be aware that maybe there are other reasons but thats like someone saying all hooves are zebras unless you live in africa those hooves are horses 999999 of the time
ok well unfortunately your mistake had a pretty direct hand in turning this dude into a misogynist you can want whatever that doesnt change the reality youre dating a misogynist and not only that but youre dating a man who rightfully resent the woman who allowed him to be bullied when he was less attractive and never stood up for him you arent going to overcome this if youre embarrassed to be with him youd better cut your losses because quite frankly you being in his life is part of the problem because youre a direct confirmation of everything thats fueling him people treating him better as soon as he got attractive
just to say even if youre legally in the clear morally you should allow this man autonomy over his own progeny i understand there is a cost associated with either getting a sperm donor or doing ivf with someone else but please do not take away his consent to bring his child into the world men and women should be allowed this right sue him for the cost of the ivf and even what it would cost to do it again with a sperm donor but dont bring a child hes clearly stated he doesnt want into the world against his consent
nta but moving forward upon ordering ask for separate checks not only does that make things way easier for the waiter it makes it clear to lynher boyfriend that whatever they order is fully on them 

its best to learn ways of dealing with difficult people in a way that isnt directly confronting them its unclear if you actually said to the waiter i want separate checks so i dont pay for the other couple but if you did probably best to just address things as i suggested instead because passive aggressive and snide remarks about your girlfriends best friend in front of said best friend without ever saying trying anything else is also not the most mature way of handling things and is bound to rub your gf the wrong way regardless of how in the right you are
hey its clear youre in denial but you dont need to apologize to us the only one who suffers here is you just remember that
are you his first girlfriend im going to assume you are or at least youre the first girlfriend to want to have physical intimacy kissing hugging sex etc and he asked you out unaware that he wouldnt like it but he doesnt and hes probably really unsure why himself i would say more likely than not this has to do more with him his feelings his identity and his journey than it has anything to do with you i understand that sucks but i would very gracefully break up with him just send him a text it feels like were friends not in a relationship i think it would be better for us to just be friends from now on
well if you want the real talk maybe you wont ever be absolutely sure and in that case dont ever get married marriage isnt something you should take lightly and frankly much like children i believe plenty of people out there simply will never be fit for marriage if you cant do it right dont do it not when your decisions can have such huge effect on the lives of others both in the person you would be marrying while unsure and of the kids you may have with her
id probably speak to a therapist as it sounds like youre struggling with empathy
well sounds like even if you could trust him before in the past youre no longer able to trust him now as youve caught him in multiple lies 

hes turning into an addict and a liar and when you combined that with the fact that 1 he has additional traits you dont like and dont seem to have touched upon here and 2 youre on reddit asking strangers if you should break up means this

this isnt the life you want for yourself and you know that this is the life you will have if you stay it sucks because you love so much about him and you wish you could just make him into that perfect person you have in your head but he isnt and as time goes on its becoming harder and harder for you to convince yourself hes close enough to being that person its true that no one is perfect and we all fight and have flaws but the reality is this isnt working and it probably hasnt really worked in a lot longer than you want to admit but the longer you stay the longer itll take to not only get over this relationship but also to find the person who doesnt make you feel this way not only that but staying with someone like this is only going to leave you with issues that make you a worse partner in the future 

all in all he may want to stop but you cant keep waiting around for him to stop even without the drugs probably if you were honest with yourself this wasnt a man that youd want to stay with even if you didnt love him
im not sure how much this really means if the next most watched game without 4 of the most popular female streamers playing in it was less than 10k viewers
i also think hes probably putting the blame on the cat when he should be looking at himself 

uimpossiblesign6754 if you are noticing your wife is relying more on a cat than her own husband for emotional support instead of trying to get rid of the cat start asking yourself why you arent the one giving her the emotional support more likely than not youre not actually there for your wife so of course shes going to rely on the cat who is
you should just tell her im happy to pay for you but anything your sister wants how about you cover yourself good compromise
they definitely left because they were homophobic not because they were blindsided you can be surprised someone has two fathers but if youre not homophobic your first thought will definitely not be to get up and leave with absolutely no explanation if for no other reason than because you know how homophobic it looks and generally wouldnt want to come off as such i could maybe see this being a topic of conversation after dinner but no semitolerant person storms off like that without even saying anything to the effect of wow i feel like you were purposefully hiding something from me i feel like you may be hiding other things and i dont think its a good idea for us to have a dinner right now
ok but heres the issue if the money is just meant to be passed along generation to generation no one ever is going to use it right if thats the case 1 the kids shouldnt be upset as it wouldnt have been money they intended to use and 2 thats foolish because hoarding money so you can say you have it but never actually doing anything with it is part of the reason theres so much wealth disparity in the world 

money should be spent responsibly of course but him enjoying the rest of his life and making sure hes able to care for himself is why the money exists if his kids dont want him to rely on them then they shouldnt rely on him to give a full inheritance independence goes both ways
gunna be honest both of you sound toxic and are trying to hide behind jokes and quick wit when the reality is you are both just bitter and bad partners you probably arent good for each other because and especially neither of you seem ready to be with anyone you cant control him but you can control yourself do some selfreflection and work to undo the unhealthy behaviors youre forming so you can find and keep a partner who will also not treat you like shit


im also going to add never once have i looked down into my cup and seen anything looking back at me while insulting your family is so far out of line i cant even begin i also cant say i wouldnt also be disgusted if my partner was drinking from a straw with crap growing in it
maybe tell her its clear this is becoming an issue and you want to discuss this constructively before it causes permanent damage to your marriage so youve booked an appointment with a couples therapist
if you cant do that are you prepared to be the one putting in 100 of the effort again because those are the options he likes you because you dote on and borderline worship him if you stop doing those things he isnt going to chase after you it sucks but thats the reality pick whatever you perceive as the lesser of two evils 


but just remember as much as you feel like you cant do it you can and the sooner you start the sooner you realize wow how did i ever think losing him was that hard
dont make yourself miserable because youre afraid of your family thinking less of you its okay to make mistakes its okay to want the best from those you love but it isnt okay to be miserable because youre afraid of potential judgement your family may just be happy youre finally rid of him so dont stay because youre afraid of what others will think if you leave
i would maybe consider that you also arent who you think you are either im not saying this was your fault but you show a shocking lack of awareness of what id consider the basic status of both your relationship and partners general life its very possible this is all your partners doing but id probably guess you could also do some work on yourself so you can be a better partner in a future relationship with a woman who hopefully will deserve that trust
i like the pants but the top throws off your proportions you have a wider waist and smaller chest so you probably want a top that creates a more flared illusion sweetheart necklines or even a ruffled top would help to even out your proportions a bit
well he clearly thought she loved him more than she loved herself 

the unfortunate thing is for at least three years he was right men and women need to remember that if you arent your own priority youre doing something wrong within reason please dont be selfabsorbed just know your worth
yeah especially since presumably she was dating the exfianc for some length of time meaning this couldve potentially gone down only a few months before they met
its definitely better for jj oops husband thinks jj is immature for not having a boyfriend thats not the kind of energy i would want in my life everything else not even considered
not really saying we need to start working on this and making progress because i know this is an issue i cant live with forever but im still willing to work on it now is different than an ultimatum which is effectively make this dramatic change right now or were done
honestly to answer your question yeah i do think youd be a monster to issue an ultimatum of let me cheat or ill leave you instead tell him i cant stay in a relationship without intimacy we either need to work on this together or we need to reevaluate our marriage because this isnt working for me if he offers an open relationship then sure but to coerce him into an open marriage nah fam if youre unhappy you leave you dont do that
honestly i think this fit will come down more to your size than your height it looks good because of her figure
did you ever pause and think maybe your son doesnt respect you two because you dole out a harsher punishment for speaking out against racism than the racism itself 

id say no offense but i actually mean offense when i say if you arent racist get your shit together because youre coming off very racist right now just in the i have a black friend of course im not racist kind of way that 21st century racists all seem to thrive people seem to think refusing to use a slur means you arent racist and trust me its a lot more complicated than that
most likely because you understand that actions have consequences and anyone can push things too far she likely thought after 5 years they were essentially one so even if he didnt like what she was doing he wouldnt stop it which is a bold choice
if shes lucky 50k year at 27 with no working history and no info on what her degree would be a godsend
it never ceases to amaze me how someone can so confidently refuse to compromise because they firmly believe they hold all the power and so quickly backtrack when they realize theyll lose everything over being unwilling to lose anything
you should really only use force as a last resort you should try bribesmasking before you resort to shoving the pill down their throat
i dont recommend this but at least in your head say there may be many women who would ask for less but there are also many men who will give so much more

you deserve better
yeah im so so so sorry that this is happening to you but its very clear that he thinks youre trapped now there is no changing him and given everything youve just told me i think its most likely he will both cheat and turn physical 

make a decision without him i understand this is hard to come to terms with so if it takes you time to come to the decision thats okay but if you decide to leave him and i would seriously consider it make sure you have everything lined up and never mention a word to him you may need to ask family for help friends make new accounts whatever it takes to ensure he doesnt find out youre honestly very likely in danger right now secrecy is your best friend be careful op if you need resources i can link you to someone who will be able to help more than me
i also think the title is misleading she isnt actually saying maria cant be vegan but shes saying that maria needs to stop demanding specialty vegan items like fake meat fake cheese fake butter etc if shes vegan on principle good for her but she needs to decide between a plain old saladpasta with tofu or going hungry because its ridiculous to expect everyone else starve and get inadequate nutrition just so maria can have the fancy vegan foods
make sure to check the reviews i always raise an eyebrow at affordable dresses that require decent construction to look good would suck to waste a couple hundred on a dress that ended up looking cheap
the reality is your husband wants a traditional wife he wants a woman whos sole existence is to serve him and his family your role is to cook for him take care of him bear and rear as many or as few kids as he desires and put up with whatever he wants he makes a bunch of money and he feels as though thats his right as not only a man but a successful man 

i get everyone on reddit telling you not to tolerate it and you shouldnt but you need to be hyper realistic about the situation youre in he isnt going to change there is no point in trying to convince him if you try to change him one of two i guess three things is going to happen he will leave you cheat on you or become violent hes already become angry with you for beginning to challenge him so do not doubt the possibility that he will become physical 

you need to simply decide if your and his views on what a marriage should be are compatible and they very well may not be but if this isnt what you want you need to make plans to leave not plans to stand up for him otherwise you may be in physical danger or at a minimum left in a situation with no plan he may become vengeful in a divorce and do everything he can to take everything from you and leave you with even less than you came into the marriage with i cant impress upon you that the choices are either accept the marriage he wants or do not say anything until youre in a position to quickly and safely leave
youd be very wise to involve your father not only for your sisters safety but for your boyfriends safety you need to tell anyone and everyone what your sister is doing and make it clear this isnt consensual and protect your boyfriend because this is how false accusations usually arise your sister may not take the rejection well seeing as any semi sane individual wouldnt tell her sister shes going to pursue her boyfriend of 4 years so youre already dealing with someone who isnt all there when it comes to following social norms be careful and protect yourself and your boyfriend the sooner someone can step in and knock some sense into her the better
as much as i understand you dont think its weaponized incompetence it is definitely still incompetence i have never ruined a single dinner timer or not because i am paying attention to the meal i would never walk away from a kitchen appliance thats turned on i have never messed up a load of laundry like that because i always check to make sure to fully check hands inside the machine that it is empty before and after a load of laundry ive never had any furniture tvs or anything of the sort break on me because i test to make sure things are installed properly after i finish he cant prevent the actions of others the late drivers and rear end accidents arent him but youre allowing him to blame way more than he should on this nebulous im cursed idea when the reality is he simply isnt going through life intelligently especially because if you know youre that unlucky youll learn quickly ways around it you two have been together years and perhaps even live together if youre eating the same food the fact that you dont get food poisoning and he does probably means he isnt using good food hygiene for the food only hes eating as bacteria doesnt selectively decide to attack him and leave you alone 

this is a classic example of one crappy encounter happens two is unlucky is every encounter sucks the problem is you not them i get it you love him you want to believe this person you love is totally helpless to do anything to stop this unfortunate string of events but he isnt until and unless he understands that hes allowing himself to a victim more than he needs and why given he seems so predisposed to the inevitable and takes steps to course correct youd be fully within your right to leave someone who doesnt understand something so basic as dont leave cooking food unattended that i learned that when i was 8 years old and started cooking
probably didnt see the context of he was sleeping on an air mattress in someone elses room i was initially thinking he was the ah for making a big deal over 200 but given he doesnt even get an actual place to stay yeah its time to put the foot down imo
its probably an overreaction to say quit him but i agree op needs to simply put her foot down i am not quitting my etsy store if the time comes where i need to go back to being a waitress i will but being a waitress is a dead end job and one i can get at any time with any resume i am going to put my focus where i am happy and making more money until that changes i understand your concerns so if my business starts to fail ill definitely figure something else out but you do not get to unilaterally tell me to quit my business especially not to go back to waitressing of all jobs its utter ridiculous of you to suggest such a foolish business move
it likely doesnt take much luck if you a come from a rich family or b have the mother of the child do all of the child care while you focus on school and then your career the kids were all by the same woman it seems you have no idea if that woman was well off or what but its definitely possible
people seem very unaware that in the franchisedascension league teams are no longer free to make changes whenever they want but yes the rosters are as they are unless there is some emergency transfer allowed by riot which would only be for extenuating circumstances this is a good thing for the scene overall though as rosters that just make a change after any bad performance are going to perform worse than the teams that work at chemistry and accept that the path to success is rarely ever straight up
to me thats hard to say he might absolutely but he just as easily might not theres 5 teams currently and will be 6 teams by next year im sure changes will be made to franchised teams no doubt but its a combination of depends on what his salary and geographic requirements are combined with what the scene looks like by then a lot can happen in a year in fact yay went from relatively unknown to dominant superstar in less than a year there is nothing to stop that happening again to someone else and based on the trajectory of the scene thus far i actually bet it does happen again the issue is when theres only 30 franchised players and only 56 slots for your particular role it probably isnt a great risk to take saying eh ill just take a year off and come back later because frankly you may not have that option yay has a very particular role he fills with a very particular play style he excels in and he does it well but when youre the best in a niche field you need prominence to ensure relevance and that doesnt happen in a world where he doesnt compete and rarely streams i mean he hasnt even updated his twitch to remove c9 from the about tab and frankly unless yay has a backup plan for his career lined up that isnt a risk id personally want to take when were talking about his actual livelihood here it may not be as glamorous as he would want but it definitely beats becomingstaying unemployed
well i think people on here in the comments have knee jerk reactions as a result of the people in the posts ignoring numerous red flags the problem is they see where the red flags tend not always of course lead and as a result have a hairpin trigger on convincing people to expect more for themselves and stop ignoring such blatant issues 

however if the people on here were always really intuned with how much these red flags can turn into relationship enders and instead only ever came here for advice on i messed up i forgot my wifes birthday how do i make it up to her or my partner and i disagree on how to handle xyz how do we come to an agreement people would probably be a lot less likely to jump to this relationship is unhealthy you see the issue 

instead this guy is recognizing the dynamic is unhealthy right away and opting out which is the smarter way to go about dating it means that when the issues do arise they tend to be manageable issues and with someone who hopefully will be able and willing to work on those issues with you
yay wins because he wont be knocked out of the competitive scene for a year ranked is terrible for practicing for pro play and being out of practice with scrims meta and competitive performances could really hurt him in the long run valorant is a game where recency plays a huge role in your value and in a year of franchising with no yay and however many other newupcoming players dominating he could find himself with no prospects again definitely yay has an incentive to be playing and be showing the world he is still very much a top performer compared to all the other talent out there and he does that by competing not by sitting and playing ranked
well believe it or not most likely the getting all up in his over his eye color had to do with his race her brother getting hostileaggressive could be taken as borderline abusive and ops lack of either a warning about her familys behavior nor any attempt to run interference or set boundariesstand up for him show an unhealthy dynamic that can easily turn toxic 

its not silly for someone to see the red flags for what they are right away and not wait for the silly to turn unbearable in fact if everyone acted the way this guy did people would both be happier in general and also those who refuse to make changes in their lives that would protect their so would be forced to because theyd just keep ending up alone otherwise
yes and no anger will consume you if you let it learning emotional maturity is learning how to not allow your emotions to rule you and often part of that is learning how to since you seem to like frozen let things go so while yes its a nuanced topic moving on from something does often involve choosing and actively working on not allowing those emotions to control you anymore sure if you think about it you might still feel those things but its semantics to make the argument about whether or not active or passive feelings of anger are still being angry about something in short yes being an adult means you need to be able to choose when to actively feel emotions vs accepting that you do feel a certain way about something but refusing to allow that emotion to control your life the attitude of she should remain angry forever is frankly unhealthy and lacks any sort of emotional maturity 

she can be angry but she ultimately needs to decide if shes going to let that anger rule her life or not and yes most adults are 100 capable of choosing not to be so angry about something anymore if youre unable to consider you may not have adequate emotional control 

imo it isnt worth it for her to remain angry because the ring was given to her cousin without conditions and regardless of its alterations op wasnt given the ring so there is no additional loss to her as already the ring wasnt and wouldnt be hers it sucks she can mourn the loss of a beautiful ring get it remade for her if she so chooses now free of guilt
well people can actively to choose to move on from a situation theyre hurt about the point of the comment is a very pragmatic one either make this a hill to die on and cause familial tensions or accept that whats done is done it was technically given to her without conditions of keeping it as is and as much as it hurts that hurt can remain a personal one 

forgiveness is often a choice someone actively makes not one that simply happens and its one that is often made not for the person being forgiven but for themselves yes its hard but part of being an adult is being able to manage your emotions that doesnt mean to just get rid of them but you should be able to manage them enough to be able to move forward
even the 2030 lbs tvs of today could definitely kill a toddler if it fell the wrong way that poor child but thank god oop lives in a country with strong intervention for at risk children
i assume the most likely reason for his overreaction was he may be unaware pancada has said he finds playing smokes boring despite being really good at it and thus assumed this was being done against his best interest my guess this was brought up and syyko is enabling pancada in a way even loud wasnt abledidnt want to
and against any medical practice policies that you wouldnt be horrified to go to even most fast food restaurants say you cant wear a ring if itll risk tearing your gloves yet op thinks a cardiologist should have worse hygiene than a burger king

i mean if you really want to be real the problem is she accepts it
unless i missed something i think ultimately the friend simply isnt going to attend op didnt say anything to me that came off as trying to force her to attend without hans just that she cant attend with him as it would make it so the mother of the groom wouldnt feel comfortable attending her own sons wedding
right and as long as op isnt forcing the friend to come without the dog and accepts the friend simply will be unable to attend all is well but its completely fair for op to say i fully understand you cant be without hans unfortunately my mil is uncomfortable around even the most well behaved dogs due to her own trauma as much as i would love to have you there i wont ask either of you to be uncomfortable can we celebrate together the four of us you me hans and groom on our own
in public yes 100000 but this isnt public this is a private event where she isnt required to attend if she doesnt feel comfortable going without her service animal she shouldnt but to act as though her being able to attend comes before making sure her husband can have his mom at his own wedding is also an odd take i for one would really be second guessing a marriage where my stbw made it so my mother wouldnt attend my wedding
she is nta for ensuring her husbands mother feels comfortable at her wedding over her friend however unfortunately this means the friend should simply not go to the wedding its unfortunate but the friend is not required to go to the wedding and her presence isnt a priority compared to her husbands mother
uhm yeah actually your post aside it can 100000 be rude to tell someone something objectively true for example you look really fat in that dress can both be objectively true and rude af to say to someone even your tone can take something from being not rude to rude like id say your attitude was for example hey id prefer to go to the movies alone if thats okay but we can have dinner after vs really you cant possibly think id want to go to the movies with you im going alone its true you dont want to go with that person but the first is polite and the second is rude
no you may feel you have to move now because youd prefer to run alone if the option is there but definitely understand that thats a choice youre making not being force to make and you can make that choice silently if you feel uncomfortable fine but no one else needs to hear why youre moving just move
she most definitely accosted him you can feel she was justified in doing so and therefore isnt an ah for it but she was 100 accosting him for using the treadmill next to her
in the future dont say anything just silently move to another treadmill on the off chance that this guy has unrelated reasons for using that particular machine it prevents you from acting rude and even if he did want to impose on you moving without the confrontation will just annoy him and keep you safer 


i would say if he made a complaint as is youd be partially in the wrong as he does have a right to use the equipment regardless of if there are other machines free without you acting like he was doing something wrong and guys like that are definitely the type to make a complaint so its better to just get up and move rather than confront it either wasnt on purpose in which case confronting him is an ah move or it was on purpose and youll convey the message loud and clear without ever having to interact win win
why not just have your sister text her and see if it goes through on her end thats a pretty surefire way to know if shes blocked you
that is not true at all that was true in the peak of covid which is no longer really a concern its a tourist economy the lack of tourism is hurting a number of the locals and the ask was strictly because the hospital infrastructure isnt equipped to handle large influxes of inpatient care and being an island in the middle of the ocean alternatives for those who need it is effectively impossible
its 30 not 50 theres 14 guests  opgroom and i assume theyll have a slightly nicer setup for themselves as itll double as a honeymoon so 2116  13125 an 30 increase if you assume opgroom dont splurge on themselves and if you assume a linear ppp which most likely shed do a double bed and couch setup for the sister and family making it less than other guests which are presumably primarily couples 


doesnt change it the flights alone on a last minute trip to hawaii are nuts and why spend that much money you 1 dont havedidnt plan on and 2 on someone who really isnt there to celebrate your relationship just wants a free trip
im sorry for not inviting you i figured since you said no due to time away from work and difficulty handling the long travel time with the kids that a longer and harder to get to location would be the opposite of easier for you guys but id still love to have you if youre able to join i can send you the flight and hotel details unfortunately you will need to cover your travelaccommodations as the plans i made were based on those who rsvpd yes only and weve already used our budget if you cant spend the money or the time due to it being your busy season i more than understand and hopefully we can get together once things settle down for us both more if you need to think about it no worries just be sure to let me know by whatever date you want so i can make sure to get extra tickets for the activities i planned
your bosss success compared to his bosss doesnt have anything to do with the idea that your potential ex may try to sabotage your career
you can also give him some benefit of the doubt especially because you still come to the same conclusion if hes being caused such deep emotional distress that hes ask you to quit your job after seeing just how low you were at one point that means you are just as unhealthy for him as he is for you at that point even if hes being totally genuine in his feelings the conclusion is the same i love you and i dont want to keep hurting you but if itll take me quitting my career for you to not be hurt unfortunately at this point its for the best we part ways we both have our demons and it seems like they cant play nice with each other im not giving up my job but i also will not stick around and trigger you either please get some therapy its a life changer if our paths cross one day and were both in a place to lift one another up maybe things will be different but for now i think i should move out so you can focus on yourself and your well being
i hope it isnt true but that was my thought as well either that or im unfortunately guessing he probably isnt the cleanest person to live with because i would definitely notice and clean up any blood left on the floor regardless but especially if caused by something i was ashamed of
i have no agenda and a number of oops comments have been deletedremoved and show a very different side of oop he was attacking anyone who disagreed with him insulting them and doubling down on the idea that family should come first after being criticized by multiple people it seems his attitude has softened significantly which is good but multiple people on a number of threads have said the same thing the repeated use of the language blood family should come first and calling an obvious abuse victim spineless doesnt sit right with many people the point is the repeated context in which it was used felt less like you shouldnt allow yourself to be manipulated and more like you should simply side with family because were blood and were here first including in the first few comments that were made on this thread thankfully oop has admitted the wording was wrong and emotions were high but i stand by my statement both generally and in the way many felt it was being used in this context and understand you likely didnt see many of oops earlier comments in this thread as he appeared to be deleting them when they werent well received
fair always is dangerous language however i believe that when you take a marriage vow you need to be prepared to make that person and family you make together your priority over your blood family
i stand by what i say fully it is disgusting to say you think blood family should be the priority its completely fair to say you think his values which clearly his fiance was in direct opposition to should be his priority but how you phrased it is something i disagree with extensively i fully stand by that dont double down on the context as that only implies you do think blood family takes precedence over a life partner which when that life partner is actually in alliance with you is 100 a disgusting statement

quite honestly you honestly seemed to have an air of blaming your brother for not sticking with you simply on principle without recognizing the complexities of abuse and that makes can still be victim to toxic relationships im sorry that youre upset i take issue with that but i do
thats good you recognize that a healthy partner should always come before blood family the way you wrote that post definitely indicates otherwise im glad your brother was able to see reason and get out of an unhealthy relationship
as much as oop was right that this woman wasnt right for hisher brother im surprised no one has pointed out the idea that blood family should always be the priority over your fiance no matter what is also a disgusting view assuming you and your future life partner are aligned in values you should 100 always pick your life partner over blood family the idea that your sibling should be a priority over a life partner in cases other than such extreme hatred isolation and abuse is horrendous and based on how many times oop brought up the idea of he should stand by his blood family makes me feel like this isnt extenuating circumstance and oop just believes this is what you do i hope oop changes their mind before getting into a ltr if theyre interested in them because my heart hurts for all the people out there in unhappy marriages because their partners hold them in second place to mommydaddywhoever else in the name of family
sure but that will probably become apparently relatively quickly and can be addressed then as long as youre not depriving your child of any form of food for months seems like a fine strategy to at least try
i read this as crows initially and had to zoom in in order to definitely say those definitely are not crows
i mean realistically speaking thats because if a partner was going to negatively talk about body count its going to be towards a female i would be more surprised if i saw someone judging a man for sleeping with 100 girls in college quite honestly
generally speaking it gets around when youre all friends in college
you should probably read again i said this isnt a legal issue specifically where it pertains to her lying and saying he raped her i never said sexual assault isnt illegal i was specifically replying to the idea he should report it to the police for fear of her flipping the narrative
he honestly isnt working that much yes its a lot but plenty of people do it the real issue is hes leaving for work at or around 12 pm if a 1213 hour day has him home at almost 2 am depending on her work hours that means they probably never see each other he needs to get his hours in check and start working wayyy earlier so that him and his wife can share meals together but honestly i have no sympathy for someone who expects his wife to work 30 hours a week do all the chores and then stay up past midnight to have a home cooked meal ready for him in the middle of the night 

this would be a totally different story if he was getting up at 5 am and getting home at 79 pm and expecting her to cook something quick or have take out or whatever but these timeframes are totally unreasonable and unnecessary
to be honest the part everyone seems to be overlooking is if hes coming home at 130 am after a 1213 hour day that means hes leaving for work at noon he needs to start going into work at 67 am and getting home at a normal hour so its reasonable to expect a meal ready for him but its ludicrous to be going into work that late staying that long and still expecting your wife to stay up past midnight to then cook

if he were coming home even at 9 pm i would be fully on his side coming home at almost 2 am fuck no
im not saying it isnt im just saying this isnt a legal issue re she could lie and say he raped her no sex happened in the us actual rapists with evidence go free but you cant have evidence of what didnt happen and unfortunately even though he was sexually assaulted male victims have even less chance of legal success than female victims however filing the report will at least substantiate ops experience even if no consequences befall her 

and like i said if ops girlfriend doesnt believe him even after he has gone to her multiple times then hes learned a valuable lesson about how she prioritizes him so he can gtfo
she could but since op was smart and went to gf about this before its consistent this wont be a legal issue sex never happened he got a bj and without any evidence of any sex let alone nonconsensual sex op really doesnt need to worry about a rape charge not in the us at least if his gf doesnt believe him ultimately its better for him to know she isnt someone who will have his back and he can leave
the staff didnt side with her and theres nothing about anyone else agreeing it was simply she had an attitude i had one back the staff told us we were both able to use the equipment as we wished unless you see information not im the op but how youre portraying it is very different than how the op portrays things
you do seem to be dragging your feet a bit on the legal side of things just to warn you that could seriously hurt you in the long run just be careful
i mean if communication is important to you i wouldnt stay with someone who doesnt communicate i get it sucks but that just isnt who she is you should love someone for who they are not who you want them to be
yes i agree but also recognize that there are some people who take undue offense to what most would consider normal so as much as it may depend on him recognize that it doesnt all depend on him this is so much an issue where women assume the worst of guys in the gym where its a growing trend on tiktok for girls to film and watch for anyone who glances at them just to start a fight its entirely possible that she may have also just assumed he was staring at her when he wasnt im not really speculating who was doing what because theres ultimately no way to know except that even if he were standing too close for her preference in a gym environment or really any if you come at someone with an attitude like she did you should expect an attitude in return it really isnt an abnormal social interaction
even if you regret it in the future you can mourn him then theres no reason or expectation that mourning a life can only occur at a funeral with people to watch you grieve if you dont want to go now dont and whenif that ever changes decide how you want to remember him then
let him blame you at the end of the day if him blaming you is what it takes for you to find a bigger better relationship far away from a cheater like him thats a small price to pay
i mean i dont necessarily think its sincere but i am saying that if you immediate attack anyone even trying they will stop trying
thats fair enough i will say i take it you were probably a bit more polite than it seems the woman in the story was but youre totally entitled to your opinions and experiences i think to me ops answer seems a bit more normal as i get the impression the woman also had an attitude to start and you tend to get what you give so i dont really find op an ah for responding to an attitude with an attitude but im glad you havent had that experience
no she said she was convinced her intentions were good and realized they werent and her actions came from a place of judgment which was wrong
yeah it is glaring obvious who does and doesnt go to the gym in this thread to the surprise of no one most people on aita clearly are not avid gym goers
out of curiosity do you go to a busy gym because youre totally entitled to your opinion but its 100 normal expected and required in a busy gym to stand close enough to a desired piece of equipment that as soon as the person gets up from their set they can move up and take the equipment otherwise someone will take your place this comes down to if the woman isnt comfortable with that sort of environment thats totally fair but she probably needs to go either at a less busy time or a smaller gym

also im not trying to attack you im just curious if youre familiar with this sort of environment because i can see how someone who isnt familiar with busy gym etiquette may get to your conclusion
tbf if everyone in the thread is mischaracterizing his actions as something they clearly werent he can provide clarification people are out here acting like he was standing over glaring heavily and making tut tut noises while pointing at his watch when this sounds like completely normal gym interactions from someone who actually goes to a gym heads up gyms are filled with adrenaline and testosterone and women and men tend to be a bit testier than usual women often assume that everyone is leering at them and tend to want space and no one looking at them and men often just want the person theyre waiting on to get out of the way so they can do their set it sometimes leads to snarky interactions and its not that deep
they didnt actually they said they understood where op was coming from but shes allowed to do whatever exercise wherever she wants thats actually the opposite of saying hes out of line thats retail worker speak for i fully agree with you but this is my job and i need to not get in trouble
and believe it or not youre allowed to silently judge people he didnt say anything stop acting like you can police someones thought thats some orwellian bullshit right there
 youre gunna decide a person is an asshole for a silent thought dude thats just unreasonable the woman spoke to op first and told them to go away pretty sure op isnt the ah here
i mean she has a point though as far as i was a giant flaming asshole and now i realize it goes she got further than a lot of people ever do none of these comments recognize that though id probably caution people at least in their real life to be kinder to people who have any form of selfreflection because the fact that this person still got piles of hate for acknowledging they messed up just makes people never want to acknowledge their flaws to some extent she cannot undo what she did she can only reflect on her previous actions and try to learn from it in the future if we actually want the world to be a better place and for people to want to be better we all need to encourage people for trying that doesnt mean forgive their previous mistakes but endlessly hating on someone even when theyre trying to reflect on their behavior isnt the answer
yeah and then you realize really quickly someone who really loves you wouldnt hold you back and theyd probably move with you given he has nothing tying him to where he is i get how it feels but take it from an old curmudgeon like me you realize a lot of the things you were so sure of at 18 just arent true by the time youre 25 and then again when youre 35 youll find someone who loves you so much you never find yourself posting on reddit about how theyve made you feel guilty for achieving greatness

ive lost loves before that felt like i wouldve died without them but im still here and in the end i now realize those loves were there to teach me something and prepare me to be the person i was meant to rather than to accompany me in the journey but youll find that person i promise the road may be bumpy but itll be worth it
i think you should just be honest im going to great school you can either come with me or you can stay but i am going if this is where our paths diverge i can honestly say i loved every minute but i am not giving up on this dream i understand if you arent ready for this step but i am

i was in a similar situation many years ago i have no regrets and id pick my education every single time my parents always said if its meant to be itll work out and if it wasnt meant to be it isnt worth sacrificing your future for
does he have a therapist knowledgeable in addiction if not that should be the first step
sounds like she figured after 3 years marriage should be the next logical step but she realized that wasnt what she actually wanted it could be someone else it could be she wasnt ready it could just be that you two arent right for each other it doesnt mean you were a bad partner or theres anything wrong with you but not everyone is meant to marry each other be happy she realized and finally told you before the wedding rather than after and im glad youre okay
sometimes just the threat of it would be enough to get someone to back down
well it would probably be easier to trust if you waited to trust until someone has proven they are worth it ya know then you wouldnt constantly be having dudes breaking it youd just be weeding out the bad eggs without feeling like its a person affront
like i said before a person who when angry responds in a way to cause pain isnt marriage material you should aim for someone who even when angry is able to come at a conflict from a place of love
you have time take a breather moving forward table any serious discussion of marriage engagement moving in etc until you feel like you actually know a person and there arent any massive flags thrown out if this is about a rush to the aisle youll end up there a lot quicker and only once if you take your time and make sure its right the first time
plenty of mcdonalds are 24 hours still weird but possible explanation as to why no one checked
girl youre a doormat stop believing what this therapist has to say and get your own therapist to work on your issues because youre about to be a mom and you need to work on your spine unless you want to get completely run over by the two kids youre about to have to raise on your own
as soon as you realize he doesnt actually care about your feelings he only cares about his you should stop caring about how much you love him because thats meaningless to him
fair enough good luck you seem to have a habit of rushing into situationships with men before you actually know if theyre worth the time investment id recommend slowing down and not jumping in head first with any guy who shows interest
i do have to ask how many men are you dating and why are you talking about marriage to a man you arent even faithful to you made a post 4 days ago that youve since deleted about a wealthy older indian man wanting to date you and you were considering it expect he was married before i feel like youre going through something but none of the information youre giving is actually honest as theres a common theme of you wanted to be the first wife
its ok to admit you cant move past it ive said it before and ill say it again never stay in a relationship with a person who when angry will say something just to hurt you that isnt who you commit to a lifetime with it shows theyre vindictive and cruel and neither are traits you need in a partner ive been angry before really angry i have never said to a person whom i intended to continue dating anything that i felt would hurt them just because i wanted to hurt them
you should both recognize youre career oriented and neither of you should give up your career goals for the other but those goals are in direct contradiction geographic incompatibility is a real thing and residency is long hard and time consuming if you think long distance relationships dont work let me tell you relationships in residency also dont usually work if you combined long distance and residency its a whole other beast to tackle if you already have doubts it aint worth it to invest another 23 years just to find out what you already know
youre in your final year of uni when do you graduate are you done in mayjune if so hold off until you graduate itll give you time to plan and get the logistics sorted start applying for jobs now either where you are or back home where your family is go to your universities career department to get in contact with alumni message recruiters on linkedin this all works way better than blindly applying network network network use being a student to your advantage there is no easier time to get a job than now 


as for how to get where youre going do you have a drivers license if so rent a car to get where youre going you can possibly take your bird on a train cover the bird during travel and get a travel cage that can fit either at your feet or on the seat next to you be realistic about how much it costs to transport things it may be cheaper to replace items than ship them i moved cross country twice in a very short period of time and the only thing i transported was clothing everything else was bought as cheap as possible and given to friends when i left vacuum bags are your best friend for getting as much as you can in your bagscar 

if you dont have a license but do have family willing to house you pay for a ticket for them to fly out and then rent the car to transport you and your stuff in the meantime you need some income look into on campus jobs the dining hall library cafes tutor centers etc all should have flexible hours and be okay with you working 515 hours a week for some pocket change save every penny work as much as youre able 

focus on 1 getting a part time job on campus if possible 2 getting a permanent job network network network 3 talking to family to see if they can help you and how 4 looking into how much it will cost to get where you need to go the further you have to travel the more it will be and ultimately make sure you dont try to take a bunch of stuff that will be cheap to replace but expensive to transport
im going to go against the grain but i would be uncomfortable if my partner went out in clothing like that personally nips showing for me are a no go and its pretty clear there were some nips showing its your body you are 100 in your right to do whatever you want but hes also allowed to be uncomfortable with it after 5 years together id personally expect my opinion to matter a bit to my partner i think you probably should decide if this is the hill to die on and if it is go forth but i wouldnt think wearing a shirt with no braundershirt or jacket or anything is worth making my partner feel as though youre looking for other mens attention i think youre nta but i get where hes coming from you clearly dont need to be with a guy who is uncomfortable with clothing like that though either ultimately may just be an incompatibility in your views
info do you actually have a choice because based on your description youre third in line after your grandparents and your aunts to get the land unfortunately if this is the case speak to a lawyer before responding because legally this might be the best youre actually going to get that doesnt make it right but you should get this info before deciding how to proceed because if you dont have leverage here legally youre going to need to proceed accordingly it honestly sounds like your family is legally entitled to take 100 of your inheritance if theyre so inclined and you wouldnt have any recourse if you irk them they may go this route
im fairly certain she isnt using an account with a 120 balance in it to provide the cash to close last i checked you need a lot more than that to even get approved for a mortgage and so theres obviously another account somewhere
again i do not you seem not to realize that apple has embedded software in the photos app that changes the video attributes when you copy a file this is exactly what was discussed by professionals and exactly why i said unless its an original the metadata is useless have a good day now
again that is incorrect like i said this was key information in a public trial last year where multiple professionals said copying a file does not save that exact information date time location etc on iphones unless a file is the original the metadata isnt usable im not going to argue any further i will take the experts opinion over a random redditor
looks super cute but needs a fun belt or even a flannel tied around the waist as it is its missing something but it definitely works
i do youre referring to the date with which a video was physically taken ie the day that ops gf was having sex if the video isnt the original which would track in her story the metadata wouldnt be in tact granted i believe you can tell if the video is an original if youre a forensic technician but laymen are unable to tell what youre trying to say the metadata will say 

copying a file alters the metadata simple as that and like i said before ill take a paid professional with a decade of experience and tons of lauded credentials saying this in a court of law over some rando on reddit contradicting it
this was a key point in a very public trial that involved forensic metadata experts and these were the conclusions they all drew if the files werent original the metadata would not be intact ill go with their expert opinion over yours thanks

eta this was jd v ah where the fact that metadata couldnt be verified in copied files is what hurt her on top of everything else but thats not relevant here
i think you missed the point is she able to financially bring the same as you do in the relationship is she willing to have an even financial split or is she looking for someone to take care of her what do you want do you want an equal partner or are you okay with being with someone who you need to care for
what sources are you using because while its true that often these are compromises made in relationships at your age they are by no means necessary to find a relationship so long as and especially if youre willing to wait until you find someone who feels the same way as you in fact you have a lot of the conclusions it takes people another decade or so to come to so good for you realizing this so soon

i will remind you that even with a healthy mindset relationships can fail but that doesnt mean the relationships werent worth it or didnt teach you anything so while you should properly vet women before committing to them try to loosen up on the disgust because things not working out being what you thought and all of this is a big pet of growing up and somewhere along the way its likely that exactly what you want in a partner will change and evolve as a result of these experiences and thats a good thing growth and experience isnt a bad thing just remember that regardless of what happens if you can learn something from it it was worth it
thats only if the file is original otherwise the metadata would show when the copy was created ultimately he either trusts her or he doesnt and i would understand him not being able to trust her
ive definitely had this happen if all youre referring to is the date it says when you click on the video sometimes its smart enough to know when the photovideo was actually created and other times it just is whatever the date i saved the videophoto
funny because i expect it will go exactly as she expects sex work is a hard line for a lot of people and hes conservative it doesnt take a genius to figure out more likely than not hes not going to marry someone who was a sugar baby it sucks but 1 this is why its important to choose someone who have values compatible with you and your life and 2 the sugar daddy has her number its clear that he isnt above searching her up as soon as he realizes shes married itll come out and its way better for her to get broken up with now 2 years and no commitments in rather than divorced in a few years when theres a house marriage and kids on the line 


we all make choices in life as much as i believe people can change sometimes those choices will always have consequences but its better to be with someone who accepts everything about you rather than be with someone who you know would leave you if they knew the real you like you said i knew if i told you you would have left shows just how selfish a person really is and frankly means they probably havent really changed as much as they tell themselves
if it helps tell yourself youre also going this for her she needs to be able to sort out her relationship issues without you in the picture and its clear that unfortunately youre a stressor 

and you get the added bonus of doing this for you too because no one deserves to be harassed or name called and remember this isnt your fault
okay but stop explaining it and justifying it this is what hes going to do he wants to live with his mom and he wants you at 23 years old to support his mom and him remember easier to leave a mommas boy than divorce one hes a mommas boy you arent going to change that he isnt ever going to pick you over her this is the reality instead of wasting all of your energy justifying explaining and defending what you know spend your energy figuring out what you actually want to do is this a life you want youre on reddit looking for advice so clearly some part of you is fed up i would be honest with yourself if you really think this dude is worth a lifetime of being second place you got together at 1517 ill let you in on a little secret the guys youll find now as a fully independent woman with the world at her feet will be a million times better than the guy you found when limited to your math and english lit classroom youre in the prime of your life at the ideal age to find a way better partner both on paper and in how he treats you know your worth
for both of your sake walk away now you still love her so maybe your relationship will heal but if you keep letting her in your life the friendship will sour even more than it has not only will your presence bring up some obviously repressed issues in their relationship but the chances are someone is going to say something unrecoverable neither of them is ready to deal with the fact that dude isnt straight take a step back if you love her let her sort her relationship as youre clearly putting strain on it if you love yourself take a step back because youve been groped and harassed repeatedly and you dont deserve that you do not ever need to accept someone making you feel unsafe i wish you luck i hope she realizes how shitty shes being but do not stick around as if you do youll always be the scapegoat i speak from experience walking away is the best thing for everyone involved
keep in mind and im not defending her at all she needs to come to terms with her boyfriend being predatory unfaithful and at least partially a different orientation shes probably struggling with the reality of what she just witnessed actually means and thinks its easier to blame you than deal with things 

this isnt right this isnt your fault you need to drop her because this isnt right but maybe in the future shell get her head out of her ass and apologize because every one of us including her knows that youre telling the truth and youre not making a mountain out of a molehill shes just hoping she can make a molehill out of a mountain because she doesnt want to accept her relationship is over its up to you if you ever want to entertain a friendship ever again no one blame you if you dont but its pretty clear shes heavy in denial
this is your life you only have one it is yours to do with as you please if you want to stay stay if this is who you really want to spend your life with thats a choice you can make but remember no one else should have any say in your life because at the end of the day you need to live your life no one else this guy cheated on you call a spade a spade he lied to you fucked other people manipulated you and got others around you to manipulate you too 

stop saying he technically did nothing wrong he did he knows it and you know it if he didnt do anything wrong are you telling me lying isnt wrong because he lied to you every day he told you you were the only one its foolish to keep writing things off if hes still unwilling to say i lied i knew what i was doing was wrong and i lied because i knew youd leave otherwise then theres nothing to even save
to be fair op seems to have things confused it wouldnt be her leaving if she crosses the boundary itll be him leaving it seems like hes making baseless threats and she knows it hopefully op is prepared to actually walk away otherwise hes setting himself up for a very dark future
well actually plenty of nutritionists do advocate for intermittent fasting so the idea that her skipping breakfast means she doesnt understand balanced eating is also absurd its actually a rather old take that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and now theres a much better understanding that nutrition isnt a one size fits all and what works for some might not work for others 

that being said yes they cook together and she said she monitored the calories and was still gaining weight given that she ruled out medical concerns it would lend itself to he may be doing something while you arent look unfortunately there have been a few posts of feeders who have purposefully made special condiments with huge amounts of calories to stealthily add to their partners meals not saying i really think thats whats happening here but i am saying i dont think op has all the info here
while i understand what youre saying she did minutely track her calories so she clearly does understand just how many calories are in what shes eating as nowadays people use an app where you just look up the item and amount and even while tracking she wasnt losing weight which would indicate he may have been doing something to her food while she wasnt looking
arranged marriages across continents is just plain risky i understand your faithculture but speak to a match maker or at the very least limit yourself to people you can actually meet in real life 

the nature of an arrangedaccelerated marriage like youre discussing is going to lead to people ditching you as soon as they think they may have a chance at an even slightly better prospect which realistically thats my guess what happened
thats probably unlikely to be an option he has no leverage his dad can pretty easily say marry her before you start the next year or i wont pay tuition
do so with the primary goal of you arent giving up your children and you arent allowing them to move anywhere far away i assume that especially being well off half a house and half your savings account isnt worth losing your 4 kids right because ultimately shes never getting child support if she has more money and you have your kids half the time so telling you she wont ask for child support is just emotional manipulation at that point because it wouldnt be something she would get anyway as you dont want her to have primaryfull custody
just a heads up there are a lot of people who actually stay with someone they know will be vindictive if they break up because theyre afraid in the back of their head of facing the vindictive ex and figure its easier to deal with whatever the relationship brings
yes but she specifically said she was looking forward to them cooking together more often not him cooking for her so youd generally think that that means she can see what hes doing and if shes an athlete she would understand that shit ton of butter means shit ton of calories

i totally understand most people dont understand how many calories are in fats like butter but i would expect more from someone who says she eats healthy and is an athlete of a decade
well elaborate on the conversation be blunt we met when i was getting out of a sexless marriage im afraid this is a sign our marriage is taking the same direction i hope im wrong but as my husband its both of our responsibility to discuss this as a couple if youre stressed we need to work on things together because i am not prepared to stay in a relationship where excuses run rampant and i feel tossed to the side im happy to work with you but this is something we actually need to talk about
you two werent married he didnt commit to stay through thick and thin you both committed some acts that would warrant the other ending the relationship name calling is a pretty fast relationship killer and you  said you have a pattern of namecalling now that isnt to say he was an amazing partner he also wasnt but just because you stayed in a shitty relationship doesnt mean he is under any obligation to i think people get this twisted idea of if i stay when you suck you need to stay when i suck but no putting up with bullshit doesnt buy you the ability to also act like that 

you two clearly never had a fantastic foundation for a relationship and that might be because the two of you dont mesh well or it might be because thats just how he treats the woman hes with either way as much as it hurts be thankful because this wasnt the right guy for you and its pretty obvious you werent going to end it he bit the bullet for you both and did what everyone else can see was the right call it sounds like he honestly never liked you very much and you always put up with less than you wanted because you thought you could convince him to change for you heads up if you tie your self worth into being able to convince shitty men to treat you better because youre worth it youll always be disappointed get your own therapist learn to love yourself outside of how a man treats you and then reflect on what you want in a relationship and find someone who is naturally like that as soon as you need to convince someone youre worth being treated well they arent worth your time
there are definitely other issues going on here you sound like you may have some body image issues and he may sound like hes doing something to your food i would recommend you proceed with caution because while i dont want to tell you whats going on i get a weird feeling you are missing something here both of your reactions just feel off
you probably need to just send a message saying its pretty clear you either dont want or arent ready for a relationship with me anymore so i just wanted to make sure were both on the same page this is over and i wish you the best
yeah personally id make it whenever the lease it up
oh 100 agree i said elsewhere if them growing apart wasnt enough to ruin the marriage his actions and behavior surely will
that information isnt included in the post so we cant really tell maybe there is and maybe there isnt perhaps she has other views where she believes tattoos are unclean or against her faith or she just doesnt like the look of them perhaps her ocd would manifest in another way where having a mark on her may trigger her in other ways perhaps shes afraid of needles or has a clotting disorder or a million other things that we cant know but presumably all her loved ones would know im not saying that any of this is the case but im just posing scenarios where it would be legitimate to intervene in someone making a decision fueled by mental illness that wouldnt necessarily be included in a reddit post 

all this to say sometimes if everyone with first hand knowledge of a situation including a medical professional is in agreement theres a chance that they have more informations than we do ill say this if i were going to make a permanent decision i usually wouldnt make and my loved ones knew that and knew i was going through a mental health crisis i would want them to intervene everyone else can feel differently but i would personally rather not make a permanent mistake if someone around me could stop that
usually 1 of 2 things either the person knows youre not right for them deep down but is also afraid to be alone or hurt you but once forced to be alone actually finds the one and immediately realizes theyve found what was missing all this time prompting them to take the plunge they always dragged their feet on before or sometimes you have to learn the hard way it isnt that the person loved you any less or didnt genuinely want to be with you its just that they really thought they had time they didnt really see what the big deal was and figured you agree that as long as it happens eventually its all good but as soon as theyre reminded that love isnt enough and actually women are willing to leave without that commitment as soon as they find someone they feel that same way about they dont want to lose it again so they act fast
i dont necessarily disagree but her therapist is presumably more educated than you about mental illness and ocd and advised her against getting the tattoo because she clearly felt there was ample evidence of it being fueled by the ocd to some extent if it wasnt fueled by ocd it wouldnt make a difference if she got it on her 5th 6th or any other memorable date it would really just matter that shes permanently honouring her mother

this is a classic case of commenters assuming that the poster has just as much information as they do rather than having way more information including the opinion of a medical professional specifically trained and informed of ops gfs mental health and her current state of mind
lmao what the fuck youre not immature for just wanting to get married thats absurd
you know whats even more of a special kind of stupid thinking that your boyfriend who makes the same as you and has more assets than you actually would be with you for your money its pretty obviously a joke and the fact that she cant realize she is the one with less money in the relationship so obviously he isnt with her for money just goes to show that she isnt ready for a serious relationship yet
well most notably she thinks im with her for her money and then we make the same as one another and i have more assets than she does like fam this is not a woman to start a life with you have kids you need someone stable and trustworthy not a woman looking to bail any time you make a joke a joke that anyone smart enough to be a fucking doctor should realize is a joke you literally have more money than her
you can emigrate to another country then as it seems yours doesnt really care about peoples actual happiness either that or be unhappy it seems like you get the choice of being unhappy and rich or unhappy and poor
it doesnt matter i hate people who act like someone needs to justify why they want something shes allowed to just want to be married she doesnt need to explain it no one needs to explain why they want kids or get married or have a monogamous relationship youre allowed to just want that and youre allowed to end an otherwise great relationship with someone who doesnt
i understand i hope you dont think i was implying you would cheat but understand insecurity is a hell of a thing that being said your weight is definitely not the only thing different about you you said yourself youve made a lot of big changes in the past few years its disingenuous to act like the only change is your weight not only will that many changes come with a natural shift in your personality you also said you two no longer have a big thing in common your love for games and more likely than not if youre gymming that much the way you spend your free time has also changed significantly perhaps you no longer enjoy the same foods or restaurants you once did you would almost need to or else you wouldnt have lost so much weight maybe you like to go hiking whereas before you two would watch a movie instead i get its hard for you to see how much you changed because to you youre still you but as someone who has had their partner undertake huge changes like youre describing i can promise you its way more than just your weight youre practically a new person and that can be scary for him and he also may not feel like you two are on the same page anymore 

like i said in a previous comment just because you think everything is fine and you dont care about how different you two are now doesnt mean he doesnt care and based on everything youre saying its clear he cares
time to put on your big girl pants and say the scary thing i know you havent given it much thought but after 4 years you need to start im not willing to wait as long as youre saying you want before marriage is even on the table to discuss you need to think long and hard now about if you want to marry me because the option isnt going to be on the table forever and its not even going to be on the table for another year im sorry to put you in a difficult spot but this is a dealbreaker for me if four years isnt enough time for you to be sure then no amount of time will be and im not willing to wait any longer to find that out i love you and i want us to be together but i love me more i know what i want in life and i wont be a girlfriend for a decade its just not something i have any interest in
the thing is you dont need to know the details of their relationship not everyone wants to be a girlfriend for 67 years its the same thing as one person wanting kids and another not even if the rest of the relationship is everything you ever hoped youd find this is a deal breaker

and thats before factoring in theres no way to know if he really will ever marry her or is just kicking the can down the road like so many men do and why so many women are not willing to be a girlfriend for 67 years
yeah i mean i think its easy for us to sit from our chair and tell op to leave but i agree if she wants to feel like she gave him a chance she needs to be brutally honest with him too that timeline doesnt work for me if you dont see yourself getting engaged or married for a few years we need to part ways i want a relationship that is working towards marriage and if after 4 years that isnt a step youre willing to take with me yet im not willing to wait until you are you need to think about if this is really how you feel because if so we need to be having a very different conversation
i honestly think everyone acting like he took advantage of her is making too big of an assumption more likely than not he got someone who he felt comfortable with and now is afraid that shes gotten hot and successful and will want to upgrade her partner its pretty common from both men and women and isnt as malicious or intentional as people think its just that some people arent able to handle jealousy and insecurity and purposefully choose a partner that doesnt flare that insecurity and arent prepared for such a huge shake up 

that combined with i stayed by my partner when they were fatpoorno bodyetc and then they became hotrichfamous etc and the first thing they did was leave me for someone they met at the gymworkwherever is way more common than people want to admit do i think thats op no not at all but its silly to pretend that exactly what this guy is afraid of isnt something that happens all the time it happens so often that its a running troupe of people in professions like doctors lawyers tech and professional sports
i think you are being naive yes because the reality is hes making these comments because youve already grown apart for you maybe you dont care but for him it seems he cares he wants a woman who shares the same hobbies with him who is lower maintenance and doesnt care about how she looks or making a ton of money im not saying this to criticize you strong independent women are amazing and we need more of them in this world but not everyone wants a gym rat girl boss tm some people want a cozy gamer and that isnt you anymore and thats okay but its naive to act like if you think its fine so does he and clearly he doesnt think its fine he clearly feels like hes already lost the woman he fell in love with do not change for him please you should always be who you feel most comfortable being but you also may need to come to terms with the fact that youve begun to walk different paths that no longer cross
maybe dont focus too much on him wanting someone to control because that might not really be true more likely he thought had a sweet chubby introverted gamer girl he wasnt worried about losing and now youre independent making more money than him youve gotten hot and probably have more male attention from dudes who never wouldve looked at you before and lets be real youve become an entirely different person than you were when you met he likely feels like he cant compete with the sort of guys you can get now 

how hes handling it isnt cool and its controlling but its also probably coming from a place of fear and desperationpanic that hes about to lose you the sad thing is if the fact that you two are now completely different people wasnt going to ruin your relationship how hes acting now certainly will its a selffulfilling prophecy but also the reality is you grew up and he didnt and thats okay but you two dont seem to be compatible anymore
honestly i thought it was him making fun of how everyone in the sub jumps to insane conclusions boy was i wrong
if it makes you feel better it wasnt you who selfsabotaged your marriage its pretty clear that something was very wrong in your marriage long before you ever said that as a happily married and monogamous man doesnt voraciously message everyone he knows looking for a hookup the second his wife indicates she might be okay with it a respectful husband doesnt ignore his wife communicating she isnt okay with it there were issues in your marriage that perhaps you were aware of or more likely werent prepared to actually face but the marriage was over a long time before you ever brought up another woman forgive yourself but also recognize you cant keep pretending this marriage is functional it isnt now and it wasnt before end it and set yourself free
if it makes you feel better it wasnt you who selfsabotaged your marriage its pretty clear that something was very wrong in your marriage long before you ever said that as a happily married and monogamous man doesnt voraciously message everyone he knows looking for a hookup the second his wife indicates she might be okay with it a respectful husband doesnt ignore his wife communicating she isnt okay with it there were issues in your marriage that perhaps you were aware of or more likely werent prepared to actually face but the marriage was over a long time before you ever brought up another woman
lmao of course were not 100 accurate but you said it yourself he was jerking you around why do you suddenly think thats going to change 

ive read your other comments youre either looking for a fight because youre upset this dude is ghosting or youre a troll because you havent responded to a single comment genuinely looking for an objective viewpoint youre just trying to argue which just makes me think if youre actually a real person really going through this dude has probably realized 10 year younger tang isnt worth crazy if youre a real person just recognize how batshit you must come off in real life if after 4 comments on the internet pretty much any man on here would be running from you good luck i do hope youre a troll because otherwise youre in for a very sad life if you dont grow up and fast
yeah you dont respect yourself why wouldnt he beg you to move in you demand nothing of him let him do whatever he wants never ask for more and here you are left alone at home while he goes and hangs out with the family who degrades you that he apparently doesnt even care enough about you to talk about you in front of them and you still want to plan elaborate and thoughtful birthday celebrations and get him a cake it makes total sense why a person like him would drool over finding a woman who cant even demand she be a part of his birthday celebration you think he would actually want a woman who calls him out on his shit of course not

be honest with yourself how much more do you let him get away with
elaborate what you mean and what you got mad about 

overall he may not have been ignoring you then but you also probably never said im done either so it may be a bit different this time
he read it because leaving someone on read sends a pretty clear message of i saw what you said i want you to know that i saw what you said and i want you to know that i am intentionally choosing not to reply to you 

in short he isnt interested why did you get mad at him perhaps you were right and this guy isnt right for you so all in all its probably a win for you both im the future just be a bit more careful when you tell someone youre done if you arent prepared to mean it its probably not a great idea to say it rarely do people play well into that sort of hot and cold
maybe youve learned some valuable lessons dont start things with roommates and if this is a trend maybe youre moving too fast in your relationships and progressing too intensely with the wrong sort of guy youll heal but itll take time dont worry about breaking down youre human and thats a beautiful thing you arent meant to be a robot
well just remember there is no waiting it out nothing will ever change until you do if youd realized this 45 years ago you couldve been married and successful by now but dont fret the second best time to make a change is now and thankfully you still have time for that

stop being complacent in your own life you have a choice here dont forget you do have power in your own life you arent helpless
but remember that is a choice you are actively making you can just as easily and quickly stop being a doormat as much as you dont want to say anything because youre scared and itll hurt or whatever other bullshit you keep telling yourself if you really asked yourself are you not already alone in your own marriage are you not causing yourself pain every day knowing your wife wants another mans affection wondering ifwhen shell cheat on you too

people often overlook the chronic pain they invite upon themselves because they think an acute pain will be worse but trust me it isnt id rather have a broken arm that will heal than deal with lupus every day until i die
good youve spent the past decade gaslighting yourself into ignoring or brushing off hundreds of red flags second guess everything and see your life and your marriage for what it really is not what you want it to be that way you can start to see just how much better you deserve and how much better you can get stop allowing yourself to be the backup
i mean really the only think you can be sure of is youre being a doormat and of course your wife isnt going to respect you you dont even respect yourself youre worth more than this man you have to know that
how can you lose something you never actually had

she never actually picked you she just did enough to fool you into thinking she had i dont even see my actual friends from college as much as you seem to have this guy in your lives thats a bit weird dont you think
heres to hoping he just doesnt care as much as some do care the vast majority really dont enjoy your newfound freedom
well because its decently obvious by the lets just figure things out as housemates rather than as a couple that he sees it as a relationshipbreaker because shes basically said as much how else would you take that comment
that is not what the joke implies not even close
im going to be honest everyone in this story is a few years too old to be making such shitty decisions esh because at the end of the day who youre friends with also reflects on you and its pretty abysmal that even after all this you werent the one to pull the plug here on the friendship she was 

having fun and partying is great and all but its practically asking for some dark shit to befall one of you by inviting multiple complete strangers into your hotel room in the middle of the night from the sidewalk in manhattan during a huge holiday if this is commonplace for you or your friends and based on your tone it appears to be you need to really selfreflect and see if this is where you think you should be at 25 years old
no i just dont feel the need to engage with victim blamers
lmao so if you think the wife is abusive its cool to just blame the victim the father of her abuse got it yeah bye now
id probably only ever see yelling as appropriate if someone is in actual danger or about to do something really destructive and you need to get their attention now i can also see people yelling at one another if extremely angryfed up about a lot of issues in their relationship that theyre just at the end of their rope for but in that example id probably say that either the person yelling has issues themselves or the person yelling is only doing so because they dont love themselves enough to walk away and instead think yelling will get through to an otherwise toxic partner 


ill go out on a limb and say your partner has anger issues though but regardless of if you or he is the problem and its him it isnt you this isnt a healthy relationship
fiance thankfully she wont need to worry about a divorce all she needs to do is separate finances and figure things out like housemates instead of a couple which conveniently is exactly what shes doing and im sure we can all guess exactly why
i think the point is unless you think he should be abusive he ultimately isnt in a position to allow his wife to do anything his wife is going to do what his wife is going to do shes her own person just like op is his own person and he cant force him to return home or forgive his sister see the issue youre acting as though the father can just snap his fingers and force everyone to fall in line to his will but thats not how people work his wife and the other kids are all independent people capable of their own decisions and actions theyll act as they see fit and its up to the people around them to react how they see fit the only very loose way to not allow his wife to treat op that way would be by saying if she keeps it up hes divorcing her 

and now were back to the beginning sentiment its unfair and unrealistic to expect this man to throw away his marriage and his relationship with his two other kids who actually live close to him to support ops beliefs who not only isnt cutting off his father but also lives across the country anyway
idk if i were you id probably just say i know why you beat up  thank you but please dont do it again i dont want assholes like that to ever take anything else from me again and then just give him a big hug
hey i agree fully im just saying when it comes to the father i understand why he isnt taking such a hard and fast approach now i think cheaters and wrong and i think the mom isnt handling things well at all but those two things are a bit unrelated
his mom told him that not his father i agree the mom sucks for how shes acting im just saying it makes sense that the dude isnt going to ruin his marriage and relationship with all his other kids when 1 op isnt cutting him off and 2 op is across the country everyone else is right there real life is more complicated than reddit acts
you should be able to get someone to do it for 5001k at most
where do you see the dad putting himself in the middle by doing anything other than existing again this is his daughter its ridiculous to expect him to throw away his marriage and his relationship with all of his other kids because you think that its not completely normal for parents to be way more forgiving than you would be to their own childs mistakes 

i repeat the world is not as black and white as you seem to think it is and we do not have all the information here to know any of the details of why everyone feels how they feel on this matter
she insinuated she does want kids so not sure why either of those should factor in if she wants kids its better to be with someone with a child than someone with undiagnosed and seemingly severe mental illness
eh i dont really think its fair to expect people to entirely blow up their marriage and their relationship with the rest of their kids to support the beliefs of someone else yeah i think cheaters suck but thats also his daughter it makes sense that even when your kid messes up you arent going to immediately exile them the world isnt as black and white as reddit acts like it is
it really isnt ive found partners at many ages you probably just arent looking in an effective place
instead of relying on apps join classes or workout groups with interests you have so you meet someone naturally
i mean its not actually that hard youre just being defeatist because it scares you to be alone for a year or so but thats perfectly normal be you 25 35 or 45 it takes time to find a good partner
honestly the mom of whoever called overstepped id get it if a day had passed but thats really overkill for an adult woman a few hours with no contact
just be prepared for your dad to turn the invite down hes right youre putting him in a nowin situation and more likely than not hes going to avoid pissing off his wife and kids that live close to him youre far away its way less hassle to turn you down than pick a fight with everyone near by i just want to prepare you for the most likely outcome
you should probably speak to a lawyer familiar with this you should start by getting a survey of your land so you know exactly what is yours and what isnt get up property line markers it shouldnt cost more than 1k for the surveyor and marking everything out with physical markers youre going to need a lawyer to know how to best indicate anyone past this point is officially trespassing because like everyone said youre taking on a huge liability and also putting yourself in a position where your land could be seized by the local government as youve allowed public access i know youre very pregnant but this needs to take priority because the last thing you want is to be recovering from birth and trying to figure out how to be a mom and then youre getting sued because someone on an atv died hitting a low hanging branch and the parents blame you for not trimming the trees or a million other examples that have actually happened and the property owners were held liable for your husband can hopefully take on some of the burden of sorting this as it will likely be a good amount of logistical sorting but itll be cheaper in the long run especially if this is meant to be your forever home put up signs at the entry points for now take photos and get a lawyer asap
im just going to pop in here to remind everyone that a person with ppp has an approximately 45 chance of either committing infanticide or suicide yes there is an elevated risk and yes these women absolutely need professional help do not treat women with this condition as ticking time bombs though
you were in a previously abusive relationship so you think as long as he isnt abusive hes great but thats not true you may need some therapy to reset what you should want in a man because this isnt it 

not abusive isnt even the bare minimum of being a half decent guy and it seems like thats really all you have as your standard right now understandable but love yourself more than that aim higher stop going for dudes with no ambition
hey women can have big feet too
because if youre in an accident where enough forcefriction is generated to pull off your shoes its just statistically more likely that that same force was lethal
if you dont leave just tell him you need to be more careful if this happens again im breaking up with you immediately i do not give a shit if its an accident or not if youre so incapable of controlling your dckk you cant keep it from sodomizing me i have 0 interest continuing our relationship am i crystal clear

and if it happens again then you leave
all that matters is it makes you feel good
i dont think dresses like this look good on anyone personally its too shapeless and is reminiscent of a trash bag to me but fashion should always be more about how you feel than what others think imo
youre never an ah for fighting for your kids never the sooner you learn that the better a father youll be
just for some actual facts as worms arent something parents tend to discuss at daycare 2030 of preschoolprimary school aged children will have a threadworm infection so definitely common enough that it isnt a surefire sign of neglect but not so common that the parents shouldnt be taking steps to prevent
because its not him forbidding her access to basic hygiene its just nature of being a parent to a newborn youd have to make the argument an infant is the abusive one as thats who is technically preventing the sil from showering regularly which is entirely ridiculous as a concept until you actually have a kid you clearly are ignorant to the fact that even two present and active parents will often not have time to shower for 2 days it isnt the husband directly saying i forbid you from showering which yeah is abusive its i have a newborn and my husband isnt being a present dad and i dont want to leave my kid alone or take him in the shower with me theyre fundamentally different im not going to argue with someone who has clearly never had a newborn or had the lowest maintenance newborn ever to know that its just plain normal and expected that when you have a newborn you just plain arent going to shower every day hell i dont have a newborn and im so busy with normal adulting tasks that i have often gone 2 days without a shower no one is abusing me its just ridiculous to conflate i dont have time to do x with someone is forcing me not to do x so yeah even by your definition this is not abuse 

i am not going to argue about this further because its clear you dont understand how common it is to be too busy to shower every day when you have a newborn its not a sign of abuse its just a sign of being a parent
you probably need to stop considering him your husband he said pretty clearly he no longer views you as a wife youre just the woman who gave birth to his kid you need to understand you have absolutely no leverage here and your husband hasnt divorced you yet simply because it would put his daughter through more trauma than she needs right now but you arent an equal partner youre on probation and if you dont start acting like it dont be surprised if he realizes youre trying to traumatize your daughter more by forcing her to be a puppet than he will traumatize her by putting her through a messy custody battle
op nicely but understand what your husband is really saying hes saying this if you ever want to see your daughter youre going to do everything exactly on my terms otherwise i will go through a court battle to completely strip you of the right to see your daughter i dont want to but if you force me to i will  know youre place and right now your place is egg donor not mother you need to earn the right to call yourself her mom
sure but none of that is abuse thats just not meeting your needs as a partner that isnt abuse again thats being a bad partner the two are very different and a lot of people conflate the two bad partner yes bad dad probably abusive nothing here indicates that
he was working regardless of the rest it isnt abusive to tell your partner to take a screaming infant and guest out of the room youre working in look i agree hes a crappy fatherpartner but the bottom line is nothing here is actually abuse its just being a shitty partner 

he isnt keeping her unwashed or sleep deprived being a new borderline single mom is whats keeping her unwashed and sleep deprived and for those who dont understand how parenthood works even two fully attentive parents will likely end up unwashed and sleep deprived in the first year of parenthood its just what happens its not abuse its not neglect its what you sign up for when you have a kid yeah shes doing more than she should but thats different from abuse
neglecting the child yes neglecting the needs of your partner especially while youre working like the guy was in this story no youre just a poor partner at worst believe it or not shes a fully grown adult and capable of taking care of herself and isnt fully reliant on a man like an infant may be for care abuse is definitely the wrong word here with the information presented please stop pushing for such a strong word to be watered down that only hurts actual abuse victims in the long run again not all bad partners are abusive partners hes a bad partner no info indicating hes an abusive one
did i miss anything actually funny happening looks like he just walked by them carefully
shes 23 shes dating a 37 year old how reliable do you really think either of them are going to be at caring for 2 young kids shes going to be stuck in the hotel room earning her free vacation there isnt much other reason 37 year olds date 23 year olds and they certainly dont do it because said 23 year old is practically a mom whatever the fuck that means
no it isnt weird at all have you ever had a newborn sometimes youre so desperate for adult interaction youll hold up the mailman thats not a sign of abuse thats a sign of parenthood especially parenthood with a rather absent partner
at the end of the day that was his decision not to actually pursue any means of getting the money back if heyour step sis were unwilling to even try to get the money back from the actual person who stole it theyve pretty much lost the right to even ask anyone else to provide it
i think jumping to clearly an abuser because hes a bad partner is a stretch hes a bad partner and bad father for sure but this is another example of bad person  abusive person
hey also depends on the kind of partner youre trying to attract too
hopefully this has revealed to you a truth about your husband youll stop ignoring as based on your previous comments this behaviorside of him is nothing new what example are you setting for your son by tolerating this behavior
you probably need to think about the grander scheme of your marriage when you find a place to stay because this doesnt sound like a good place for you at all
understood is in quotes so op clearly doesnt actually feel like he understands you can say you understand and still not actually take the action required to back that up the likely fact is in order to change the agreement his dad may need to go to court and his mom may not let him go so easily if his dad isnt willing to deal with thatsimply isnt willing to be ops full time guardian understanding or not op is 14 years old and really doesnt have much of a choice on where he lives

which sucks but hes 14 he cant just move out
is that actually an option though ops father called him selfish so perhaps he wont let him move in full time not only that it may require a custody battle for that to actually happen if the mom wanted to put up a fight about it
if you do consider her a friend id send in a text message so you have this in writing if she goes off the deep end something you the effect of hey name im sorry i made you feel worse in an already tough time for you im happy to help you out but i need to be clear about a few things i have no interest in you romantically or sexually i consider you a friend and nothing more i want to be really clear that you dont have to worry about my having any ulterior motives because that simply isnt how i see you and im not comfortable with you implying otherwise while youre living at my place that being said while im happy to give you a place to crash while you get back on your feet i am also not comfortable fully supporting you youll need to take care of food and anything else you need on your own if you havent been paid in 5 weeks thats illegal and you need to talk your boss or file a complaint but im sure im not the only person in your support network so if you need to youll need to lean on more than just me ive been busy lately so im going to continue taking advantage of part of my compensation at work since the food is better than anything i can cook but youre more than welcome to stock the fridge with whatever you want and i wont take any of it if you feel uncomfortable staying with me for whatever reason please dont feel obligated and be upset if you want to stay with someone else but if you do plan to stay moving forward we need to be clear on boundaries i dont want any implications im trying to get with you and you need to start providing the basics for yourself im only here to give you a place to stay nothing more
fam stop resenting him and start resenting yourself because youre the problem here you ten respecting yourself at all this man has no loyalty to you stop spending time on someone who has told you he isnt loyal
im pretty sure he meant you dont get paid every day not that you dont get paid when the company tells you
hey ultimately that might be what ends up happening but i think people sometimes underestimate how difficult it is to connect with that one person who fits all the criteria especially as a 32 year old new father if he doesnt even have time to hang out with existing friends alone its pretty unlikely he will have time to find and vet random people who are okay with hanging out with a baby especially because unfortunately there is a higher chance of someone any gender biting at the gambit to hang out with a man with an infant potentially being not suitable to have around said infant 

we like to say that you should wait around and not take shit and only surround yourselves with the people who are perfectly suited for you but if thats your attitude you also need to be prepared to simply end up alone which when youre a new dad newly in your 30s which is definitely a shock for plenty of people myself included it sucked no longer being in your 20s and old and lost touch with a lot of old friends being alone can be really isolating and isnt actually as healthy advice as you think 

tldr yes the advice of find friends who are okay with being a dad is great but it fails to consider just how hard that process often is when youre a brand new dad
i am assuming 500 is a lot less than a hotel wouldve cost for the time you stayed 

in light of that id probably say something to the effect of the full day sounds awesome i am really sorry but right now i only have enough room in our savings for the half day thats my fault for not specifying im hoping we get a second income source within the next few months or else were really going to need to figure out some different moves and if youre willing to wait for our thanks until we have a steady income id be happy to set up the full day but otherwise if you do want the full day and are willing to pay the difference i can send over a gift card for the amount and let you decide if you would like to upgrade just let me know im really thankful you let us stay with you and want to make sure you know how grateful i am
a completely normal and healthy one lmao believe it or not its an extremely unhealthy mentality to have that close family should leave each other high and dry for what amounts to no really good reason reddit is actually pretty toxic in the other direction with family owes you nothing and expect to do everything 100 on your own or else youre a toxic failure we have family for a reason and quite frankly its an extremely eurocentric view that many cultures would have a serious issue with family helps family family shows up for family and honestly outside of redditextenuating circumstances if your family cant rely on you to follow through that says more about you than your family 

again if this were an issue shouldve been raised when he was asked to be the best man the brother is going to be close enough where if anything happens hell just be able to leave its a local wedding he leaves them alone for work he can leave them alone to be the best man he agreed to
yeah you generally speaking do get to expect your brother who agreed to be your best man at your child free wedding follows through he absolutely can decide not to but the brother is the asshole not op its fine to not expect family to bend over backwards and set themselves on fire to keep you warm but reddit has gone way too far in the opposite direction family does owe family some grace especially if no abuse or other factors are at play these are normal siblings the brother would 10000 be an asshole for dropping out because he cant be away from his wife and kid for half a day especially when he agreed knowing it was a child free wedding and likely knowing the intimate details of why its childfree
most og influencers actually worked as well you can be serious about something and still understand you also cant leech off other people i mean hell johnny depp only became an actor because he wanted to finance his music career
hes ops best man presumably he was aware of the no child wedding for a long time he would absolutely be an ah to back out of a commitment made understanding the rules of the commitment just because hes being held to those rules not only would he be an ah to op hes also be being an ah to his kid as our society is by and large moving away from tolerating overgrown toddlers and mommas boys
correct but as i said look at things from kates perspective how would she know that jamie wanted op there so he could propose she couldnt all she saw was jamie begging for op to attend his birthday party and with all the other info she had thats definitely going to breed insecurity in most people jealousy is a human emotion and as much as it would be nice to tell her to get over it i see why she felt the way she did
i mean not really look at literally every female celebrity ever they were hot before and theyre hot now honestly id argue most looked better without the surgery its definitely not accurate to say hotter more likely its just different its all about self perception sometimes 

and yeah but also if she looked how she did but was a horrid person she wouldnt be with him either so it isnt just looks attraction is important but its not everything im sure she knows that its different if she thought thats the only reason her husband is with her of course
before you dig yourself into too deep of a hole she said shes struggled with this even as a teen meaning the surgery isnt what made her the hot one she always was she just had surgery to make herself feel better about how she looked but clearly shes always been beautiful to everyone around her even without the surgery and that friends is body dysmorphia in a nutshell
it probably doesnt help that jamie and op do have so much more than just him finding her attractive theyre really good friends to the point where he was begging op to rearrange her schedule to be at the party im not saying hes in love with her at all but from the perspective of kate i understand where the insecurities lie you cant just write it off as physical attraction in the moment and nothing more they have an emotional bond as well now i know well enough that you can be friends with someone and not want to marry them but putting yourself in kates shoes it can be hard to say that confidently i feel for op though it sucks to lose friends for something you cant control
fair enough you date enough people unfortunately youll encounter plenty of toxic ones definitely do not make this right though she either needs to come to her senses which i suspect she will at some point especially if you dont chase after her or she wont in which case you can decide if thats really the sort of trait you want in a partner good luck you did nothing wrong though btw never lend money you arent willing to lose
nah 24 is definitely an age where its fair to expect a person be mature and responsibly by shes been out of college for 23 years at this point she isnt a freshman in college thats definitely not normal behavior even for a 24 year old
that isnt really true plenty of people are willing to bail their partners out now are they obligated to no but dont imply that asking your partner for any financial help automatically is unhealthy
yeah and a reminder of your friends should understand if you cant contribute 1k dinners youre an awesome person and a true friend will be happy to have your company and whatever it is you can contribute thats in your budget i had a lot of friends way wealthier than me at that age there was never an expectation i had to keep up
well dresses makeup the bachelorette party spa day theres lots of things you could contribute that would be around that much
tbf if you have a pattern of ending up with immature women its possible that regardless of the age youre being attracted by traits that go hand in hand with this sort of immaturity
i am pretty sure a lot of 24 year olds are significantly more mature than this especially ones who have educationsjobs and friends are getting married
 why would he offer to pay for a night out he wasnt even at i get we freak at age gaps but 24 and 32 are both adults that are at approximately the same life stage this isnt about age as much about 1 dont lend money youre not willing to lose and 2 always check your bank account
so i want to address both sides of this the first is your friend lied to you and thats definitely problematic i dont really think testing people is ever a great tactic that said hes a friend not a lover and you dont necessarily need to be able to have the same level of trust in a friend as you would your wife so if you decide to keep being friends with him after this simply make sure you do so with caution and a modicum of distance put between you two on anything of importance i understand that may be controversial but 1 its difficult to make friends once youre older and have a family and 2 if all of us are honest we have or at least have had plenty of friends that were good to go to lunch or a concert with but you would never call if you needed a place to stay or something huge 

now onto his side of things hes a 29 year old male yes there are some dudes who will be fine going on a stroller walk but the reality is most guys arent hell id probably guess most dudes with kids wouldnt even want to do that as a hang out theyre going to want to have fun go to a bar watch a game play pool or whatever that activity is im not saying its going to involve drugs or blacking out but you probably also need to understand that in order to maintain friendships you need to retain your identity as okstill179 first and loving father second a lot of women also struggle with this balance so dont be alarmed or feel weird about it make sure youre taking time to go and just be you with your friends and make sure youre not making you and your infant a package deal most single 20s guys just arent going to want a kid involved and i definitely empathize it may mean its a few months till you and your wife find that balance so just ask for some patience but remember that the balance is important to find especially if realistically you want to be able to maintain friendships
she said she sold it at a profit but so its an investment are you telling me you should sell your stocks at what you paid for it even if theyre worth double thats just stupid
that is what happens when youre the waitress at a table you come back multiple times
ok if thats what you mean then i understand that thats fair to expect once ownership has changed hands
youre aware that you only deem op an ah because you want the brother to be able to continue to take advantage right because an eviction wouldve been inevitable unless you think he shouldve been allowed to take advantage as nauseam and at that point the difference between op serving him with an eviction and the new owner is its way harder to pressure a stranger than family so why do you really think the eviction is an ah move

genuinely asking btw because i get what people are saying but i dont think they realize what that really would mean
fair enough but no and i think a lot of people are really not understanding its extremely common that rented apartments dont have top of the line run your shower max temp for hours at a time water heaters that would be required for 56 people to get hot showers i mean hell my old apartment i alone couldnt take a shower longer than 15 minutes without getting cold water thats just usually how it is when you rent you dont get unlimited hot water you have to plan your showers you deal with it
a quick common sense search also tells you 3 is a lot less than 612
its very obvious you think renting a home is the same as owning and it simply is not when you finally do own a home maybe youll understand until then dont comment on what you clearly dont understand
thats simply not true if that were actually true developers builders property managers etc would never go bankrupt but they 100 do that would mean these people never get sued never had to evict anyone never have any damages ot gone a month without rent theres absolutely a risk just because someone is typically smart enough not to overextend themselves to the point where they cant float the additional costs does not mean there is no risk it just shows your ignorance on the costs involved in running a business and owning a home to think there isnt if there was no risk everyone would be a landlord but they arent why because theres risk
