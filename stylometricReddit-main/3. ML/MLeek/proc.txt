someone has sent me a video of you during a party and now im really concerned about your safety with the people you hang out with i need to ask you some questions so i can know youre safe now

id say that id have to

it seems very obvious to me that whoever sent you this video intended to shame your bf and bully him further the first thing you need to do is be clear it did not work your concern needs to be for his safety and your clear communication needs to be that nothing he does no matter how drunk he gets validates or excuses people treating him this way

do not be the tool of his bullies be clear that his safety from abusers is your only concern if he says he is stays the fuck away from those people tell him youre glad and youre proud of him ask if he wants to talk about it any further dont demand the only answer you need is that he is currently safe from danger and abuse
if its selfimposed then its not a ruleagreement with your partner its a personal choice you would make for yourself with any partner 

but to be entirely honest as a bisexual woman id still probably avoid getting too deeply involved even if you swore up and down it was entirely personal and your partner didnt even care because it just reflects that common attitude that sex between women isnt real sex

youre entitled to a personal choice other people can have personal feelings about that choice
consigned 

as a bisexual woman this implies to me that any sex and connection im having with the woman is lesser than purely on the basis of my gendergenitals 

a personal choice is fine and all  i have lived much of my adult life with only one penis but it was never a policy it was just who was in the mix at the time  and we cannot pretend these sorts of attitudes towards sex that doesnt involve a penis exist in a magic little bubble they exist in a context that id rather not operate in
no the mother would likely need to be extremely illmalnourished to begin with in order to end a pregnancy this way with any reliability

two weeks of deprivation would be totally insufficient for most reasonably healthy adult women
young wolves become way more vocal yipping and growling in ways that dont appear to be very communicative when the rest of the pack is ostracizing them for poor social graces or bullying behaviours

but human beings arent wolves either
okay that explains the problem more clearly but you still need to stop trying to solve it for him

tell him the actual problem for you hes shown you a plan but that plan is not happening you are paying for him but he is not being honest or accountable to you hes loosing your trust and your respect

stop trying to tell him how to solve it and trying to fix it for him put it back on him hes damaging the relationship being dishonest with you and being dependant on you financially its not acceptable its going to end the relationship maybe not tomorrow but eventually you will be happier and healthier without him so you choose that any sane person would

dont tell him exactly how to fix it remind him youve given him plenty of suggestions and you now expect him to fix this problem not continue to make it yours 

if that direct talk about consequences and boundaries does not get get him moving on this within a few days start planning to be rid of him if the problem is him and hes choosing to keep those problems and make them yours too then you have to solve your real problem by getting rid of him
hes told you he doesnt want help hes shown you his plan you can disagree but if he had a plan and hes working it you need to stop pressuring him to make a better one its his plan 

and he may be right about what the limits of the charitycouncil powers are and its not your business in the least if he doesnt want to ask his parents for help  

if hes paying his obligations to the shared home then you need to let him carry his personal burden the way he chooses too and speak for yourself speaking for yourself can look like i dont have the bandwidth the listen to these complaintsstress right now or even i find it hurtful you continue to complain at me but will not entertain any of the suggestions ive given you at all speak for your own feelings stop trying to fix the situation for him its his

if hes not paying his agreed on share of your shared home then you need to consider that this isnt a safe person for you to live with because he expects you to carry his burdens without having to listen to you or consider your feelings or perspectives at all
this it makes me so mad when kids are taught this was the highest of high art and was inaccessible or highbrow rj literally opens with a bunch of teenage buddies making a rape joke a rape pun but so many teachers just swan on past that
i was confused at first too then i remembered women are always bad and always to blame
youre probably incompatible this isnt what you want

you can and should bring up the idea of separate bedrooms but its concerning that he doesnt seem to recognize that option
dude the part that made this really bad sex was the part where you made it her job to take care of your feelings afterwards no hook up wants to be your therapist or your coach 

the fact you are continuing to think it would appreciate to try and demand more of her time and attention is unhinged

go watch some educational videos on performing oral sex and with the next woman ask her what she likes and make sure she orgasms before your penis gets involved 

leave this woman alone as she has clearly told you too

you are not owed any amount of chances she is owed the basic respect of you not contacting her anymore 

dont be a creepy demanding child if you showed up at my house in this situation id call the cops and let them explain to you that i will not be speaking with your further
nothing but me man me use big tool go vroom

statistically women are safer drivers by every metric on a average women are just as capable as men of spacial reasoning but they dont overrate their skills by as much take fewer risks and can more accurately assess the risks women ding cars and crack fenders men kill people 

from a pure probability pov if you want to live let a woman drive
if you dont want to be in an open relationship its time to leave this one because that is the best case scenario the best case scenario is that he wants a transparent and ethical open relationship from there it only get worse 

dont get stressed out just admit you want monogamy just monogamy nothing else if he doesnt agree fully and directly in language you can rely on let it be over
your bf just put you in the be my pretty lady not a human being box 

it would be slightly different if he had simply said hed prefer you not fart around him when it was avoidable  and because we are human he knows it is not perfectly avoidable  as just a personal preference the fact he connected it to being ladylike is gross and demeaning and very very stupid
its funny they think rich men werent hoarding women before

you know its just that less of you plebeians die young right most of you were not gonna be landed gentry you were not going to be assigned a buxom teenager you were not likely to be master or meritorious in 1020 or 1620 or 1820 either   

youre just angry you dont have a woman an assigned woman you can punch down at no matter how low you are
i always wonder if they think small children in guatemala are just failing to manifest food and clean drinking water like if systemic issues dont exist then there are entire nations causing famine with all their negative self talk
fit of rage is a phrase which should only ever be associated with an ex 

you dont have to be perfect to deserve not to be absurd that is a lie abusers love to tell to keep you trapped
thank you for explaining why this might be a deterrent it seemed like a very easy hoop to jump through to me for someone with malicious intent who wanted to create a false sense of security
i am opposed to engaging with people who exhibit a behaviour i have found to be directly connected with negatively resentment and even other controlling behaviours

also i am woman who largely but not exclusively dates men  

in my experience men who start off with this demand quickly have other demands and accusations 

i have strategies to keep myself safe this is not one of them

exactly the opposite i guess my strategy is too avoid men who exhibit a behaviour that doesnt make me feel safe and respected
your husband turned you into his private porn star without telling you about it he felt entitled to doing so without your formal consent and is now demanding a formal request they be deleted

i doubt your husband is a compete fucking moron he was aware or should have reasonably assumed that you believed the videos were deleted and that is what you wanted he should not have felt entitled to them in this way and trying to make you the bad guy who demands he give up something he never should have taken without explicit permission is revolting

you are underreacting 

it feels like an invasion because it was 

tell him to delete them 

tell him he fucked up royally by behaving entitled to these videos without a transparent conversation at very least you should express deep disappointment with his judgment
hes 32

hes not confused about pets he doesnt need it explained to him this is who he wants to be the asshole who treats your dog poorly and enjoys its fear 

he sees you only as a servant to his future baby not as a person balancing her loves and needs 

and people who are jealous of pet are often jealous of babies as well 

dont keep such an open mind your brain falls right out this is exactly what it looks like
if trust is broken dont date her

testing her is just demeaning yourself in a shitty relationship that already isnt working

you were manipulative you were toxic you decided to stay in a relationship you shouldnt have and used that as excuse to practice being a bad person
i dont understand how this strategy is protecting someone from a trafficker the trafficker is usually real local people arent they it doesnt seem like it would have helped the victim in that article
youre mistaking consequences for cant do it

you absolutely can break a contract and if it was a legal one there might be consequences for doing so 

but scientology cannot enforce their a billionyear contract in court and you cannot use the law to force your partner back into the marital home or bed if they dont want to be there
yeah im fine with that youd be unmatched not an issue for me what reason a person concocts at that point
yeah ask for a facetime first and okay but ask me to buy todays newspaper or make some weird hand signs often within the first day of matching just gtfo

i used to do it without fail these people were all bitter resentful and a bit controlling
he knows how you feel he doesnt care he feels entitled to placing this pressure on you he thinks you should preform this way for him

youre incompatible

and hes a bully

dont stay with him

but since youre going to anyways say this comments about my femininity skirts and makeup need to stop youve cross the line from expressing a preference to being really hurtful if you care about not hurting me you will stop if you care more about what i wear then how i feel we will break up maybe not tomorrow maybe not right away but itll happen if you dont stop hurting me
this it has to be really extreme before i assume they were actively trying to be deceptive im bad at reading photos 

im far more annoyed by men who lie outrageously about their height ive happily dated men who are shorter than me and secure about it dont want to date a person who isnt comfortable in the height difference
i dont know if youre joking but when someone does this to me i immediately unmatch my photos are current and authentic and i use to comply but i have never had a positive interaction when i did 

a person who comes at me from this kind of place of bitterness and control is not someone i will continue to speak with

dating is risky and often disappointing but if all youre bringing into is distrust and anger i want none of it
then be honest with your own needs and walk away 

i didnt mean to imply he needs to regret or feel ashamed only that people who have enjoyed casual sex in the past are still capable of choosing monogamy and being faithful in my experience they are often better at it because of the lack of fomo
youre not compatible 

he could be just as capable of commitment and monogamy as any man who ever lived but it doesnt matter if you cannot believe that 

if youve lost trust this is over 

you should date the person in front of you not their every past choice or the person youd hope they could become you need to be able to believe what they say about their current choices and values if you cannot be happy with that person today be honest and bow out
because freedom
the republicans are right and royally fucked

they have cultivated a delusional base that is not capable of selecting a candidate who can win a general 

running to trumps right is the smart way to get the nom and then to in loose the popular vote again and probably the election
you just know this man watches nothing but hard core anal porn and pimple popping videos and is in deep denial about his desire to be pegged
because its not about attraction

like rape the power is the point the violation is what they want 

they are just exerting power in a public place all public spaces belong to men in this persons mind women just walk through them women in mens spaces get what they deserve 

ive a had few men try to genuinely compliment me you can tell the difference and no its not that they are chads they have said shit like cool hat awesome vibe or wish i was going to whatever party youre headed too 

its really not that hard to compliment a stranger stand still do not move into their space compliment a choice not a innate thing about their body allow the interaction to end right then easy
i disagree with your premise 

the divorce rate doesnt speak to people who want to end it over the smallest thing most people i know who divorced worked damn hard sincerely to avoid it the people i know whove been married 10 years went through periods where they had to do that work too 

assuming every divorce is a personal failure is a lingering stigma not a reality 

and how can we say the divorce rate is high when were comparing it to a time when it was practically financially and often legally impossible to divorce not to mention the stigma do we really think marriages were twice as healthy and happy in 1950 as they were in 1990 or that they were 3x more blissful that people were really freely consenting to stay married more often even if your own family history was happy enough most of us can ask our grandmothers about the women she knew and be quickly disabused of that notion

and why in earth do you think people who dont want to marry not marrying is a problem
of course he did

my ex and his family were appalled that months after he dumped me with a bit of bonus cruelty i did not come to care for him during his unexpected surgery as i had during the first eight of them you see he had thought he was healthy now so he no longer needed me he had blamed me for stalling his life but once he was in need again i was a monster for not actually putting my life on pause again to care for him

the mind boggles
in other words people who are less likely to want commitment and compromise at that stage of their lives are less likely to work towards commitment and compromise at that stage of their lives
and im disagreeing it seems very obvious to me that is not many people that is a minority the majority are inclined to stay longer than they really should and keep working 

more importantly its the right outcome thats the would i want to live in if someone has one foot out the door give em a shove problem solved
hah id say they dont actually understand consent

they just glom on to buzzwords to try and make their positions sound modern and palatable its like when they talk about the loneliness epidemic and mens mental health stigma and youre nodding along because yes real issues but then you realize they are actually suggesting the government gift these men sex slaves to solve  the problem
i agree the only reasons i can see to get married today is if you believe its a religious sacrament terrifying to me but ok or if being married provides better protection for the children and their rights where you live otherwise dont get it very expensive party and pointless peice of paper for me
i cannot comprehend this attitude towards people its so objectively and observably false 

most people the vast majority keep working at preserving a relationship for months or years after it becomes objectively clear it should probably end and both parties would be happier and healthier we all know these people we have mostly been these people 

i looked back in my life and know where i should have had a zero tolerance policy lying about money throwing things in anger being mean to waiters 

healthier conflict resolution skills often contribute to relationships coming to an end because healthy approaches to adversity and conflict include fundamentally changing the terms of the relationship agreement or even ending it
i work very hard to look like im ignoring everyone who is hollering for my attention in public i always listen very closely for a few seconds before deciding if im going to engage and usually i will not if youre asking for directions or warning about construction sure if its unclear in those few seconds what youre up too i assume its no good and keep walking
thats nice

legally speaking if there is going to be marriage there must be divorce without any outside authority judging whether or not the reasons are good enough anything else in unjust to everyone 

no fault is a term of art for the kind of separation youre talking about  where no one but one or both of the two people in the marriage gets to decide its over the term exists because there was a and time and place recently and currently where they wasis not the case it doesnt mean everyone is a blameless little angel
hes certainly expressed the willingness to blame the woman when he rapes her if he sees the opportunity
this seems to be connected to new movement in the manosphere against no fault divorce she consented to be mine and she is not entitled to withdraw that consent for any reason which means its not actually consent at all so the law is wrong when it gives her the ability to leave the marriage

the problem with the divorce rate in their minds is the same problem as the false accusation rape hysteria they dont want women to be able to withdraw anything they interpreted as consent to their supremacy they want to trap one and not have to worry again about being worthy or of a partnership
this guy knows with 100 certainty that no woman has ever enjoyed herself with him and never will
motherhood is the best thing when it serves them personally or their political goals 

the like motherhood as an ideal not as an occupation that might not directly benefit them 

the fact that an actual person they have to interact with may be doing the work of being a parent while female is inherently distasteful
i think it should be a goal daily on a personal level  ignore them live your life 

but beyond the personal sphere we cannot afford to ignore them not only do the extreme members try to kill us with guns and with legislation but the shepherds are leading more and more young men to the slaughter on a societal and political level they cannot be ignored they want women subjugated and their strategy relies are making more and more men desperate entitled ill or angry enough to support that cause  on the false promise that access to an unhappy subjugated women will make them happy and that they will all of course be found deserving and meritorious by the new patriarchy
its a bad habit and she needs to stop

could it mean shes not over him sure but a bit more likely is that shes picking at the scab rerunning conversations in her head and basically letting this wound fester

she cant build a new healthy relationship unless she recognizes this behaviour is selfdestructive just cause lots of people do it especially just every once in a while and not weekly doesnt mean it okay

in the end id be more concerned that its been two years and they havent formalized the divorce
you need to go see what you can swing with work

look that kind of response is unkind its not crazy for your partner to ask you to commit to spending some vacation time with them or to ask you to confirm those plans in june for july you may not mean to be jerking her around or telling her shes not a priority or embarrassing her in front of her friends but the result of that kind of response can rationally be all those things 

if you cannot take vacation then figure out when you can and calendarize it now 

youre working too much regardless of what else is going on here in this relationship your work life balance sounds like complete shit right now and a reasonable partner will become frustrated by that
ask him what his plan is for his agreed on portion of the bills are if he is out of working for a month or 3 months or more

thats the question you need to ask him and make it clear you have not agreed to covering all the finances for an indeterminate length of time he needs a plan to meet his obligations he needs to communicate that plan to you

stop trying to fix the job search issue for him start expecting him to address your very reasonable fears and boundaries like a reasonable person 

its not your job to find him a job

its his his to explain to you how he is going to meet his responsibilities once this contract ends its not totally crazy to be looking forward to job searching after his contact ends but if that is his plan he needs to tell you he has enough cushion to make it happen you are not his safety net you just moved in together that is not a kind or reasonable expectation of you
i didnt want a better life for the women
just tell him the truth its not working for you 

this daily texting is awkward and confusing you dont want to continue it you cant build a serious connection like this its hard to even build a friendship tell him you want to stop wish him well 

block him when he doesnt reply with grace
its not fair

its obviously abusive behaviour

youre not in an ethically nonmonogamous relationships youre in an emotionally abusive one
i honestly dont know how women have sex with men in some states these days at all i love sex but it seems unnecessarily risky

but at least now you know he wasnt getting better he just has a little while where he had fewer reasons to be utter shit now he has a new  reason to be a selfish abusive peace of shit and hes going all in on it 

you dont need a perfect excuse but his transparent attempts to bully manipulate and shame you into silencing your own feelings and needs are pretty damn perfect as valid reasons to dump a person goes

hes gonna call you selfish and stubborn if you were paying his rent and donating a kidney he just wants to get his way it has nothing to do with reality
one of my few boundaries in my open relationship is that neither of us sleep with who is not prochoice even though protection is always used as well

i may stay in the relationship with someone else being pregnant but i wouldnt try to force a polycule or triad because she got pregnant the two of them may have a relationship as coparents and that would remain separate from my relationship as partner or friend with either of them

but you really shouldnt stay in this relationship

he is manipulative and emotionally abusive and if he actually uttered the words small inconvenience to refer to his own child i might take a baseball bat to his bits before i go
there is nothing here but to live and learn

people are more than just toys or experiences they are people first and foremost dont think because youre less experience its okay to treat someone who isnt openly transparently consenting like a toy or a fun ride its still really important to talk about what you want dont make assumptions about what they want or feel

even if you had watched the movie he may still have ended up connecting with and choosing someone else so dont follow that road in your head to silly places

its totally normal and healthy to have fantasies but stop fixating on this guy 

just keep dating 

use your experience to inform your future choices
this is just not a person to engage with the rest is unknowable you can know you were right to get away from her

there is nothing to learn here except that you were right eventually good for you

but the term youre looking for is serial monogamist or even cowardly little shit sociopath is a stretch based on what youve given here and monkey brancher is from incelpua land with their notoriously terrible understanding of evolutionary psychology if you dont want to be associated with misogyny dont use their buzzwords you can be plenty angry with one shitty person who happens to be a woman without buying into the resentful bullshit that will damage your relationships with all women

file this under shitty person is shitty and move on closure happens when you stop caring why shitty is shitty and just be glad to be staying away from it
youre incompatible

also pair bonding is just a profound misunderstanding misogynists have about birds that they have used as an excuse to shame women if anything human beings can actually get better at forming intimate relationships with more healthy practice at it

but that doesnt matter here youre not compatible with her and thats okay you dont trust her dont date someone you dont trust also dont be a controlling twat but that is a seperate issue it just has nothing to do with her cognitive or neurochemical ability to create and maintain partnerships in her own life
a yellow flag but not a red one

at three months you should be a little bit skeptical of anyones report of their crazyabuse ex

but reactive abuse is a very real thing the key word is react people are not at thier best when facing frequent abuse they snap they lash out they do crazy toxic things in reaction to being abused

mutual abuse is rare

reactive abuse is common and lots of abusers try to push their victims to react so they can blameshift and gaslight the victim into thinking its their fault 

keep your eyes and ears open but no not an immediate red flag
improve first then communicate to him the exact steps you are taking

telling him before youve even started the work will feel like youre making an excuse like youre asking him to tolerate it or worse solve it for you and even worse still that might actually be on some level what youre trying to do  get his acceptance and validation make excuses not changes

so change first do the soul searching pick some strategies identify a few small steps you need to take and maybe one or two big ones maybe book a session or two with a counsellor then share with him what you are doing to solve your problem
no

the two things arent related in that way 

the national pp federation is restructuring to support statelevel decision making better and to developing more telehealth the former ceo was there for 12 years new one has been in place for about 3 i dont think anyone who understands ngo life cycle would find this all that shocking sad for the individuals involved absolutely also totally sane leadership
wont lie to you that was all pretty damn bad 

the point now is to get your head on straight so you dont make similar mistakes when youre hurting or in pain in the future thats the best way to make amends and to rebuild your trust in yourself
get back to the hustle and get your financial independence back

and dont be so hard on yourself

you entered into an arrangement with someone you knew was paying you for sex like a lot of young people you came to realize just what that all meant it would have been rational to assume she was paying others as well looking back you can probably identify some places where you should have said no thank you or suggested she work with another trainer but she was probably far more skilled at pushing past boundaries than you were at expressing them

get yourself out safely and rebuild and maybe an sti check crash on a friends couch for a bit if you need too there is nothing wrong with you its a learning experience about setting boundaries listening to your own instincts and avoiding manipulators its one a frightening number of women of all races go through and youll make it through it too
i keep on validating disapointment and saddness 

you keep saying you get it but then immediately insisting on more angry assumptions and accusations of wrongdoing against her so you dont seem to be getting the discretion

good luck
youre becoming absurd in an attempt to hold on to your anger with her and find wrongdoing 

you met her in midmarch its now almost the end of may thats a very normal range of time for people to connect sincerely but for ones to realize its not going to work out
yes that was unkind but shes entitled to her belief and if she doesnt believe he can handle it then shes right to end it regardless of what he thinks of his own capacity i do not trust youre capable of meeting my needs
would be more accurate but its the same thing and valid its suboptimal phrasing but she appears to have owned her choices no problem 

but seriously his behaviour here is reminding me why 29 is my absolute floor im inclined to agree with her assessment
most people experience validation from relationships of all kinds 

youre looking for a reason to make her the bad guy because she disappointed you but you dont have a good one she just disappointed you because she didnt want what you wanted
the assumption she didnt tell you just about as soon as she figured it out herself is the bitter and entitled bullshit i mean those are the kinds of negative thoughts you need to stop indulging in
while i think its inappropriate he didnt tell you if he never replied its not that weird that he kept it to himself 

a lot of people especially men do not like to admit they are being harassed and it is harassment it may be lowkey but it is that 

i dont block the man who sends me these sorts of texts because a i worry if he realizes hes blocked he may escalate and b i want to have a record of the behaviour in case he ever does escalate its not a comfortable thing to tell a new partner about but i always do
yeah but youre letting these thoughts fester we all have passing thoughts after a break up that are are negative and irrational you have to let them go not ponder them further 

they wont support you being happy or kind in the future so drop that bullshit
be disappointed not irrationally bitter and entitled
you werent lied too

you were given the best truth as she had it to give you as she realized what she wanted more clearly she told you 

the fact you are trying to round up an incompatibility her own needs in a more serious relationship and her very open and direct communication with you into a lie and a betrayal is a huge part of why youre not emotionally mature enough to be dating older women 

this is how healthy older people date its fun for a bit if youre basically compatible but it will likely end quickly once they decide its not longterm
so you meet a grownass woman who is totally clear with you shes not ready for anything serious you date for a few months and she decides its not gonna work for her longterm then she tells you so plainly and directly

and you still accuse her of using you or gameplaying 

she just told you what she wanted and you werent it thats sad but not a betrayal 

that was successful communication you had a good time for a while you had some basic compatibility but once she knew it wasnt for her she told you

maybe the problem isnt your income or the age range maybe the problem is you need to learn to handle rejection most connections with anyone of any age are gonna just not quite work out
just stop texting him entirely

you rejected him when you rejected his intensity and talk about future wifey that was rejecting him you didnt want what he wanted and thats okay it was the right thing to do

let it be a rejection and let it be over
then your marriage is over

youve decided it

youre just trying to bully her into being the one who says it out loud it may take years but eventually she will and youll tell yourself your hands are clean but they are not 

what you are doing is cowardly and manipulative at least as shitty as anything youve accused her of here

if you actually want to be married stop this bullshit and go talk to a counsellor together
youre the one who described actively threatening the relationship

whats worse you dont even mean it you dont want to divorce right so youre just being manipulative and hurtful when you speak that way to her at least shes being honest with you about her unhappiness 

so why dont you shit or get off the pot stop making it all her job to leave your ass 

the rank hypocrisy is shocking you sound like a teenager not a 35yearold

either get a marriage counsellor involved to help you both do better you yes you really need to do a lot better than this or stop being such a little shit and hire a lawyer yourself
just let him avoid you its fine for him to avoid you

this is resolved just fine 

stop trying to pursue the fwbcasual fling with him he is not equippedinterested in that dont get bent outta shape that a 22yearold cant explain his boundaries and emotional needs clearly just take the damn hint that hes not looking for what youre looking for and stop trying to get what you want outta him 

the awkwardness is a thing you can choose to ignore for yourself
then you earned every downvote

everyone who thought your question was insincere or combative or condescending or not worth engaging with was just objectively correct
edit the fact that this got downvoted is both hilarious and pathetic

that response really just supports the decisions of others to not engage with you

if you want a sincere conversation in the future start by indicating youre willing to put in the effort to understand other people read through the thread ask for specific clarifications or identify common themes or things that seem contradictory to you reword what youve understood and ask if youve got it right these are skills were taught in grade school for engaging other people with ideas sincerely and respectfully and showing we are interested in comprehending new ideas 

dont just vaguely demand someone else spell it out for you especially in the context of this sub demanding someone else just spell it out for you is going sound combative and condescending and leave the impression of a very large risk that you are the sort who jumps into this sub feeling entitled to the emotional and intellectual labour of women who you intend to shit on regardless

that is why i choose to ignore you the risk outweighed any possible benefit to me and still does im very likely going to regret this 

if thats not who you are then dont approach it like this
does it matter if youre not compatible then youre not compatible it doesnt matter very much if that is personal or cultural
if youre comfortable with this level of prudishness and insecurities sure

i wouldnt be comfortable with this id remind her that i also kissed my ex while wearing pretty much every single shirt in my wardrobe and she had unzipped every pair of jeans i own and maybe have used every towel in the house while naked she also pet my dog even kissed his little nose can he stay 

if she wants to be absurd lets be equal opportunity absurd i wouldnt spend thousands of dollars to appease the irrational insecurities of someone im just dating especially not if they were phrasing it as a demand and not a request for support and understanding even though its a bit silly
no this is a terrible idea 

shes either looking to wound herself with this information or shes gathering ammunition to wound you with this question is inherently combative and controlling it can only damage your relationship 

tell her she needs to trust you to maintain appropriate boundaries with people you find attractive as you always have before and that if this conversation is going to be a productive one its time to get the counsellor involved and examine what she is trying to achieve with this line of questioning
i didnt say there werent many good things

but look at what this bad thing is cause its a fricking huge one

1 he felt unsafe speaking with you about his unhappiness and concerns
2 you two disagreed about boundaries and you appear to be seeking to isolate him from external emotional support you say you dont want too but in addition to number 1 that is the toxic dynamic that is developing and deepening 
3 you are now experiencing too much anxiety to join him in his regular activities or interact with people who are really important in his life

its fine to decide the good outweighs the bad but the bad youve described here is massive and youre still firmly in the honeymoon phase

you can decide to work this out and it might even work out but recognise that one of the important things about dating isnt just learning to work things out most of us will try to work out plenty more than we really should this sub is full of people trying to work out obvious incompatibles cheating and even outright abuse its really learning what is not tolerable for you so you waste less time with basically good people who are not the right people for you
its normal to maintain keepsakes especially in a private place

the fact you see this as a possible confrontation is a major issue this was not thrown in your face this was privately tucked away and your stumbling sounds a hell of a lot like snooping

its understandable that it upset you but the issues here are obviously whatever insecurities youve got going on he didnt do anything to you he didnt do anything wrong youre doing all this misery to yourself you should be talking to him about those and maybe seeking support and treatment for them this book should be a nonissue

the fact you think sentimental objects are disrespectful is absolutely not a universal opinion and frankly its a rather immature one one id expect from someone closer to 18 than 30
its been four months these sorts of issues so early on can and should be dealbreakers

in another situation id tell you that you cannot obsess about your side and that your partner needs to have people in their life they can confide in about their struggles and concerns while there can and should be some boundaries relationships cannot be emotional prisons you shouldnt want to isolate your partner from their support network you must trust and respect those people understand they are only hearing one perspective most people do understand that 

but in this situation why are you trying so hard to make it work when it so clearly isnt
dont worry about this guy hes not the issue this is not about apologizing 

are you getting medical support for your mental health right now youre in a really bad way and making really bad choices for yourself 

you just need to end all contact with this guy and get yourself some serious support and medical intervention this sequence of events was not about him it was about the bpd you need serious focused invention and treatment for your bpd
no

id say maybe big maybe if your true intention was simply to apologize for wrong doing

but it isnt this is condescending youre talking about her like she was a secondary character in your life existing only to assist in your growth underneath this all is the assumption she requires your apologyinput in order to move on with her own life you know thats not right

you havent spoken in years you know nothing you have nothing to offer except a sincere apology and what youve written here it not that sincere apology what youve written here is an inwardlooking bit of journaling about what a great person youve become this is selfcentring and personal validation not an apology its great if its all true for you but that has no value to her

nearly every time i hear a longtime ex reach out to apologize i end up rolling my eyes its almost always just selfishness and guilt and they are using the other person to make themselves feel better demanding attention to an apology that is not really an apology but is about making themselves feel better is just not a good look dont do it
the most important thing is to relax and keep on living your life

youre just talking its been good but its just talking hes moving its reasonable to believe hes probably not dodging you moving is highly timeconsuming and brainspaceconsuming

right now you are penpals trying to move things forward right away wouldnt be sensible or kind id suggest you not fight that and just accept it hoping that its temporary but not overinvesting youre going to stay penpals until at least a week after the move so think about how much time you want to give to a penpal and offer this connection only that much time

once hes moved give him 23 days and then suggest a few days youre free and even a suggestion of a placeevent especially if he doesnt know his new area well if he doesnt confirm within the first week or so of moving cut him loose

you cannot force this you cannot speed it up what you can do is decide how much of your energy youre gonna give this connection between now and when hes moved
absolutely they have issues the one in my area is very closely moderated often to the frustration of new members but even still 

however there are also guys from online dating who are posted several times a month for cheating stalking stealthing and all sorts of acts from really rude to greedy to outright violent i absolutely suggest my friends on online dating be in that group to know who the repeat offenders in the city are 

but if you look at all the posts  not just the juicy ones  most get nothing but a good luck or even i worked with him he seemed cool

this is totally old school analogue behaviour  the whisper network  in a digital space the criticism i hear from women is all like yours be critical of what you read check for the big risks not the whining but too many men are just terrified someone will say something mean about them as if they have never trash talked as ex or a hook up to their buddies and dont realize these networks exist because of a longterm systemic lack of safety for women

a woman who writes the above just really really hates other women and still thinks perfect judgment can protect her from a skilled manipulator and abuser
you might want to read some relationship books written more recently or by someone under 40 that sounds a bit regressive even for the 80s 

we are socialized in gendered ways sure but this kind of bullshit does more harm than good when two individuals are trying to understand one another
this man isnt going to save you 

he doesnt see you as a serious longterm partner and he isnt willing to take the kind of risks or make the kinds of investments an adult often would with a serious longterm partner 

on top of all of that you dont trust him he lies

this man isnt your safety whats worse he made just be a distraction and an obstacle keeping you from making other plans for yourself
ugh im so sorry im glad it sounds like you were able to keep yourself safe in the end
it happened last summer in ohio 

her rapist was arrested and she was able to get the medical care she needed in indiana her mother was advised the abortion wouldnt be legal in ohio under their heartbeat law
women are also the default care givers for small children so many women needs the legal structure of a divorce to protectcare for any dependants
i love these she dumped me for no reason stories 

one ex said i dumped him for getting a tattoo she didnt like

he got that tattoo while wastedhigh at a festival trip after promising me to stay sober and not make me play mommy instead i spent the second day to checking every medical tent and then the local er i eventually found him outta his mind in another er on iv fluids without his passport or our train tickets home

but sure it was the ugly tattoo not the 48 hours of terror and trauma followed by the cost of the hotel room and flight while i helped him sort his shit out with the embassy and hoped he wouldnt get arrested
i think theres a lot of complex intersectionality going on here and we cant really tell you much about the patterns in your neighborhoods or the ones you walk through their behaviour towards you could reflect biases in policing in the area or their jobfamily businesses or a dozen other things about the communities make up 

i walk through sort of three distinct neighbourhoods to get to my office each day and each of them presents unique risks and people respond differently to me based on how im dressed in one of them dressing more affluently will make me invisible in another it makes me a target in one wearing my more artsy queer coded clothes makes me everybodys friend in another really dirty looks and sometimes comments 

i think most street harassment comes down to punishment for being conspicuous for taking up space a reminder from men they own the space and youre just moving through it taking up space is it gonna look different in different neighbourhoods and at different times
even if it was true how is she should suffer with me because im suffering a good outcome for anyone if this were true then the women in this situation are doing a beneficial bit of emotional and practical labour for them both by ending it
oh fuck yes graduation and entering the workforce is one of the biggest transitions of your life so far dont underestimate the freefloating anxiety  totally reasonable uncertainty that kind of moment brings thats stressful for the normies please do consider putting a few of the avoidable battles back on the shelf for the time being live to fight another day i promise you itll pay off in the long run to be strategic about this personal development
notice how a shitty relationship where you or your partner is miserable much of the time seems to still be a rather good deal for men

its as if there is a great deal they benefit from in a partnership besides being happy and for women there is very little to be gained by being partnered if you are unhappy

the idea that women are more likely to leave a bad relationship is not an insult against womens character it just says something very sad about what men consider good enough and workable for themselves especially when they are not the ones doing the work

she failed his test the test to see how much shed accept from him

that is what triggered his explosion when she said maybe i dont want to accept this much

i agree op was also testing used passive aggression and needs to asset herself better  but thats because then she wouldnt waste three months with a man who wants to to play bullshit games not because she caused his verbal abuse and transparent attempts to manipulate her
exactly this

he wasnt confused he was tactical these are strategies that work for him 

op has plenty of flaws that make her an appealing target for this sort of man and a partner in his toxic dance but that doesnt absolve him
ops response was imperfect  shes a great target for his style of bullshit  but like i said he knew exactly what manipulation he was engaging in at that moment there was no reason to tell her about the text or his response except to test and trigger her

he didnt ask her because he cared he asked her as part of the test he was training her not to protest his behaviour and learning how to best manipulate her 

and when she failed the test by beginning to question and stand up for her own needs and boundaries he went on an overblown attack to threaten and coerce her into silence 

classic all my exes are crazy behaviour from this man

only thing to do is block him and move on any further contact will continue to bring out the worst in op
fellow panic disorder here and i completely relate to if i didnt challenge this id do nothing i had to manage panic around things like picking up the phone learning to drive and getting on planes 

but if nonmonogamy regularly triggered full blown panic i wouldnt do it one of the most valuable tools i have is pick your battles no that is too many battles put some back pick like two battles 

when i first started to really address my anxiety i thought i had to fight and defeat all my demons i put myself in a lot of unnecessarily triggering situations that actually made it harder to reach equilibrium and practice the skills because i was constantly pressuring myself to perform under intense anxiety when i stated to focus on the battles that were personally worth it to me things really started to click driving was 100 worth it getting on a boat absolutely not worth it i can live a very full and rich life without boats 

maybe this is a battle you want to pick but please give yourself some grace and make sure youre really picking it because its a worthwhile one for you and if it is consider putting some of the other battles on the back burner for a while dont try to everything all at once manage your energy and give yourself real recovery time time to recover and reflect is where you really firm up your tools and tactics otherwise you risk just burning yourself out
major toxic fights in the first three months are a huge red flag 

he doesnt want to be a boyfriend he wants to appear single at least to his guy friends he doesnt care how that makes you feel 

hes 34 not 21 hes not confused he knows exactly how he was manipulating you and leaving you feeling insecure and begging for his commitment and transparency stay the fuck away from him block him grieve it out and move on with your life
its actually rather cool its a real thing but the stupidest thing about this comment is that it was found largely to be fetal cells like from their sons so yes they checked it was that 

some studies have shown that up to 60 of women who have given birth to a son retain some of his cells it is naturally assumed they also retain their daughters cells but i havent seen studies for that in my admittedly shallowish reading they have also found some cells of older siblings in the younger ones and obviously twins and blood transfusions its just really not that big of a deal 

this seems to be a myth that came up in 2017 based on a study of women with male children outta seattle in 2012 but they decided to conflate the findings of male dna in the brain with the idea that the women were promiscuous and the dna was from multiple sex partners instead of what they actually were women who had sons
thats worse all of that is worse 

he treated you at least as badly as her but she had the sense to make the boundaries she needed for herself and cut him loose 

it also sounds like he used you to try to emotionally manipulate her while he was lying to you 

this is so much worse
her im trying to access a very basic prescription and also maybe not be maliciously imprisoned or murdered by the state any advice

him shouts irrational insulting assumptions about her body and sexual pleasure into the void
hes not confused

hes tactical you were convenient hes not capable of being alone

hell make plenty of excuses for himself and most of them will be lies dont gaslight yourself they are what they do not what they say

and what he did was making himself available to his ex for your entire relationship not just the first few months 9 months outta 10 that just means he hasnt hit her up super recently he never stopped
id walk 

this is his shit to overcome and he didnt probably wont 

but im his age 

and hes dating a woman over a decade younger then him because he assumes he can get away with this shit during her benefit of the doubt era he might last until you hit your knows her worth era 

a man who is 35 and behaved like he did is not capable of being mentally health alone which means hes not capable of being with anyone else either
4 year olds when they are called kiddo

24 year olds when they are called kiddo

me when my friend since kindergarten calls me sis

me when my catty sil does 

its almost like context and intent matter in human communication
this guy youre the real racist for not conforming to my sexist and racist stereotypes about you
i would consider the friendship done

his behaviour was horrible and your response was not productive but it doesnt really matter 

generally speaking i wouldnt keep a friend around who is clearly expressing a sense of entitlement to my sexualromantic interest and there is really no other rational interpretation here he wasnt defending white men in general they are doing just fine and dating plenty of women are asian decent generally speaking he was attacking you for not being a specifically available option to him and that is someone you need to stay the hell away from regardless of the racism angle
it would encourage women to buy toys and cohabitate with one another so as not to become a indentured servant 

there would be less children but possible a rush in sperm donors because youre making having children via sex even riskier that it already is
let spare a moment of shame for the guy who keeps trying to get him on mic 

best case senecio this random guy is going through some shit put the camera down and walk the fuck away stop encouraging this performance
its normal for people to grow apart especially at this stage of young adulthood

theres no going back there is not much chance of fixing it if youre this confused about what it even is after this much silence and blocking drama

allow it to end grieve it out and move on
your daughter is currently being abused your ex is trying to estrange her from you with lies about her own criminal violent potentially fatal actions that us lying likely some gaslighting and its generally emotional abuse designed to isolate your daughter from you 

your daughter is currently the victim of emotional abuse do not forget that or gloss over it that is what is happening here while you do not have the legal power to stop it at this time that is what is taking place your ex is actively abusing her
just keep persuing the parental ordercustody agreement

speak to a lawyer about your choice not to pursue criminal charges you should not have made that call without legal advice about how it would impact the custody situation if you dont already have one a lawyer will probably recommend a evaluation where a mental health professional will issue an opinion on whether or not you had a mental breakdown andor false memory

document all acts of estrangement tell your ex youre only going to discuss parenting right now over email follow up with any inperson conversations with an email that says as we discussed in person today let her reply in writing that she didnt intend to say she asked you to lie and say you stabbed yourself

youre not going to be able to repair your relationship with your daughter much further at this time she is not going to be able to read and comprehend the police reports medical reports or protection orders for many years your daughter is 11 years old and all her basic survival needs are met by her mother shes gonna side with her mother its just a basic human thing that is where her safety and her food comes from youre gonna be coasting for a few years

you need to seriously reconsider your legal options in regards to the stabbing youre not protecting your daughter if you are making it more difficult for her in the future to discern the truth about what happened youre also not protecting your daughter or anyone else around your ex from further acts of violence
you dont youve already explained plenty he had actively chosen not to understand and ignore your boundaries

you thought maybe you could be friends but his further treatment of you proved that you could not he wasnt friendly he continued to be boundarybusting and manipulative

youre not a therapist or a rehab centre for sad boys

expect him to continue to overreact and be ready to reenforce the boundaries that youre happy enough to hang out with him in a group but you asked for the texts to stop when they didnt you stopped them

leave him blocked youve communicated clearly
you can divorce someone for any reason youd like

but i do think you need to calm down if this is a hard boundary for you discuss it with him ask for his agreement to stop express to him you are willing to consider divorce if he will not 

but for my own sake i find this behaviour immature not a betrayal its just kinda ugly like a grown man having swimsuit illustrated posters on his bedroom wall
it is strange to me because pumpkin spice is a mix that humans have loved since the late 18th century when we finally became globally connected enough to concoct it there is even a bit of evidence of this spice mix as far as 3500 years ago good things taste good 

most of us loved this before it was branded psl
in hand not pinned to the back of your head like 90s barrette
your boyfriend suggested something if it will make you feel less insecure

you need to work on your insecurities in therapy

what he said was careless not an insult he fell into your baggage you need to pick some of this shit up off the floor its a tripping hazard

and dont bleach your vulva its unhealthy
you cannot fix the situation but saying i know this sucks and its a thing you need to get through that sucks will probably be validating

shitty things be shitty

sometimes the best help you can give someone when they are really in the dark part of it is is just agree this is shitty you feel shitty because it is shitty tell me how i can help you get through the shitty part
first ask her what support she wantsneeds

second recognize she is having a totally valid emotional reaction to something that is 100 true  the arts field is deeply unfair that is hard to get a job and almost nothing pays well there is a whole bunch of earning your shot and being a team player and paying your dues that you can basically only afford to do if you come from money and she was burnt out and dissatisfied in her last job she feels lost because she is that is a totally reasonable place for a person to be at 27 shes not broken shes 100 normal i know a hundred people who continued to work in the arts after this sort of period in their lives and i know a hundred who left both choices are valid but the choice will need to be made in time 

some shortterm depression is not a completely unreadable response to the situation shes experiencing especially when you stick a damn pandemic on top of it

do not say she knew what she signed up for of course she did she doesnt need you treating her like a child with that kind of comment but she didnt know how it would feel  she didnt know what the limits or stressors would be longterm she didnt know she wouldnt like it and it wouldnt be worth it she felt reasonably at one point in her life that she was making the best choices for herself it is possible you could have found yourself having the same crisis of faith about your choices in it so dont be a condensing shit about it just because art was her previous choice it wasnt a bad one it just isnt working out

keep encouraging therapy because she deserves the support

dont encourage professional networking until she has a more concrete purposegoal in mind
to be able to hurt her back for no damn reason while her legs cramp and fall asleep and wear mocha fraps in her hair all while dreaming of doing battle with a poorly photoshopped northamerican kaiju 

also i am deeply disappointed that they just greyscaled the image of a rooter instead of at least picking a photo of a black one like they come in black roosters come in black google black rooster dammit lazy shitposters
from the little window we have here it does seem like he is incapable of offering her anything but negativity and harsh judgement she may have told the group in an effort to pressure him to perform as if he was supportive and happy for her for at least a damn second
oh to have the ego of a mediocre man who doesnt even think the posting rules apply to him what i could have achieved in life with this oblivious and inflated sense of selfworth
i think she is in the wrong objectively but youre not coming at this objectively youre coming at this emotionally and trying to use a money agreement in the relationship to solve your unhappiness and money issues with a situation she is not in control of your employment i can understand why she would be upset when you frame this as financially punishing her because you hate your job that it isnt what it is but its sure what you make it sound like

you need to stop making assumptions about her savings and you need to stop attacking this emotionally objectively if that space is her office  especially if she intends to get personal tax benefits or write offs for it  then its not part of your shared home thats not about your budget or your job that is her being honest with herself with you and the irs about what her business costs to run and what resources it requires it requires a room just like it requires certain software or licenses its a business expense not a relationship one it belongs to business not to you or to her personally the business needs to be renting that room the business owner needs to pay that isnt about the boyfriendgirlfriend agreement thats about the business owing money its not paying 

and you need to be seriously looking for other work she may be unfair and maybe you should break up but generally speaking its also not fair to be constantly at your partner because youre miserable and not doing anything to fix that for yourself
i wouldnt want to be married to either of you

yelling is unacceptable to me

however so are constant accusations especially public drunken ones

what you are doing isnt being insecure were all a bit insecure you sound like you have long ago crossed the line into emotionally abusing your husband

most people will not accept emotional abuse forever without snapping snapping might look like yelling but it can also look like withdrawing running away or sobbing hysterically people break under that kind of treatment longterm they just do its called reactive abuse if he we were here asking for him id be telling him he probably needs to leave you before you bring out the worst in him and his behaviour gets worse because you are unlikely to seriously change yours 

stick with the therapy and discuss this incident there in the context of your behavior towards him
if you need to discuss how costs are split in you relationship you have to do that before you agree to go and pay for the ticket 

youre not wrong but you made a mistake not discussing the impact of this wedding trip on your budget before you agreed to go 

if you do speak to him about this start there i made a mistake i should have told you before we booked that this was more than i could comfortably spend
i wish i hadnt bothered tho this guys posting history is a nightmare before it was complaining his wife wasnt communicative enough with only the most weakass arguments shed done anything at all wrong and right here were seeing exactly why his wife has learned not to speak to him 

even when the information is totally banal he takes the opportunity to shit on her instead of supporting her
so he doesnt believe in being accountable to other human beings and honest about his commitments

youre 25 and pregnant you need to wake the hell up
youre trying to make it complicated because you dont like the simple truth everyone else gets it just fine he definitely gets it youre the one who doesnt want too 

hes doing exactly what he wants

if he wanted to be at those appointments he would be

if he wanted to be dating you he would be

he doesnt 

and he probably never will 

stop trying to fix it and start learning to live with him as a coparent
agreeing not to fuck other people is not the same as being a partner

same answer hes not your partner

its not stable with him hes not offering you that he is doing exactly what he wants and he doesnt want to be your support in this 

the longer you imagine you can turn him into either a good partner or a good parent the harder it will be for you to move forward with your life as a mother and as a human being

im sorry youre not ready for that reality sooner you get there the better off youll be
i just dont want to break up with him

its a situationship by definition you are not together 

we have a rocky relationship but we want to do better for our daughter

great you need to realize the best you can do probably doesnt include dating one another 

 i wanna start by finding a way to have him go to the baby appts mkre

you cannot turn him into either a good partner or a good parent hes gonna be who he wants to be and you need to make your peace with that
dude you were absolutely implying that she was incompetent and that you didnt trust her researchjudgment call despite the fact this was an ongoing issue for her and you knew shed taken previous steps

you may really think you didnt intend it but intention actually isnt everything what you atually did was shitty and her emotional response to being treated that way was predictable and reasonable 

it is a damn small thing and you were a selfabsorded ass about it

got to be honest with you if i was opening the garage by hand for a single week my partner would have declared that unacceptable and built a plan to correct that situation before i even got around to it

you should apologize and do better treat her like the competent adult she is and dont expect her to struggle with a daily task for months just because it doesnt impact you and then throw shade when she says its time to resolve the issue sesh youre 35 this is rather basic courtesy and empathy it is not rocketscience
i think you feel like a single mom because you are one 

stop the situationship just be coparents 

hes not your partner hes not the partner you want hes just your coparent and you cant force him to be a good parent you can only give him opportunities to be one 

the longer you imagine you can turn him into either a good partner or a good parent the harder it will be for you to move forward with your life as a mother and as a human being
let it go and focus on being coparents

she doesnt sound all that more toxic than you to be perfectly honest

go be better with someone else and find some grace when it comes to the woman who is the mother of your child your animosity over her sex life is pointless and counterproductive you may not be able to create a home with her and your son but you can create a coparenting relationship where you butt the hell out of exes sex life and focus on just being a parent and not fixating on your role as jilted or resentful ex
you probably want to begin by trying to connect with an individual therapist not a couples therapist to get you a place to talk through the particulars and make some thoughtful choices 

you want to leave the house and in the short term that is probably a good idea but you may want to speak to a lawyer if youre concerned about how that impacts your legal standing staying close by would definitely be wise and maintaining regular contact and support for the children 

if it doesnt matter where you live then you live near were your children are right now that is the default 

i dont know where you are living but you should recognize it takes way more than a night in jail to stop you from seeing your children the child have a right to know you and have access to you and no court is throwing that right of the children away over a verbal fight catastrophizing isnt going to help you here what is going to help you is focusing on being a present and available parent that should be the foundation of your decisions 

but get some distance in the shortterm and some support from an individual therapist and a lawyer
he definitely wants to fix it

if this has been your whole relationship and hes never spoken to a therapist or sought a sliding scale or a free support group or read a damn selfhelp book from the library then he doesnt really want to fix it he wants to seem like he wants to fix it so youll continue to tolerate it

youre both benefiting in some way from this unhealthy dynamic and you both need to admit it to yourself and eachother
he needs to realize this has to be fixed if he wants a healthy relationship with anyone ever and certainly if he wants to marry you

he may hate this about himself but as long as he tolerates it about himself it has the impact of guilting and silencing his partner

you cant remedy this for him he has to do it for himself and for you
this was my ex too

i tried desperately to point out that hed reply with no as the first word out of his mouth even when i was 99 correct or if had just used a wordterm he deemed less accurate then the one in his head 

he expected me to make all the effort to make myself understood but not to have to put himself out for a second to try and understand
i wouldnt i would text him after i post it

conversation can evolve from there or not 

make sure you know the policy at your company but if there is no risk of a direct reporting issue this is just a question of mutual interest
id start by asking if shes changed her mind about porn

the deception is a major problem but struggling with a change of opinion on a loaded topic like porn can be very different than a hypocrisy or betrayal unless youre in a race toward divorce your best path forward is an open conversation about porn and frame it as an upsetting and confusing but valid change in her choices and opinions and not a personal attack

you saw what you saw youre confused and more than a little hurt

try to put aside your assumptions about what she thinks or how she feels or even how often shes engaging with try to approach the conversation as an opportunity to reset the understanding about porn and just porn its possible she might still think its wrong and be disgusted with herself which would also account for her physical withdrawal from you

if she struggles to be forthcoming recommend couples counselling urgently to help moderate this important conversation dont spend too much time banging your own head against the wall and fixating on the betrayal
go back to therapy and figure out what kind of relationship if any youd like to have with your mother and what steps you need to get there that could absolutely include cutting her off or minimizing contact 

its totally valid to feel like you do and its really mature and wise of you to be able to recognize that your mother has changed and is making efforts you dont have to feel bad youre clearly trying to be fair to her and the person she is today but that doesnt mean your feelings are totally valid be fair to yourself too and get some more support for this stage
tbh i often forget this is criminal in the places where most redditors live

a few times ive given advice like thats not something you can reasonably expect from a matchhook up youre looking for a very specific service and you should be hiring someone and tipping well and completely been oblivious to the fact i was suggesting a crime
you cannot control how he feels

you can tell him youre concerned thats fair but dont get into specifics

youre concerned hes stressed out and overworked youre concerned he wont accept advice or listen to doctors on the best way to manage his pain or his diet

dont assume you have the answers dont be your mothers little helper speak for yourself and admit youre worried you want better for him than he seems to be choosing for himself and as someone who loves him that makes you sad
youre a piggy bank for a man who hid his child from you for four months

the fact hes an unreliable dad isnt something you can fix for him 

being a reliable parent means showing up he cannot do that without the financial support of the new gf he lied to 

you made the first right decision the second right decision is removing this person from your life
but she thinks your lusting after your sister however wonderful you think you ex is that is what she thinks of you she thinks at best you lack boundaries and at worst that you are incestuously obsessed with your sister 

that really should be insulting and offensive enough to help you get past this

your ex has shown you who she really is shes possessive and jealous and willing to make up extremely offensive insults in the attempt to isolate you from your sister and her kids
you cannot fix crazy

your problem is that youre trying to fix crazy

and why would you want to date someone ignorant and stubborn really

your exgf has decided to believe something absurd and offensive about you youre never going to reason her out of it you shouldnt be trying to work through it you should be removing someone who thinks such irrational and hateful things about you from your life
you need to stop seek therapy

it is extremely unlikely this man was going to pick you if youd just agreed to go home with him after the first date thats not realistic its a fantasy story youre telling yourself just to beat up on yourself you keep shifting the details but the core of it remains true he met someone else

it is a good idea to be upfront up walking to book a second date with someone youre into but that probably wouldnt have change the outcome here 

he connected more with someone else 

its just a rejection its a normal part of dating

the way you are behaving here on reddit suggests you are not ready to be dating and handling normal rejection as part of that process stop fixating speak to a therapist
stop supporting and start laying down some expectations

if hes not a jealous person then the way he is treating you and n is irrational and unkind

that drunken attack was not acceptable he doesnt need to be coddled he needs to be told this isnt an acceptable way to deal with whatever hes feeling

you have been nothing but open to working with him on this but he continues to make it your problem to live with his shitty attitude and random accusations followed by gaslightingeseque denials its not kind to you its not respectful of you he needs to do better because this is a shitty way to treat your partner who is very very willing to adapt this friendship to address your feelings 

stop trying to be his therapist and tell him to get his damn ass to an actual one if hes experiencing intense feelings he cannot speak with you honestly about
youre incompatible

and she basically said she feels she needs too and is entitled too financially punish you in order to stop you from becoming lazy why does she want to marry you if she thinks that you need to be threatened with higher costs in order to perform and set goals yuck

but honestly the even bigger longterm issue here is disagreements about parenting like the importance of private schooling if the rest of this doesnt scare you that should terrify you that disagreement is going to harm the children 

shes told you she is going to be constantly chasing status and making comparisons between your family you and everyone elses family if dont share that keeping up with the jones mentality and want to spend big to keep up public appearances then youre signing up for misery

also shes way too old to be this much of a brat
dont do this

use the letter to sort out your thoughts but then if you really need to express these thoughts to him and have decided to take the risk do it facetoface

whatever the outcome youll feel far far more confident and at peace with it if you do it face to face i promise its scarry to do things the right way to get a clear answer but thats the better path and believe it or not if youre gonna get rejected itll hurt less that way

if you cannot face this risk in person then you shouldnt be taking the risk at all
hes not a faithful man he never has been

can you be secure and healthy with someone you cannot reasonably expect to be faithful to you

you are being naive these are not challenges this is him making choices major changes in character and in core choices are rare and they have to be internally motivated unless he has explained clearly why he has changed his choices moving forward for himself and the life he wants for himself and not just to appease you there is no reason to believe he will not choose what he feels perfectly entitled to choose which is to engage with sex workers and lie to you about it

youre 23 you got a hell of a lot more life left i wouldnt recommend wasting any more of it on this one
nothing about that ran out as rhetorical to me if it was an attempt to persuade op of anything else except that you believed her to be held culpable for being emotionally abused and manipulated for years it was not well stated
yet here you are claimed it was a joke to brush it off as if not trying to get him mad at you for lying to you thats pretty wild and makes no sense

it makes perfect sense for someone in an eightyear partnership who is used to being silenced lied to and made deliberately distressed you stop responding reasonably to the manipulation and abuse because reasonable responses to it never stopped the behaviour in the past you get confused direct communication feels impossible that is the goal of this kind of abuse to make it feel impossible and pointless to respond in the reasonable ways  with legitimate anger or clear boundaries  that you assume op should it doesnt happen overnight its not all ops fault they cannot fix him by being better their responses to being abused are flawed but very human this is the kind of flaws that ongoing abuse will bring out in most of us

this isnt enabling this is the misfiring of survival instincts and toxic coping techiniques after years married to an emotional abuser

it doesnt get better for op until op gets out
youre supposed to leave the man who is either so conflict adverse he is unwilling to admit when he hasnt done something or so maliciously and gaslighting abusive that he takes pleasure in manipulating you and making you suffer

this is a big deal hes acting more like an unhinged prison guard than a partner 

at some point it stops mattering if he does this because he is weak and fearful and cannot admit when he has failed to do something or if he does this because he takes pleasure in abusing you the end result is the same
hes a gameplaying numbnut divorcee who wants to be chased even as hes telling you that he is not available to be caught he wants to feel desired by you and others without actually having to offer anything of himself or do any of the hard work of being more than just nice 

just end contact there is nothing here for you but drama
so all these people like each other more than they like you

which sucks for you but isnt a fight you can win there is not letting these adults make their own choices there is only you deciding what relationships you still want to be in 

its not your flat youre not on the lease these other people the subletter and your girlfriend were invited by the person who does lease the flat you didnt do them an act of kindness it wasnt yours to give to them 

the core issue here is that your gf doesnt want to move in with you when you return shes not prioritizing living with you thats plenty of reason to decide the relationship cannot or should not continue but this narrative you have about other people taking advantage of you or victimizing you is nonsense they disappointed you is all you had a room in someone elses house and that someone else has invited others instead 

if you dont want to continue with your gf dont but drop the rest of this bullshit
id consider it a rather serious red flag if a man used the word emasculating at me in anger because i had achieved personal success or experienced personal stress both of these are human things 

hes telling you he thinks his achievements and his stress and carry more meaning than yours because hes a guy and youre a girl this is a serious issue 

you need to stop building him up about his career and instead tell him plainly that he is not entitled to rip you down because of his own twisted ideas about women and men or his own negative feelings he needs to manage his feelings without explosions of anger or gendered insults those behaviors should be dealbreakers 

emasculating is not a word he should be using or even thinking when it comes to your career path or achievements
yeah i dont get it

my parents are rather happily married for 40 years they are both basically good people but they described their vows as sincere workable wishes which is the best way i think you can look at it and something i practice with my partner now its not a prison sentence its a promise to work hard and work first at this shared wish and also to stop working and go on wishing the best for one another if we find no amount of effort means we can stay in the partnership without being miserable
yeah so friends speak once and then hold their peace or remove themselves

that is how you deal with a serious concern about a friends choice in partner respectfully

and ill happily agree for the second time they may be toxic and we cant know

i dont think youre being the critical thinker you imagine you are

but you do seem to be reflecting a common bias where a body you find undesirable is immediately associated with behaviour or personality you assume is undesirable as well there is nothing here that suggests op is an unreliable narrator while that is certainly possible there usually are tells i dont see any and you havent pointed any out

your interpretation took way more assumptions than mine did

all mine hinged on was the fiance not speaking up for his own choice to be with op clearly to his friends thats a pretty defensible take whether we completely accept ops reasoning or not fianc should still be standing up for his own choices  even if those choices are mistakes

you really should consider why your story  the one where op must be toxic and the friends nobbling defending him from her  is the one you felt compelled to tell and doubled down on because it didnt require critical thinking or skepticism it required a rather fallaciousseeming leap

the devil has plenty of advocates already and playing one doesnt actually make you seem interesting or insightful it just makes you sound like a motivated reasoner
why do you want to imprison this man with a wife who resents him and doesnt want to be with him its not like thats a great deal for him either if op isnt able to willing to change the shared goals and expectations she has then he deserves to be free of her just as much as she deserves to be free of him 

and do you think people didnt walk away from their partners constantly in the previous centuries due to poverty or illness cause they did in droves sometimes with a bit of social shaming but far less than you might imagine men more than women which is not a comment so much on mens general character as it is their power and agency to leave a undesirable situations and seek greater comfort and convenience elsewhere

its so funny how individualism went awry just the time as when women achieved the most basic human rights and the ability to leave situations they found intolerable
no we dont get to dictate how others deal with objects or memories from experiences that were traumatic or abusive

op can absolutely bring his feelings and needs forward but she doesnt have to do this because the ex was abusive if anything the fact he was abusive may contribute to her connection to objects that represent the positive aspects of the relationships because all abusers have some positive traits at times that is how they entrap
it does to me

but also these are very stupid and desperate criminals
unlike the magic power to declassify documents by looking at them he retained that until the very last second and then some yes  
id recommend these things get put away in a drawer and from there you suck it up

not because your feelings are irrational but because grief  especially grief and processing after long term abuse  are super fucking complicated 

you can ask her to do this work for you and your comfort that fair if its a thing you really need and boundaries you need to revisit but id recommend you not force the issue shes very likely to let go of more in time but two years after seven of abuse is not full processing time for most people

shes probably not holding onto him shes preserving the story of her own life
you shouldnt stay in a relationship you dont want to be in

your husband needs to stop gettingseekingstaying at jobs where he is either not able to succeed or his work ethic doesnt line up with expectations 

becoming successful is not a reasonable expectation if that is what you need its probably time to walk away go date someone who already is 

becoming stable reliable and less miserable should be the shared goal and expectation of him if youre going to stay that may include a major change of industry andor changes in expectations about how he will contribute
laugh

and then hopefully wake up from the strange dream where my partner and my father are not both rational and civil men who can resolve disagreements and do not order me around like a dog
we always just have ops pov they are frequently manipulating the internet for validating responses do you jump in on every thread to remind us of that fact or just the ones where you suspect the fatcard 

look if you think its not very probable that a group of people have deemed someone unworthy primarily due to their weight i do not know what universe youre living in cause it aint the one i inhabit

ive happily agreed they may be toxic and we cant know but you seem to need more than that you should ask yourself why
friends speak once and then hold their peace or remove themselves 

they dont speak about another persons body or level of perceived hotness as being a huge mistake

while its possible these two are poorly matched or toxic there is nothing here to suggest it and fianc should still be standing up for his own choices  even if those choices are mistakes
does it matter

most of the time he kept talking about his friendsfamilycoworkers and exes and only asked about 3 questions about me the entire time

and

i was like no i dont kiss on the first date and we kept talking about it untill he leaned in and kissed me

this man is a boundarybusting selfabsorbed asshat who is not relationship material

unless youre just looking to get laid move on frankly even if you are probably want to be moving on a man that selfabsorbed and indirect in his communication is a coin flip odds are not great hes a fun lay anyways a guy who asks you nothing about yourself is rather unlikely to get you off 

dont so be desperate to be picked by somebody that you chase after selfish little shits who basically ignore you as a person realize you get to do the picking too  and then put this one back on the pile unless the earring is worth a small fortune let it go along with this guy
i think the real issue here is your fiance is refusing to stand up for himself with the people he calls friends which is sad for him and it limits your life together

basically he needs better friends or to tell these friends they are expected to be better or to gtfo
no you probably shouldnt

you should be speaking to a therapist about how to best move forward in your own life

you still havent sorted out the difference between her doing something wrong and her doing something that disappointed you

youre not expressing all that much love for her as a person but for the role you have cast her in and are frustrated she is no longer consenting to perform

youre not owed a certain number of chances and your family as you previously envisioned it doesnt need to be back together that is your preference not a fact of the universe she doesnt have to agree she doesnt agree

these attitudes all make it extremely unlikely that youve done the work you need to be an independent and reliable adult and even if you had done that work she might still not want to reconcile because youre not owed a certain number of chances she can just choose not to be in a marriage she doesnt want to be in and she has

take these thoughts and feelings to a therapist they do need to be addressed but not by your exwife
your mother is dating an asshole and what is worse she knows it and she appears to have quietly approved of his behaviour she warned you when she should have said if you are verbally abusive to my son in yourhis workplace i will dump your childish ass

dont talk to him hes not relevant to you and if youre in a union situation you should seriously consider reporting him for threatening your workdayincome because hes pissed off you didnt buy him a meal

tell your mother kindly but firmly that your invites do not include him unless you explicitly include him you need to avoid these misunderstandings in the future by being clear if he is coming or not
even if he isnt cheating on you this isnt okay

if hes not cheating on you then hes trying to punish you for forgetting to pay your bill during your time of crisis and grief 

you dont need proof hes cheating to get the fuck rid of him over this
a person who tells you they are sooooooo nice and sooooooo loyal and no one else will treat you as well as they will is a completely trash person

do not make peace with this

do not marry this man

this is a major warning sign

he will abuse you

then he will tell you its your own fault while declaring all other men are worse abusers than he is which is a lie he tells so he gets what he wants he wants to abuse you
why not just block him thats perfectly acceptable and very clear response 

and if not that then you tell him to stop

dude that sounds flirty i dont like it cut it out 

if he denies it or pretends its not or its no big deal dont argue with him just say good im glad thats not what you meant cut it out anyways i dont like it thanks
its a bad idea to date someone in their 20s

the age gap should bother you more than it bothers her and it should motivate you to make a responsible respectful choice based on your life experience

to answer your questions generally i think dealbreakers prior the first date should be short and sweet and cover the really big things guns religion sex before marriage and abortion vegan diets if that is a big one for you those sorts of biggies the conversation about what could a relationship look like how much time will we spend together and where how do you see a relationship with your children developing is a conversation you have after 23 pleasant dates and you both agree you want to continue to see one another
i mean it sounds like the guy is a sexist asshat you should reduce your time with

its okay to decide not to invest in friendships with people if you dont like how they treat you or others

stop being a bystander its gross if youre not going to call him out at least step away from him
youre not 

you are not 5yearolds call dibs on the best ball as the bell rings 

you treated her like a human being 

hes treating you like a competitor in a sport where she is the favourite big red ball and he cant figure out how to dibs her 

keep her friendship reconsider his
she wasnt that into you

you were into her and kept hopingimagining she felt the same 

maybe she kinda liked you at some point but then she didnt 

there is no problem here just a normal disappointment 

the only thing youre doing wrong is refusing to accept this as a totally normal bit of normal human disappointment most of the people you like arent gonna like you back
youre both being absurd and kinda gross

this woman has told you shes not available for new connections at the moment

he doesnt give a fuck he thinks this is a game to be won not a bunch of human people with feelings and free choices and youre acting like he bought her by driving you around and being your friend that is also pretty gross

opt out of this bullshit when he makes passiveaggressive comments tell him hes being kinda unfriendly over this shit and to cut it out be a bro not a whiny brat you value his friendship but if hes gonna act like a 5th grader who called dibs on a girl who told him she isnt single anyways its gonna damage respect between you two as adult human beings

if you dont want to keep speaking her then dont but this isnt about who falls in love more this is about not surrounding yourself with men who treat women as trophies and you as the competition its toxic af its not friendly
when i see no drama my brain immediately translates it to i am the drama i bring the only permissible drama

no drama is the poor cousin of all my exes are crazy i wouldnt say is guarantees gaslighting  that term is getting super inflated but it does mean they seek out and create toxic dynamics and at very best lack selfawareness
yeah 

and you wont die cause you cant afford insulin or chemo or got in a car crash and your family wont loose the house andor all their savings trying to keep you alive 

everyone on the planet who gets this deal would fucking go to war against the us if they tried to export your the idea of a tiny bit less taxes but everything else is way fucking worse and only the millionaires benefit 

i literally do not know how so many americans wake up each day knowing they are one er visit away from total financial ruin
tell me youre an adult man who wants a mommy without te nm fuck it
you are loved and awesome

he was telling a story telling a lie because his ego couldnt accept the rejection he couldnt handle the consequences for his bad behaviour he needed to tell a story where you unworthy of him so he didnt have ti address the fact he was clearly objectively unworthy of you 

its been years since i broke up with my ex and some of his nasty stories about me still slip into my life telling me im unworthy or im greedy or im dumb im shocked how many years later im fighting his narratives even though they were lies then and they are definitely lies now 

your brain it trying to make sense of someone you cared for and were vulnerable with telling you such terrible lies 

you end all contact you keep reminding yourself these were selfserving lies that had everything to do with his weakness and hatefulness and nothing to do with you as a person
honestly the best thing to do is leave these conversations i tell them to google motivated reasoning and then go touch grass

its not a data argument to begin with no data scientist would take these with anything short of a 10lb bag of street salt thats not even what average means this was a dataasmarketing for paid dating apps a decade ago apps that are selling a product to predominately straight men by convincing them they require a paid advantage 

marketing departments make graphs all the time that i roll my eyes at and say well that is technically not a lie thats all that is happening here
are we talking oh that 18 year old has great emotional regulation expresses boundaries clearly while also being empathetic to those around her

or do we mean shes a free baby sitter and chauffeur for younger siblings and isnt thats a great perk for her parents

there are definitely ways to praise young women for being mature or wise that reflect their individual strengths and not their usefulnesssubmission to others
irrelevant 

this would be a bit funny from a 21 one year old but its embarrassingly stupid from a man his age who wants to be a parent

if ubi does happen ha and ai takes over significant parts of our world school will change a lot but children will still need to be educated in order to be people we want to share the world with and maybe even live fulfilling lives
its pretty obvious this man just wanted you to shame her into handing the child over to you and then you would be responsible for the care of him and the child

glad you escaped id suggest you be very very skeptical of anything he ever told you about her whatever her struggles are now clearly when they were together she had two babies to take care of and one of them was a resentful and manipulative shit of a 450months old
i would not date a man who thought it was my job to sort out his parenting and custody issues with his ex thats insane 

he was being a shitty parent and trying to coerce you into doing the job for him this terrible attitude towards responsibility and work likely his assumptions about womens work was going to continue

if he had won custody youd have basically been single parenting that infant can all but promise it breaking up over his lack of responsibility and blameshifting was completely wise and not at all petty
then start with your obygn or a standard therapist and ask for a referral 

if youre serious about these concerns address them seriously addressing them seriously is not going to happen on reddit
33 isnt an older father those studies usually begin at 35 to 40 

you should be talking to a doctor not google not reddit and not a sociopath
i think trying to round your hall pass up into polyamoury before speaking to your wife is toxic as fuck swinging is completely and utterly different from poly most swingers will be the very first to tell you that  and makes me perfectly comfortable expecting better from this man hes not a novice he should have the basics down so trying to build a new relationship outside of the marriage for weeks without speaking to his wife thats taking it past poor communication about boundaries into a realm id consider manipulative and coercive

i say this as a practicing enm person who has seen a lot of wellintentioned people mess it up this is not a mess up i could assume was wellintentioned experience has taught me that people who really want to take good care of all their partners and relationships arent this stupid this mess up would mean both of these people are outta my life forever they are not safe or reliable

im not a fan of keeping such an open mind that ones brain falls right out the best ill give this man he was very conveniently confused and when someones confusion is that convenient to them and what they want for themselves trust is severely damaged
if i heard hall pass id assume it was a onetime hook up thing so yeah hit it and quit it and i probably wouldnt want to participate in that sounds dicey and not what id want in an enm encounter

but i really dont know what a hall pass was in this marriage and neither does op and apparently neither did these two thats kind of the whole problem and its not ops problem
so this chad was a sorta awkward and totally ageappropriate teenage boyfriend right
no one dates someone 20 years younger then them by accident or because they are looking for a relationship with and equal rooted in mutual respect

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

you dont seem to be open to advice

its reasonable for your gf to not want to marry you and live with your mom its reasonable for her not to want to marry someone who is planning on financially supporting his mother for the rest of her life 

it is strange that you find this surprising and its only coming up now 

this isnt insecure  a bit sexist maybe but not insecure this is a reasonable boundary you should halt all plans and probably break up if you plan on financially supporting or living with your mother for the rest of her life

outside of very conservative upbringings very few women are going to sign up to marry you under those terms
no absolutely not you are not required to make yourself of service to this messy toxic man or his wife you are completely correct this is not yours to fix why are you still in contact with either of them there is nothing for you to gain from that 

this is not your circus not your monkeys if he violated their relationship agreement that is the two of them to sort out it has nothing to do with you

if you feel like you want to do her this huge emotional service and massive favour invite her to contact you via email with her questions and you stick to factual responses ie not about what you felt but about timelines and what information you received when

but even that i would not do if these two are at war with one another there is no good outcome for you if you go wandering out in the middle of the battlefield id advise you to end contact entirely with both of them
i mean this with respect and compassion but you need to go touch grass

youre giving over way too much of yourself to this and twisting this into stories just to get down on yourself stop trying to place those highschool pickme dramas into this thats not whats going on here

your hurt feelings over this make sense for a few minutes but this is all a bit much dont wallow dont fixate she wasnt into you she probably wasnt into you for something causal either let it go
a woman who plans to have somewhere to be after the date doesnt plan to have sex with you be sure this all adds up to not that into you
honestly women in their 40s are well aware of that stigma and they will tell you if they are into something casual with you if she did not odd are very good she was not
you need to relax and let them know which dishes you need to access and that you are not able to reach x y and z in the position they were moved too ask they be moved back or that you take a look together 

youll be fine its fine to ask for things you use frequently to be stored at a height you can access safely
you can feel how you feel but she didnt do anything wrong

you know this is about your insecurities and instead of taking it so personally you should be taking this as clarity she was correct you were not compatible as dating partners you were not looking for the same thing 

if you really want to be her friend then you can mention to her that he considers himself redpilled and suggest she google what that means before she wastes too much energy

but you also dont have to be friends if youre not happy being her friend which may involve being aware or even seeing her connect with someone else
you dont trust him dont fuck someone you dont trust

its not complicated youre not as compatible as you had previously thought you were just end it
two hours on the phone is a long time for adults with full lives 

if youre doing that several times a week im not surprised shes not on the whole time and that its not that satisfying 

ldrs are tough but you need to focus on the kinds of connection and length that fuels that relationship not the kind that just checks the box of we talked today
you mean your exboyfriend right

this is not rocky this is risky

this is not just disrespectful behaviour its dangerous

this is not about him getting off even this is about him taking sexual pleasure in deceit and violation of you and of other women

this isnt about you or your body this is about the fact he likes lying and ripping women down generally this is what he does this is who he is that is what you can put your trust in you can trust 100 that this guy likes to shame insult and lie so he will do that 

the quicker you get away from him the quicker you can start to heal
this is sexual assault hes dangerous

he is going to lose control again because he feels entitled to use your body this way without your consent take your bags leave never come back

unless you want to end up having a baby with your rapist because staying in this relationship will almost certainly lead you to being bound to him forever by the baby you have after he rapes you
no dude quit it take that venting to the therapist your ex was an abusive monster no one is debating that or ignoring the impact it had on you and your family but that actually isnt the issue today

the issue today is your current partner isnt behaving up to snuff in a home with your children fulltime and isnt prepared to do any of the work to improve the situation and your brillant plan appears to be treating her like a convenient income for the next four years or so and then see how you two feel about each other

shell probably hate you by then if someone treated you like nothing but a financial crutch tell me you wouldnt

get your kids and yourself the mental health support you can and seriously reconsider your ability to remain in the district without remaining in this relationship im not saying you have to leave but you and your partner both need to realize that is reality and a possibility that is the only way to untrap yourselves it to be willing to seriously contemplate life apart  and then either choose to do the work to stay together or not
dude just no

this isnt ethicalnonmonogamy or openness this is just drama and you didnt even want opennesses to begin with 

at best shes confused and not emotionally available for a serious relationship at worst she lacks selfawareness and basic consideration to the point that makes her manipulative or even malicious

just no
your amazing partner didnt want you to fulltime parent your own kids and now you cant leave a relationship youre all miserable in because you feel perhaps correctly that you cannot afford to 

pretty obvious why no one feels secure or particuarly loved in this situation

get your kids and yourself the mental health support you can and seriously reconsider your ability to remain in the district without remaining in this relationship
part of fully acknowledging that what you did was wrong is accepting the consequences

the consequences are that you are not welcome you dont always get another chance it doesnt matter if the other person is shitty or if you think you deserve it it doesnt always happen and frankly do you really want it too these people are insane and the brought out the worst possible behaviour in you a sane person would stay the fuck away from them and not try to seek their approval 

your bf needs to figure out how he balances his time it feels complicated but its actually not any more practically complicated than that accept have some grace ask for the time you need and respect that he still values some time with these friends

hopefully he can recognize that the toxicity at this point is coming from only onedirection  not you who has apologized and will now accept the situation with grace  but his socalled friends who are apparently totally cool with assault and insults and regularly drink to excess this all rather gross for a bunch of 30yearolds
 any woman who doesnt chase you after shes slept with you is a woman who belongs to the streets

tell me youre a shitty lay without telling me youre a shitty lay
i agree there isnt we dont know

and i wouldnt risk it not this one not if my instincts were what ops appears to be
you really seem genuinely confused by this but

its okay to demand more from a partner than just them not being abusive

you dont have to stay with someone just because they dont hit you or call you names
he doesnt seem violent himself

the bar is beneath the damn floor

someones not treating you right if you are concerned they empathize more with the consequences your abuser faced then the experience of being abused thats not just ignorance and it wouldnt be okay even if it was
i would simply walk

i would trust my instincts if i suspected my new partner felt more for the man who was inconvenienced by the legal ramifications of his abusive actions then he does for his gf the person he actually knows and supposedly cares for who was abused that is a dealbreaker i wouldnt confront i wouldnt explain i would just say no thank you and walk

the first joke was careless and could be overlooked as a oneoff poor judgment call but the concern that he thinks believes your abuser was hard done by or just caught a case should not be overlooked i wouldnt confront or even delve into that id just trust my gut and escape that

its one thing to not know what to say or make a dumb joke its another entirely to express more empathy for the person who hurt you facing consequences for that behavior than for you having to live with the ramifications of the abuse

you shouldnt stay in a relationship where that doubt and fear has even entered your head i wouldnt he might not mean anything by it but i wouldnt roll those dice on someone id only been dating for a few weeks or months 

edit dumb typo gut not guy
its not on her if you cannot treat her with respect

youre not actually taking full ownership of the issue here youre not asking for sensitivity youre asking for submission to your bad behaviours and for her to manage your feelings for you youre asking her either meaningful change or hide how she interacts with her classmates because you cannot handle yourself 

you need to seriously consider if you are capable of being a partner to anyone at the moment  without being emotionally abusive or controlling towards them because by your own description youre crossing that line
yeah that typo doesnt help any but it seems like most people got it all the same 
approach this from a shared goals point of view

you both have a shared goal of living together there is a proposal where you could do that more quickly if he was willing to provide you with a better interest rate than the irs and cc companies would 

show him your plan for repaying them and how youve worked that plan over the last few months then show him how much quicker it would go if you were repaying him at a less aggressive interest rate 

from there id suggest you hit pause let him go away and think about it dont get too into the weeds right about how much interest youd pay him or about trading rent for repayments instead just give him the information about how quickly youd be out of debt and roughly how much more quickly you could live together 

tell him you know its a bit strange and you dont want to pressure him into something hes not comfortable with you want to build your life with him regardless so if hes not comfortable with this youll just keep on working the current plan youve shown him on the current timeline
stop going back to this well its run dry

you were rarely if ever friends

you can know this because the friendship faltered or fell apart when either of you were in established relationships or actively dating others you were almost always the pseudopartner the whatif in the other persons life you were oneanothers fantasy but never oneanothers reality those are the hardest things to let go of the things that never really existed except as a hope the honeymoon stage never ends if it never even begins 

its time to let that hope die be grateful for the good feels find them in a healthy way with someone else
most people in their 30s arent dating partners 10 years younger than them cause they want relationships based on mutual respect and clear boundaries

personally i think this is a silly and immature way for an adult man to engage with social media but not a betrayal however that really doesnt matter

what matters is whether or not this is a dealbreaker for you hes been clear hes going to continue you are entitled to your feelings but your feelings dont make the rules he gets to agree or disagree and he disagrees you have to decide if that is the kind of relationship you want to stay in or not
okay  first off you havent won squat yet

some couples try to maintain perfect financial equity but at some point that system tends to break down a real lifetime of teamwork is rarely going to break down 5050 on all fronts

if you have a shared goal of homeownership and that could be accelerated or improved by using part of your winnings its a bit silly imo not to be open to other ways to protect your equity besides a perfect 5050 split of the downpayment its not that it would be unfair to her in any way just that it would be kind of silly and bizarre not to factor this change in your financial reality into a holistic plan for your lives together  especially if kids are in the cards

buying a home or getting married involves some level of financial risk to both parties you can manage that risk but you cannot erase it not if you want a partnership 

if either of you wins or inherits a large sum of money it makes sense that the shared plan and goals be reevaluated and that plan should include some protection for individual assets i dont think either of you is showing much sense or nuance on this at all
break up with her and give her a deadline for leaving your home a week or two at most

you could look for legal advice to support you in this but frankly she is undocumented you could hand her some contact numbers for charitiesngo in your area that supports people in her position but shes unlikely to try to push for tenants rights or 90 days notice 

dont talk about the things tell her plainly the relationship is over it doesnt matter what she does now doesnt matter if she gets a job tomorrow the relationship is still over

if you can offer her cash towards a plane ticket but dont give her anything until she takes her things and leaves and never give her anything more than what you agreed too at that moment then change the locks pay if necessary to have them changed its worth it

in the meantime depending on how concerned you are with her behavior between the time you tell her to leave and the day she actually does ask friends if you can store anything of value money or sentimental with them and make sure to keep your technology money any passwords out of her reach
the issue is youre feeling a lack of intimacy in your relationship currently

the issue is not that she had a past enjoyable sexual experience with someone else 

you probably have things to talk about it this isnt it
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them  
  
i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long  
  
upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who could make you so

this was known bullshit in 1796 and its bullshit now its an excuse men use to justify themselves in preying on women they are assuming are either stupid manipulative or weakwilled there nothing about it that is a good idea sane men shouldnt want partners who test them that way to begin with and there is nearly no evidence of women engaging in that behavior  just a lot of rejected men saying they must this theory is just straight misogyny because rejection sucks and lots of men will do anything to negate it
you dont have to be friends with anyone you dont want to be friends with for any reason

and yes tolerance for casual racism is a rather good reason

most people when they find themselves in a crowd of people yelling slurs or say wearing swastikas or hanging nooses at very least leave mike didnt even want to distance himself from eric mike doesnt think the problem is with eric
please stop asking reddit you might be finding more validation by creating these variations in the story but the end result is the same

break up with her if you do not want to be with her

or or seek therapy to manage your emotions in more rational ways

her behaviour basically makes sense to me she avoided a past hookup in public who from your previous versions was unkind to her and talked shit about her with his friends and she gave you details about the encounter with him when you kept on probing for more information because you didnt accept her initial brief explanation in your earlier versions you were not the least bit concerned about her safety or only suspicious about the details so now you have more details and you dont like them either 

your choices and behaviours here make so little sense that i sincerely hope this is fiction
id be okay with a return date of 34 months perhaps but 612 months with me using all my vacation to fly to them nah i couldnt sustain a healthy relationship on those terms certainly not one that was only 8 months old
i dont think you need to be really clingy to not be okay with this

im fiercely independent and have gone a month or two without seeing my partner when worktravel have required it but would i commit to 612 months of an ldr with only maybe a few visits with a man id been dating of ra less than year probably not thats a bad use of my time and energy for a situation that doesnt suit me nothing needy or clingy about that
just ignore it but keep your eyes open for ways to move out of his department

this man tried to use his position to coerce you into an affair and now hes trying to create plausible deniability

continue to document everything 

he wasnt your friend and you cannot become his 

he only saw you as a potential affair partner 

he acted out and retaliated against you when you didnt play along with his fantasy 

hr may not want to admit what happened but everyone with two brain cells to rub together understands what happened

the only thing more you can do to minimize the harm this man can do to you is look for a positive move out of his department before he manufactors a negative one
im sensing there might be some downsides to spending a few millennia telling men that god made females for them
yeah this is the bullshit that works in the movie dont do that

you should bring your own timeline to the meeting though and let her know that you two do choose to reconcile you would plan on purposing in x to x number of months months not years

ultimatums get shit on because they dont feel very good to receive but when they are honest they are important she was 100 honest about what she needed in this relationship and she walked when you couldnt meet that that wasnt controlling that is clear honest communication 

she cannot put a timeline on your healing but she is 100 entitled to place a timeline on her own needs in order for the relationship to move forward 

just be transparent about what changed your mind dont actually make it all about how wonderful she is focus on what you have recognized about yourself and need to change to in order to build the life you want with her be clear that while you want her the person youre changing for is you because that how change lasts
you may not be able to eat your cake and have it too

all you can do is be just as transparent and clear as you are here and then youll likely need to step back and give her some time to process this information her initial reaction is likely to be anxious and angry and to feel abandoned youre going to have to let her move through those feelings and figure out what she needs to express to you because those feelings are gonna be valid

youre only eight months in and youre suggesting going into and ldr basically for at least that long again its a huge ask of a young relationship 

most people would break up it would be totally reasonable for her to decide not to remain in a committed relationship with someone making the choice you want to make it may just not work for her
your gf doesnt believe her friend will cheat she cares for her friend and the friend is wasted you may be right but youre probably not going to convince your gf to think badly of someone she clearly cares for

and youre really having the wrong fight here

instead of getting worked up about a bunch of women trying to keep their dumbass drunk friend safe just tell your gf plainly that you wouldnt find her friends behaviour acceptable in your own relationship you wouldnt do it and youd like your gf not to do that either thats the agreement you actually need between the two of you about the boundaries when dancingout at the club

in your shoes id be far more concerned about your gfs comfort around drinking to excess and her willingness to take on caretaking roles for her friends in dangerous moments having a frank conversation about what i find acceptable is an easy problem to address trying to talk to your gf about the fact her friend has a substance andor impulse control issue is way harder if one of my friends behaved this way more than once i would decline to go out with her until she got her shit together not because of the risk of cheating but because its not any fun to cockblocking for a drunken moron on the regular
i would be more inclined to agree if i thought for a second he was actually concerned with the cost of and access to healthy food and not with just punishing those he deems unworthy
this would seem to me to point to large issues in how you deal with finances

some couples can nickelanddime like this but personally i think its toxic and counterproductive once you live together
if the book is important to you then it doesnt matter what he thinks get the book then end contact if you want to end contact his ego is not relevant to this at all you cannot control what he thinks or feels so why waste any of your time on it

but shit if you take your book collections that seriously have a loaner copy i never loan out my copy of my favourite book i have a second copy for the purpose of loaning out its dorian gray you could have grabbed a copy for him for less than 5 dont give people the copies you are attached too in the future
is this some sort of first edition a rare find of a book with a dedication inside from your dead relatives or something 

cause unless this book is irreplaceable youre the one playing games 

dont pretend to be friends just dont be friends if you think hes keeping you around for a ego trip
you drew a boundary about a kind of joking you didnt find funny and didnt feel was healthy for either of you thats not throwing the past in her face thats asking her to not to continue to make jokes that you do not enjoy 

its reasonable to acknowledge her feelings  she was hurt by your comments and thats not insane to feel hurt  but the message wasnt and shouldnt be intended as an attack its just not funny for you you want to move past it not joke about it
all of this i feel for the guy shit as he may be that would be an awful experience and im glad he made it home safely

however if any woman had stopped to help a nakedass man in the woods and been attacked  or worse  by said men all the same people bemoaning this guys plight would be blaming her for not using her common sense to avoid the obvious danger of the crazy naked man 

men know other men are dangerous they act on that knowledge ever fucking day they just dont like it when that reality is reflected in womans choices in ways that inconvenience them personally
do you that think men and queer folks up and down the binary dont ghost
then dont be friends with her

mutations are normal variations within a species individuals dont really undergo speciation groups do its a longterm process not a mutation in a single individual 

you are free to call yourself a nonhuman and free to not choose to be friends with people who do not honour that thats all ya got
no the only problem isnt her communication and the other problems might not be worth solving better to call it off entirely

but op can and still get past this bullshit i cant actually say what i want he should just know when i say i feel in a good relationship that will often happen but even if the best relationships actual conversations about actual disagreements are required at times

and in a really shit relationship doing so will help you waste less time
hey im all for op breaking up with him

but if youre not able to express what you would like your partner to do and have a conversation about that then youre setting yourself up to be immature and gameplaying and disappointed thats childrens games adults express reasonable boundaries and expectations and walk away if they are not met being willing to walk away when someone isnt going to offer the kind of relationship you want to be in is the opposite of controlling what is controlling is not telling them and trying to manipulate them into giving you what you want getting more and more worked up angry and resentful when they do the thing you dont dare to actually ask them to do 

someone can give a fuck about your feelings and still disagree and make a choice for themselves it happens constantly if you cannot manage disagreement as a couple with clear communication then you shouldnt be a couple
you have to be able to actually tell your partner what kind of relationship you want to be in and are willing to be in with them

thats not controlling thats having needs wishes and boundaries like a full human being who knows themselves well enough and is mature enough to express what she wants and needs

what youre doing instead right now ends up being gameplaying and manipulative you get into bullshit arguments about my feelings are valid which of course they are but thats beside the point here and not the problem what you really need to discuss is okay you and i disagree about what is appropriate here with this new female friend lets talk about boundaries we can both live with and help me feel secure and respected in this relationship

if you think hes shady dont date him

but either way learn to speak up for yourself its not controlling to tell your partner what you want in a relationship and to try to find an agreement with them that suits both of your needs that is literally what healthy conflict resolution looks like
he disagrees

he understands that you are uncomfortable he disagrees that he needs to do anything differently because youre having that feeling and you dont seem to have actually asked him to do anything differently

being understood is not the same as getting what you want

expressing your feelings is not the same as actually asking for someone to change their choice or do something differently next time

to communicate in healthy respectful ways you have to actually have to ask for what you wantneed not just repeat your feelings at people

if you need a boundary you have to ask for it clearly and he might disagree then you have to actually talk about it explicitly and try find an agreement 

if you didnt ask for a clear boundary then it wasnt totally insane for him to think that you were just expressing your feelings about the situation and that he did not need to change his actions he disagrees that his actions were a problem and you didnt ask him to change them so he didnt

you two have to come to an agreement agreements are what change behaviors not just telling him your feelings and hoping hell figure out what you want and do that instead

he made a new friend i can understand why that concerned you a little bit but do you really want to be in a relationship where you see every single new femalehuman in his life as a potential threat i prefer a relationship where i trust my partner to make new friends and observe good boundaries with them
there is nothing you can do to control another person you have to be kind and clear and trust that your professor is reasonable 

thank them for their offer acknowledge youve accepted another and express regret at not working on their team at this time do it asap the quicker you tell them the kinder it is to them

if she burns the bridge nothing you can do about that youll have done your best
again like i said that is possible but if that is the case then good bullet dodged you dont want to be picked by someone who is using that as their picking criteria if that was how he made his decision then you two were not compatible

however more likely he is just telling you hes entering or moving towards an exclusive relationship with someone else so he is ending contact with you and no longer available to date casually

sleeping with him that night was unlikely to change the situation he still probably would have continued on with someone else

you really need to accept that its the truth the rest of this is your internal bullshit and baggage and you need to get a grip on this
i said about sleeping with him that night was unlikely to change the situation he still probably would have continued on with someone else you just would have been hurting more when he did 

i also dont sleep with people on the first date as a matter of principle i want to take the time to reflect on my experience with them and think about the vibe check before i climb into bed if someone rejects me for this reason that is fine because im confident with my choice nevertheless

why are you fixating on sex this was not about sex thats your anxiety and insecurities but it has little to do with this you had one good date that fizzled out thats all thats very very normal 

seriously this isnt a healthy perspective on dating at all go talk to a therapist and work on owning your own power to choose people and express your interest stop talking to your mother if her advice is straight out of 1940
you did nothing wrong he was actively he met someone else he may have liked you very much he liked someone else more 

sleeping with him that night was unlikely to change the situation only make it hurt more

its also possible he felt he was purchasing sex with his dinner in which case you dodged a bullet  

either way this was a nice date and appropraite ending to a connection you didnt have sex you didnt want to have nothing is wrong here thems the breaks
this relationship is over 

the quicker you get yourself the support you need and get an enforceable legal agreement in place the better off your kids will be

all the studies suggest that separation when your children are under 4 is way less damaging than doing it later get this work done now use couples counselling to negotiate the end speak to a lawyer get an individual therapist involved for yourself and the support you need
apparently there is no other way for women to support one another and build a vibrant community and family except to surrender to this mans and his gods version of servitude to men

what this really tells you sadly is this man has no idea how to maintain healthy relationships or lead a fulfilling life as part of a community except to coerce a woman into doing that work for him
make a pillow wall or get a bigger bed

but also he has to wake you up

he just has to nothing else is going to work except to make you uncomfortable whining about you being not nice while youre unconscious is not an excuse you can and should make some suggestions to address this but he has also gotta be willing to advocate for his own sleep if he stopped moving pushed back or woke you up when you disturbed him your habits while unconscious would be far more likely to adjust if he always accommodates these behaviours while youre asleep youll keep doing them while youre asleep because the asleep version of you doesnt have a problem he has to give the sleeping version some consequences for bad behaviour
end all contact with her and get therapy immediately

youre hitting yourself that is either a serious mental illness or an attempt to manipulate her

this isnt about all women this is about you your inability to make healthy choices for yourself right now  including the choice to stop dating her so stop dating her and please get help for the selfharming behaviours they are not her fault they are something you need to address for yourself
there is nothing to do except say to your gf i think hes flirting with you do you think hes flirting with you youre entitled to share your opinion and to listen respectfully to hers that is the end of your power

and then let her deal with it trust her judgement or dont date her its her classmate they are her boundaries to enforce when she deems it necessary and in the way she feels is appropriate and right for her 

dont expect your young gf to go around put other men on blast just because youre having a bad feels get a grip manage your own shit and expect your gf to do what she deems necessary and appropriate
do you think youre friends if so id recommend you stop considering this a job and instead call it a favour or hobby for which you might be compensated 

decide in your own head how much youre willing to do without being paid be at peace with that and then once you hit that either say no or ask for payment 

either that or tell him youre not available for this work any longer as you need to focus on other lines of income but value his friendship its totally fine to turn down work because the terms just dont feel right to you
yeah she knows and if she stopped when she was caught then youve called out the behaviour as much as productively possible

dont get hung up on battles you cannot win if youre gonna stay in this relationship save your strength the fights that matter if she stopped this one is as resolved as its every going to be
exactly an apology in this case is just a pointless attempt at a power play an apology that everyone involves knows is a lie changes nothing its just score keeping if op is gonna stay in this relationship shes gonna need to learn to pick her battles asap
what is the line you think can be drawn here

you have to force your mother to pretend to apologize for harassing me or you have to be willing to end all contact and probably your childrens contact with your mother if she wont apologize to me

the first one is pointless theatre and the second one is a pretty excessive demand for bf and his children to go no contact with his mother even though bf has never actually chosen to introduce op to his mother  if that is what op really needs  for this woman to not be in her life at all  she is probably headed for a breakup because while that is a totally valid need its not likely to be one her partner is going to immediately agree to this toxic unhinged woman is present in his life and hes can demand she treat op with respect when he includes op but he cannot perfectly control his mother if shes inclined to this degree of nonsense
absolutely do not reach out to her yourself ever this is not your battle to fight this is 100 between him and his mother

however he doesnt control her he can create boundaries he can say if you dont apologize i wont talk to you anymore but frankly that is a waste of a boundary the boundary hes actually going to need is if you cannot be respectful of my new gf when i am ready to introduce you to her then you will see less of me and of the grandchildren until youre willing to behave with respect towards important people in our lives

of course she should apologize but shes not gonna and she wouldnt mean it anyways you cant fix other people you dont get to communicate through idiocy and insanity there is nothing to be worked through here youre not gonna move past this this doesnt get resolved with an apology youre gonna live with a toxic and sorta crazy person in your life unless he chooses to cut all contact with her

hes fundamentally correct he cannot and should not be having this fight until he needs to have this fight you either need to trust him to step up when it becomes necessary or you need to leave this relationship
you know this is a you problem and that you need to work on it if you want happy and healthy relationships in your life with her or anyone 

if that isnt enough for you how can anything we say fix this

speak to a therapist if youre unable to address these feelings and intrusive thoughts yourself
go low contact 

there is nothing to gain from these relationships you only show up for them out of obligation learn to manage those feelings of duty in healthier ways

dont fight who they are just minimize the damage they are able to do to you as an adult
nah you were right to cut him off

he was either inconsiderate or not that into you or both invest your time elsewhere
the issue is you dont like her boundaries you keep pushing against them which is why she is further clarifying what behaviour she is willing to accept from you at this time either you do x or im walking away is a boundary a firm one what you are saying here is that she really should walk away from you which means you are also just as responsible for walking away from her at this point 

stop having a conversation this doesnt require a compromise your accusations are totally out of whack with reality she doesnt have a problem you do if you think shes doing these nasty things to you then there is truly nothing else to talk about you solve your problem by ending the connection that doesnt suit your needs
that doesnt seem fair im not selling an ebook or a program or any crypto at all
while she might not be perfect youre being really really immature and resentful about this you need to end this its not on her you have to end it because you are not okay with it

it makes perfect sense that she may be looking forward to meeting you and possibly seeing if there is something there in a few months when youre in the uk but unwilling to commit to you at this point

at this point she is offering you friendship it is valid if she decides that friendship doesnt include details about her dating life some friendships dont she has told you that you are not exclusive and that she is single which is what she needs to be clear about if she not telling you about other dates she may be on that is because she has judged probably correctly that you are overinvested in this connection and will not handle that information well

this is all on you man you dont have to like her choices but her choices sound reasonable and yours dont youre judging her extremely harshly for not being willing to commit to an ldr with a person shes never met for many months thats not hostagetaking or manipulative thats sanity you havent been friendzoned you have been person i met online only and will not meet in person for many months zoned because that is what you are right now she sounds pretty clear about what she is offering you right now which is not exclusivity because of course she isnt you live an ocean away and have for months and will for several months more
you majorly overinvested in an ldr and youre blaming her for not taking responsibility for your feelings and making it her job to end this connection to protect you from your own poor choices

thats not fair its your job to end this if it doesnt work for you 

her boundaries with you right now make a lot sense  you are not committed to one another youve never even met in person compatibility is still a big question mark no matter how much you enjoy speaking to one another she knows youre overinvesting so shes keeping you on an information diet about her personal life she is telling you to either get a grip and respect her boundaries or opt out

your expectations for a level of commitment from a woman you havent even met are extremely unrealistic if this connection is unhealthy for you or making you unhappy you need to leave it its not all her fault that you wont do the right thing for you
it sounds like a 30yearold man who is mooching off his stepdad is also now taking advantage of your vulnerability to get yet more financial and practical support for himself 

it sounds like a 30yearold man who is mooching off his stepdad is also now taking advantage of your vulnerability to get yet more financial and practical support for himself  living environment to another slightly less toxic and unsafe living environment but youre still not where you need to be
your reaction to this was pretty intense for someone who says shes okay with porn and understands this isnt cheating 

the obvious problem here is that either he lied or he is so unaware of his own actions and motivations that he couldnt provide an answer for why he screenshots these

i have no issues with porn but i find it immature and boundarybusting when people repurpose social media images as if they are porn those women arent producing those images for that reason or consenting plenty of women out there are there is no reason for it unless you enjoy the violation of women who are not consenting to be porn starts plus its just childish in my opinion

what he did was probably within normal but lots of normal things are shitty and id be concerned by his lack of honesty andor selfawareness about this habit
dude you came for advice youve been given it

im not getting into what is the correct amount to charge them because you have completely missed the window to discuss payment you claim to full accept that fact but youre still trying to wiggle outta it the fact that february was within the initial agreement is why that was the appropriate window

were not brokers for room rentals in your area were talking about the relationship you can ask for whatever amount you feel youre entitled to but youre likely to damage the relationship thats the advice its not about the dollar value you want to assign
still gonna go with no but also who the fuck cares if it does seriously how is this beneficial to you to give your mental energy too youve already done the only thing you can do short of ending the friendship entirely learn to let go
finding the baby voice unpleasant is a totally different opinion to express than asking her to silence or stop her affectionate text messages 

one is about style the other is about substance 

by all means give her notes on the style honestly the baby voice thing has just never been cute for me ive always found it a bit offputting but i wouldnt suggest you in the early days tell her that she should hold back on expressing her desire to be with you you dont seem to be describing bombarding here youre describing one text where she tells you she cares for you and misses you
are you really that special that much a unique niche of an employment path really

because i have a super niche path and career and i can still think of three people a few years younger than me who have made very very similar steps it never occurred to me to consider they were copying me we have similar goals and skill sets they are my professional colleagues not my mimics

you are already doing the only thing you can do if this annoys you keeping the information you give him to a minimum besides that id advise you to get over yourself there is nothing to deal with except to decide if youre willing to put a positive word in when asked or not
youre going to damage this relationship if you try to ask for payment for a gift youve already given to someone you say you basically consider a family member

its as simple as that there is no magical way to demand payment now that wouldnt be hurtful they probably would accommodate you but it probably would damage the relationship because you handled the communication so poorly 

the time to revisit the could chuck us some money conversation from a place of respect was like february you missed your window by a mile
i offered to pay for storage unit but the argument was why buy stuff if youre just going to store it but i like having rare sets to rebuild on occasion

right so this is a thing to revisit as you take a deeper dive in your shared financial life

but while doing so you need to recognize that while collecting or hoarding may serve a positive emotional need for you it may just as legitimately cause anxiety and distress in her to see more things piling up those are very real feelings you both have to be willing to acknowledge and address
stop seeing this as a money problem and start seeing this as a feelings problem

your gf doesnt feel secure with your shared saving plansgoals

that is a problem worthy of addressing her feelings and opinions on that are fundamentally valid and worthy of your attention and time if you want to marry her you either need to increase those goalsplans or by help her gain more understanding of them so she can feel confident in the shared choices there are some financial advisors who specialize in helping couples have these conversations and building the emotional aspects of financial literacy

the money isnt the core problem here the problem is that the money brings forward very different feelings in you both in order to build a life where she feels secure and you feel trusted and happy you need to come together to acknowledge and manage those feelings

secondly and i could be wrong here but perhaps recognize that both of your nerdy hobbies dont just take up money they take up space collecting isnt just about money its about space and lifestyle she may genuinely dislike these hobbies but you still need to be reasonable enough to realize that a lego collection impacts her in ways sports tickets do not my ex was always on me about how i didnt respect his miniatures but i had no problem with him being nerdy and liking minis what i didnt like was the fact that he hoarded so many nerdy objects that my home was frequently uncomfortable and uninviting and he never parted with any of them accumulation without consideration was the issue not the money
i dont care much for any of the people involved here and there is a lot of blame to go around but they were all responding to understandable stupid harmful pressures

it does hit hard against that dichotomy want a happy life long marriage pick the adult woman you respect as an equal who really understands your goals and your values
who is keeping the list

today we are

battery half of

water

the plot of the lion king or maybe just the villain arch the minions its a bit unclear
please reread my post i suggest several avenues to bring these issues forward
your bad feels are not the biggest issue here that the university can help you address  the issue here is he is not doing his job and he is not being respectful when he communicates with or about students

you need to frame your issues in a way that makes it easier for the school to understand and address
i would jus speak to your student ombudsperson directly to get clarity on what is expected of this helper and what your actual obligations to him are 

in the meantime block this mans number

fundamentally there could be reasonable causes for an adult instructor to call an adult student in university the boundaries arent the same as they are in high school however without further instructions i think youre well within your own rights to withdraw consent from this particular person reaching out to your personal cell phone

edit the fact you met with him for an extended period and none of your classes got book ie the outcome of the meeting wasnt achieved is actually probably your stronger objective complaint against him remember youre not just a student deserving of respect youre also a customer and this guy is giving you shitty service start with your ombudsperson or get advice from your student union even your program director is a another possible avenue but id get my ducks in a row before speaking with then
i totally believed this happened you can pop cyst like this during sex or riding a bike or getting outta bed too fast but it was not for the reasons he thinks 

it is so fucking rare for husbands to show up at all when their wife is in hospital that any one who does a smidge more than drop off clean undies a magazine is treated like a god damn prince some nurses are as guilty of this shit as anyone 

so it wasnt about your dick ya dumbass you were getting wildly praised and rewarded for the baseline of care that woman are expected to provide without comment or complaint
and if you can at all help if do not be sold off into a politically advantageous marriage while still a teenager to a man a decade older who is definitely not over his ex
if these mens version of  a traditional woman requires that woman be in poverty and disempowered socially maybe there is something exploitative about wanting that kind of tradition
how can you make it a nonissue that your husband is spiteful and doesnt listen to you or have any respect for your anxiety about money

you cant not alone you feel rejected because you are being rejected and ignored not just misunderstood

communication takes two people you cannot fix it entirely on your own the question you need to ask yourself right now is if you have a partner or not in solving this problem
thats because shes bitter and hit the wall so they dont have to listen to her anymore s 

their system is flawless anyone who disagrees with them is always oldfatugly anyways
dont try to jump the queue to become girlfriend by being friend with benefit that almost never works and it shouldnt you cannot be next in line for a relationship with someone

if he wanted to date you he would he doesnt 

what youre considering would be harmful for you you dont want to be his fwb so dont agree to it only pretending to be an fwb while trying to wiggle your way into something more is dishonest and unkind either say no or admit to him what you really want
youre arguing that you see the exact same percentage of women imagining the man in the service role is seriously flirting with them sure we cannot read minds we can read context like the context of someone being paid to be a pleasant sales associate or server

because i spend a lot of time with women and while i have definitely heard a sales guy or bartender referred to as sucha flirt not a single woman i have met was confused about his role as a service provider

there are plenty of errors that are just human but this one when it comes to flirting vs service is just not a 5050 cognitive error
he told me that even watching porn when you have a boyfriend should be considered cheating so naturally i would assume that the same should apply to him

if none of the other reasons cut it for you this one obviously should he shamed you and verbally abused you for far far less than he deliberately did behind your back and then he lied about it in the lamest possible way he thinks youre a moron

whether or not you or i or he thinks this is cheating doesnt even matter it doesnt have to be cheating to be totally unacceptable dont get pulled into that argument with anyone this is all a very dangerous double standard from a man who is giving every signal he is willing to abuse you 

you dont owe him a conversation this isnt a debate this is him getting dumped for being dishonest and a dangerous partner keep yourself safe end it quickly and cleanly get rid of this man
you are not completely innocent here because you violated the agreement when ella said she had caught feelings your responsibility was to say i understand but since that has happened i am no longer comfortable continuing with the sexual relationship

youre not a monster but dont get attached is a hope its an intention its not a thing that can be promised it is not a boundary the boundary is if one of us catches feels we stop fucking

so you had the exact same responsibility as ella had to end it when that happened  i would actually say you had the greater responsibility at that point since she had just told you that her motivations and judgements were clouded by her emotions and her attachment to you continuing to have sex with her at that point was selfish and naive your actions were not reflecting the agreement you said you wanted when you continued to meet up and have sex with ella after that conversation 

youre not a villain but you did fuck it up you had a clear line with ella at which all sexual connection should have ended and you both blew right past that line maybe not everything ella thinks of you now is reasonable but it was not kind you should have done better
you need to just walk away

he may be a lovely partner in some ways but he is absolutely not capable of offering you a relationship you should feel at all secure in and hes been dishonest from the beginning trying to manipulate you into accepting something he knew was a rather lousy offer

this isnt a situation where everything is great except this this is him this is a guy who dove into dating while still fullon living with his ex gave totally false timelines introduced his kids way too early and has not been prioritizing his separation or creating a healthy home life for his kids

this may be a good guy making shit choices but more likely its a rather shitty guy making rather shitty choices

breaks are bullshit they are slowmotion breakups that just prolong the drama its time to be broken up tell him hes welcome to call you if he gets his act together and starts to actually live separately from his ex and has the time to date and be a coparent but dont hold your breath far more likely hell move on to another young thing he can manipulate into accepting this shitty situation for a few months
its a neutral term  if you value your friends as friends what was their argument for misogyny that men didnt actually want her friendship so calling them that was offensive or a mislabel 

i think there can be a lot toxicity in fwbs situations because people forget to be friendly and end up viewing the other more like an amateur sex worker instead of buddy you share a fun activity with or they define down what would be objectively called casually dating into a fwbs situation but in my experience those issues are also pretty gender neutral men and woman both those mistakes
hed never be so beta as to allow something like over a decade of data and welldocumented trends to penetrate his skull not when he saw with his own two eyes how the paid server smiled demurely at him not merely performing  her job in the expected style but clearly begging for the leadership and protection of a man
there are cultural norms there are affects

there is no more truth in his racist delusions about what those norms actually represent in individual human relationships then there is truth is his understanding of human biology
ironically he did figure out anal tho
and with a healthy dose of idiots not being able to tell the difference between customer service and women being super into them

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

this guy is telling you stories stories about how he think its permissible to treat others believe him 

he will turn around one of these days and declare you are just like all the others  and he will decide probably without telling you that he can treat you like the others then he will tell you youre not entitled to be hurt or angry with him because he warned you 

lots of people score a bit higher in sociopathic tendencies and recognize that means they need to work a little bit harder to empathize or to keep the ego in check people who struggle with this are pretty safe they compensate and focus on what healthy relationships really take people who say well this is just how i am and now you know fair warning are not
 you dont compromise 

you trust him so trust him to select his own friends and not hook up with strangers 

if you think he can be persuaded to cheat then you dont trust him and shouldnt date him  hes a 20 year old adult not an 8 eight year old on the playground being bullied into eating dirt or some shit if he doesnt want to cheat he wont
emasculated is one of those toxic traps where the more you help him the more blame youll catch

continue to be realistic most entry level jobs are easier to get when youre physically present there is little reason for someone to want to employ an 18 year old who cant start tomorrow thats usually the appeal of teenage employees 

besides that just listen agree that it does suck and it is disappointing  because it is that what it is not is a reflection on him as a man reminder him this has nothing to do with his gender  and even less to do with yours hes a person not a potential provider
she didnt want to talk to a group of people who had said nasty things about her

this is not rocket science youre being a weirdo who is making it all about sex when its about not talking to mean people who have insulted or shamed you previously if she has an ex who is a basically decent person or perfectly reasonable to not be nervous about him but to be nervous and want to avoid a group of bullies 

what went down with her made sense your reaction was intense and really strange you need to figure out what was going on inside your own head that led to this her explanations for what went on in her head pass the sniff test just fine
its honestly terrifying where americans even ones who might consider themselves democrats think the centre is 

i remember back in the day trying to explain to a few american friends that obamas policies were not left of centre in any other established democracy very centrist even sometimes right of centre which was a large part of his global popularity 

but the far right nutters just saw a black man lost their shit completely and now here we all are
shes not your problem its not her job to fix the issues in your relationship shes not your ally and youre not trying to help her out youre desperately trying to manipulate her into helping you out because you and your bf cannot find an agreement that works 

your problem is that you are choosing to stay in a relationship with someone you believe is cheating on you

stop pretending to be worried about her wellbeing get a damn clue and realize youre the poor girl involved in this situation who isnt behaving in healthy ways or with any selfrespect

if you cannot resolved this by speaking with him then it cannot be resolved
stick to the no 

this was a rather transparent move on her part to force a meet with the children to justify her curiosity about you 

you and your bf have not decided to make a relationship with the children part of this relationship yet continue to not include the children in your plans when you do decide you are both ready for that step then you and she may need to meet briefly while custody is exchanged that is sufficient she gets to shake your hand not break bread with you 

whats best for the children is you declining as much as possible to play her game or become more a character in her little drama
hes 22 he is not a boy he doesnt need to be handled hes not a toddler going through a phase where he find poop hilarious 

it is completely realistic to expect a 22 year old to be honest about their own interest in and opinions on porn use while in a relationship and to keep a promise if they make it

men are people not dumb animals who cannot help themselves
he doesnt agree with you about porn he never has he thinks its acceptable in a relationship 

if you want a relationship with someone who doesnt watch porn you need to date someone else 

if you want to stay with him youre going to have to find a way to deal with this as a legitimate and transparent disagreement instead of a hard boundary
this man is too old to not understand that not everyone has a close or meaningful relationships with their parents and adult siblings

and five months is quick for this kind of pressure and judgment 

what is weird is that he is not making the effort to listen to you and i understand who is actually important in your life
as sad as it is if she needs to break up over this youd be wise to just accept that and wish her well

she withheld information that was clearly relevant to her about her virginity and sexual experience for five years 

youre not the asshole she needs do the work herself to move past this if she is not willing or able to do that then you need to have the strength to face the end
i wouldnt date this man

hes telling stories about money mean untrue stories about you because of his choices about his money 

its one thing to be bad at budgeting but telling mean stories that its someone elses fault that youre spending what youre spending is a serious character flaw and one that will likely impact other areas of his life too itll be your fault he doesnt have enough free time your fault hes gaining weight your fault the house is cluttered with things your fault the grocery bill is too high 

be very very wary of signing up for a lifetime with someone who externalizes blame like this his gfwife will always be the most conveniently located external person to take the blame for his actions

romantic intimacy not requiring a big budget is not your real core problem here
this is shady and i wouldnt like it

but his answer is plausible and im not surprised he tried to manage you this way

this whole exchange was deeply immature on both sides
talk to her as everyone is saying try some more actually relaxing games

lots of gamers  men and women  think the golden rules change when they are gaming and that angry outbursts and namecalling are part of the culture you need to be able to say clearly that its not i love to game but ive had to have a few tough conversations with friends that if being able to yell or call people nasty names or throw things in anger is an important part of thier gaming experience  then they dont to game with me 

im an adult who likes to game if you are a gamer because you want to behave like a toddler sometimes please play with the other oversized toddlers
it sounds like he feels he has done nothing wrong and broken no agreements with you

he deleted the texts for six months 

he knew damn well he was violating the spirit of his exclusive relationship agreement with op even if he tries to claim he wasnt technically doing anything wrong trust doesnt work on technicalities trust was broken here
why do you need to be the bigger person

youre not holding on to the past youre addressing an ongoing issue with his choices

he continues to bask in the attention of this woman who behaved inappropriately for months and who he only stopped enjoying the attention from when he got caught he knew he violating boundaries with these conversations  you know he knew because he was deleting the messages and telling her they were a problem but not telling her to stop it 

if a person who has a long history of ignoring my boundaries and flirting with me in direct disrespect of the relationship they know damn well im in climbs onto the treadmill beside mine i wrap up my workout and leave that person is not my friend
it is reasonable to assume from this conversation hes at least quite aware of it and has seen some

what you need to ask is if he engages with it regularly and thinks its acceptable porn consumption because you dont think its acceptable and you dont want to date someone who ever engages with it
good luck with it  and with the therapy

i think your boundaries are the right ones but your fears are a bit extreme and they are making this harder for your to deal with than it needs to be youre getting overworked and spun out and drawn to extreme cases you need to reign that in and realize your boundaries are important and valid even if watching this porn doesnt necessarily mean your bf is ever going to even look at an actual human child in that way once in his life its still not okay you dont have to be okay with it
if you watch porn that features childrens bodies  even if they are illustrated  i cannot date you i feel too strongly that that is completely wrong to do i expect you to answer honestly is this porn you engage with and think is acceptable
first you get into therapy you work on better managing your anxiety the odds of there being immediate risk or danger to anyone on this topic are rather low 

ethics in porn creation and consumption is important to me as well i would also draw the line with my partners if they were engaging with illustrated porn of prepubescent bodies its not acceptable to me even as fantasy even as an illustration to contextualize a childs body as a sexual object its a hard red line for me i wont date that person 

but like your cnc kink i would not assume that porn consumption meant pedophilic criminal behaviour was terribly likely just that i dont want to date someone who doesnt hold themselves to a higher standard when it comes to consuming pornography and framing their own sexual identity through what they consume 

youre going to need to revisit this conversation with him but i think you need some tactics to deal with anxiety before youre going to make it a productive one
if hes testing you hes validationseeking and validation seeking is knowing how to communicate to get what you want its just a toxic way to go about it

in the end you have to decide what you want in a relationship but if i was feeling i was having arguments multiple times a week after only two months i wouldnt be keen to continue either you need to be able to reframe these conversations and bring the temperature down or youre in for a hell of a lot of needless drama in my opinion
if hes seeking attention and validation by picking petty fights with you thats pretty much the worst possible dynamic for someone who has a history of feeling smothered in relationships even if the other fights get resolved easily enough that would be a real concern to me i dont keep people around who use negative behaviours to try to get my attention 

if youre now in ldr after the move i absolutely wouldnt hold out much hope for it getting better 

this is two months this is you both on your best behaviour its not great
i often joke that no one who lives in toronto drives in toronto we drive only to get out of toronto 

i owed a car for years and walked 45 mins to work on most days could i have driven it to it 10 mins on most days absolutely would it have been worth it absolutely not
hah it really isnt but i do think were under a lot more construction downtown than ottawa is thats a lot of the dust in the downtown i have that experience every time i visit new york and the new yorkers are all like how do you like the big city and i think i know for a fact you can keep cities olders and wetter than this one cleaner than this one but its great
youre unlikely to acquire the gf object to service your emotional needs like its a rare drop or legendary weapon or a partyplanner or a substitute mommy

the older you get the more women are going to be turned off by this attitude towards them likewise your inability to form friendships with women you dont find sexually appealing always a bit of concern it means you are not able to value a woman as a person unless there is a chance they will be servicing your gf object requirements

youve had a relatively normal amount of dating experience for an 18 year old thats not the problem the attitude is

you need to fill your life better with or without a gf this dissatisfaction and any childhood drama is your job to address not the gf objects job build a life another person would actually want to share and be interested in and build relationships that arent based solely on getting your needs met but on equal exchange and mutual enjoyment
play stupid games win stupid prizes

some things are only fun as fantasies its okay to learn that 

also stop thinking about these potential thirds as if they arent real people with their own agency just because shes in an open relationship doesnt mean she had wanted to fuck the two of you 

keep the conversation shelved full stop it doesnt need to be more complicated than that just because someone seems convenient doesnt mean you should fuck them
you put your foot down

and if youre ready for a divorce go ahead with that and get a lawyer involved 

this is now crossed the line from him feeling whatever hes feeling to him acting in a way that is emotionally abusive

the constant accusations of cheating without him willing to do anything to address his negative thoughts or behaviours or bad feelings is unacceptable it is abuse he needs to take some damn responsibility for himself and stop adding this issue entirely to your workload youre already doing plenty if he actually wants his feelings and concerns addressed he has to be part of the work to resolve this and not the abuser

you cannot prove a negative you are know youre not cheating you know you dont the time in the day to cheat you cannot fix this for him you can recommend couples counselling but go in very cautiously because there is a real risk here that he wants to abuse you  that that is the point and not the accidental outcome here

dont consent to cameras or to the invasion of your privacy until hes 100 committed to doing the work to get past his own bullshit if you do he will very very likely use this access to escalate his abuse not resolve it you seriously need to be considering your safety first and his feelings second

the sad reality is very few 40 years old are choosing partners in their early 20s because they want an emotionally healthy relationship built on mutual respect possible but not likely

and the stereotype is also sadly true he probably knows you dont have 10 mins in the day to cheat the most likely thing here is that he is projecting and is either cheating himself or wishing he was
most relationships dont last forever

but you dont stand a chance of noticing a good relationship when youve got one if you dont change these bad habits 

take a deep breath and see this for what it is this relationship isnt perfect this relationship might not last however if you want to give it the best shot to last or even to end on good terms you need to change your habits and find ways to manage your anxiety that should be the bulk of the work youre doing to maintain this
thats nice

hes naive dont take on his education

consider this a learning experience you need to laugh at what you cannot and should not do anything about youre taking this too onto yourself
sure

but cities that dont prioritize walkability bike lanes and green spaces dont see those same benefits and then there is the increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases from dense urban living which increases the risk of stroke heart disease lung cancer and asthma

there is a lot of evidence that living in cities  especially welldesigned and governed ones  is a net win for individual human health but there is no reason to pretend there we are not making some trades offs and that really we need to make larger changes so people are able to be healthier regardless of the community they are living in
you absolutely can tell her i wouldnt id go and enjoy her company  consider it a gift youre giving her  and id tell her later in a few days that im played out on tea and want to make a different tradition offer one or two other suggestions for a new event or activity you can do together on special days

its not untrue its just framing the message in the least hurtful way sending her scrambling the day before is not terribly kind
this is the answer dense urban environments dont have many health benefits but this is the one they do generally less time spent commuting and commuteserrands where walking is economical 

toronto is also exceptionally diverse  even in comparison to other major cities on the planet  so youre looking at a totally cornucopia of different eating habits and cultures around food 

if you drove out north to the small towns in ontario youd see a difference although broadly speaking canadians are slightly less obese than american counterparts probably a lot of reasons some just around portions sure but also i expect that better access to preventive medical care means we may get the heads up earlier if were at risk
that doesnt change your responsbilty to this relationship

your responsibility is to end it

its not reasonable or kind to sit back and say well he hasnt left me yet so its his own damn fault hes still dating an addict its not all his fault you fully share the blame when you allow a relationship to continue where you know for a fact you are not offering them what they say they need

youve already made it clear youre not going to accept this ultimatum

which means you must end the relationship nothing else is acceptable
yes the relationship should end if you dont want to abandon your lifestyle of using 

its really not any more complicated than that youre not dedicated to your sobriety he wants a sober partner its time for one of you to end this 

its not all on him its your job too dont encourage him to leave walk away because you are not offering him what he has told you he needs this is on you stop trying to make it all his job to leave you he should but youre just as responsible for the end as he is
extremely skewed this is a relationship your wife has formed its not a mechanic for humans 

im concerned you continue to gloss over the fact you are eavesdropping that needs to stop completely and forever the only information you are privy to about her therapy is the information she shares with you
youre missing mine

there is no situation in which is acceptable for you to sit and listen to your wifes therapy like this without both her permission and the therapists 

you describing hearing way to much and forming far too deep an opinion for it to be accidental and even if you insist this was accident you dont appear to realize it cannot happen again

we dont know the therapist sucks right now neither do you we do know you are not holding yourself to an appropriate standard when it comes to your wifes privacy because you have told us you are not
this is staggeringly inappropriate and disrespectful why do think this is an okay way for you to behave do you sit beside her at every dental cleaning to hear what the dentist says read all of her emails examine her shit before shes allowed to flush

you need to quit this

you do not know what is going on with your wife but i dont know what is going on with you but you have some of your own shit to figure out here this is not cool
hit the breaks hard and put these assumptions aside

and absolutely stop eavesdropping leave the house if you cant help but overhear shit that shouldnt even need to be said

you dont know what goes on in that room your envisioning is counterproductive and unhelpful

it is extremely unlikely the therapist drastically changed their approach unless your wife askedindicated they do so

what is far far more likely is your wife changed what she is listening to and how she is engaging with the therapy

instead ask your wife pointed questions about what tools she was recommended for this situation encourage her to ask her therapist for tactics or techniques focus on how that approach was initially helpful to her in the early stages her time was not a waste you saw the things of value she was getting out of it previously

finally recognize that a therapist saying yes that is difficult and yes that does suck is perfectly valid and helpful and that your wife was entitled to change how she engaged with therapy

you cannot manage your way out of every stressor and difficulty in life sometimes shit just sucks for a while dont assume your wife needs to be further fixed or just has to do better that sounds to me like a bit of toxicity positivity sneaking in what she might actually need from you as well at the moment is just the validation that yes this is hard hard things are hard sometimes there isnt much better to be had or to be done and we just live through the hard bits
just decline the future plans if you want to continue to rebuild a relationship with olivia invite her to oneonone things and not double dates 

i wouldnt inform her unless she asked
this is what a responsible civil defence looks like when the accused is definitely guilty of way way worse than the issue at hand 

they just need the court to put a  on this one so they can go home without admitting to something thatll get him more than a fine
yeah dont do it

just tell her youre really happy for her but you have confirmed to attend an engagement party now and arent able to make it at that time

try to book another time to see her in the near future  maybe make some nice oneonone time planned with her during your mothers day trip

you can also tell her that while she may be ready to forgive her bf youre fed up with him treating your sister like dirt and will be minimizing the time you spend near him
this is manipulation while it is true that anyone can and should leave a marriage that isnt working when someone is constantly holding a gun to the head of the relationship threatening to shoot if they dont get everything they want then youre not in a partnership anymore youre in a hostage situation

dont tolerate the word divorce being thrown around lightly if he says he wants a divorce tell him he is welcome to one  if he wants out you want him to get out  but he is not welcome to constantly threaten you with one just to get his way
tell him it doesnt matter if its love or lust its unwelcome

this is boundarybusting unwelcome behavior if he wants to respect your marriage and respect you as an individual then you expect him to respect you right now when you ask him to quit this permanently 

if he doesnt immediately correct himself or if he begs or bargains or tries to say youve just misunderstood then he values his idea being in love but not lust with you over his actual friendship with the human being you actually are in which case get rid of him
own your own shit 

i would appreciate it if youd get a checkup i dont want to keep talking about the maybes i care about you and it would make me feel more secure to know

he may still say no but at least youll have been honest about what you are actually feeling and not beating around the bush trying to make him feel the same way you do
yeah no

im sticking with my reasonable assumption that he is making the purchase and they are paying him back the comment above refers to them still needing to pay him back even if they couldnt go because they are not refundable

hes the one with the membership so hes making the purchase to get a better rate hes tasked with buying the tickets they are paying him back for their share

this op would be very very clear if he was the one paying for all three of them each time hes not gonna let that be unclear if he was gifting his buddies to a trip to the movies once a month
probably and if it was him going about his previous plans is the best way to deny her the control and not let this tactic work 

i mean i wouldnt want to date someone i suspected of that but short of breaking up that is his only option its not like he can force her to go to work
it may be petty to force a verbal agreement i actually like usqitten suggestion here way more than mine do that
listen to upurveyorofsocks this is not how socks are to be purveyed
i dont want to turn this in to a family vacation to serve my own needs

okay but consider how that conversation was from her perspective that is exactly what it seemed you were trying to achieve even though some of the boys werent free anyways that would be a very reasonable pov for her to have here she planned x trip with her and one son and friends and you tried to turn it into y whole family trip you said y was important and how you wanted to spend the money then you didnt answer but im assuming here you did nothing else about actually making y happen but remain quietly upset and asked no further questions about her plans for x

look shes not here to give advice too id be telling her to validate your feelings and recognize the important of shared meaningful activities but youre the one here and youre fighting the wrong battle and not working for or planning or advocating for the family vacation you told her you valued

take it to the counsellor if you need help getting back on track
he should be ashamed for leaving cum socks shoved in the couch cushions

if he is feeling shame he is responding like a rational person to be caught out being an inconsiderate slob dont let him pretend hes so stupid that he didnt know this wasnt respectful behaviour in shared spaces

you already apologized for making jokes and making light of the situation you can repeat that if youd like however his behaviour does need to change you being insensitive doesnt mean he gets to shove x many more socks into the couch you both know that 

youve got other issues in your relationship that got pulled into this fight acknowledge that say it out loud you know youre both frustrated about other things as well when it comes to sex but for this very specific subject youd like him to agree there will be no more cum socks shoved in the couch cushions
and what did she say about the idea of also planning a family vacation with you and the rest of the kids have you taken any steps yourself or put any of your energy into this or suggested any possible future plans on this

if you want to plan something as a couple or a family vacation then you should do that and advocate for that with her but you can value that and your time together as a family without going on the attack with other plans she might also value especially if cost isnt a key issue here

trying to turn something which someone else invited her and one son on into a family vacation to serve your emotional needs when some of the other kids arent even free to go anyways was not a great move your feelings are valid but that doesnt mean every single way you may handle them is particularly wise 

i think you reacted from a really emotional place understandable but not entirely fair and her response was predictable if she had wanted you to come she had the opportunity to frame it that way she wanted it to be okay that youre not included 

you need to back this way up valuing having a family vacation is just dandy only deciding you value that because you felt left out in this case and dont like this plan is hurtful
hes a mooch 

38yearold men arent this stupid unless its a useful tactic 

invite him to prioritize himself fully you look for someone who treats you like a partner not a nicer place to crash for free than mommies
no kiddo it isnt gay people are plenty capable of being sexist racsit andor homophobic assholes and while no one can stop you people are gonna call you an asshole thats the consequence of being an asshole

on the amazingly slim chance youre not just a troll its good your friend knew you well enough not to bother having this pointless argument with your selfabsord ass
this might point to a more basic inability to communicate like ive said its not work you can do alone its a job you have to be a fully committed part of but if she cannot do her part as well it doesnt resolve and then youre just both get stuck in a place where youre just not compatible

good luck with it
right the joke is that you think other gay men lack selfrespect and that they choices they make for themselves are rude selfabsorbed and just stereotypes

and you think that is totally funny and not at all judgemental or homophobic

like we cannot stop you from thinking that but its boneheaded and wrong and if i hung out with you id be saying yuck that that pile of bullshit
so whats the joke exactly

is the joke that other gay men are too feminine to hang with the boys that they are too flirty too sexually aggressive too woke too annoying 

what makes the other gay men one of the bad ones and you not one of those

cause i think when you try to explain that you might realize when its not really all that funny id never describe myself as one of the good bisexuals because most bisexuals are fantastic and assholes can be assholes because they are assholes not because they are bi
does he where

theyre nonrefundable paul and mike said they wouldnt mind paying their share anyway but i bet they wouldnt like it if it actually happened

the anyways in there certainly implies they regularly pay him back for the tickets he books for the group
youre in the wrong for believing this person is a good partner for you 

even if he started out with this kind of pigheadedness its been a year and a half and hes developed zero respect or appreciation for what you study and do thats an even bigger issue in my opinion than the compatibility one
that doesnt really address more than a few words of what i actually said 

there were emotions at play here that you steamrolled over and left your gf feeling less connected and valued

you dont need to buy her takeaway to be nice but sheesh could you really not figure out how to be any nicer than this
you both kinda suck today

she should have respected the first no but you sound like youre nickelanddiming her when she feels unwell and im not surprised she felt hurt by that likewise im not sure why she wouldnt have offered to order for you both

you do need to be open to joining your partner in small things that bring that joy sometimes maybe this wasnt the time but there do need to be times or even the most budgetconscious of partners may end up feeling pushed away and unloved
im not going to pretend i respond as well as i should to criticism but i would rather be told whats up rather than be blissfully ignorant of her pain i dont try to make it so she cant tell me things and i dont understand why she feels that way

you see the contradiction there right you know you could do better but dont want to understand why she might feel like you should do better 

im not trying to call you a monster i think this is an important lesson about dealing with conflict with someone you love 

the change is you have to be actively trying to make it easier for her to come to you with negative messages you both need that from each other and that is hard work for you both it seems to be a trust that is missing here you cannot fix this alone  shell have to put the work in too  but you absolutely can ruin it on your own and you can damage that trust super quick with just a few careless words or assumptions 

i think the important thing to recognize is when said things were going well she was probably not actually lying she was telling you the best truth she had available to her at the moment or she might have been rounding it up and focusing on the emotional connection and intimacy instead of her orgasm those arent malicious lies those are choices she was making to try and emphazies the important elements that were totally present for her and not to focus too much on the ones that werent

most people dont try to lie to the ones they care about most people tell the truth they have at the moment they have it and on reflection realize there are also other important truths they need to express

your first step may be as simple as saying i realize my responses might not be making you feel safe to bring these things to me and that isnt what i want for us im going to work on that because i really need you to come to me with these things
you take a huge step back and instead of calling her a liar and blaming her for all the totally valid reasons she was ashamed or afraid of speaking up earlier you make a safe space and show you are someone she can talk to by saying ok im listening now in order for this to work you have to be able to trust me even if im not into something we can talk about it

i understand youre hurting but so is she and she probably has been for a while

youre not going to make this better by centring your bruised ego and accusing her of malice when she was genuinely trying to do the right thing by protecting that ego and placing your sexual pleasure above her own 

she made a mistake an understandable human mistake 

the two of you are now fighting a lifetime of sexual shame and conditioning and possibly even ignorance youre not going to win that fight with more shame and blame and accusations all that response tells her is that she was right that should have kept on protecting your ego or youll get mad with her you gotta be the bigger person here or nothing good happens
equally valuable yes

equally accessible not always

recognize that some of your wifes hobby also checks required labour boxes like some basic home maintenance and child enrichment activities so while your desired activity is checking only one box relaxationrecharge she is multitasking its not unusual for some productive hobbies to get a larger share of time just because they achieve other goals simultaneously ie someone who loves to cook or bake might spend more time at the activity but there was still a baseline of time required to that activity to begin with

other hobbies can be prohibitively expensive or require getting a group together for extended periods and for that reason get far fewer hours really dedicated to them

equally valuable and worthy of respect is not necessarily the same getting equal hours in the week dedicated to them

if you need more downtime ask for it clearly and carve it out but i think tying to fight for if you spend x hours in your garden then i get x hours to veg out is really missing the point entirely and setting up a false comparison where you are going to come out looking petty and foolish even if you are expressing totally valid need for more relaxing time that need should be respected equally but it doesnt necessarily mean the same number of hours should be booked off
it sounds like a core incompataiblity 

if by recent you mean a few weeks then perhaps allow a bit more time for her to sit with the idea and consider it 

but if by recent you mean a few months of dating then shes not responding from a place of surprise or having never considered this at all shes just telling you straight up she values being closer to her family and youre not compatible 

you need to date closer to home people with established lives are unlikely to move just for a relationship for most people there need to be other motivators as well bringing them to your area to make this successful
youre telling these guys they arent worth a 20 nonrefundable risk once per month

they are gonna find that hurtful and your refusal to commit earlier for better seats as disrespectful and thats valid they are your plan b youre making that totally clear

maintaining healthy relationships involves some cost and some compromise if youre not willing to eat this cost or manage this compromise then youre probably gonna damage these friendships and you might not maintain this connection its not complicated its something you have to decide and you have to address 

there is no magic spell that makes them 100 okay with what you want what you want is hurtful and not respectful of what they value if you cannot find a compromise or accept a risk then you need to optout and join in a separate seatorder once youre ready to buy thats the nonasshole approach
dude suggest someone else manage the purchase if your priorities and planning dont fit with the groups preferences and needs

be gracious be a grownup its not disrespectful to have your own system it is disrespectful not to be open to change when they say its not working for them address the feelings and the issue in the obvious way youre not the right one of the three of you to be buying the tickets maybe someone else should do it

the judgment youre heaping on them for just being different people with different preferences and priorities than you is just really petty and meanspirited

the point of the thing is to not be an asshole with people in your life you want to keep in your life

you are treating them like plan b and thats fine but stop getting your knickers in a knot because they have the audacity to know that youre treating them like plan b

hand over the responsibility of booking the tickets and maybe the transfer of the account itself if youre a real mensch to someone else and accept that if you get a better offer some friday and cancel on them you might be the one out the cost of your movie ticket if you hold steady on this youre torching your friendship and disrespecting something they really value over the possible cost of a few movie tickets a year on your end
i mean i think its a bit embarrassing when 40yearolds use ig as a public record of their spank bank to be perfectly honest 

but the insecurities issues are your own speak to your therapist about those 

if youre not going to request different boundaries on socials from your partner which you could certainly do and they could say yes or no then dont go looking for things you know will only make you unhappy exercise some selfcontrol and keep working with your therapist
you dont want to spend time with her this week you didnt plan to you dont want to it doesnt just seem that way it is that way and that needs to be okay 

stop accusing her of malice if on some level she did do this to get more time together then simply make that plan fail spend your time as you planned too take a walk or a ride on your own meet up with a friend encourage and agree with her that she needs to manage her mental health the way she thinks is best  and largely leave her to it  just because youre not at work doesnt mean you are available as a caregiver at all times
youre being immature and petty the only difference between these situations is your ego was the one bruised this time and your motivated reasoning to define it as somehow a bigger betrayal but your choices were innocent its total bullshit and you ought to know it

if you want to be with her actually with her stop being a chicken shit and do the work stop stringing her along stop allowing yourself to be strung along either be together now both of you stop pressuring others in any way or dont 

no one else can tell you what choice to make or promise you itll work out but the obvious glaring problem here is that you two keep stalling out on the road to a relationship shit or get off the pot
you are 19 it might suck but you need to do better than this even if you were paying her rent youd still owe another human being in the house youre staying in a bit better than what youve expressed here 

boundaries are good assumptions shes trying to control or manipulate you  without any evidence  are harmful to everyone involved including yourself
frankly your mom comes across here as even more toxic than the new gf

i understand being uncomfortable and having boundaries but you also need to realize that you have the power to decide not to feel guilty or obligated you have the ability to accept a gift like a young adult and acknowledge when nothing but basic friendliness is expected in return

in the future if you feel this strongly about rent you need to make the agreement about rent before you arrive once youre there if she says youre a guest and you dont need to pay there isnt much you can about it maybe buy the three of you takeout once a week as a way to acknowledge and thank them 

until and unless this woman actually does try to hold her gifts against you find a damn bit of chill that doesnt mean accepting everything she offers but it does mean acting like an adult house guest and not an angry adolescent who isnt getting their way 

no store should be telling a total stranger about another customers purchases or habits but sending them photos and asking them to ban her is just silly you may embarass her out of it but did you really think a bookstore is gonna refuse her money

this woman might be annoying and you should keep doing the dishes and keep your eyes open for other ways to contribute to the household but you also need to take it down like 9 notches and stop assuming malice just because your mom has her knickers in a bunch
this makes me wonder if your bf believes that all familial relationships are basically womans work and that you should just be making this perfect for him without him needing to do anything at all 

my ex and his family was like this just a few months into dating they found it appalling that i picked up a mothers day card for my own mom but didnt get one for his mom who i had met once basically they were fine with him forgetting birthdays and events when he was single  just a man cant be helped  but as soon as he had a gf they all assumed it was the gfs job to keep track of these things
youre not at all crazy i dont know what the red flags were but assuming you were not telling nasty lies about him then you made a very normal human mistake and most healthy people understand that ventinganxiety in a new relationship isnt the same as the relationship being all bad or toxic your family has given every sign of understanding that 

so for him now the simple answer is yes

yes i am holding you accountable for your current choices to reject my familys invitations and opportunities to build a relationship with them yup i am putting the responsibility for your current choices the ones you are making today on you 

hes entitled to his feelings it may be awkward or uncomfortable at times but fundamentally what this guy is telling you is that youre not worth it your family and your family events arent worth him putting in the work or really any work to move this situation forward

at this point you have to acknowledge he may not want this fixed not really he may just enjoy his blanket excuse to opt out of any adult responsibilities towards your family and nothing short of treating him like king charles will be considered acceptably friendly to meet his standards
your bf is being extremely weird and i suspect he doesnt want this fixed on some level hes enjoying lording it over you

its not all normal to expect your adults gfs family to text you or call you to chat

he is invited that is how your family is welcoming and its appropriate hes invited and hes refusing to go because its not good enough that is childish to say the least

youve done what you need to do it

your family is inviting him in

it is his responsibility to show up and be himself a nice version of himself

that is literally all he has to do and hes refusing to do it

you made a mistake years ago but everyone involved besides him is being reasonable about it and ready and willing to move past it with just a tiny bit of effort required 

its becoming another and very real red flag that he is not willing to show up for you and do his part
there is no shame in being a bit thirsty but save yourself some drama and dont be shocked when a 20something hookup behaves like a 20something hookup

one of the benefits of being in your 30s is supposed to be not getting so hung up on this bullshit anymore if you want to sleep with him tell him so and invite him over ya want to date him tell him so and suggest a date not half as complicated as youre making it
eh your mother doesnt have high standards shes bigoted and biased and stigmatizes mental illness and divorce who says broken family is 2023 a family changes often for the better after a separation of unhappy adults 

id much rather date an adult who sought treatment for mental health issues and is now stable than an adult who never admitted they needed help it can cause issues but most of those issues arise from the refusal to seek treatment and acknowledge the problem if he took the right steps and is stable now i wouldnt be concerned 

thank your mother for her concern then follow your own judgment
you need to walk away

either she is too immature and unstable to offer you a healthy relationship or she is actually abusive and using these threats as a tactic to get the behaviour she wants out of you to keep you insecure and chasing her approval

frankly it sounds like its the latter she is doing this just to maintain control and keep you too scarred to ever ask for or expect better for yourself

but either way its not a relationship you should stay in
two things you need to accept

1 this isnt the life you want hes not offering you what you need and you do need a partner who isnt an active addict
2 you dont know hed be a good partner otherwise thats a fantasy and a hope not a knowable thing

youre gambling with your life and its a bet that might not pay out even if he does get sober which he is not doing
not your circus not your monkeys

you said your piece and im sure you meant well  at first

now its time to stop badgering these adults with your opinions and judgments they are doing just fine you need to handle yourself
three months in and hes dismissive and unable to handle conflict

this wasnt just about your issues this is about his issues he may not have consciously weaponized your vulnerability but he used it to avoid addressing his own shit or his own inadequacies

dont overthink it it was three months a perfectly normal amount of time to really like someone but realize they arent offering what you need in a partner
each couple gets to decide

but practically speaking if you are legally married then your money is combined in many ways  even if you have no insight into it

asking for some exact  of change on one day seems entirely beside the point and not really all the helpful information unless hes selling today at some sort of major profit its not really information that means much 

however asking for enough transparency and knowledge so you could take care of both peoples financials if they were in a coma for six months thats my rule of thumb i have never combined finances but we have shared retirement goals we update one another on at least one a year and we make sure the other person knows enough about our accountsinsurancedebtetc to that if one of us was in a coma for six months what needs to get taken care of would get taken care of 

the fact youre feeling insecure and uncertain about your future is a problem that needs to be addressed
if you dont want to date someone whose ex is also a close childhood friend stop dating that person

youre giving this guy way too much power hes not an evil mindcontrol wizard if his existence was an issue in the past it was an issue for one or both of you he didnt make the relationship spoiled you two didnt maintain it

youve told her  with your actions  that you cannot be trusted to respond reasonably to her friendship with this person not even in a group setting so now she hides that friendship and her choices because she doesnt enjoy how you treat her when you are met with that reality shes not unhappy with her boundaries shes unhappy with your behaviour 

if you need her to observe different boundaries you can ask for them clearly trying to shame her into doing what you want by saying shes not respecting herself is gross if that is what you think of her dont date her
people who pressure you are asshats

i didnt drink from 19 to about 26 having fun with people who are drinking is definitely a skill and a practice i never felt like i was missing out on being wild because it was actually the loss of control i didnt enjoy but i definitely felt less interesting or plain its hard to remember that they are the ones being irrationally confident  youre fine 

to hide among the drinkers id ask for a coke is a short glass and people assumed my drink was a rum and coke its a pricy way to fake it but in groups where i didnt feel like explaining myself it works 

people who arent asshats arent really thinking about you at all
yes it was terrible that partners urgent care and months in hospital costs us less than 2k outta pocket and we are  both now back at work as a productive and healthy members of the community instead of me being broke or even homeless and him being dead 

also hate my basic physical autonomy as a person who may experience an unwanted pregnancy some day
some will and hell be peddling male supplements and prepper supplies to make ends met like alex jones if his do not compete allows it

tucker was bad habit tv most people will replace the habit they will get their hit but they arent necessarily loyal to tucker theyll be asking their friends where they get theirs now that the guy with good stuff is doing 2 years in federal same as any addict
it really just sounds like hes listing the ways a lot of men loss a lot of money 

the amount the guys i know lost on crypto put my scented candle collection to shame theyd have been better off scrolling instagram
this is rude and inconsiderate behaviour of those around you 

given your age there is a risk someone will say something nasty to you and nastier to her for letting you 

i would suggest you keep sexual touching private you know this touching is sexual thats why youre enjoying it so keep it private
i honestly dont understand

no one involved here seems to think anything happened except that she invited an old friend and a friend of a friend to a different public gathering of many friends 

all that i can see here that might have happened is your dude friend wanted to stir up some misery and drama in your life and found a super lame and weak excuse to do so which shamed you into a breakup 

after two years i wouldnt assume my gf wanted to fuck someone else just because she invited him to an afterparty its weird you seemed to however if that is what you thought then its best to be broken up
being upset isnt getting you anywhere you need to start to be very clear about when you will be prioritizing your own family  even without him  and when you would like him to put his phone down and be present with you 

youve allowed a dynamic to form in this relationship that you are not happy with you need to tell him plainly its not okay and its going to be renegotiated you will be spending your time a bit differently and he will be expected to be respectful of that
dating is really hard work its worse than finding a job it sucks

but you did have really good dates that is what happened and its what should happen if youre mature and selfaware you should have mostly good dates but good isnt good enough to build a lifetime of romance and compatibility on and that is okay most good dates after two or three of them are gonna result in one of you saying eh youre good people but youre not my person

if youre having largely good dates thats perfect thats really great thats what you want if you were mostly having totally shitty and disappointing dates then youd need to seriously reevalute your choices

all you need to do here is realize its work its hard work it is often disappointing work it takes a shit ton of time outta your day if you are really burnt out on the work take a pause for a few months and then come back to it resilience is the name of the game for you resilience and remembering that good doesnt have to be good enough not for them and not for you
ill take you one further employees and clients do this schoolchildren do this human beings do this its a normal part of human relationships forming sex and love isnt the only place were looking for compatibility and understanding of boundariesterms the engagement
i have never shited tested on purpose but ive had two guys accuse me of it and they were both totally own goals 

one i asked plainly about his views on abortion mine were right up front in my profile and i dont date men who disagree with me on this subject and he refused to answer because it was a shittest so i unmatched and moved on

then i had another guy accuse me of shittesting once because he suggested a restaurant where i had previously had an allergic reaction so i suggested another nearby and very similar where i could eat more comfortably

he absolutely went off on me about shittesting him and gameplaying if it hadnt been so spooked by it itd have been really funny my only intention was to have a pleasant meal i could enjoy 

both cases they created shittests out of normal direct human communication by failing so utterly
then im with udfahnz

i dont know why youre trying to force this after three months

youre calling her controlling demanding and unkind and thinking she cantwont change these patterns if your assumptions are unfair  you shouldnt date her anymore anyways if your beliefs are bang on  you definitely shouldnt date her anymore

youve had fun for three months but that was casual intellectual fun i wonder if you are a bit more attracted to the idea of the clever concert pianist then the actual woman who is there the life you actually want to live daytoday does not sound like its going to be with her

edit it always depends on the dog and the situational trigger but definitely make sure you encourage other adults who visit your home to help you by immediately becoming unfun if the dog jumps on them any big reaction positive or negative reinforce the behaviour if the dog is smart enough to know the behaviour is undesirable you start rewarding them for better choices ie a greeting that takes place on all fours or a good back up or off if youre really struggling get a pro involved
first things first the dog shouldnt be jumping on anyone that actually is a training situation where perfection is the fair expectation its up there with no biting one dog lover to another you need to step up your game the expectation of not being jumping is not excessively demanding or controlling  especially not if you two want to be parents with this dog in the household  and is one you should be working seriously to meet by the time the dog is a year old very very few of my dogs were still jumping with any frequency by 1 year old

the second thing is you dont actually sound as independent and confident as you think you are

you sound like youre taking good advicefeedbackexpectations when she gives that but call it demanding when you dont like it instead of saying youre a smart woman but no thats ones not for me thanks

the fact the dog kept her up is a problem a problem that should be solved by a simple im sorry the dog kept you up i understand that was really unpleasant for you itll happen sometimes but we do need to minimize it next time please wake me up so i can handle the situation and we can all get back to sleep

i think you need to step back and realize your girlfriends directness and transparency can be a good thing when you meet it with equal transparency confidence selfknowledge and directness 

maybe she is a deeply toxic and unkind person trying to change you maybe shes abusive i really cannot tell what i can see here is that you take what is useful to you and get quietly pissed with her for what you dont like and try to force yourself to accept it you also need to learn to take the good with the bad and stand up for yourself clearly when you disagree with her that is when you will know if shes just a forceful person with decent conflict resolution skills or an abusive bully 

at 3 months you probably also want to have some of the tougher conversations about what life together would look like you want a dog for the rest of your life they are a member of the family as much as a child be clear that that dog wont be rehome for any reason except extremely and immediate safety situations ie the dog starts mauling people youre 39 you should also think of some of the other dealbreakers its time to discuss plainly like plans and values around money or homeownership or faith and family
you can mute the chat or leave it and tell them why

its just not a positive and healthy space for you right now it may be what they need but its exactly what you need to take some space from they arent doing anything terribly wrong you just need to stand up and leave the frontrow seat of a show youre not enjoying

ask them to reach out to you via other channels when they want to get together and thank them for their support and understanding 

you need to be willing to take care of yourself no one else is gonna read your mind and do it for you
i agree we dont need their language or framing

we have a lot of healthier genderneutral words this phase of a human relationship where boundaries are tested and we figure out another out storming doubt stage hide and seek stage the power struggle the honeymoon hangover 

and men do it plenty im dealing with a new hire who cannot string 10 words together with shittesting his coworkers or managers either were going to move through this phrase or were gonna dissolve the relationship this isnt evil women this is a normal social strategy you can observe in a kindergarten classroom 

the way the puaincel defines shit testing is inherently malicious and immature and only assigned to women but in reality its a normal part of human relationships forming even in the workplace and its can be benign or even helpful
hes abusive

when someone says you make me be cruel there is no grey zone that is the battle cry of the unrepentant abuser

he feels entitled to call you nasty names if he uses the threat of breaking up each time hes not getting his way that is also a common abuse tactic this will not get better and might get worse
you explained fine he choose to doubledown on accusing you these kinds of misunderstandings are frequent in relationships its a red flag when a man of 30 cannot handle them without making absolute absurd accusations 

tell him that is not fair or true if he cannot accept misunderstandings with a bit of grace and respect you shouldnt be wasting your time with him

either he is terribly immature or this is a tactic hes using to keep you proving yourself and feeling insecure in the relationship either way you should expect better
your bf knows how he treats other women at parties he assumes all men do the same 

this isnt just the controlling hypocrisy of it its also him telling on himself he knows how he behaves is wrong but feels entitled to it 

dont dare someone who feels entitled to behave badly
you cant fix a person with poly it requires even more open discussion about boundaries and comfort not less someone who busts boundaries and neglects their partners feelings and doesnt communicate openly in a monogamous relationship isnt gonna suddenly start doing those things right in a poly on 

i think you need to have a serious think about what youre trying to fix in this relationship

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

let it go

you didnt go any further than they did 

tell your husband that being a bit embarrassed or uncomfortable is totally understandable  just like you were  but if you can have a laugh about it surely he can as well

if hed like to discuss how you can both observe different boundaries about privacy and sex in the future thats great have that conversation about what is off limits
youre not concerned that your bf tried to negotiate a polyeqsue situation with another woman staying in your home without talking to you first because thats a bad start

there are reddits specifically for polyamory and nonmonogamy and you might get more advice there but i have had openenm relationships most of my life and frankly the way your bf behaved with you and with a vulnerable woman staying in your home does not sound the least bit ethical i wouldnt offer a person anything if they tried to create a threesome or more  without talking to me their partner first

it sounds like youre trying to manage a man who you know will cheat on you thats never a good place to come at this from
its a fairly common fantasy that fuels a huge percentage of the science fiction and fantasy stories we have 

can you explain a bit more about what makes you uncomfortable about these conversations does she want to do harm to certain kinds of people does she not listen to feedback or is pushy with her friends about her imagined authority 

if she is basically expressing impossible wishes for the world to be kinder or safer for other people  and doesnt see that happening  i think shes probably just at an immature stage of a social justice conscience and i really wouldnt worry about it
certainly have a back up plan in place

this man is controlling and abusive he may also have a very genuine sensitivity but the way hes addressing it is not acceptable 

i would suggest you tell the wife you will no longer be cooking its not comfortable or reasonable for you to feel like youre taking a risk each time you feed the children its cannot be your responsibility if this is the behaviour that is going on in the home 

i wouldnt be willing to stay till september but if you do definitely have a back of plan of a quick safe place to stay this is a pretty toxic situation and you want to be able to leave quickly if needed you should not feel secure here
yeah thats how most bigotry works

basically good people need to be on guard and thoughtful or they end up reflecting and acting on it

intent is nice buts its not everything and its doesnt cure anything kindness is work not a hope not a feeling not an intent a thing you have to actually do
so you have no advice you have a shallow pedantic platitude that is vague shaming and silencing of totally legitimate boundaries and criticisms  for the others sincerely trying to help
the sister did her parents decided her cooking wasnt up to par 

perfectly reasonable that she stopped trying to contribute in that way if that is the feedback she got
if he lost 11 lbs in a month he probably needs to speak to a doctor that is what you should be on him about immediately 

no one is refusing to feed him 

hes refusing to eat 

hes hypercritical of both your mother and your sister and he wont eat there is food he has a car arguably knows where stores are he appears to be competent and can solve problems in his life he has chosen not too 

you cannot fix this but try to find a doctor wholl give him a talking too and to build that relationship incase there is something else going on here medically or cognitively tell your father hes an adult and is capable of keeping himself basically healthy it is disappointing that he is blaming others for his behaviour and you are concerned for his health if he doesnt change his actions
no hes almost certainly not

he is almost certainly toying with you because you havent told him youre not a plaything but a colleague the same as any of the men 

take a huge step back from him avoid hun like the plague when booze is involved this is not your friend hes using his wife to get a green card hes using you to feel good at work 

this is not safe emotional investment or a wise move for your career youre becoming a subject of office gossip huge huge step back from this personal connection
its not a positive conversation he treated op in a way that is unacceptable  the only reason its a conversation is because it is out of character 

if you have advice offer it but i dont believe in holding peoples hands when are being cruel i start with i think this is cruel and i need you to stop it from there we can move forward
i mean there is almost certainly some misogyny going on here he tried to demand she make herself ugly so she wouldnt rebound too fast thats not happening in a vacuum and suggests hes got a few concerning ideas about women and men going on here 

but yes if something isnt a pattern better to start with a firm this is not okay we can talk about what youre going through and what you are feeling but you need to know i am not going to accept being treated this way
is dropping by his desk for an actual chat a possibility 

personally i really dont think its that rude to ignore a nonwork related chat for that long im an avid user of slack but my expectations for responses are entirely different if im asking a work question or if im asking how their cat is doing

but you are right it is a struggle to make connections without some text chatting perhaps it would help to give yourself an assignment and carve out a few minutes in your day to catch up with text messages you may never enjoy it but if you treat it as a necessary task that needs to be performed in order to maintain social connections you can probably do it fine

meeting people to date is really more like a shitty part time job than a fun hobby i dont think there is anything wrong with admitting that and just doing the work to get you where you want to be
i am shocked that suggesting you should trust your wife she speaks was so upsetting to you
its strange that youre arguing for nuance and the need for thoughtful consideration of communication while not be able to exercise much of either but its clear that youve been triggered too severely for me to be helpful good luck
as is your right with advice

but you asked and she confirmed she was serious you still dont want too risk it with your career

youre right youre not being a rational actor youre trying to leverage your assumptions about her mental state and emotions  assumptions that are the exact opposite of what she clearly said  in order to justify the choice you want to make its a reasoning flaw 

all im advising you to do is make the choice without the part where you treat her like shes the irrational and untrustworthy one you dont need to make assumptions about her feelings to be honest with her about yours

by all means marry her but dont try to read her mind to get the outcome you want be transparent with your mind there is nothing childish about that
dont marry someone you dont take seriously when they express their needs 

say no if the choice is no  is the risk is too much and you need to stick to the plan say so  but own that choice for yourself and stop trying to justify it by demeaning and condescending to her and telling yourself its okay to not believe her when she speaks that will come back to bite you
thats a lot of words to say that you have a type

you probably should be way more concerned that youre repeating toxic patterns in your own relationships then you should be that people of a similar age in an similar area connected with another as friends
open with that then this is extremely out of character and im not cool with how we left it im deeply concerned youd behave this way and im looking for a reasonable explanation for the totally unkind and unreasonable way youre treating me right now
the only thing they can do is try to tell the gf which puts them back in the line of fire for their abuser

she doesnt have the information she needs in order to protect anyone here except herself 

so no i dont agree that is likely to achieve anything or that op has a responsibility to set herself on fire over things she cannot prove or protect anyone else from
he probably is im sorry but youre right 

unless thats a crime where you live then there is nothing you can do about it even if it is one there is probably still nothing you can do if hes just showing then to friends and not posting them publicly 

thats a reality youre going to have to live with it shouldnt be i wish i could stop it for you but i cant the safest thing for you is have absolutely zero contact of any kind with him or anyone close to him
tell him this doesnt wait until you maybe get more serious he has an intelligent highenergy breed he needs to be taking proper care of right now and proper care includes training 

if he doesnt take it seriously now he never really will maybe hell let it be your job and hell resist you every step of the way

in your position id be brutally clear i cannot respect people who do not train their young dogs to be safe around people and dogs the fact hes decided to just not bother right now is a real mark against his character
there is no crime to report

it is extremely unlikely bringing your concerns to his new gf will do anything besides trigger harassment 

there is nothing productive you can do sometimes bad things are just bad and there is nothing to do about it 

you need to block both of them everywhere you cannot punish him or save her
that is a bizarrely shallow and controlling sentiment hes expressing he wants you to make yourself in his mind unappealing to other men out of respect yuck does he also expect you to be wear a black veil for a year and then purples and greys for at least six more months after that 

my bf and i were joking about death recently and he told me to use some of his life insurance to buy a really good vibrator if i didnt feel like playing cougar right away 

i would suggest you not try to make this right he issued an amazingly petty shittest tell him it was both bizarre and unkind for him to try to dictate how you might theoretically grieve like he doesnt trust you to be actually devastated by his death he needs to imagine youll also need to make yourself again he imagines ugly to ensure you dont immediately start dating again that insane
break up with him and end all contact

he cheated because he wanted to cheat nothing you ever did made him do it you didnt cast a spell hes a person who can choose not to be shit he choose to cheat and hes telling you hes gonna do it again 

this will all make a lot more sense when you stop talking to this manipulative piece of shit person
i think its silly not to accept what is basically market rate from your gf

if you stick to your plan and shes truly not comfortable with it then shell simply end up paying more elsewhere anyways 

you might also consider connecting with any schoolscolleges in the area and trying to find a short term lodger 36 months i did this a little while to supplement my income but so as not to commit to anyone long term where i live they also pay a bit more and if there is a serious problem you can let their school know
its just compatibility 

telling the truth did exactly what it is supposed too 

it was better to find out now than later that you were youre going to be incompatible with lots of people for one reason or another if you were incompatible in this way its absurdly unlikely that you were magically perfect for another in all others these things tend to spill over
ah thank you you too

although in all honesty mine is so far behind me now i really dont look back at it with anything a sense of humour and gratitude that i stayed basically safe part of current awesomeness
my little brother made the mistake of pulling this women wouldnt fight in ww3 bullshit on us last week 

he has type 2 diabetes asthma and is nearsighted he will have a desk job every single one of his sisters is way way more likely to see combat than he is
i dont know who the imagine that housework is being done for like just for ourselves would be grand but not economically viable the exact opposite happened last time industry ramped up the women went to work
im sorry you went through this it does suck but it really wasnt about you it was all about him being able to keep the mask up until anything was expected of him besides easy words 

am i right to assume his divorce was really resent and hes still very bitter and inexperienced at living alone cause women his own age probably wouldnt touch him with a ten foot pole if he was acting this way they would definitely bail the moment he accused them of being emotionally abusive  like his ex now you know as well what to listen for take the lesson but dont take it personally its not about you its about him still performing his old toxic patterns  hes not trying to avoid them in you he was trying to enforce them on you
can see why this man is a divorcee who picked an ldr with a woman a decade younger than him

dont take it too personally be proud of yourself for confronting him on his shitty inconsiderate behaviour that took some stones its not a cultural thing it a selfish person thing tell him its over and then block him dont bother trying to explain anymore im sure his exwife told him over and over again until she lost her voice
no shaming of sex workers or sustained celebrators intended
i remember my hook up years when my standards were rock bottom and i was chasing self worth through dating and casual sex 

and 3 new men a week who could string a sentence together and brush their damn their teeth while also working 50 hours and being an adult impossible absolutely not happening not one week ever not if i spent every waking moment swiping and chatting 

i know a few sex workers and i dont think even their average week includes three new clients
our bodies dont exist except as products on a shelf
thats gross i really hope that is an esl issue because this is not a respectful way for him to speaking about these women and it sounds like both have some difficulties with respecting the women in this sport
if you sincerely believe your partner is targeting women in his sport to perform violence on them when hes angry with you then you should not date him 

we cannot read his mind any better than you can if that is what you think of him and his temper act accordingly
no you cannot find out you have trust and respect or not 

if you sincerely believe your partner is targeting women in his sport to perform violence on them when hes angry with you then you should not date him

because that appears to be what you are saying and you must see that is an insane thing to think about a person and then stay with them
except you dont not when you assume hes letting them win or they are fundamentally of less value to him as a competitors than a man would be respect isnt a claim its a practice

do you want to be an athlete and wrestle with men

if not then yes that is a possible hypocrisy but its also picking a fight about something you dont even want for yourself anyways 

you need to get a grip if you trust him trust him when he tells you what is normal in the sport he practices
you are misunderstanding a culture which should be rooted mutual respect and sportsmanship  and often is you are underestimating how much skills can matter and you are severely underestimating these pro woman no one is letting them win
women participate in the sport with men and his explanation is plausible with nothing else to go on these women deserve your respect as athletes 

the issue here is not the sport 

if you otherwise trust him and your conflict resolution remains healthy and productive i would advise you to let go of this entirely
love it 

even if we assumed every single woman on of was an active creator of sexual content and was an american woman between 18 and 35 ya still get 19 of roughly the 55 million american woman between 18 and 35 with an of account 

and they arent all american or all selling sex and only an even smaller minority are active so even with the most generous take on this its less than 2 roughly the same percentage of women who leave their christmastree up till february
strange way to tell us that the algorithm knows youre not interested in content from women unless they have an of
all in all youre dating a person who doesnt have much bandwidth or skills to deal with a normal disappointments and daily struggles in his own life  and judges and mischaracterizes your struggles because of his own limits and lack of awareness he may not be consciously projecting but it doesnt really matter end result is the same even if hes not malicious about it he has been consistent about telling you what support he can offer and consistent in his refusal to seek treatment 

hes not being consistently kind youre not compatible 

as a 25 year old who has embraced treatment and learned the skills she needs to find success in her own terms you probably actually have less in common when him than you do many neurotypicals
you apologize

you acknowledge youre both angry and that being angry with him for not waking you wasnt entirely fair 

you admit that while its not his job you probably should be asking him for the favour of the occasional wake up  because you have a medical condition you cannot perfectly control thats not making it his job that is asking for his support with something that isnt his job 

and you probably have to do some listening to some frustration and unhappiness he has as well hes probably pissed too and hes got about the same rights to it as you do


and then you probably talk to your doctor about some sleep aids if youve already done everything you can on your own to manage your sleep hygiene
yeah youre the asshole here

if he had agreed that on this one day he would wake you by x time so you two could stick to your shared plans then youre be justified in being angry with him for not doing so

but thats not what happened what actually happened in the vague plans kept on shifting and he didnt really know what was to do when you fell back asleep he likely felt rationally that he was gonna piss you off regardless of what he did he didnt have information to act on feelings are not instructions or directions to be woken or left to sleep 

right now youre pissed with him for not doing something he didnt agree to do which you didnt ask him to do and both agree he fundamentally shouldnt be expected to do

being disappointed in the situation is totally fair being angry with him was not youre both frustrated with something medical right now that neither of you can perfectly solve 

you need to ask for what you need clearly i would suggest in the short term being clear with him that if youre sleeping through commitments with him you would appreciate him waking you up so you can keep those plans

he cannot be your human alarm clock everyday but he can and should be able to come and get ya when you two have agreement
thats not totally fair

men also use it against men when its convenient to them to argue that all men are biologically programmed to be unfaithful or sexually violent
the loss part of this is what is wildest

any halfway sane woman hearing that would be calling a lawyer and opening accounts without his name on them people loose their jobs all the time someone who raided the family saving account to immediately pay off their employer is not just getting laid off 

this guy seems to thinks loving him means turning off your rational brain and walking joyfully in to the jail cell beside him
i have this theory that women arent bullying one another enough anymore to create enough insecure women willing to date me so i have to get way better at lying to women to work around the amount of mutual respect they have for one another and now expect from men i tell extravagant lies like i respect you and acknowledge your value as a person instead of ugly truths like you actually have no value as a human being if i dont find you personally fuckable and available
i fucked up at my job so badly i was fired and i was financially liable and paid it from our savings cause ya know were married its probably not just mine but no lets not discuss it further and im gonna just chill at home for the next two weeks while you panic and  hah not psych lol you should have seen your face wait why are your bags packed
without knowing what the thing is its impossible to form much of an opinion on the risk to the relationship and if your anxiety is something you simply need to manage yourself
your boyfriend is nearly 30 doesnt have his life together in the least has a history of cheating and instability in general and is 100 going to sleep with this woman after moving in with her

get yourself sorted find an affordable for place for yourself and a job if youre going to school you might find they have resources to help you find a room or a job that fits with your schedule most schools want you to keep paying tuition so they may have some advice for you definitely call them and try to find someone to speak to before you move back to a parent who isnt supportive

when youre 29 youre gonna look back at this guy at his choices and his emotional manipulation and your mind is going to boggle 

keep on loving him if you want but dont be an idiot keep your financial and home life completely separate he cant be trusted partner when it comes to money or a place to live
dude you got rejected by someone you chatted with for a few days whose intentions were right there in her profile 

this isnt a pattern this is not a friendzoning and you are far too old to use that word 

this is a person who was always offering you friendship and you were disappointed by that 

given your feelings you should probably decline her offer of friendship
you cannot fix this for her she needs to acknowledge it is unhealthy and do better for her own sake as well as the relationships

and that is really unlikely to happen
youre being played

hes in debt deep which means you are too you need to stop the bleeding
you flirted with an ex you did cheat anyone sane would consider that a violation of the relationship agreement

stop being a dipshit admit what you did recognize that getting dumped for it is perfectly fair reasonable
its strange that you wouldnt begin with husband i want to work towards a mortgage and to do that i need to have a better idea of our financial position  and that includes the business lets book some time to sit down and go over the financial situation together with the accountant 

the fact hes being vague is what needs to change deal with that reality dont tip toe around it and work behind his back thats isnt going to fix the problems here the finances are only half the equation
youre in an abusive relationship 

hes escalating because your dependency is escalating he doesnt have to work so hard to mask his behaviours any more now that he has you trapped

this will continue to escalate if you relocate hes not looking for a way out hes just stockpiling ammunition for the exactly the sort of combative and abusive relationship he wants to have with you
deleting the texts was dishonest when you have an open phone policy thats a mistake she could have reasonably understood hed want to know she was in contact with this person and she choose to hide it she violated the spirit of the agreement even if not the the letter 

its not great what she did  if she was here id be telling her not to date someone she needs to manage like that  but his reactions is the real red flag here

she doesnt have to be perfect for his reactions to be deeply concerning
i actually agree with this 100 that is what everyone should want and need 

but you seem to refuse to realize how your behaviour is not communicating that or making much space for that 

your behaviour  if its anything like its been in this thread  is communicating that you need to be managed and pacified because you cannot control yourself very well
we read what you wrote man were listening and discovering your girlfriend was right to be concerned you wouldnt respond reasonably to messages you dont like 

the only smart thing you did throughout this was take a huge step back when you realize you werent behaving yourself and you needed to go cool down i suggest you do that again because this isnt a problem with explaining to your girlfriend why youre mad that makes perfect sense we all understand why youre mad the place the miscommunication is happening here is your refusal to recognize that she made a reasonable choice to withhold information that you apparently cannot handle what she did was wrong but her judgement was correct about your ability to take the information in calmly it was the wrong choice but it was a totally logical one and you are refusing to acknowledge that which will stall transparent communication in the future 

the problem does not appear to be her understanding what she did wrong the problem is you realizing that she was totally rational to be fearful of having this conversation with you and you reassuring her and showing her that you can accept upsetting information without acting like an enraged toddler

if you cant turn to her and say i understand why you made this mistake and i can promise you that while i may be mad at times in the future i will behave rationally and in a way that will not make you feel unsafe if you need to share information with me that i dont like as long as you can promise me to not repeat this mistake and lie to me to keep me from being angry

edit again that is if you believe her if you believe her about what the texts were then also believe her when she said she assumed youd be mad  extremely and irrationally so if you need her to end contact with this person ask for that if you dont believe her break up
yeah cannot imagine why a 20 year old might be fearful of giving him a message he dislikes s
can you really not see that you are coming across here as totally unhinged and irrationally angry i wouldnt want to talk to you face to face when youre bringing this energy no one would 

if you suspect cheating break up if you dont grow up 

this makes perfect sense to anyone who isnt used to using their anger as a tactic to control others get a grip stop throwing a temper tantrum at randos online you asked for advice and the obvious advice is  even when youre right and shes wrong you cannot bring this kind of rage at her and expect transparent communication in the future thats not how people work 

i dont even know you and based on your words  here id be worried enough by your lack of empathy nd emotional regulation to not want too
while she made a mistake i can see why she doesnt trust you to behave reasonably with this information 

youll never know what really happened here

but if you believe her that it was nothing then you need to work on being someone its safe to communicate with as well she was wrong to do what she did but it was a tactic to manage your anger and anxiety for you and this experience will have only confirmed for her that you couldnt be trusted not to explode at her had she told you first 

while nothing you do will stop someone who really wants to lie to you or manipulate you remember that most of the time you have some ability to teach people how to treat you be careful about teaching her that you are irrationally angry and have to protected from bad news at all costs
they grew up together the sister and the h were likely in the same grade sister saw him as a brother figure it wasnt unreasonable for her to assume her little sister saw in the same way she was just incorrect

it wasnt ops problem before and its also not now

op said there is no pattern of malicious behaviour from her sister there is just a perspective and it was good that op got a moment to address it

not everything one person doesnt like or agree with is some sort of monstrous violation
just let it go

its her opinion its not an insane one she asked you answered 

shes not being cruel to either of you there isnt really a problem here it can be okay for someone to love you both and have those sorts of questions
your plan requires a relationship being a housewife generally requires a breadwinning partner 

there isnt a problem here unless your family is not respectful of your relationship and how you and your partner choose to organize your lives 

youre 25 if you have a goal for your own life work towards it you dont need your parents to cosign on it or pat you on the head itd be nice but you need to learn to cope without it they are entitled to their own opinions and perspectives and you are entitled to ignore them
if i didnt work so hard she would be very disappointed in the situation it would lead to

i think youre projecting your own concerns about your role as a provider and you both are going to keep to accept things in your lives need to be compromised its not just her

if you are hiding from her the real costs of your choices as a couple financially and emotionally then she isnt making her own choices and compromises with the full picture so yeah based on the limited information and understanding she has she might be disappointed but unless you think she is a fundamentally really selfish and ignorant human being then that is a matter of understanding one another better and being partners getting on the same team its not a matter of you failing her

it might help you to consider this

how would your wife survive if you were in a comma for six months does she have enough understanding of the financial situation to be able to keep things together would she know where to find the passwords or who to call if she had questions about the accounts because for both of your sakes she should if you have taken on so much of the burden of understanding and doing the providing role that she wouldnt be capable for six months then you havent set her up for success that is a failure for you both youre all in danger if that is the dynamic that exists right now
acknowledge that yes you are prioritizing the game and no you dont want to go for drinks 

you want to stick to your plan and relax on your own it may involve playing a lot of star wars and it may not either way you like your plan and youre sticking to it 

sometimes the easiest way to deal with a fight is not to fight acknowledge shes correct you are prioritizing that game over going on a date she has accurately understood and that is okay
he has told you plainly he doesnt care about your needs and will not even be discussing them with you as if you are an equal or a person that he values

how you communicate isnt the problem here

youre not his priority

there are no magical phrases you can use to convince him hes decided already

he has decided he doesnt have to listen to you

anything you say will be labelled wrong or disrespectful or mean

you will never ever win he has already decided youve lost everything he is saying now is just designed to keep you afraid and shut you up about it so you accept the situation he prefers

wanting to see your partner weekly is reasonable he is not offering that kind of relationship

thats the reality you need to stop thinking hes just independent hes an asshole
this is probably the core of it

he suspected he couldnt give her an inch without her demanding a mile when it came to any communication during this time

instead of recognizing that as the huge red flag it really was he tried to enforce this maximalist boundary drawing to a head the fact they are not compatible and she is not someone really anyone should be dating

op got to the right outcome but he could have probably wised up a bit sooner and gotten there by a smoother path if he just thought hey i should probably date someone who you can respect and understand when i can only have a very brief contact during this week
i also dislike like hyperconnectivity i can go a day or with low or no contact with my so no problem and i dont want to date someone who couldnt 

however one or two texts during a week especially in the context of a young relationship is not hyperconnectivity it the basic maintenance of a human connection
i agree that a healthy secure relationship should be able to manage a week of no contact 

however that wasnt what this was on either side she was absolutely not healthy or secure and ops inability to fire off a sentence or a damn emoji one or twice over seven days from the toilet also doesnt speak well of him he wasnt deployed or studying the ice in the arctic he made a choice not to give his new relationship 30 seconds of maintenance and consideration even once during this time my father travelled and trained like this all the time he usually called once for less than 15 mins and spent 10 minutes on some break sending a postcard the bar doesnt need to be that high 

and 20 years ago was only 2003 we all had email many of us had flip phones and we still had pay phones and post cards it was not that unusual to make brief contact with your closest people during holidays  which again this was not
yeah we also had different standards for dental hygiene too the mind boggles
if youve got legal protections you can seek you could report him

but if you dont keep your head down and survive find someplace else to go and thrive where bigots are not given so much power over you
break up are usually a healthy kind of selfish like i said a relationship shouldnt be a hostage situation if you want out then you should be out even if your reasons are irrational if you want to break up you still should

its normal to feel bad we never enjoy hurting someone else
a breakup isnt a negotiation youre not stuck with her just because she doesnt feel like moving back home

and a relationship shouldnt just be a convenient social arrangement or a hostage situation 

break up are really hard and disruptive but if you dont want to be in the relationship anymore it is the hard work you need to do

no one here can tell you for sure what it is you want but the reasons youve raised here for staying together itll suck at parties she doesnt want to move home are really shitty reasons to keep working at something you seriously do not want any longer
all you need to learn from this is that school and workplace computers are for school work and professional work and that personal questions and research should be done on your own time

you know there was plenty of bigotry and bias at play here we all know that we all know that gay men are people and they can fall in love and choose to be couples that isnt porn thats dating or romance or being human there is no reason to try and read other peoples minds and try to poll how many people online are gonna get offended stupid people exist bigoted people exist we cannot pretend they dont and its just beside the point the point is people are assholes and school computers need to be used for school work

anytime you are on a device or network owned by your school or employer assume you are being watched by someone and that someone doesnt care about your intent and might be an asshole
you need to speak to a therapist

youre carrying a lot of resentment towards your wife but it boils down to a broken dynamic and your own struggles advocating for yourself a lot of this is about the expectations youre placing on yourself youre also clearly just burnt out on parenting you really are describing being a fully involved father  which is great but yeah thats like the time a baby takes the labour division might need to be changed up but that is the work 

i am not saying shes perfect just that you need to do some work to approach these important conversations from a more balanced place for your own sake it sucks that the person with the bigger problem and the larger amount of work often has to be the person who adds a bit more work to their own plate first to start the ball rolling but i think that is where you are at

you got a big ball of stress burdens resentments and twisted dynamics to unravel a lot of it is based in your expectations of yourself  some of which seem pretty excessive to me  and the partnership dynamic you have contributed to with your wife when you really lock yourself into a provider role instead of a partnership role you should speak to a therapist about priorities and how to start which conversations with your wife
dude you need to find a new story

all of this my dad was poors the girl of my dreams was stolen from me is a story a myth from the outsiders perspective there is basically no truth in it all its just you trying to project and assign your insecurities and jealousy to these other people without any rational basis

you need to stop clinging to a story that says youre life is over because you missed your chance in your early 20s thats toxic its not what happened ya just experienced a bit of standard rejection imagining shed have fallen in love with you instead if you just had a guest room is really absurd its time to actually accept this rejection without writing a starring role for yourself in an epic tragedy for the ages if you cannot manage and reject these thoughts yourself bring them to a therapist and let them challenge this bullshit
doesnt change that it would be a really big ask for a lot of people  even healthy and secure ones 

but all you can do is be glad you found out quickly this woman was not healthy or secure try to put it out of your mind as well as you can there is nothing you can or need to do until after your exam
this is creepy

lots of people like to leave their desks at lunch

do you really think shes have a 20 minute fuck in a busy parking lot every afternoon you need to get a grip and talk to your wife
there is nothing here to discuss escalating baseless accusations of cheating should be an absolute dealbreaker even if the rest of this was not

however i will say that with someone who behaves better than this a full week of radio silence is probably not good enough to support many relationships certainly not a new one a few texts throughout the week would be a reasonable ask from a healthy partner  but this woman wasnt that anyways so just keep her on mute and deal with the break up when you return

good luck with the exam
youre replying as if i called bf the best ever who can do no wrong

when what i actually said is this obviously sucks and i have no idea why shed want to keep dating him with all this drama and distrust after only one month

when someone brings out the worst in you in terms of insecurities paranoia and controlling tendencies you just get the hell away from that person who brings that out in you no matter how much i appreciate she is genuinely and legitimately hurt i also think this is a terrible version of her and there is probably a better version who is more secure and mature who is dating someone else so we dont need to demonize him when he does something pretty damn reasonable you just get away before the bad dynamic messes you up even more
i would refuse to date someone who expected id be constantly available to them via text

i dont check my phone with im having a meal with other friends or when im at a concert or a play im out with people and those people or that art will get my full attention if i dont go the bathroom or need to call an uber im not really looking at my phone and its on silent i will sometimes have workdays where i dont respond to any personal texts that arent absolutely vital for a full 12 hours my job is not the kind where you carry a phone on your person at all times

i dont know your relationship but i think he did the correct thing in setting the expectation

you are being distrustful and a bit controlling and looking for every detail of his night

you might also be being misled

after a month of this sort of drama i dont know why youd bother continuing with someone you feel this way about it shouldnt be this hard for either of you

you have some insecurities to work on if youre going to date like a busy adult with full lives but he also might be a shitty bf its impossible to say and it doesnt even matter this much drama and distrust after only a month this clearly not working for either of you
this was utterly juvenile bullshit i wouldnt want to be friends with either of you and im not sure why you want to go on being friends with her after she spun this shit on you

you realize shes using to you testbaitpunish her boyfriend right youre not really her friend  she clearly doesnt actually value you in her life that much if she takes dumb risks like this and then cuts you out when they play out poorly youre a tool shes using to treat someone else like shit 

you cannot do anything except ifwhen this comes up again admit you were wholly and completely wrong and childish af no excuses no explanations just a straightup i shouldnt have done that was shitty i am sorry i dont know why i was so fucking stupid as to imagine it was at all funny

cause you were extremely stupid unkind and you have no defence here
walk away

trust doesnt work on technicalities he chose a very convenient lack of transparency

and hes shopping around which may be technically fine in your agreement but you should leave him to it he doesnt need to cheat to be sorta shitty

multidating is common but isnt usually a stage that lasts into the five or six months range unless youre nonmonogamousopen so this isnt cultural or about multidating really this is just a lowkey not great human being who is comfortable enough with you and enjoys the benefits of being your sorta boyfriend but is not willing to commit or move forward together

after five months of casual but frequent dating its time to move on he doesnt communicate to the standard you should insist on and hes either just not that into you or hes a real shithead either way times up

you could ask him for a greater level of commitment and involvement in one anothers lives if youd like but i wouldnt a nearly 50yearold man who chooses the easy white lies for himself where he technically isnt betraying anyone else is just not what im looking for
youre never gonna know 

the best thing to do is not waste any brain power on it
thats not cute or clever its awkward if i did like a guy a joke about other men and multiple personalities would turn me right off

just tell her what you actually want and then youll find out
it is rude to expect to take anything home from it

this one is pretty cut and dry youre right hes wrong he has misunderstood the situation

it is not appropriate to go into a meal train visitevent with any expectation you will leave with anything a host may offer if they have too much or things will spoil too quickly but the expectation is rude and inappropriate the point is to gift them food they asked for your company as well but the pointagreementexpectation is still to gift them food
its been six months its time for a checkin

ask him how the saving towards buying into your house is going we all know the answer is its not

tell him youre not comfortable moving forward with him if he doesnt provide more clarity about his debt situation and repayment plan because you shouldnt be 

stop tiptoeing around his stress ego and tell him plainly what you need from an adult partner 

he needs to be stressed and pressured that is what he should be feeling right now hes misled his partner about his finances having stressful conversation full of pressure is how you succeed at a life partnership if he crumbles under this pressure and cannot at least make a focused efforted to keep his word to you about money then you absolutely cannot have children with him
you need to stop thinking of yourself as a provider and start thinking of yourself as a partner and a partner doesnt say oh whatever you thinkneedwant im sure itll work out when they are in fact not at all sure of that a partner speaks up clearly about their own needs and limits and concerns a partner isnt such a damn pushover

im not surprised you feel like a pawn right now you have accepted that role you are following that script

while she may be inconsiderate or poor at budgeting or have any other set of negative qualities shes not here right now youre here asking this questions and reading these answers right now nothing she intiates is going to save you from the selfimposed consequences of your own choice to not speak up clearly about your preferences and needs and feelings

you need to be confident enough in yourself and have enough faith in your marriage to say what you actually think in each of the cases above you told her to make her own choice and then resented her for doing so

moreover if she is the one taking on the work of planning all of these trips you actually may need to step in with far more concrete plans if there is something you want to be prioritized i could be wrong but the  if you can find a free weekend response sounds to me like it might have been a you do the work dont make me plan yet another thing stepping up and taking on a larger share of that mental labour and planning for family or couple trips might be a good way to address both of your feelings of being left out or neglected and to start approaching this subject as a team with a shared plan instead of all trips being primarily her projects
its not that strange this is just you being attracted to the people you see as peers and it takes experience to properly identify your peers most teenagers cannot know what they do not know which is the whole reason some laws apply to them the laws are a bit arbitrary  but society has to pick a line so the line gets picked and we organize ourselves and societies permissions and expectations of young people around it 

but seriously dont date a 30yearold its healthy enough for you to see them as a peer but that is a lack of experience on your side still there is something profoundly and deeply wrong with a 30yearold who sees you as a peer no matter how wonderful and mature you are
you need legal advice this isnt a relationship issue anymore

dont contact him not yourself not personally not ever

as i said not a relationship issue you have no relationship whatsoever with this person anymore you are not consenting to any relationship or contact any contact you have no should go through the lawyers or law enforcement or at the most a professional message in your capacity as a professional offering to purchase the domain at a reasonable rate but not offering to sell your friendship or any personal contact whatsoever

reach out to a nonprofit that supports abuse or stalking victims access some legal advice

or more pointedly dont worry about it too much and build your site with the same kind of accessible variation of your name that most people named john smith need to figure out link it in all your bios correctly and googleseo will quickly figure it out and send people looking for your full name to the site that is actually populated with content
so that is the exact problem im advising you to address

you need to have a conversation one where you try to understand her perspective and not one where you try to make her perform to your expectations seeing it from her perspective involves listening and understanding her choices you dont seem to have managed that on your own so have that conversation with a professional involved that is the only thing which will tell if youre are still compatible or not 

shes a person first and you are actually working really hard to not have to see it from perspective there is nothing here in this question that says you have heard or understood her perspective you simply report her actions if you saw it from her perspective youd be willing to talk about her goals and concerns about stopping her education or her work youre treating her goals and values as if they are just bad habits she needs to break taking a class isnt stuck in your ways its not a bad habit being uncomfortable or unwilling to be a sahm is not a bad habit its a huge leap of trust to put in the working partner

i feel for you you are working really hard but youre not working smart when it comes to your relationship there are obviously major issues in how the housework and childcare is divided but youve taken such an extreme and closeminded view of it im not shocked you two cannot even communicate about it anymore

if you decide she is nothing except the mother of your daughter and that her employment and school work are just bad habits shes stuck in then shes not your human partner any longer your relationship will and should end if that is your attitude towards her and you will be solely coparents
look even if he had any reasonable discomfort talking about his partner he actively hid inappropriate conversations with another woman and even looped his parents into the situation gross 

you know he was full of shit and weaponizing your mental illness against you try not to stew on it there is nothing to learn here except to end things sooner and that is a lesson only experience can teach you
i would back way up and get both of your butts into couples counselling

and individual counselling for yourself this is not all about what you can do for them  you need and deserve support which they are probably not wellequipped to offer at the moment please make sure you get it 

you need a counsellor who is experienced with queernonbinary patients and respects ethical nonmonogamy but put a big old pause on actually practicing any openness or nonmonogamy coming out one week having a crush and pursuing an open marriage the next is not a healthy timeline for anyone involved here not them not you not anyone else unlucky enough to fall into to either of you in this bumbling sorta openness youre considering

the best way to support them is to be healthy yourself and to sort out your own needs and goals some selfishness on your part isnt an attack its an important next step towards a relationship that genuinely serves you both in the way you each need
take some space apart if you can get tested and ask for his records

gather the information you can but recognize the information you already have is pretty damning your husband decided to be ignorant about this to make his own life less embarrassing even if it meant putting you at risk its a deadly serious breach of trust
an sti is not a bodily function its a transmittable illness 

he chooses to believe untrue things about a transmittable infection he had before they become sexually active and throughout the marriage  that could be easily disproven by a google search or transparent conversation with a doctor because the false information he had found was convenient to him

he exposed her to increase cancer risk with her knowledge

that is nothing like lying and saying it was the dog who farted

thats like exposing someone to an increased cancer risk and genital warts without their knowledge for years
its been seven years

are you gonna spend the rest of your lives together refusing to accept and trust your partner to select his own friends

you can always leave someone whose boundaries and morals you dont respect but you choose to stay and have continued with that choice stop pretending to yourself hes gonna turn into someone else 

hes picking these people and hes gonna go on picking these people make peace or gtfo
it seems you two didnt have a solid agreement on child care and finances prior to the baby arriving

you made offers to her that you thought were generous and proper but offers are different from mutual agreements youre both very much adults you need to have conversations and make agreements

you had very traditional expectationshopes of her and shes clearly noped the hell right outta that you cannot force her to perform the way you want her to she has to agree to it she has to want that or at least accept it and feel secure as an adult who is dependent on you in order to stop working or delay her education goals if she isnt willing to do that you cannot force her you can just choose not to be her partner 

you might not be compatible as partners but stuck with one another as coparents

couples counselling would be wise you two skipped over some important conversations about the division of labour and finances and you need to have them now you dont seem to have any understanding here of what is motivating her to work or to get an education you dont have to agree with her or even like her choices  she can be an outright terrible human being for all i know  but youre stuck with her so itll help you to understand what she is thinking so you can have a real conversation

sounds like you are probably fundamentally incompatible and that there is also a huge lack of trust here once you realize your life would be easier as a single parent thats generally the direction it heads in but even still a couples counsellor can help you navigate the split

the point of love languages isnt just to get someone else to speak yours its to pay attention and understand them when they speak

my boyfriend doesnt speak words of affirmation very much but he knows they are important to me and he tries

what he does do is tidy my kitchen and pick up my grocery list meticulously every time hes over he 

if youre not happy leave the relationship respectfully and honestly but dont forget that love languages are also about listening not just demanding your preferences be met
your husband lied to you

for six years

the first thing you do is go get tested vaccines are almost never 100 percent and gardasil protects against nine of the common human papillomavirus hpv types there are more than 150 types while the odds might be good that he has one of the more common types that the vaccine may cover your husband was wrong and monstrously selfish to assume the type he had was one the vaccine covered he has absolutely no way of knowing what type i very very much doubt he spoke to a doctor who gave him the advice that you were fine and it was aokay to lie to you they almost certainly said your wife needs regular screenings 

you are utterly justified in requesting any evidence you wish but you might need to have more fundamental think even in the bestcase situation  where he didnt cheat had this from the beginning and assumed you were immune  is this okay is that really all that much better he chose to keep himself and you ignorant of the reality of the situation and the risk for a decade because he rather protect his ego than your health
i sincerely hope no one in your life is ever in need of support regarding abuse this is a truly heartbreakingly horrible take on reactive abuse

mutual abuse is rather rare the actual power and control dynamics rarely permit it reactive abuse is almost always present in any abusive relationship this is textbook reactive behaviour from op after facing years of manipulation and blameshifting 

reactive abuse is pretty basic and can exist in any abusive relationship between people parents and children friends and even employees and bosses 

you think youve got some special insight because youre being contrary but its just ignorantly sticking to a narrative that is as old as time itself
a break is almost always a slowmotion breakup

youre already on that path you may care for her on some level but you dont respect her behaviour or decisions or even trust her intentions thats not fair to either of you you shouldnt be trying to force yourself into a relationship with someone you have those feelings about 

be honest enough to admit to her that you dont want a break you dont want to be in this at all break up
youre 36 you owe it to any woman you date seriously to have this shit figured out better than this i expect this kind of dithering from a man a decade younger than you no one here is going to have the exact answer for you except to tell you that yes its high time you put in the work and figure this out 

speak to a therapist if you need to sort out your own thoughts and come to conclusions you can live with for yourself its no longer reasonable or fair to put this all on finding the perfect partner and a rational person should probably realize that if youre unwilling to sacrifice everything to make it possible then its probably not going to happen because for most people having kids does means sacrificing a hell of a lot 

ignoring for a moment that having a much older biological father actually does impact the outcomes for the infant in some ways because more importantly unless you are independently wealthy time does run out in a practical sense youll probably want to retire not still be paying for school trips or tuition into your 60s
dont engage with this person they are not interested in your safety they are interested in attacking you on the basis of your gender

there will be time to reflect on how you can make better choices right now the choice you need to make is to prioritize your safety above all else
the moment anyone punches or throws anything the other person is at serious risk of harm

so the relationship is over
no one has to behave perfectly  not women men or children  to deserve not to be abused

emotional manipulation deserves a breakup not a screaming match not a hole in the wall not the real threat of escalating physical violence

what is deeply sexist here is the idea that men are not capable of facing big difficult feelings without resorting to violence they are men are sensible and capable of dealing with big feelings and even break ups without being abusive without screaming bloody murder or making inane accusations and transparent attempts at guilt tripping without punching walls or people most of them pull it off just fine

men can be capable of dealing with these moments without violence when they and others expect it of themselves 

hopefully at some point you will stop thinking there is anything people do that means they deserve to be abused

edit and yes men are even capable of leaving emotionally abusive partners without violence
its insane to think this is apology territory this is escape plan territory 

he is not sweet sweet is the mask he wears when he knows a sensible person would leave his abusive ass

your bfs emotional and verbal abuse has escalated to the first steps of physical abuse people who will hit objects to scare and intimate you are warming up to hit you 

it may not happen tomorrow but this man has been telling you over and over again that he is willing to hurt you to keep getting what he wants

dont ask for an apology plan the breakup and then execute it quickly the most dangerous moment for a person leaving an abusive partner is when the abuser realizes they are losing control that is why the violence escalated when you told him it wasnt working

look up the cycle of abuse and then plan your exit from this dangerous situation
did you read my last paragraph dude where i spelled out that you should expect and ask for the same and advocate for yourself cause it sounds like youre retreating into resentment instead of doing the work to communicate your own valid needs

if you rather have your martyrdom thats what youll get
sure bro and for decades we thought women couldnt have autism at all  because they werent disruptive enough

its almost like there is just way way more pressure on women to mask and perform whereas men get to indulge in their eccentric genius myth
its the main thing going on in her head right now

your response wasnt just unsupportive it was cruel 

a complete no exam talk rule is telling her that she has nothing to contribute at all at the moment and you expect constant performance of good girlfriend and good girlfriends arent allowed to be stressed out 

instead create exam free zones or times over meals while youre in bed together make space for other another separate from her exams 

if youre feel silenced about your own stress or exams use the same guidelines learn to ask for what you want as she is now not punishing her for not automatically have given it to you in the past
people are gonna pile on you telling you not to take is so personally  and while that isnt wrong  it doesnt mean his behaviour is kind or considerate

you dont have to want to be the one who is constantly ignoring or managing someone elses every passing negative feelings or be doing all the work to redirect your partners inconsiderate bids for attention they need to do the bulk of that work themselves those are their feelings primarily their job its okay to ask for more kindness and consideration in how youre spoken to in those moments
hes a grownup he should be able to manage his disappointment better than that at a tiny little totally predictable and justifiable hiccup where he doesnt not immediately receive what he wants

it is reasonable for you to be disappointed in him for his lack of that emotional regulation skill and not showing you more consideration

youre not controlling his emotions by being disappointed in how he is managing or not managing them youre telling him that there are times like when you are in the middle of work when you expect him to moderate his behaviour and handle his emotions himself not dropping them at your feet like a dead mouse like a cat and getting pissy youre not proud of him for expressing himself

you would probably do better not to his feelings on yourself so readily  but i dont think the problem here is an equal one or a just a misunderstanding  hes not being considerate to respond with anything besides okay hun love ya talk later

well if he is then he apparently knows you well enough to know itll work 

why is this taking up any space at all in your brain 

why are you trying to read your exboyfriends mind

youre newly married ya really got nothing better to do
its a date if he wanted a professional connection he has linked in or could track down your work email

you matched on a dating app its a date
hes only sure there is nothing she can do about it once the way the baby is there not for a few years

once heard a guy at work just straight up admit he say it that way she cant leave me while shes on mat leave anyways and then shell be too busy so im probably good until they are in first grade at least
youre overthinking and these assumptions arent gonna help you any

ask the dude out yourself
i realize this isnt the best advice but youre describing almost exactly what ended my longterm relationship

my ex didnt want to make the changes necessary to be a parent himself he assumed id do the work more than what i was already doing he wanted kids like he wanted a steam achievement or a trophy from the local beer pong league he wanted to cuddle them while they peacefully slept not take the day off work when they were ill show up at championship games but not to have to figure out the carpool schedule for the weekly practices he just knew his life wouldnt change much because surely his job paid more so it would be more important he shrugged off the changes he was insisting i make to mine

women get shit on for going babycrazy but i know far more of this type of guy to go legacycrazy they dont want to parent they want to check the i passed on my genes box dont be a vessel for his ambitions if he wants to be a parent he needs to be a partner first and address your perfectly reasonable concerns and standards
you cannot make her feel something

its not about you

shes been clear she doesnt like it dont pester stop pretending there is some magic spell you need to recite she doesnt like it

frankly i dont send photos either by enjoy receiving them there i just dont feel safe and confident sending anyone any nudes at all ever i appreciate that other people are comfortable with this but im not and im not going to do it it doesnt feel good its not exciting or fun a guy who behaved like you are and created all the pressure on us both trying to earn my comfort would be extremely annoying and not someone id want to date

you could be the most trustworthy human being who ever lived and im still not going to do something i dont want to do she shouldnt either

if you dont enjoy leaving your comfort zone for her then stop doing it
you only had a foundation of five months this was the likeliest outcome of a sudden separation and she was clear with you she is overwhelmed and needs to focus on her deployment 

it doesnt mean you did anything wrong it means this situation was not conducive to a stable and healthy connection continuing to grow

cry it out eat some sugar or some carbs dont beat yourself up that an objectively tough situation in a very young relationship didnt pull through for you
most people not just women want to feel desired

its not about being a douchebag or being rude its about being expressive and transparent that youre into her sexually

the relationship might be doomed you might be incompatible

regardless youre far too old not to realize that very few people  men or women  enjoy sex with doormats we pretty much all want to feel our partner has got a full rich life they want to share time and energy with us not that they are desperately clinging to us and have nothing going on besides the relationship to which they give all thier time and engery we pretty much all want to feel our partner really wants us and is excited by us and isnt so terrified of rejection or offence that they wont express that
this is abusive behaviour consistently baseless accusations of cheating are a tactic to keep you trying to prove yourself and service his needs hes set up a sisyphean task  itll take all your energy to defend yourself and you never actually will

it may be time to tell him that you refuse to be played like that

youre willing to work through his anxieties with him but not for him if he keeps trying to make this your job to solve a problem that exists solely in his head the marriage is going to end maybe not tomorrow but sooner or later you cannot maintain a marriage where you are treated this way

ask him to see a doctortherapist on his own its a sudden change and he needs an assessment to make sure these fearsfeelings are rooted in a physical or medical issue do not agree to couples counselling unless he is willing to speak to someone himself first and he is willing to be accountable for his behaviour if he doesnt do those two things is is very likely he will just use what he learns in couples counselling to refine his tactics of abuse

and its probably time to have an emergency plan know where your important documents are and know where you are going if you need to leave quickly you need to consider the possibility of real danger
they are probably not legally married because he is on record as believing the government ruined marriage with things like nofault divorce 

unpleasant as she might be its hard not to feel for a young woman having a child with a man who has gone on record as believing she is property and should have no legal right to leave him ever
looking through your replies here i had given this guy way to much benefit of the doubt 

you are being lied and strung along hopefully that certainty makes it a bit easier cause sheesh this isnt even a case of not that into you this is a clear case of shitty person is  fucking with you stop letting them
i dont think your wife has ever had a 10 dick or toy or a bruised cervix

very very very few people actually want 10 inches of insertable length seriously

play stupid games win stupid prizes 

this was a stupid joke that you started get a grip and let it go
do we need to insult her appearance she doesnt look 35 and rationally we know shes not and shes not behaving online as if shes much above 17

she can be a deeply unpleasant person or even a bigoted and hateful person and still be in a relationship with a seriously problematic power dynamic with a man who appears to be nearly 10 years older than she is and openly discusses her and now his unborn daughter as property
shes already the second wife 

its part of his origin story his first wife was seven years older than him and apparently started cheating and doing sex work two years into their marriage

maybe the first wife was abusive maybe hes full of shit well never know but perhaps recognizing how the age gap impacted his first marriage he goes out and finds himself someone about a decade younger than him to toe the line
he doesnt have to be a narcissist to be doing you real harm

and no obviously you should not let him come crawling back

and its not ghosting if you tell him what is happening so tell him youre gonna sort out the leave then as soon as youre not legally bound to him you will be blocking him and never want to speak to him again

call a tenants rights organization in your area and then the leasing office the quicker you move to invalidate the lease the more options youll have tell them this strategic truth your exbf was misleading you and its no longer safe for you to move in with him

all of his exes are crazy all his exes will aways be crazy he makes sure to drive them crazy get rid of him for good
the baby is still in utero and hes posting about how she wont be allowed to leave the home until she is married or go to college because college is for skankroos
first lady of the manosphere one might assume 

before or after ones eyes roll right out of ones head
not having the papers isnt unusual 

coming up with several different versions of the story for not having them is and a young man spending several days without his phone in a hospital after a fall where he only has a bruise to show for it that does strain credulity

dont call his bluff dont play detective this person has barely been in your life a few months and youve found them unreliable dishonest and only reaching out to you when he needs validation or assistance 

just end it cleanly
act like nothing happened because nothing has changed 

its not like hes gonna tell your mom that hes a serial cheater 

youre both showing up for the meal because youre young people respecting your mother as host thats it just do that
you dont have to be terribly smart to be an effective manipulator toddlers are effective
we really just cannot know the legal ramifications in a case like this the parents may not have been legally entitled to visitation or the care team could have advised against it 

does it look bad from the outside hell yeah am i gonna damn the parents no they struggled for nearly a decade with a seriously ill and complex child needing to surrender a dangerously mentally ill family member to the state is a devastating decision a child even more so whatever they did wrong there is no question they have suffered

op needs to make the best choices for his own health but hating these people isnt productive from a bunch of online randos
what are you doing to manage your anxiety

because while i think your mother is being unkind and silly not to just let you be responsible for your own laundry this is not really a rational riskmanagement strategy

and when anxiety crops up in this sort of way its usually pretty damn prevalent in a bunch of other ways too
or even just indigestion

you ate too many spicy wings and are feeling pretty uncomfortable burpy or gassy or something well lets just put you in a possibly uncomfortable position and ram my body inside of you repeatedly or maybe a lot of bouncing yeah you could do all the bouncing instead what but why not
it would be unkind to ask

its perfectly acceptable to say no its just not working for you

dont worry about if youre enabling them or not just stand up for yourself this constant shortterm loaning is exhausting and uncomfortable you dont want to do it anymore

if she wants to let you know what is going on she can confide in your or not but either way youre not a cheap payday loan officer so quit that job
are you in a relationship or a hostage situation 

hes basically holding a gun to the head of the relationship and demanding you fuck him or hell shoot it dead

but its already dead tell him he is right youre not compatible youre an adult who is capable of compassion and nonsexual affection as well as sexual affection and hes just not
this relationship is over

it doesnt matter how right you are if you continue to attempt to punish her with demands of payment the relationship is over and youll never see the money

its not about who has the right its about the actual reality so just face it 

consider 800 an expensive lesson that this is not the person you want to move forward with as an adult partner with more and more serious obligations and expenses continued grievances about the debt are only going to hurt you more not make you any wealthier
your ex is an abuser and a manipulator

i honestly wouldnt believe a word he says about his dad im sure his dad is hearing all sorts of crazy untrue stories about you

the facts we know are that your 30yearold bf went from mooching off his dad to mooching off you to mooching off his dad again maybe as a super cheap babysitter 

wise up this man is already ruining your life slowly its not gonna get any better youll never appease him he wants to abuse you nothing you send him will ever convince him to stop doing the thing he wants to do it can only get worse keep records and be prepared to get the police involved if needed but end all contact with your abusive ex
i think bringing this question into a group session with people who know you a bit better and have at least a bit more similar experiences is a great idea

in the end your therapist is right this really is about what you want to do connecting with your family will be hard work in a lot of ways you dont have to do that work 

at a glance it seems your family recognizes that and is open to having as much or as little interaction as youd like 

this really is about whether or not you want to have any kind of personal relationship with them most people are gonna suggest that its probably worth the work to try to connect with them at least a bit because even just a very few personal relationships are pretty really important to human happiness however this just isnt a question anyone else can answer for you in the end this decision belongs completely to you and that does make it tough especially if youve spent a long time institutionalized and under care you may not have a lot of experience with big choices that belong entirely to you and this one really does
you do nothing you continue to come when invited and be friendly and civil 

your gf handles her mother and establishes the expectations with her for how you are treated

you dont get to make someone like you your gf gets to tell her mother what the consequences will be for their relationship if her mother isnt civil to you
you did something childish and stupid

but why would you even want to date someone who sincerely believes they need to protect their family from you

thats clearly not a situation either of you should continue in at all
you need to just stop every sort of interaction with this person except his legal form obligations to you and the child as a coparent

you and your mom should talk to a family lawyer and do not allow him into any medical appointments unless his presence makes you feel safer and more secure childbirth even at it easiest and smoothest is terrifying 

regardless of any mistake you ever made do not allow anyone in the room when youre giving birth unless that person adds to your happiness and feeling of safety please please know you can be 1000 selfish at that moment you do not owe him that that moment unless he can be trusted to behave himself  and right now he cannot he is not behaving like a coparent or someone who respects you as a the mother of his child 

you made mistakes when you were a teenager in a relationship you were also preyed on by an abuser who greatly benefited from your inexperience and immaturity to get what he wanted nothing you did means hes off the hook for his cruelty or any abuse he commited

dont rob your child because you feel guilty about being a shitty 18yearold girlfriend forget about being a girlfriend never be his girlfriend again focus on being a parent yourself and giving your child the best start you can that means clarifying his rights and responsibilities under the law to protect your child and provide what you can for them
technically true and patently ridiculous are not mutually exclusive

lets not keep such an open mind that our brains fall right out
ive always thought anyone who wants to control and abuse will use the narratives available to them to do so those people who are seeking to control can twist leftleaning narratives and language even more deceptively than fundamental faith based ones  a lot of us catch wise to those one faster these day in my 30s i actually stepped back from some guys i was friends with because i realized they were using me to virtue signal their progressiveness to dates and gfs while actually behaving in ways that were extremely conservative heteronormative andor straight up toxic in their private lives 

my feelings have always been these sorts are going to get what they want and the politics are always a mask no matte what the politics are 

but the most truly feminist men ive dated are probably the ones who talk the least about it listen the most and just focus on living their own lives aware of bias and attempting to treat women equitably
you can say no

and it sounds like you should you dont actually trust him to behave reasonably or respectfully and even if you did i dont want too is a totally good enough reason to say no i just dont want that i am comfortable with the current level of contact and not ready to be friends

no contact after a break up really should mean several months not two weeks unless there are things like leases and pets to sort out

youre not responsible for managing his insecurities for him or keeping him from feeling any pain its normal and natural for you to be happier now  thats why you broke up its okay for him to be hurt by that but its not your job to lie to him its his job to accept reality 

closure is a myth its not something you have in your purse and need to hand over to him its a thing he needs to sort out on his own 

its april i assume the semester is over soon tell him at least that you do not want more contact until after exams its not your job to address his shit right now focus on the important things you need to achieve right now
she needs to plan to do this alone you cannot do it on her timeline you need a job there and she needs to accept that if her income cannot support you both at least for several months and moving with blow through your savings then this doesnt happen yet 

do not move cross our try with her on credit card debt and no job lined up that is insane shes not a sensible adult partner if she thinks that is the right path for either of you thats not some sacrifices thats madness
imagine something totally different took place or that this woman behaved in a way i imagine she did but is in no way reflect here for the reasons i imagine she has oh also women who date online are desperate and sad and only doing it to further victimize the poor mens

nah hard pass have a good one
i think i have a chance with you so you get to be not like other girls until you disappoint me
is that better or even much different is i think youre a hot girl and i think hot girls are insert negative generalization meaningful different than not like other girls i really dont think it is 

hes the one looking down on others in that moment specifically other girls he thinks are hot hes not talking about attractive men or egotistical people generally
lets say youre absolutely right about his life experience this is still not a compliment and she doesnt have to be okay with this sort of awkwardness in the snippet we have here she does a great job of saying shes not cool with it without shaming or attacking him 

is there anyway she can say please dont shit on my gender in general that you would deem acceptable 

he might have never met a black person with a phd but if he said youre not like other black people wed all know that aint a compliment and it aint okay
yes how dare i choose not to continue in the company of a person who has a negative set of opinions about a group i belong too 

why would i possibly assume that someone who openly exposes negative biases and opinions about other girls might not actually think all that highly of me or may swiftly change their mind

why dont i take a chance on someone who expresses generalized dislike for people of my gender its probably just them being clumsy with words no way they could possibly have realized or intended to be joining in the relentless stream of lowkey misogyny of daily life 

i see now that my standards are absurdly high how dare i hold the people around me to the standard of not expressing casual contempt for people like me

s

its not a compliment just because it makes the person saying it feel good about themselves thats actually usually a pretty good sign that its not a kind thing to say it all
not only are you entitled to talk about sex and the situation regarding sex in this relationship you have too if it is triggering for them and they cannot speak with you then respectfully acknowledge that isnt the kind of relationship you want to be in its not fair to either of you and there is nothing wrong with you being clear that you want a relationship that includes mutual sexual desire andor open communication about sex
it makes sense to be stewing over it right now days after the break up but it doesnt change my advice

this is over let it be over dont give in to his halfasses promises of change accept the unknowable
the reality is you will probably never know for sure and the sooner you make peace with that the sooner youll be able to move past it

the odds of him actually going to a single therapy appointment are slim you know that he was just saying what he needed to try and renegotiate the break up 

dont get back with a guy youve always had concerns about and who behaved this way just let it be over
lots of women have internalized misogyny its best not to take it too personally

you know he was taking a dig at you it doesnt mean hes unbalanced but it does mean hes a condescending little shit 

your initial instinct was correct be less sorry to be rejected by this sort recognize your mothers limitations as a source of advice as well on what behaviour to accept from men
deliberately getting black out drunk as a goal is a problem regardless of the circumstances

you should be far more concerned about her ability to stay safe from randos or uber drives then about her past hookup if she is set out to purposely incapacitate herself in public 

i liked to club to relieve stress when i was her age but never purposefully got so drunk i couldnt remember or blacked out that was never the goal of the evening and personally i never found it that hard to not fuck around on my partner when i was in a relationship its just not that hard to not cheat
im a combination of the all girls ive seen and admired in some way is a rather lovely way to put it id hope we all are a combination of what we admire in others regardless of gender although i know took me till i was a bit older to realize what i had modelled after the positive men in my life as well
youre rolling those dice no matter who you have a child with 

you could both be phd astrophysicists and end up with a child who is bored by or struggles in school

what is far more important is that you two have some agreement about the importance of education and how you will support your children if they do struggle 

the ability to be successful in school is a nice to have a partner who is actually your loving supportive and respectful partner is a must have
nah that was a solid reply and refusal to continue down that path with her

id recommend you block her everywhere 

if she wants her buttons pushed shell do that all on her own no matter what you say so you if dont want further contact enforce it to the best of your ability
why wont women work in jobs where they are particularly unwelcome and subject to above average abuse and contempt  when they can even get hired to begin with i boggles the mind
wha i dont want people assaulted at trump rallies either

is this nutter talking about ashley babbitt cause that is just a extra plus bad terrible take
its almost like the predators dont wear little warning bells around their necks
youre not like other girls has become a straight up warning alarm for me it tells me you cannot maintain basic social ties or have friendly conversation with women you dont want to have sex with it

its not a compliment its a concerning reflection on your character dude
sounds like its actually the preference
eh sounds like thats the actual problem here 

if you distrust him this much figuring out whenif his dad called him about the accident is rather besides the point isnt it

i hope youre working with a counsellor theyll probably necessary at this point and can help you address the core issue here figuring out this phone call is not the core issue its the place the drama llama is taking a shit today
are you in the process of divorcing or not its unclear you filed months ago but still call him your so 

if you are i think you need to consider this purely from the position of coparent not spouse as a coparent what contact if any will you have with the kids grandparents and unclesaunts or do you expect all of that contact and information to flow through their father to you 

if you want to continue to have a relationship with your exinlaws then yes you should absolutely ask after their health but not quiz them in their contact with your ex so
im not offended at all advice is about perspective and im a okay that mine isnt of value to you ive honestly wished you good luck and youve kept on assuming the worst of everything i type you think maybe youre a bit needlessly combative sometimes and unable to accept another persons perspective or feelings as valid youre only options here for your partner is that hes an idiot or a liar 

just not how id want to move through the world and thats truly okay by me its just a advice
yes youre 25 this is a thing to discuss openly

just remember that opinions and situations can change its not a contract its an ongoing conversation in a relationship you should expect people to try to be honest with you about what they do know about themselves but not to know everything and not to be able to promise you exactly what sex will be like between now and 2065
i didnt say you should break up

i said i cannot imagine bringing such a demeaning and combative attitude into an important conversation with the person ive committed too everyone has flaws but i would never frame my partners this way or assume they had nothing of value in their own perspective or choices on a subject doing so would make me miserable 

good luck
and youre not gonna leave him after describing him that way sesh okay i cannot imagine committing to someone in my 30s if we both agreed they were fundamentally objectively childish and just having to work around that 

i didnt suggest behaving like a teacher but communicating openly as if two adults are involved with some appreciation for differences in knowledge and values but hey if you both know this is what works good luck
yeah shitty turn of phrase i can see how that was hurtful im sorry

see she how fucking easy that is

it was more important to your husband that he got to blame you for ruining the morning than it was for him to 5 seconds of emotional reflection and just say yeah ok i can do better

our language is full of phrases and idioms that are hurtful and biased and bigotted no one is gonna avoid them perfectly but dear god its not that hard to take a beat and think thats not so hot really

also how much dusting and vacuuming does this asshat do i might hazard a guess
yes they can it can be wildly variable people are complicated

some people dont experience much sexual arousal at all both men and women can be on the extremes of really higharousal or very low women are often shamed and judged for high and men are usually shamed and judged for low but we all exist on a wide spectrum and a spectrum that can even shift throughout our lives

a lot of women especially young women are not encouraged to understand their own sexual arousal or ever express it openly sometimes they simply dont know how because there arent many healthy models for it but it can also be shameful or even unspokenly dangerous for them to try

you were both young you dont need to be quizzing women or trying to read your exs mind thats not gonna help you need to be working on putting down the baggage you picked up from an early relationship that didnt work out well for either of you
hoping hed figure it out andor expecting a better job at the age of 30 are still you describing situations that might be within his risk tolerance

look i agree with you there is a real problem here in your position id be unhappy with my partner too but you need to stop approaching it with this insulting attitude that he is childish or evil he wasnt meeting your unspoken standards for financial security they werent his standards and he didnt have the information or the skills to know what yours were or how to meet them

you should ask for what you need clearly but kindly with your ears open to his actual feelings and perspectives

especially if there isnt a snowballs chance in hell of ending this relationship over this then put your damn fists down and set the worst of your judgements of his character aside begin from the place of him not being able to know what you dont tell him and you not knowing what his overall risk tolerance is in the longterm thatll be a way more productive conversation then trying to tell him he cannot afford to live like he saw his parents live
i have understood that you are not interested in any advice or in adjusting of the thing you can control   your own behaviour  for the possibility of better outcomes while dating you want to date the majority of women apparently well also blaming all women apparently for a problematic system you are choosing to active reinforce and engage with

okay thats fine by me thats how you want to play it then good luck with it
is she cleaning up the children and dusting while also touching up her make up and taking 15 minutes to rest all magically before knowing whether or not hell come home late or not
you can say pretty whatever you want and experience what you experience but you talked about studies and i think you took the wrong lesson from the data

the lesson from the data is that consistently paying for all dates isnt as good or necessary strategy for men as they seem to believe it is to get to date the women who actually want to date them
im glad you dont expect me to address your personal attacks so thinly veiled as genuine curiously but you gave my bf a good laugh so thank you 

the point i was making which could be actually quite useful was not about most women and certainly not most american women it is that if you assume all women are like x you are likely to only engage with women who confirm that belief youve set up a dynamic where you understand one anothers expectations you will be avoided or weeded out by women who are not like x or who very much dont want much of x in their lives if any so if you dont like x stop engaging in the behaviour that attracts and reinforces x fewer dates but better ones compatibility not high scoring
you mean the studies that found women who scored higher in all three of the dark triad personality traits of narcissism psychopathy and machiavellianism were much more likely to engage in foodie calls and the women who scores lowest either didnt do it or felt they had done it said rarely and i would argue because of the guilt and social shame of accepting a meal from someone youre in the fence about

i mean if were taking about the science men should absolutely stop trying to buy sex with meals perhaps pay for the first invitation they make and then switch to dutch rather quickly its not a particularly good strategy with any group of women anymore to pay for all dates thats what should be known widely  based on studies and surveys  but rejected by men who view dating more as a gamble as a numbers game instead of a compatibility search
sounds like youre holding yourself to the traditional standard and then being annoyed that is resulting in more dates with women who accept those standards and performances youre indicating and initiating 

if a man in the early dating stage is taking all the initiative and has cast himself as pursuer i assume he wont be comfortable with me stepping up  and when i actually like him enough to try to correct this dynamic i often find i was right he couldnt hack with me if i wasnt a passive recipient 

if you were looking for actual compatibility instead of access youd probably have fewer dates but better ones
i think the thing you really need to recognize and except is that he does feel secure with this

he probably wasnt lying to you he probably wasnt withholding or keeping secrets this wasnt just technically good for him this is what financial stability looks like to him hes living just barely within his means and will i would agree with you that thats not really what stable is  for lots of people its the best they ever hope for

youre in your 30s you own a home together while your current financial set up might have been working so far you need to see this as a big sign that you chew skipped over some really important conversations about longterm goals savings and retirement
your gf seems to have unrealistic expectations  

your sister isnt her peer or her bestie she doesnt owe your girlfriend the attention and validation shes seeking 

does your gf frequently make vague break up threats when she doesnt get exactly what she wants
he is being controlling dangerously extremely controlling 

hes also told you that he cannot control himself at all at parties or around pretty women he doesnt even really think he should have too its their fault if hes aroused by them 

break up and block him quickly it is unlikely the break up will stop his attacks completely you need to stay safe have zero contact
you know he has an army of underpaid support staff predominantly woman who feed and cloth him care for his home and any children or pets and schedule his personal life for him 

which is why none of his employees can out work him while absolutely working harder every day than this price of shit human can even fathom
watch out pearl shes way hotter and we know thats all that really matters
you should have gotten rid of him after the rave

disappointment is valid but this guy is just an asshole who cannot handle lifes hiccups without assigning blame and being a condescending shithead hopefully hell grow out of it but i wouldnt suggest sticking around and finding out
i think being nervous of friendly men at 23 years old is totally normal youve probably met a lot of men who are willing and eager to take any opening they get

but its not everyone as you age is a bit fewer people

your boyfriend trusts you but you need to build your trust in yourself your own instincts and your own boundaries you got this you dont need to be second guessing yourself all the time you can be a human being and you can extend trust to men to be human beings  and you can revoke that trust in individual men as needed
i wish theyd just do a better job of securing the provider type so id run into fewer of them
its probably better that you not get too involved in the early stages even if it was your dialect youd want him to find his bearings through instructions before you got too involved

i understand being disappointed this isnt something you can share but it also sounds like that wasnt a core goal of what he needs to achieve for his work that is sad but it also makes a lot of sense

he also probably isnt aware of the depth of differences and the strong feelings between the two dialects my partner thought id be keen to use my french when we travel he had to see for himself a few times how my french was not always welcomed or understood by french people before he really started to get how different my dialect was from how most of the world speaks no matter how many times i told him he had to feel it before he believed it until then it was all just french to him
that is childish and cruel

if he has a problem with how your anxiety impacts his life he should discuss it with you like an adult and figure out what boundaries he needs to have or accommodations you need to make he can talk about that and figure it out 

if he cannot talk about it in that kind of reasonably way he is either too mean to date or too stupid

he shouldnt be punishing you the way we do yappy little dogs or how shitty parents manage toddlers
why did he do this

were the classes easier to access

is he choosing a dialect that is more commonly spoken or easier to learn

when my partner wanted to learn french i actively steered him away from my dialect because the accent and diction are globally perceived as being cheap or not proper i actively encouraged him to learn metropolitanparsian french because we could still speak to one another just fine but hed get more use out of it in the rest of his life if it didnt stick to the way i spoke

i can understand why you might have some feelings but i think youre being a bit unfair if hes choosing something that will be more broadly useful or accessible for him not to mention picking on someones accent or tone in the early learning stages is just decidedly unhelpful in my opinion
this is the woman who once said  if we took away womens right to vote wed never have to worry about another democrat president its kind of a pipe dream its a personal fantasy of mine

i think its a bit foolish to imagine she does anything but run her mouth for attention 

there is no realizing of any kind going on shes white and wealthy she got hers she doesnt actually give a shit she just figured out a thing to tweet that would get the attention of both echo chambers
dude ya do you have a problem with bi women you told us so listen to yourself

when you say shit like is the way i feel justifiable by my morals and ethics what you are very clearly saying is you believe there is something inherently unethical or immoral about women who experience sexual attraction to other women as well as men

you shouldnt date anyone you dont want to but youre being a naive asshole when you pretend your preferences are not rooted in stereotypes isms or phobias they often are hell a lot of our biases against smokers are i wouldnt date a smoker either but i acknowledge that some of the beliefs and attitudes i have about smokers are unfair and biased and its still not cool to compare sexual orientation to the choice to smoke or being an addict comparing being lgbtq to addiction or choice to smoke would be kinda homophobic

you said things above that make it clear yours are rooted in biphobia and nasty assumptions about the character and values of bisexual people you said yourself that you perceived bisexual as less ethical and moral than heterosexuals like yourself

we none of us are immune from the cultural messages that judge or demean others you seemed to be capable of recognizing this when it was directed at bisexual men dont pretend to be blind when you are the one directing these biases and judgements at bisexual women

dont date bisexuals we cool please dont but also dont be shitty and pretend its just a preference you got some shit to unpack dont put it on other people or let yourself totally off on the hook none of us are perfect and you just said a bunch of shit that is biphobic accept it and youll be able to better avoid it

edit sexual orientation not sexual irritation lol
you are being irrational

its biphobia when people assume girlongirl is just something fun for guys to watch and not real meaningful sex between two people who enjoy and care for one another its biphobia when men are shamed for secretly being gay or treated like they are gross and its also biphobia when you assume a bisexual isnt just as capable of monogamy and loyalty as any random heterosexual

you are entitled to this bit of irrationality and shouldnt date anyone you dont want to

its not anyone elses job to make you not biphobic youre not a monster but you are wrong and you absolutely need to stay away from bi people as dates its not kind or fair to them to make them address your irrationality or bias you should probably be thoughtful about how you treat any bisexuals or pansexuals you know socially you are experiencing a bias that is not true or kind

there are plenty of men who feel as you do i get it a fair bit i appreciate it when they just keep that hateful bullshit to themselves and acknowledge they just are not keen to date a bisexual 

source a bisexual woman
i think its more likely than youre imagining if its no big deal to this woman or her husband they might bring it up when they run into each other oh youre s wife yeah we dated years ago back in  such a small world that we both ended up raising our families here

no matter how small the risk you think it is it exists i wouldnt roll those dice on my partner
youre doing the right thing

you may consider asking them to join you on a day trip instead of phrasing it as a gift to them ask them for their company as a gift to you and naturally as it is a thing you are planning and want to share with them you will pay a concert or play a trip to the beach especially something your cousins will enjoy instead of giving them a thing involve them in an experience with you 

dont try to force cash on them in the end you are barely an adult in their mind be gracious if they want to treat you like a young relative who is not yet expected to contribute money

when you leave send them some photos and a long thank you note of your best memories that is clearly what they value from the visit

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

youre 30 youve been in couples counselling for ages she says shes not in love anymore you dont trust her when it comes to money and you cannot communicate about it

of course you should find your own apartment youre just coasting downhill with a woman who seems unwilling to actually break up with you set yourself free
its a small town gonna be way worse if she finds out in any other way besides you speaking up

and thats why you should do it for her sake to spare her any risk of confusion or embarrassment by not knowing something that some else does thats the benefit to her

it is also about you feeling better tell her that this is ancient history and i dont plan on seeking out her company but ive been thinking about it and i know if roles were reversed id be hurt by you not telling me so im telling you really just to manage my own feelings about it and my discomfort with keeping it a secret and so that you never get blindsided by someone else mentioning something to you
you need to start saying no kindly but firmly 

thank you but no that isnt enough notice for me to comfortably get ready

im sorry but no ive told you i require at least x number of hours notice to host people in my home and x hours before leaving the home id really appreciate you respecting my timlines so i can join you in the future 

boundaries dont control what they do a boundary is about how you are going to respond if they dont meet your needs or standard and what you are choosing for yourself once you state a boundary you have to choose it enforce it and often enforcing a boundary means you dont get what you most want either

the only power you have here is to withdraw your participation if they value your company and presence in their lives they will adapt
you can always leave a relationship you dont want to be in for any reason

you havent been happy in this relationship for a rather long time it would be silly to continue

you need to end contact there is nothing to gain by treating this like its an ongoing conversation its not its over
have you been friends for years

or have you been waiting for years thinking someday your friendship will earn you a date

because its totally reasonable for her to be fearful of the latter
dude you have zero interest in understanding why this is a bad take and not how consent or respect work a bunch of people have tried to explain peddle your willful ignorance elsewhere or create your own op for advice on how to human and what does consent mean
yes consent is her view mutually enjoyable sex is her view if its not yours well nothing much else to say youre just kinda gross 

i really wish you were just an ignorant teenager but ive dated enough to know youre probably just a sad adult who cant get outta their own way
no man that is the twisted part about of this whole thing the fact she did it before is why she knows she doesnt want too sex is supposed to be mutually enjoyable and consensual not a reward for boys its a not a gift she gave other men but if withholding now that is a pure toxic attitude 

shes not withholding hugs shes just not consenting to a sex act she knows well enough to know she doesnt want to perform again

if a guy wrote mushy love letters before and didnt want to with me than id assume he didnt much enjoy writing them back then either and felt forced to perform
break up with her if you need a relationship where oral sex is performed on you she is not offering you that kind of relationship

stop talking about what she consented to in the past that part makes you the selfish piece of shit here and that is not justified just because she consented to something in the past doesnt mean she is required to continue consenting today she doesnt want to do it dont be the next in a line of assholes who bully and whine at her until she gives in

be the honest guy who admits he really wants that in his relationship and breaks up to go find someone who is offering that kind of relationship
 i love her and would like to date her

this is why 

she doesnt trust you to respond reasonably to her dating life she doesnt want your opinion she is aware it is biased she may also be trying not to hurt you with the information she reasonably assumes you dont want to hear about 

if she doesnt want this subject to be part of her friendship with you then you cannot force it what this means though is that you need to move on and not keep trying to win her over she is probably well aware she could date you if she wanted too she doesnt want too
im not on my own today i think weve made the right decision for us both on balance  when i said it wasnt a problem i meant i was perfectly comfortable with the decision do you have a different idea of what would be best choice right now because i would hope if you did you would state it just as clearly as i just did and id believe you just like i need you to believe me when i speak

the one i frequently use with my partner is if you were holding me back from something i felt strongly about youd absolutely hear about it

you cannot fix this for him he needs a therapist to unpack and challenge what is in essence a toxic communication pattern but you should be clear with him that this behaviour is not respectful or kind and that youd like him to do better
you know he overreacted but youre also kind of full of shit arent ya cause it isnt just curious when you hunt the smell down say yuck and are visibly disgusted those are actions those are actions that are reasonably insulting to another person

this other person might also be an asshole but also you walked into someone elses home and insulted their cooking your behaviour was insulting and you lied about and minimized it when confronted instead of saying dude im sorry im sure its great for lot of people its just not for me

lifes easier without a stick up your ass thats a bit of advice that might be useful for you as well as for him but since youre the one asking do a bit better dont be such a bullshitter if you fuck up just say you fucked up and move on
be a grown up and express your boundaries 

you dont want to be friends its not an insult its doesnt mean she did something wrong there are lots of awesome people i dont want to be besties with

you have no reason to fear abuse or harassment from her give her the courtesy and kindness of telling that while you think she is a lovely person there is just too much history and you arent comfortable maintaining contact or being her friend then block her without guilt
you should explore types of therapy and different approaches its important o have some trust in that relationship 

digging into root causes is not actually the most effective form of therapy for a lot of struggles 

i personally prefer cbt which focuses on current behaviour and changing the thought patterns behind them

if you want to talk about how your mother treated you when you were a toddler or about the meaning of your dreams you need a different kind of therapy
why arent you listening to your therapist they have already explained this perfectly well 

if she wants a man like xyz she should go find him

its okay to break up with her without first labelling her as the hypersensitive bad guy you can just stop the thing that isnt working without demonizing one another
ive been wondering if the reveal of 50k fine for not making it to altar explains a bit more about why zackirina couldnt walk away when it clearly wasnt working and if the conversation in the bedroom where they break it off which was one of the few moments i had a tiny bit of respect for irina was only allowed to happen once the producers had agreed to let them off the hook
there is a line between addressing your partners biases or limitations and being condescending as all hell you are in real danger of crossing it here

it also seems likely that a lot of this is you externalizing your own emotional reactions and anxieties and assigning them to her character as if they were all her negative traits  when they really are more about your own bad mental habits and insecurities

i think youd be very very wise to first consider how you can adapt your responses before putting it in writing that you think she is childish and unrealistic you seem to be very quick to interpret her passing comments as insults and take them deeply to heart that may not be fair or true to her experience or her meaning

you may have a relationship issue as well but you absolutely have a stress management issue your anxiety about communicating your own needs and timelines seems to be the much larger issue here you should be looking for positive and constructive ways to communicate your own timelines needs and concerns about what the future looks like together to advocate for yourself in the relationship not reasons to call her a child or knock her down a few pegs or burst her bubble or make her be realistic but instead communicating openly about what you do want to work towards and when you think you can so youre both talking about reality sometimes and not just vague hopes or fantasies if you really think that of her then you have a much larger reconsideration to do
sperate your questions for a bit

is there something about your own behaviour youre not happy with feeling isolated from a tradition or norm isnt always a pleasant feeling but unless you are unhappy with your own choices that is a feeling that is entirely yours to manage as an adult  as you rightly realized no one should be restricting themselves so you dont feel left out they are in their own home not a kindergarten class 

feeling out of place is a you problem for you to navigate and manage and you are a bit out of place thats okay our families extend and can contain people who are very different from us sometimes it really is okay i am ludicrously out of place when i visit my family in rome its a bit awkward but a loving sort of awkward

the second issue is about what you want to ask others for as a favour out of consideration for you the fact your daughter asked you initially about the pool makes me suspect that if you say hanging out naked over our morning coffee was just a tiny step too far for me would you mind wearing some clothing if were having a longer conversation  

it doesnt sound like you need boundaries or strict rules just to give your daughter a heads up that while you are fully respecting and supporting her choices in her own home as a guest with very different life experiences youre struggling with some things
also didnt like cole at all he was attention seeking and instigating throughout he only got a pass because zanab was so awful hopefully hes grown
i want to agree but micha is plenty old enough to see the consequences of the company she keeps and make better choices for herself the reformed mean girls i know had made the break by 26 hopefully the show was the kick in the ass she needed
he only has these questions after she said she wasnt feeling it

op came here to get the she should have disclosed pile on  even though he claimed to be accepting of her choice initially  and hes exactly the validation he came looking for and very little advice on how not get into this sort of pointless argument in the future with women who dont wish to date him
you debated someone and insulted them when they were just trying to end the connection 

doesnt matter if you had a point that was a dumb and counterproductive thing to do that was only going to be mean and dramatic like i said before the correct response is thank you and good luck
i told you how to improve in the future  with anyone not just a trans woman you dont seem that interested that part tho did you just come here to find people to tell you she did a bad bad thing by not disclosing why is it so hard to just not be compatible and leave it at that or to not clap back at someone who is telling you they arent interested
no man based on your own story here you were mainly frustration was with being rejected you were willing to accept the situation  you thought it had been a good date  until she told you she wasnt feeling it

the correct response to im not feeling the connection is thank you for letting me know good luck out there you dont ask why especially not if you cant handle the answer without arguing with them no matter what else nonsense they have to say you dont debate them you gtfo and be glad for it that is what you do next time you get told no by anyone 

you tried to knock her down a peg because you were disappointed and angry with the rejection you didnt think you deserved to be rejected for the reasons she gave but thats not how compatibility works youre not entitled to a certain number of chances or even to being properly understood a trans woman doesnt have to fall in love with you because you dont react with horror

that the advice for next time when someone rejects you you say good luck not well actually let me explain to you the shitty things i think you did and why your rejection of me is wrong thats just pointless drama and ego defence

that has nothing to do with her being trans thats just a really really stupid way to handle rejection
this isnt complicated 

you werent compatible regardless of her being trans you were already not compatible she told you so given the differences in preferences and feelings about your conversation youd be reasonable to agree with her on that much 

while i would generally agree people should disclose prior to sexual intimacy  for their own safety more than anything  it really sounds a lot like you were more frustrated at being rejected than by anything else it really sounds like youre trying to make her the bad guy because she didnt want to see you again 

put your wounded ego aside stop getting twisted youre not compatible the rest is details take the l end of story
relationships arent hostage situations
most people understand this just fine

block him and dont take his shit

for anyone else just tell them he deserves to find someone who really wants to be with him it wouldnt have been right to waste his time and pretend to feel what you didnt  

or tell them he was manipulating and mean cause that is also true
tell him that the healthy and adult way to deal with feelings is to communicate respectfully hes certainly allowed to feel hurt but this behaviour should be beneath him you made a request for your comfort and he seems to be responding with spite

if he cannot manage better right now take a break and take yourself out for dinner
you should block him this is rude this is unpleasant 

this is not enriching your life in any way 

youre allowed to nope outta something even if they arent actively harassing you
why the only thing i could see changing my opinion here is why did he expect to be fired

if he did something to risk his employment and kept that from you that may be a serious problem or present a major judgmentcharacter issue 

otherwise i wouldnt get my knickers in a knot about a day people dont always make good choices when they are panicking 

you had even less power than he did for those 48 hours all his choice did was rob him of your support during a tough day
it is a bit weird but its also a reasonable series of events given the recent relationship events

let the sister make nice and go to the reception as a guest not as a member of the wedding party
id be less worried about controlling and more worried that hes masking his own serious doubts and real wants under well you cant really want this do you that way he doesnt have to take accountability or feel like the bad guy for leaving a relationship that doesnt meet his needs
honestly dont beg someone to be with you

ge needs to manage these feelings better himself it shouldnt be your parttime job in the relationship to build him up occasional insecurities are things we all feel but if this is a common tune in your relationship he needs to be told its not respectful or kind  and that if he keeps on saying hes not good enough one of these days youre gonna have to assume what he really means is that he doesnt want to continue with you

its good you have some time together planned but in the meantime id put a foot down kindly but firmly youre an adult who is capable of her own choices and those choices deserve respect feeling insecure is one thing constantly questioning you is a different thing he needs to work on this
i understand you dont think youre actively trying to claim power but if youre trying to say yay were a team lets solve this together partner when she fundamentally doesnt want to play then just youre deluding yourself and inviting more disappointment and frustration into your relationship and your own life

youre lying to yourself about the situation because the situation is emotionally unpleasant for you

support is great when someone wants it and is open to it when someone is not its just painful and insulting for both parties you cannot support her out of a thing she is comfortable choosing for herself support is not the issue there

you dont need to turn your feelings off but there does come a point where you need to manage yourself and make choices for yourself not her you cannot make choices for her advocating for her against her will is not okay  and will not work 

if she genuinely doesnt want to quit and that does seem likely to be the outcome of any difficult conversations ahead then this is a you problem its a you problem about what kind of relationship youre willing to be in
is he insecure or he is telling you that he believes youre not compatible

do really believe youre compatible what are the steps youre planning to explore that or test living togeather or are these constant rounds of reassurance preventing you from having the serious adult think about that you need to have

dont beg an adult to be with you hes plenty old enough to know himself and own his own shit if he believes youre not compatible in your lifestyles or careers he needs to own that not make it your problem to emotionally handle for him
she doesnt want to quit shes not being open and honest with you about that because she knows damn well you dont want to hear that message you want to talk about what you can do together and she doesnt there isnt a together problem here there is a you problem its the one reality you dodge over and over age shes not trying because she doesnt particularly want to  certainly doesnt want to enough 

you keep coming back around and around about trying to support her but youre actually not on her team if shes not playing that game

it doesnt matter how valid your concerns are or how supportive you want to be if shes just not motivated to change

you do need to talk about this but its time to have the real talk where start trying to take ownership of the problems you cannot solve and stop claiming power over the ones you cannot the problems you can solve are you can stop kidding yourself you can stop approaching this as a team effort when its and never has been you can be honest about what kind of partnership youre willing to be in
you just listed a bunch of reasons to absolutely not date her again but instead you remain fixated on the possibility she was recently in a relationship andor having sex with a woman and has chosen not to be transparent with you about that past relationship

there is nothing here to accuse her of there is just someone to not date if that is how you feel about the possibility of a relationship with a woman in the recent past

this is not about my hangups nothing you have said has changed my read on your behaviour the worst thing i can about her is that you allow her to bring out some ugly shit in you

you need to wise up shes not hurting you right now shes not denying you anything youre entitled too youre hurting yourself with assumptions entitlements and baseless expectations
youre noticing you dont actually want to date her  the person she actually is  and need to stop fucking around as if you might stop trying to make that into a story where shes a bad person own your own bullshit this is clearly not the woman for you
it was on the list of a thousand reasons and just because shes not closeted doesnt mean she wants to deal with your weird fixation and invasive bullshit

if i suspected you of the kind of assumptions and spinning out that youre engaging in with this question i 100 wouldnt give you any information about my previous relationships  especially if they werent heteropassing you do not appear able to handle it well
stop spending so much time trying to read her mind and speak up for your damn self if there is something you want or need from this reconnection that you are not getting

youre really not being much better than she is if youre choosing to keep the fact you believe they were in a romantic relationship from her

your real problem here  the one you could actually control yourself  is the fact youre not being transparent about what you think you know or about what you want from this renewed connection all you have here is a bunch of assumptions and attempts to read her mind

you dont know how they defined their relationship you dont even seem to know exactly how youre defining your connection with this woman right now

stop accusing her of deceit when youre not being any more transparent and forthright than she is there are a thousand reasons she may be framing it the way she is including not wanting to out herself with you or face any of the typical random male judgement many bisexual women have to regularly face because this shit is often just so damn important to men who have no business with it anyways
someone else cheated on him so youre not allowed to select your friends or your health care providers

big nope

cheating is devastating handling it respectfully doesnt mean becoming a controlling asshat with every other partner in your life
let it go

youre only hurting yourself by letting this bitterness fester

get rid of it all quickly its not useful to you
youre not wrong your bf is old enough to know better and it was reasonable not to want to discuss it over text 

and as much as you may not like t personally i suspect your bf is also a bit delusional 

i wouldnt date a guy so willfully out of touch with reality either about t or about my own legitimate anger with his shitty drunken behaviour
dont keep such an open mind that your brain falls out

its reasonable to want to date a man who is wearing clean underwear each day

his insulting manipulative and flat out verbally abusive responses to this situation are serious red flags and raise big questions about his character  a much larger issue than his hygiene
nah he doesnt get off quite that easily

his forgetfulness about her limits is still a real problem he has been dodging the real conversations and considerations he needs to bring to this subject and is benefiting from her reasonable desire for equity and using that to manipulate her into spending way beyond her means 

op isnt perfect but the fact op would like to keep some equity in the relationship when it comes to meals out doesnt mean he isnt also a willfully stupid and selfish asshat
he certainly could lots of people would 

but if he doesnt want to  or even if op does not want that dynamic  then he lives with her within her limits and stops constantly pressuring her with his forgetfulness and emotional manipulation
in the context of him constantly forgetting that shes a fulltime student on a budget that wasnt a genuine offer just manipulation a genuine offer would have sounded like of course not could you bake a cakeplan a movie date thatd be lovely

hes not as dumb as hes pretending to be hes as dumb as is convenient for him to be

op does need to do better but when she does this relationship will likely come to an end because of course she doesnt want to have to be constantly reminding him of things a reasonable person could retain without difficult and op cannot properly communicate her way out of his kind of bullshit
what makes perfect sense about it general labour is an absurd term almost meaningless to take them as a group 

some general labour makes 7 an hour other general labour makes 100k a year the difference is industry unions and tradition not skill or even capital generation

if we have social programs to subsidize some kinds of labour that you imagine dont generate enough capital to pay a living wage then were not protecting individuals in society at all were only protecting illusionary profits for the executives and owners
do you think your boyfriend is a complete fucking moron because you shouldnt date complete fucking morons and either he is too dumb to date or he is playing stupid to avoid the real compromises and conversations that are required in a relationship where there is a financial imbalance

its not rocket science that you have no income

youre not making him feel guilty you are trying to live within your means he should feel embarrassed by his willful ignorance and the ongoing issues of his inconsiderate behaviours when it comes to the expectations he places on you to spend 

this man needs to hurt he should be hurting 

if he says hes feeling guilty and hurting right now say good you need to feel this pain as well because you keep putting financial expectations on me that are not reasonable and any halfway intelligent person would know they arent reasonable for a fulltime student with no income its not fair that i have to constantly carry the pain of trying to keep up with you and communicate this to you over and over again i need to say no more and you need to be more considerate and thoughtful and actually listen when i say no

he needs to feel the pain of his stupid inconsiderate behaviour because you are describing an adult man who is either too dumb to bother dating or who is just so blissfully selfish as to not see that going dutch on dinner at restaurants several times a week is not feasible for a fulltime student

he should feel guilty about how he has arranged the expectations about money in this relationship he has been selfish and stupid guilt is the proper emotional response to being regularly unkind to you as a partner
people like you have arbitrarily decided some labourers dont deserve to eat
right she got a salary of 11 million and 39 million in stock awards and other forms of compensation

not much of a defence really that the average joe doesnt understand how executive compensation is structured the end result is the same her pay appears not be tied to performance and think of the companys needs  but everyone elses is
shes not into whatever youre asking for however basic you may feel it may be shes not into it

the rest of your relationship works because you have similar values and needs in other aspects of the partnership in this area you dont

you need to make a choice about the kind of relationship you can commit too and how much communication on the subject you can invest 

in the end though if she doesnt want what you want her to want there is no way to communicate past that there isnt much to work on there either you can make someone make an effort sometimes but you cannot make someone sincerely want something for themselves they just dont
why wont he have a diploma and a drivers licence

unless his parents are abusive or his home life is so unstable hes not able to get those things completed while living at home then i would make both of those a requirement as well as the job if he leaves home without those things its exceedingly unlikely hell get them 

if you dont want a roommate dont agree to do this hes looking for an easy escape but if hes not already doing the work to complete his diploma and take safe steps forward hes not gonna do that work living with you two either once hes in youre not getting him out until he gets really uncomfortable in your home
would be way more turned off by someone who has already declared i will reject them than i would by someone who has lived a damn life by age 46
id be a bit resentful too if i thought i was entering a partnership where my opinion would matter at all and my longterm safety would be a factor to consider and it turned out i was just a tenant whose rent fluctuate based on repairs a bit of resentment is a rational response to a situation where op mistakenly believed she would be a larger part of the longterm planning than she is
we dont know that op is extremely disempowered 

please we can be reasonable adults about this we dont have to keep such an open mind that our brains fall right out 

op did choose to enter the marriage on these terms  she can be held accountable for that  but the current situation does leave her deeply disempowered and with far more limited choices than her wife has reserved for herself and that is something they are both responsible for addressing 

the main gripe here is clearly about security and partnership even if op loved the home and it was in good repair there would still be some concerns here about ops ability to create a secure longterm plan
im actually realizing that while i might be married financially im still single

while this is frustrating and sad for you i think its an important realization and something to share with her her choices have left your longterm financial security up to you because her plans dont meet your needs or leave you feeling secure and reasonably they shouldnt 

so youre going to have to make your plans independent of hers and one of the things that require from her right now is that rent is just rent it doesnt change because she needs to make capital improvements or repairs the two of you need to settle on a reasonable market rate and then that is the money she gets from you towards the home if shes not prepared to plan with you then she doesnt get to rely on your additional support for her personal homeownership plans
but the market rate rent shouldnt change because the owner needs to make repairs the owner just needs to make the repairs 

ops wife has set up a system where op is extremely disempowered in all choices from where to live to what repairs to prioritize and even what the rent actually is each month and prone to emotional manipulation to take on more risksresponsibilitiescosts for home ownership without any of the rewards or rights op is totally right to see this situation as insecure and unsafe financially for herself
you both need some serious financial advice and ideally from someone who has experiencing working with couples

a rental agreement that changes on the basis of necessary repairs isnt a rental agreement

right now your wife has the benefit of a secure tenant you without the real obligations to a committed a life partner also you youre not feeling secure because you are not a secure and respected partner in the home youre a tenant who is easily manipulated emotionally by status as wifey whenever it is convenient and then demoted to tenant whenever that is more convenient 

if your partner isnt willing to change that situation then i think you need to take a step back and think like a renter 

the current agreement means you are basically single and renting from a financial perspective and you should make your plans based on that if youre renting at 58 and still renting at 67 you need to know what you can afford in rent and be prepared to say no to major repairs and capital improvements to a home you merely rent in you need a tenancy agreement on paper and the rent should only be raised in accordance with local laws or at market rates not based on your partners needs in that way you can plan for your retirement independently from your wifes property plans
you sound like you have totally incompatible goals about how to spend money and time if you dont want to fund her travels you need to be honest about that 

while there is no shame in living at home its perfectly fair for her to say it makes you incompatible with her as a partner 

if i had been dating someone for three years and they preferred saving money at home to starting a shared life with me id be questioning the relationship as well a lot of women you date at this age will not want to date someone who still lives at home simply because of the restrictions it creates on the relationship
youve indenified the right problem

he told you not to expect him to moderate his behaviour properly hes making excuses for the next time he behaves badly when he doesnt get his way its important for adults to be able to roll with a bit of inconvenience or disappointment without acting like little shits or worse

i would date a guy who said im sorry its something im working on but not a guy who said im sorry but its just who i am so youre going to have to accept it sometimes

dont date someone who spends the first few weeks warning you they are going to treat you poorly they will and then they will turn around and blame you for not accepting the shitty treatment
dont speak to what he feels or what he knows dont make assumptions or put words in his mouth dont be condescending 

dont create false hope the idea that you may change your mind or get back together some day are normal fantasies to have but they are almost always fantasies right now its a break up because you want to break up

speak for yourself and speak honestly youre happy you dont feel youre compatible you want to break up
the first thing you do to get through this is abandon all illusions of control

there are no perfect words or magic incantation that make this go perfectly smoothly and gives you everything you want  including the vague hope of a future where you reconnect 

be clear to be kind dont let it be drawn out unnecessarily dont get into a debate dont pursue closure closure is a thing for you each to figure out on your own its not work you do together

remember that he doesnt owe you friendship any more than you owe him a relationship you can ask for what you want but in the end if he doesnt also want that or if he wants to set this bridge on fire and piss on the flames there is nothing you can do to change that
this is all more than a little silly

i have rarely been the only person with my name in any class or workplace

your gf could go by that name she is currently choosing not for her own reasons consideration convenience or anything else ifwhen your gf chooses to go primarily by that name she can and will

my mother and my partners mother have the exact same name its only very occasionally confusion we know who is who
hes probably not the safest or healthiest person for you to seek support from for these big feelings 

for that reason i wouldnt do it you need and deserve support far more than he has any right to know what was in the end a personal medical event your ex is just not the right place to go looking for that comfort and empathy a week after the breakup
tell him to stop bringing it up unprompted its unwelcome this is the opposite of helpful

hes only making another barrier for you and making it a bit harder for you to be honest and transparent with him  because you dont want to have to manage his feelings about it 

tell him in no uncertain terms to back the hell off if he means well then he needs to do well and doing well right now means shutting up completely about this for a least a few weeks
she a mentally ill addict with ten years on you 

you dont handle her you handle you and you step away from a connection that is not healthy or productive for you
this before the reunion i was willing to cut marshall a lot a slack for being an imperfect human being in a very shitty situation 

now i just plain old dont like him hes not a monster just a big ole nope
jordon peterson retired from uoft he had not taught since 2017 which is a polite way of saying he was no longer welcome or productive in any serious academic environment and hadnt been for a long while

hes a grifter he found a more lucrative grift on the radicalization pipeline 

he did not and will not respect transgendered students he was never threatened with jail for misgendering of his students he was fundamentally mischaracterising the law he was merely sternly reminded by his employer that he was expected to treat individuals on campus with respect after he went in the record saying he may choose not too respect if an individuals pronouns if he decides they were being political or had a chip on their shoulder about it

the ontario college of psychologists is positioned to discipline him and remove his license  not because of his transphobia  but because of his shameless trolling grandiosity attentionbaiting and pontificating on subjects way outside of his areas of competence if you want to behave like joe rogen you dont get to keep your license as a clinician 

and no official position on homosexuality is laughable attempt at a defence did you really type that with a straight face if you did you may want to read up on his official positions on climate change thats funnier and makes it all the more concerning if paul is following him unironically
id been skeptical of this reading of him until the reunion he didnt mean nurturing he absolutely meant submissive and servile and he didnt tell her because the first rule of these philosophies is that you never tell a woman plainly what you actually think of her or her entire gender 

i dont like micah very much but i do believe she sincerely grew during this experience  and she needed too she seemed far younger than her actual 27 years  but her real crime with paul seems to be she wasnt quite malleable enough
no man what she knows is she can do what she wants and then punish you for a while if you dare to point out shes being shitty

that what she knows to expect 

if you dont want to date someone who behaves this way then you have to not date someone who behaves this way
why on earth would you want to marry this woman she understands just fine she understands she can bully and torture you into even considering this absurdity
and thats exactly the dynamic you want to maintain her looking ridiculous you looking bored

keep the rest of this to yourself
thats precisely my point

this emotional reaction is as much as a threat to you if not more than her behaviour and this you can control her behaviour you cannot

if you accept her premise that this is a war others will play along and enjoy the show immensely and youre far more likely to loose some battles along the way

i didnt mean give her grace for her own sake i meant manage yourself because the thoughts you allow to fester will leak out and could  impact the outcome here
just bring a bit of grace to the situation

even if she an awful paranoid little drama llama she had the misfortune to fall in with an abuser who would take advantage of those qualities to keep this even more toxic and dangerous her than they might otherwise be

we dont have to like a person or agree with their choices to recognize they are also being harmed

dont let her off the hook for her actions but keep your own thoughts free of malice
yeah thats the shit you have to not give into the temptation to tell your coworkers dont say anything that would contribute to the narrative besides i am not surprised he has lied about me i really just want nothing to do with him

dont get put on the defensive and dont become part of the story dont give them more to talk about or compare notes over the story in the workplace cannot be about your relationship from 15 years ago the story needs to be sandrine is really weird and running her mouth and op is just shrugging and saying not surprised but not interested
besides documenting what youre hearing and how this impacting you in the workplace there is nothing to do a big reaction from you only validates their private little drama

being disinterested and bored by her behaviour is what others will see its far better for you if you can ride this out until her behaviour is unpleasant for others
nothing you keep doing nothing 

you let sandrine have her space and you speak to your boss if her avoidance is impacting your work 

shes frightened of him of the stories shes told been told its really not about you but entirely about his fictions if anyone asks you that is what you say it was a long time ago but if he is still anything like the man i knew im not surprised he has her frightened he was very manipulative in the past i want nothing to do with him and i am happy for sandrine to maintain whatever boundary she needs as long as we can work together cordially

i know its hard to keep your cool but its your only shield disinterest is your best defence if someone asks you express some slight pity but understanding and reiterate i am not involved i will not get involved i am happy not speaking about him or to him i want no contact with him and sandrine and i can have civil workplace contact and nothing else
sadie may have attentionseeking behaviours but this wasnt an example of one

this was an example of you having some others issues with sadie and looking rather hard for a reason to confront her about her reasonable choice

if you dont like your friends dont be friends if you like your friends stop micromanaging them and accusing them of shit 

if you want to fix this apologize for sticking your nose in shit that is absolutely none of your business without making excuses or trying to justify yourself she may still not want to be your friend anymore i wouldnt want to be friends with you if you were gonna make accusations over changing my top in a car
one of the most common fantasies out there for heterosexual women 

this is just entirely personal reflection but i found that my ravishment and consensual nonconsent fantasies diminished a great deal as i became more comfortable expressing my own sexual desires for me they were a way to not be blamed not to be responsible for what i wanted i felt like i didnt have many healthy ways that i was allowed to say i like sex i am a woman with a higher libido and all the messages i got from most of my life where that i needed to be sort of a passive recipient lots of men and women responded negatively if i took on the role of pursuer or if i was really direct about what i wanted took me a long time and my life to unpack that i still enjoy that sort of play but its a much smaller part of the mix for me now
not a danger flag but certainly a sign of incompatibility and disrespect 

his reaction is far far more weird than keeping a childhood toy
some other things women consent to do when it benefits them

i mean hes super logical and not irrationally emotional like those females so there must be something factual behind his intense feelings right s
it seems likely that your grandfather might have some age related difficulties 

i would recommend that you set a consistent time that you speak to your grandfather pick some thing that would work in your schedule and then stick to it religiously maybe early mornings would be great if hes an early riser

as my great aunt got older i spoke to her for 20 minutes early in the morning on wednesdays and then spoke to her a little bit longer on sunday evenings other than that i screened her calls she was bored and confused often and i felt for her we were both most comfortable with really clear expectations about when i would contact her
youre describing pretty normal dating for most normal people yes it absolutely does suck yes youre going to have a lot more rejection then dates you dont know whats going on in someone elses life and in the sorts of situation you never will

you need to make sure that you filled your life with some other joys as well youre putting way too much into these initial connections it can be a tough roller coaster to ride but you got a level of the emotional floor a bit
i mean this isnt working youre on again off again for a year you know this isnt working 

and shes was right she might also be petty and drama seeking but shes right telling you take a job you wanted to take and move for is quite different than you telling her what she needs in a relationship 

stop having stupid side fights this is over it wasnt working youre leaving have some damn graciousness
if were nitpicking a 27 year old is not a girl

if youre in an ldr with no immediate plans to be movelive together with if is appropriate for any plan that isnt the confirmed 

be honest and direct with her about your intentions clarity is important and scary to say things with certainty in these cases if shes hedging make is clear you mean to take these next steps
the vast majority of photographers are going to have periods in their life of this sort of work if not make their whole career on it naked women sell shit 

if you dont trust his character in a room with a naked professional dont date him

if he cannot address your discomfort without immediately talking about permission and artistic freedom dont date him he should be addressing your fears by talking about professionalism respect boundaries and goals were talking about collaborating with other people this isnt aboutma freedum or ma arts this is about being a good collaborator and creator with purpose

youre not shitty to tell him youre uncomfortable hes handling this totally reasonable conversation in a super immature way
this

i think this is where youre messing up  for me casual still includes a fair bit of friendship not necessarily dating or romantic activities but i definitely want you actually know youre person i want to talk to and spend a few hours with

a drink and a fuck is a hook up maybe ongoing hook ups but a step down from casual in my book the word youre looking for a hook up
yes it matters its gonna matter especially if your life stages diverge 

that doesnt mean it wont work out or that hes doing anything terribly wrong but dont be naive and pretend the gap doesnt exist dont be willfully blind youre not ageless thats a justification and a delusion 

and they always say youre really mature the 40 year olds who rape 12 year old say that the power dynamics fester because they are not immediately obvious to the younger person and the elder person enjoys them being mature for your age is totally different from being a compatible peer with someone who is older 

this is something youre going to have to keep eyes open to for several years in this relationship there is no dodging it its a challenge and a risk that exists here
its been 24 hours the window is closing fast

in my opinion what you really need to do is stop having sex and figure out how to manage your anxiety andor prevent condom breakage 

plan b is a plan b for some women it doesnt have much of an impact for others it is positively miserable thats before we get to the expense while you should be open with her about your anxiety and concerns that is a pretty big ask of her just because something felt off

if this is where youre at mentally you shouldnt be having sex until you have a better shared contraception plan and a personal anxiety management plan there isnt a physical problem here with her body that requires pharmaceutical intervention there is a core problem here with your comfort level with sex and its risks
your parents are going to start drama if they want to its understandable for them to be a bit disappointed put anything past that is a choice

accept this theres no magic collection of words you can say to control that or make them feel a certain way about the situation they are going to feel how they feel and do what they do

tell them youre looking forward to their visit and recommend a hotel if its an issue of money then maybe you want to contribute to the hotel bill

honestly though this shouldve been sorted out when the invitation was made it shouldnt have been held off until a few weeks before they arrive it shouldve been part of the structure of the invitation so all parties knew exactly what they were getting into in the future you need to make this a core part of the planning from the very beginning dont bring it up after the date are set

you may also consider just telling them the truth they havent always been consistently nice to your wife so in order to keep the peace you were making sure that they and your wife and you have space apart from one another during the visit tell them youre not open to reconsidering this at this time because you feel its been working well and you believe the relationship has been improving with these sorts of boundaries in place
you need a sensible lawyers advice on other ways to think about this 

its totally reasonable for her to want to feel she is building equity and is fully invested but a 5050 split is probably not going create the best overall living situation for the both of you 

the other way forward it to start shopping in your price range when my partner and i began i was the lower earned and he was keen on 5050 when he saw the reality of what a place that was 5050 looked like as opposed to a place that was split based on income 6535 he rapidly changed his mind she may also change her mind if confronted with the real limits of her budget as opposed to our budget or you may be the one to change your mind and see other opportunities to invest capital besides your primary home
you werent rude and id have been rude sooner i just say please dont touch me ideally loud enough for others to hear clearly and less in the tone of pretty please and more in the tone of wtf you think youre doing i will break you fingers

nothing good has ever come of letting someone touch me twice 

hints are for people who are being nice randos with their hands on me arent nice and i dont have be nice back we aint in kindergarten anymore you keep your damn hands to yourself

guy once asked me to read moon is a harsh mistress cause it was so formative for him i did when asked what i thought i said the pacing was horrible and i was deeply concerned by the books attitudes towards woman as supporting cast members in mens lives and that stranger in a strange land was a far far better book overall 

dont tell a 20something intellectual that youve read more heinlein than they have and you have some notes
she says in the op she is in therapy and that all the miscarriages were in the last year 

it strains credulity to imagine he was unaware of all of those miscarriages and the therapy appointments but sure suppose its possible
sure how could any other adult human being be expected to imagine that three miscarriages including a secondtrimester one which has op seeking therapy might be impacting her emotional state right now how absurd of us to expect an adult partner to maybe ask her if shes ok tell her its totally understandable if she has a lot of big feels say shit like well be in together no matter what happens or even im proud of you and well get through this instead of telling her shes not being nice enough to him and considerate enough of his feelings

s

for fucks sake men have us so conned i dont think op is handling this perfectly but the idea that hes incapable of better is embarrassing very few men are as stupid and incompetent as they like to pretend to be when not getting what they want

he only noticed this because of his asian fetish

if you watch any busy sidewalk for 10 mins youll see the vast majority of young women yield to men of all ages unless there is a walker or stroller involved most women yield and most men claim their space in public

you can find lots of anecdotal stories out there from women who decided to stop yielding and moving out of the way for others and they all say the same thing women moved to avoid them men knocked into them its a fun experiment if you can put up with some bruising google manslamming

for everyone 100 matches you get maybe 10 conversations for every 100 conversations maybe 10 dates for every 10 first dates maybe one second date 

there doesnt need to be anything wrong with you dating is hard and most people you meet with you wont click with these women are doing you a favor please stop assuming they are being unfair or stupid they arent 

and youre not really all that into these women either youre just bent out of shape because they got to do the rejecting let go of that bullshit and recognize that this is going to take a larger time commitment and more effort if you want to find a serious relationship
there are lots of idiots on reddit who dont think men should have feelings or normal human vulnerabilities or sentimentalities best to just ignore their trolling
id bet youre right she was likely taught this in therapy

standins or proxies like this are a tool therapists will sometimes suggest to help people  and not just children  communicate or signal they are ready to communicate about difficult things

while i wouldnt enjoy it its not necessarily unhealthy i wouldnt be overly concerned about it but you should be able to ask her questions about this tool and how it works for her and express discomfort if you have any

in an ideal world she would have discussed this technique with your prior to implementing it in your relationship but its possible that its so natural and normal to her she didnt realize it would be strange for someone else to be on the receiving end of it for the first time
yeah and i believe arnolds son with maria shriver did choose to work out moredifferently and change his look later on in life there is no bodyshaming here guy on the right just looks like a normal human being and not someone who is necessarily pursuing a career as an action movie star which is what is happening
in the image above the child he had with the housekeeper and hid is the one on the left the data was already wrong and  they held the charts upside down
they didnt arnold had a child with the housekeeper and hid it from the rest of his family for over a decade
and he held the charts upside down
biology and his own ignorance about the impact of miscarriages and grief have isolated him you didnt do it to him hes a full participant in this dynamic and he is not putting in the work to address it

try to open up to him about your fears and stress explain to him that while his optimism and happiness is lovely for him it can be exhausting work for you to both manage your complex feelings and your body and also be made responsible for addressing his feelings in the way he enjoys most

you would benefit from being more open with him but he also needs be a much safer and more empathetic person to be open with your feelings are valid and you will not always have the bandwidth to take care of his too he needs to do better and recognize the actual valid emotional complexity of this situation for you he cannot just steamroll you with me me meing
and it wasnt like at all what happened
but the one who was raised by the mother is the buff one in the left arnold didnt acknowledge him until he was publicly shamed into it when the kid was like 14 

it was the dude on the right who was raised by arnold for fucks sake maria shriver is standing right behind him and also fuck that noise hes not a movie star so he doesnt to do the work to look like one me neither
howd you get ask her how shes feeling from constant texting and asking if im going to leave him

hes a bully being insecure or confused doesnt make you not also a bully
have you talked about it

it doesnt seem completely unreasonable as neither of you appears to have planned sex into the equation 

i think its actually an important stage in a couples relationship when you can spend time together without having sex but given the whole context of this ldr this is a thing you need to talk about and you need to do it before you leave its not fair to either of you to carry this anxiety and not attempt to resolve it and understand one another while youre together
if you want to date paul your friendship with jay is probably over

you dont always get everything you want outta life jays feelings may not be rational but hes entitled to them and hes not obligated to be your friend or pretend to be your friend if he is not able to be at peace with your choices
youre making some bad choices most people are gonna think that after youre caught having sex with a teenager in a public parking lot and its a reasonable thing to think

you may not mean to but at 25 you should be aware that 18yearolds are not responsible partners for you even casually it says a concerning thing about your character and your sense that you didnt know that every 40yearold dating an 18yearold says they are pretty mature as well  thats not a reasonable argument of course they are its not about them its about what it says about you

the fact there are also sexist assumptions about different age gaps when the genders or sexuality is different is also not a reasonable argument for your particular situation youre making poor choices to get involved sexually with an 18 year old your expectations and needs in any sort of relationship even a fwbs one should be pretty damn different from an 18yearolds

while you do not owe anyone any answers to their questions about your sex life those people who know youre fucking at 18 year old are not obligated to like it and are allowed to think poorly of you for it
this man is trash and hes bringing out the absolute worst in you

go make better choices with someone better
there is no magic sequences of words that perfectly control how another person feels

i gave you the script below do that 

id feel most comfortable at this stage in our relationship if we both got sti tests whadday think of that
you ask because you were worried it would sound accusatory

dude
if its something important to you that would make you feel more comfortable and secure with your contraceptive plan and sex life with her yes 

that doesnt mean there is no risk of her reacting poorly  the risk does exist but its a reasonable thing to ask and itd be good to know if shes not a reasonable person about it
they dont happen randomly you do have to be exposed to them the t means transmitted but many people are asymptomatic and dont know they have any of them

your request for an sti test is reasonable it doesnt mean you dont trust her its just a better safe than sorry sort of situation for you both before you continue with barrierfree sex
she would have symptoms if she had an std

this is literally the worst most wrongheaded medical advice you could have possibly offered 

your first example chlamydia can be asymptomatic for years
thats exactly how you do it

id feel most comfortable at this stage in our relationship if we both got sti tests whadday think of that

you dont have perfect control over her reactions but you know your request is reasonable and thats the way to say it
its not too much

but if you want to be clear send him a very very short and very cold message that says something like this contact is unwanted do not send me any more communications in any channel or form if you do the next person who explains to you why this is not acceptable with be a police officer
break up

you are not bringing the security and respect to this relationship that is absolutely necessary for it to be a healthy one for either of you

either speak to a therapist to do the work by yourself because its all your work to make peace with the reality of women as full human beings with inherent value regardless of thier sexual past or break up and find a relationship that doesnt trigger the worst parts of your character in this way

there isnt a lot of great advice here man this is a you problem either you fix it or you dont if you dont wont or cant then you end this relationship and relationship where you fail to respect your partners past
those absolutely can be emotionally abusive things to say especially if he doesnt take accountability for them makes it your job to resolve his violations and continues the behavior 

have you considered this man might have a lot more experience masking his really shitty behaviour than you do seeing through this sort of manipulation

people dont generally date 10 years younger than them because they are looking for a balanced respectful relationship between equals

we forgive people for mistakes we dont forgive people for actively creating and maintaining a relationship where they get to treat us like shit whenever it pleases them to do so
seems like shes been pretty clear and consistent

if you still have feelings then you need to end or really minimize this contact

shes not respecting your boundaries and leaving you confused and hurting that isnt a friendship that is working out for you you can try to be clear again we cannot be friends if you keep joking about having sex with me after ive asked you to stop or you can just take the big step back right now
tell him you are beaking up tell him you dont want any further contact its not a conversation or a discussion there is no closure just tell him what is happening and then do it

block him on everything start recording any violations of the block so you can have the cops or other adults explain the situation if he continues to try to reach you and bully you

refuse delivery on anything he has sent if you cannot dont acknowledge it

a breakup isnt a negotiation and hes not being kind hes being a shitty little bully cut him out entirely and dont feel badly about removing someone from your life who doesnt respect you when you speak
eh its pretty good so far

good luck with it if you can learn try to be kind to yourself and others even when youre disappointed and frustrated youll have a way better and easier time of it too
do you actually want to marry this guy

cause it sounds like youre looking for reasons to label him not good enough after four years together and saying yes you should know who youre marrying and you should know if he knows you and listens to your needs and expectations well enough
you and most people usually keep on trying a bit longer than it makes any sense id say walk away now but you probably arent going too 

so my advice would be to stop when you find yourself resenting her and making unfairunreasonable judgments about her character just because shes not giving you what you want 

the best thing to learn is that its okay to just break up with someone a good person who just isnt good for you dont give into the urge to turn them into a bad bad person in your own head before you give yourself permission to walk away from a pretty good person who is just not a pretty good person for you that will save you a lot of drama and stress in life if you learn to stop and walk before you demonize someone who has done nothing really except disappoint you
it sounds like youre just not feeling secure and compatible

thats not really about texting

its a month in you shouldnt be using words like expectations and accommodating with these heavily negative connotations so early on this just isnt working for you stop trying to turn her into a monster in your own head before youre willing to admit this just isnt working for you
you need to calm the fuck down

not everyone engages with text the same way thats actually not all generational even among the same generation different people have different patterns and priorities

its okay to express what you need and want but youve known her long enough now to suspect that her preferred method of communication is inperson that doesnt make her evil or even disinterested it makes her different the fact you are jumping to the assumption shes lying or gameplaying is a red flag  on you

in the short term ask her if a 2030 minute video call between dates or a phone call would work for her it might help you feel connected your feelings do need to be addressed if this connection is gonna work out  but mostly by you not all by her  and bring them down like 8 notches and recognize that her norms around texting are also totally valid there is nothing not proper about her choice not to stalk you on social media all the time you want to talk about your shooting then talk to her as a person not a follower or audience member stop it with the nasty assumptions about her character because shes not reading your mind and serving your texting preferences
your girlfriend is accurately understanding that 17 is very different from 22 and is kicking herself for an error in judgment she made years ago this is not about the legal age of consent this is about her own standards for herself and her belief she didnt meet them

the best thing you can do is be honest with her about feeling empowered and free to choose in the relationship and accept the fact that just because she feel guilt or thinks she made a mistake doesnt mean the relationship was or is broken now 

stop trying to tell her it wasnt that bad thats not gonna work instead tell her you admire how she has set out to respect you and value you despite the age difference and that you dont want this mistake that you dont necessarily agree was a mistake but can respect she does to damage the great relationship you have now nine years later as equals
the only person who can offer any particular helpful explanations is her and shes not doing that shes said no to speaking to a doctor or therapist who could help her do that you dont get to know right now

of course pregnancy hormones could be impacting her but if she wont speak to a doctor about her emotional state then there is nothing you can do about that

it really sounds like youre looking for ways to make her change back and that isnt going to work you can only address the things shes doing and saying to you and what youre willing to accept in the friendship

stop trying to change her admit it when you cannot support her or accept her negativity telling her that isnt leaving her in the dark place not telling her the truth is abandoning her and will leave her more confused and hurt that her longtime friends dont want to talk to her anymore at least give her the respect of telling her why youre withdrawing from these conversations  cause she already knows youre not happy with her and youre withdrawing from her
i require monogamy sexual exclusivity in a partner

put it to him that plainly we all have fantasies and crushes you cannot do everything or everyone in life you want too

if you do not want an open relationship of any kind say so clearly and firmly if you never want a threesome or never with this particular woman hes been crushing on for ages say so directly

your boyfriend and immature and craves validation its not the sort of guy id want to even have an open relationship with to be honest openness and nonmonogamy requires way more selfawareness consideration and rationality than hes displayed here so far
you dont have to be friends with someone you dont want to be friends with

i agree you need to support your spouse through grief but i think you need to stop assuming you have perfect insight into their marriage if you cant support her in this just admit that and opt out
besides the incident with the xanax the rest of this sounds like she is rather legitimately angry with an inconsiderate husband and boundarybusting inlaws 

you should admit that her concerns and the intensity of her feelings are way beyond what you can help her with as a friends and encourage her to speak to a therapist or counsellor  you cannot give her the support shes looking for 

stop trying to calm her down tell her shes right that sucks and you dont know how to help if shes thinking of divorce and feeling that angry that often she should talk to a mental health professional she needs and deserves that support
youre not equiped to be in a longterm committed relationship

do not have a fling be an adult and break up if youre not interested in the same sort of committed relationship agreement that your gf is
talk to your husband you need to let him in on this struggle youre having

hell probably tell you exactly what im going to tell you if he hasnt already this man is not your friend hes never been your friend that was never his intention hes your hostagetaker he doesnt value your friendship he values the illusion of intimacy including some lowkey sexual intimacy that he is manipulating and obligating you to perform for him

regardless of what your husband says i would tell your friend that your husband has seen his comments about divorce and his compliments and your husband is insisting this is inappropriate and that you need to end the friendship then you can block him you can apologize but say you need to focus on your marriage its not totally untrue and you can ignore any future contact unless you need to call 911 to go make sure hes no dead

men have a very bad habit of respecting other mens property rights over their wives and girlfriend more than they respect those actual women when they speak when a man is treating me poorly i will happily use this misogyny against him to make him stop abusing my kindness
while i agree her behaviour is imperfect there is something to be said for being more aggressive in group settings if the norm in the group includes dominant or fastpaced talkers like your gf

your gf should be willing to moderate her behaviour however shes not solely responsible for your feelings of alienation its also on you to come up with your own strategies for handling that

it might mean turning and starting another oneonone conversation i do this a lot in groups where one person tends to dominate i see if i can start a second quieter conversation with one other person its not a play you can see if someone else will engage with you while the louder person is lecturing the group it also might mean asking other people questions about things your gf does not know details about it might mean introducing a topic of conversation where you have more to say than your gf does

your gf is in the wrong but this is also part of her nature that probably is never going to be completely resolved to your personal preferences and shes not the only one who needs to be a part of the solution here talking to her about the steps youre taking to feel more included in group conversations might even help give her some small things she can do to support you instead of making it all her job to make you feel included

if the problem persists then you might be fundementally incompatible but id address this first as something you need to change your approachtactics on not something she has to gift you
youre willfully ignorant of your own behaviours and feelings and of how those behaviours will be reasonably experienced by others and probably struggle to say simple things like im concerned or im feeling confused about the boundaries with this dude

communication is gonna be rough good luck with it
where in the post did i say it was the third or fourth time ive said this

i didnt say it was i said especially if was this the first time you brought it up think again was it really the first time you expressed negative feelings towards her coworker and this friendship do you really think she wasnt picking up on your feelings toward him earlier than this possible not likely

asking how close she is with someone isnt an insult at all

dude this shit just doesnt work you cannot be willfully ignorant of the subtext and think its gonna work out well 

give yourself a smack up the head and be honest about your own shit she reasonably felt attacked because you did attack her behaviours instead of owning and acknowledging your own feelings of discomfort or concerns feelings which were valid and you could have expressed without the but im just asking questions bullshit games

it was an accusation not a question you knew it she knew it what you meant to say was im uncomfortable and instead you said im too much of a chicken shit to talk about my valid concerns and feelings so im going to imply youre doing something bad and try to force your to justify and defend yourself instead of having an open conversation about your feelings too

you probably dont mean to be gaslighting but is what youre getting at youre trying to obligate her to pretend youre being nice when you both know youre accusing her of wrongdoing

what you need to do can do and should do is acknowledge youre not comfortable with this friendship that is valid that doesnt mean shes done any monstrously wrong it just means youre not comfortable and that can and should be addressed baseless shady accusations dressed up like their innocent questions  yeah that shit pisses people off
this is already a breakup 

stop prolonging your suffering stick the break up and end all contact
16 male and 19 female subjects

that is not meaningful support for the idea they women can detect facial symmetry in body odour this is not how girls work not on the basis of this study

oddly enough the thing that seems to be brushed right past here is that the strongest correlation in this 25yearold very small study was actually the men smelling the pretty ladies the smell of the women was rated by men as sexier the more attractive their faces these few men could sniff out a pretty face apparently the womens responses to the scent of the men were way more nuanced and less clear
this would also require op actually talking about his actual feelings 

im concernedim feeling insecurei have questions about boundaries and not opening up with thinly veiled insults like so how close are you

you need to trust me to select my own friends isnt a totally fair response to i feel insecure but its a totally valid response to baseless accusations especially if its the third or fourth time youve heard em
you came to her with your concerns and she told you whats up

keeping on coming at her with this over and over again is telling her that you think shes a liar and cannot be trusted to select her own friends or maintain boundaries with them

if thats what you think of her dont date her

if you want to talk about your feelings and have them acknowledged then go ahead and talk about your feelings a conversation about your feelings doesnt open with obvious judgement and accusatory language like how much do you two still talk and just how close are you two it starts with im feeling insecure about the level of contact im seeing can we talk about boundaries with this new friend and make sure were on the same page i need some reassurance if youre feeling vulnerable or concerned or would like different boundaries to be matinained say so talk about that but dont expect her to play conveniently stupid for you when she knows shes being directly insulted and judged not being asked to have a conversation about how youre feeling
spoken like a person who has never once been at risk of being labelled that upright b who just cannot take a joke in the office

there are reasons to let shit slide you dont have to agree with her choices but it can be extremely hard and risky for young women in workplaces to draw those boundaries we cannot afford to go around picking those fights needlessly with the rude men around us because there are real fights that are real risks that might need all our capital to address preferring to laugh it off is a perfectly normal response
16 male and 19 female subjects

haha yeah no 

it really only supports what we already know  women who are ovulating are more sensitive to body odour then women who are not a lot of women could have told you this themselves if youd bothered asking
i think this is far too fast but that doesnt really matter very much

whats the plan for the talk how do you imagine that conversation going with her are you trying to ask her if this is working for her are there things youre worried about for yourself youre not getting in this arrangement
this probably wasnt about your erection

it is exceedingly unlikely she thought about it a tenth as much as you are right now

i know you dont want to believe that because youre feeling wounded and insecure but the worst thing you can do for your longterm happiness is let this anxiety fester youre never going to know for sure but it probably wasnt about that

it was three weeks of a willtheywontthey between two longtime friends and she tapped out that was actually the most likely outcome regardless of what happened with your penis most of those connections fizzle out most of the time one or both people decide nope actually there is a reason were friends and not more

youre never going to know for sure you probably wont believe her if she tells you but the facts are

1 sometimes the body and brain arent in alignment and its rarely as big a deal for women as men assume it is its normal it happens it doesnt matter much the most annoying part about it for most women is that the guy gets really emotionally worked up about it 
2 very often the person we have romantic feelings for doesnt share them

these two facts rarely have anything to do with one another
you need to learn to say no fullsentence no excuses just no 

your mother can stand outside the door until your siblings let her in its important that you make your mother suffer under their bad behavior as well as she is the one with more power to actually correct it 

you also need to speak to your mother about some transparency into the household finances you are an adult and its not safe or responsible if she is the only one who knows how the lights get kept on what if something happens to her its way past time for her to share the budget and basic details with you if she expects you to keep contributing and living in this home as a 30 year old she might not be deliberately mistreating you but shes also not setting her adult children up for success by keeping them totally ignorant
not your circus not your monkeys

block him everywhere and move on with your life
id just find it so immature that my adult partner was spending so much time pornscrolling on socials its not about trust or control its about wanting to to be dating an adult who doesnt sink hours of their day into mindlessly thirsting

by all means enjoy consensually and ethically created porn but obsessively using ig that way is just so what a 12yearold in 2013 would do yuck
hah my ex was the same way 

he ended it but clearly believed hed be able to bully me and watch me suffer because he made 23x more than me told me to my face that i had stalled his life and couldnt afford to live without him we were both a bit shocked to discover that i had significantly more money in savings his refusal to be transparent about finances was a huge part of the breakdown he liked to be the man who decided and who paid for everything and then hold it over my head that i wasnt contributing to the plans hed made alone 

immediately he decided i must have taken advantage of him  after years of refusing to talk about money with me as if i was an adult and a partner  instead of recognizing he had terrible habits he was hiding from me and i didnt benefit from in the least
then im not sure why you asked if hes a potential rapist kinda six of one half a dozen of the other at that point isnt it not a question of is he violent just which kind of violence to classify it as in court
yes you just had a man tell you hes a violent criminal in search of an excuse

if he hasnt actually behaved like a violent criminal yet its only because he doesnt feel hes found a good enough excuse but hes definitely on the look out for one
i made a similar choice my ex made it clear he didnt want an agreement he wanted to fight over every penny in court and there just werent enough pennys involved to bother extending his presence in my life even that much oddly the person who was most angry with my choice was my own father hes not a woke guy by any means but my dad was the one who felt most strongly that my ex has stolen my labour and dodged his responsibilities after 10 years together 

everyone says women go for every penny but i never met the woman who went to the mat for anything except the children in her care and even then i know a few who said it wasnt worth the drama
its absolutely a thing people believe 

it doesnt matter how often you point out to them that divorce almost always leaves a woman less financially secure than marriage does especially if they have children

the vast majority of women who choose divorce are choosing to be seriously poorer than they were before some of them know damn well theyre choosing poverty 

far too many men just cannot accept that poverty is better than living with them or but raising children is extremely expensive and yes it actually is still your job even when the mom stops fucking you if you dont like that take it up with capitalism not the custodial parent
the simple argument is that the cats are going  thats the plan any disruption to their patterns right now just means its more likely the cats wont be successfully trapped relocated shes not getting rid of the cats by messing with the current situation  shes making it more likely theyll stick around after youre gone  

but she wont listen to reason 

more realistically you should just speak to your landlord and neighbours about someone else taking on the feeding you have other more pressing responsibilities to your own safety at the moment and eliza is far less likely to target the cats if they arent seen as yours 

if have a neighbour network and resources of support for these cats use it dont be a lonely saint let the village do what a village does and focus on what you need to do to get yourself a safe living environment
let him know that youre not interested in datingseeing anyone else youre enjoying this connection and focused on it 

it is going to be a bit early for some people but you should always ask for what you need in any sort of relationship at any stage 

and its never too early to be honest about what choices youre making for yourself and to ask them what they thnk about that
hes told you who he is

youve told him you wont live with that person

you are stuck until you decide your own future is more important than coasting and being comfortable with him right now a guy you cant ever live with
if calling you slurs and keeping you feeling insecure in the relationship is a vital freedom he requires to express his true character then hes not the funny guy 

hes the guy who has learned how to mask his malice and contempt behind humour
the one that is always stayed with me is from a long time ago i was about 19 i was riding public transit and there was a man who wouldnt stop talking to me and was trying to physically box me in i had moved seats twice and i was at the stage i was just trying to ignore him and was too scared hed follow me if i got off the bus which would be even worse than being on the bus where at least there were witnesses even if they were pretending not to notice 

i was seriously starting to panic when these two much much older ladies started shouting at me annie is that you come here and sit with us annie and demanded i take the seat between them they spent the next two or three stops winking at me and talking so loudly between the two of them about annie and how lovely it was to run into annie and how annie absolutely had to get off at their stop and have a cup of tea with them so i did and he slunk off and didnt follow us
i think you have the right idea to focus on life stages thats the big gap between them and it wont disappear for nearly a decade 

you may also do what my mother did and remind  her its the fact she wonderful and mature that will make her an object of interest to men older than her including those are using her positive characteristics to mask their negative ones my mother was addressing a much larger and more obviously predatory age gap when she said that but it always stuck with me that she explained id be selected by this sort of older men because i was defensibly mature presenting not because i was naive because i was smart and wonderful not because i was a pushover because i was inexperienced not i was dumb
in broad terms yes we could get more specific but youve basically got it

we cannot always control what were attracted  too but we can control and challenge the false stories and stereotypes we believe about the kinds of individuals we find sexually appealing

to get along with people you must remember theres a difference between a story or a fantasy or role that we might enjoy sexually and an actual unique individual person who may have a feature or characteristic we associate with that story in our heads

dating involves a lot of rejection it just does but if you cant deal with the individual person in front of you and separate them from the sexual object fantasy in your head about petite women youre gonna get rejected a lot more
yes basically honestly thats pretty impressive youve understood what people are telling you 

and its not a terrible problem a lot of us have stories about what we see attracted too that are flawed or fetishizing to some degree but it is an error and its not going to be fair to every individual woman and since you only date individual women you need to be aware of your biases and your stories and your illogical beliefs about women  and keep them under control  when you speak to individual women otherwise many of them wont like you or trust you

if people feel that youre forcing them into a particular sexual role or dynamic just because you like their kind of body and associate it with your fetishizing a lot of people wont like that

a preference for blond hair is different from preferring blonde hair because you thinks blondes are more carefree and fun the first is fine the second is a false story many blonde women will not enjoy having forced on them
nope you got that backwards and its gonna get you into trouble youre fetishizing small women because youre attracted to a story about weakness and softness they arent inherently more feminine and therefor you are attracted to them you are attracted to them so you call them feminine

a little more self awareness will help you with actual woman and not just chasing a fantasy fulfilment none of the women i know who youd call feminine would want anything to do with you if you cannot tell the difference between the story in your head about pretty little princess and the real full human being they actually are even when they wear pretty dresses
id worry a bit less about being polite and focus a bit more on being clear being clear doesnt mean being mean the clear honest communication is that you reasonably believe she gave it to your brother because she decided she didnt like your choice  and is now purposefully lying to you about that which only deepens the violation and hurt dont ask her to do anything just say i know you did x i reasonably believe you did y and are lying about it now i am hurt and angry

you dont have to not be angry or bitter this is a legitimate thing to be pissed about it does feel like crap nothing is going to make this better even getting the oil back from your brother is probably gonna feel like a rather empty victory

you probably shouldnt go back to the good relationship that you felt you had right after you got back that was temporary and not fully true hell the fact it was good for a while may be why she felt she could get away with this violation relationships arent static but you should try to stop telling yourself the kind of stories that are going to make you angry for longer the fact you have some awesome travel stories is more valuable in the long term than the oil dont let your mother take even more away from you than the oil or poison other parts of your life and memories
you offered to do this if you were anxious about the exchange you need to at least express that to him hes not wrong or evil to accept your offer of a favour at face value 

if you leave your partner thinking youre happy enough to do something for them your partner might just assume youre happy enough to do it 

if youre upset by a pattern of being inconsiderate or taking your assistance for granted then that is a thing to discuss with him but as youve written it here this is a bad example of anything besides him definitely not being a mindreader
you cannot fix this for other people

you can tell them kindly but firmly that youre drawing a boundary on these emails in your life and that includes even their responses to them you cannot let this harm in

if they continue to respond to these chains youre going to need to block them too and theyll need to reach out via text message or phone call if they want to contact you

tell them you absolutely respect their choice to engage and fight but this isnt the context in which you are willing to engage with your uncle or his ideas encourage them to take similar steps to protect themselves from harm if and when they deem it necessary

direct conflict with this sort of person rarely works be empathetic with your family who is hurting but be clear about your own boundaries on these behaviours if you want these email chains out of your life get them out of your life
technically possible but extremely almost absurdly unlikely like baby grand piano falling out of a passing plane overhead and crushing your mailbox unlikely all those things technically exist and so could possibly happen but almost certainly will not dont lose sleep this time

please use another method if you dont want to be pregnant this is how you get pregnant
its good that youve been able to improve your relationship with your mother but perhaps its time to also manage your expectations and your responses instead of trying to change her choices

by all means tell her how her actions have impacted your and your relationship but expecting her to get the oil back is just a further escalation that is a unlikely to happen anyways and a bit unfair to the poor sod she dragged into this and b doesnt actually solve the problem

tell her how the behaviour impacted you let her figure out what shes going to do about that likely nothing and allow this experience to inform your choices and boundaries in the future with her perhaps store the rest of the oil in your own space
two things

the first is that this is just called compatibility compatibility is difficult and rare its good that you are able to see the difference between valuing someone as a friend and wanting to pressure a romanticsexual connection thats a great thing a lot of people dont have figured out 

the second is to reconsider how much you engage with or centre your fetish in your life a lot of smaller women will not appreciate being fetishized like this in fact your attitudes towards them will make you incompatible with a fair number of them if youve ended up with a bit of a mental deathgrip syndrome where you are only sexually interested in one very particular kind of dynamic or body type then you probably want to try to expand your taste and stop hyperfocusing you have trained your body and mind to only respond to one thing as sexy and thats not necessarily gonna lead you to the most happiness
youre 32 youve been sharing a home with this other adult for years you should absolutely expect your husbands support but not his blind service to personal boundaries that you will not even speak up about yourself

it is hard i understand that but youre demanding work from your husband when you wont do your share you also owe it to your husband to also put the work in its not fair to make this emotional and interpersonal labour all his job to perform you make you both look foolish when youre not able to simply say bil this shoulder patting just doesnt work for me please dont do it flinching or shrugging is not sufficient communication
have you expressed this to your brotherinlaw

while i agree your husband should support you he shouldnt have to speak for you 

youre not mute youre not a confused child or any other sort of incompetence with this

you should be able to say bil please dont do that i dont like it it doesnt make me feel the affection youre trying to express it just makes me uncomfortable

then your husband should support you its shouldnt be all his job to express your boundaries to someone else anyone else
they probably believed they were okay with it too they might still believe that they probably arent trying to lie to you but you have to make your choices based on whether or not what they do works for you as a partner not just what they believe  good luck
professionals are just people even a pro quarterback making millions a year makes a few truly bad plays you can always be a bit skeptical of a single professionals opinion especially when its on someone who isnt even in the room
you are poly and asexual your partner is not really okay with either of those things

leaving aside the other behaviours  which all sound more immature to me than malicious  youre just fundamentally incompatible leaving the relationship would be wise
based on what youve said here exceedingly unrealistic

if your partner has behaviours or patterns that are making you uncomfortable discuss those with her 

and im concerned your therapist didnt correct their massive error prior to the end of the session seriously they set you off down a totally unproductive and even damaging path if i were you that is the relationship id be rethinking
of course you told your therapist more than this

but either your therapist is monstrously irresponsible or they were just a bit careless and didnt realize you were going to take way way more away from their comments than was halfway reasonable to do

its reasonable to recognize that her pattern of withdrawing or going into negative moods for a few days might be who she is  and not just a trauma response to her past relationship it is not at all reasonable for either of you to be trying to diagnose her as a narcissist that is calling someone an irredeemable abuser and liar the fact you had no concerns prior to the conversation with your therapist and then jumped to labelling them with npd is absurdly paranoid and suggests to me you might struggle with anxiety its worth remembering even a healthy person can sometimes display some narcissistic traits but that is entirely different from having npd or being a narcissist anyone who saw me drunk at my 30th birthday party could have observed a solid few narcissistic traits

to date is to risk being lied to either take the risk with open eyes or dont but dont fool yourself into thinking there is any perfect way to avoid manipulation in life there is not perfect system life is risk
yeah do that take him seriously and make him explain what is funny about calling you an evil predatory person who wants to hurt sick people
no sarcasm no bullshit take him dead seriously

ouch thats hurtful  
  
im just joking  
  
its funny to call me an evil person who wants to hurt others  
  
no its not  
  
great then quit it

if hes your friend hell take note if he wants to be a jealous jerk more than he values your friendship well youll find out
your therapist sounds deeply irresponsible

dont date someone you feel this insecure about dont date someone if you do not trust them do not date someone if you are not comfortable with how they handle their past experiences or conflict with you

dont see a therapist who diagnoses someone who isnt even in the room based on the story you tell in a single session

dont you go diagnosing someone via google

no one knows if this woman is mentally ill or a narcissist based on what youve shared here if youre giving your gf leeway on behaviours you would rather not accept in a partner address that or end the relationship doesnt suit you
you need to block her that is what no contact really means

she is going to keep on circling back either out of boredom curiosity or a desire for attentionvalidation

it is sad her cousin is in trouble but youre not her support network thats not a thing you can address youre an ex an ex who requested no contact youre not friends

stop letting this person pick at your wounds for their own sake
i can see youre really trying to come at this from a good and kind place but i think a bit of a reality check

this is not just grief this is also a bad manager

youre describing some very toxic management behaviours that were almost certainly present prior you were just in the first few months of a honeymoon period of a new gig and you hadnt seen your bosss weaknesses yet all bosses have some youre describing some particularly bad ones open contemptlack of respect focused on blaming not solutions isolating employees to retrain control emotionally manipulative

and this is your managers fault and your managers managers fault if they need to take leave because they cannot perform and treating people with respect and managing communication with the team are performance issues for a manager then they need to actually take leave and the daytoday responsibilities need to be addressed by someone else

there is not much you can do but recognize this this behaviour is not okay it may have escalated recently due to grief but it is probably not brand new if your company is at all healthy then your managers manager is aware of the performance issues doesnt mean theyll do anything about it but they likely know 

stop trying to figure out how to address your bosss feelings and start focusing on how to navigate your workplace and responsibilities from the perspective that you have a really shitty boss right now maybe they werent always shitty but id bet they always had these weaknesses and maybe they wont always be this way but right now they are your boss and they are really really bad at it the strategies you need to learn are how to work for a bad boss
ditch him

i dont fuck men who tell me they are skeptical about my gender identity or sexuality i used to try to be chill with the whole youre probably a lesbian really or i cannot believe youre really bi but no fuck that noise you can believe me when i speak if you dont we dont fuck
oh maybe this is just a reading comprehension issue and not a legal theory one
apparently not im not a lawyer either but i imagine any actual legal training might even get in the way of said knowledge
youre a lawyer

its shitty to have sex in your own living room while your roommate is also passed out in said living room but its not banging on a swing set behind the grade school

itd be funny to hear the talking to op would get if they actually called 911 because they woke up a few feet from their roommate hooking up
she shouldnt be including people in her kink without their consent and if you want a no sex in common area rule then just speak up and say so its a totally reasonable rule ive always explicitly had it with all my roommates no sex in shared areas like living roomsbathrooms 

if she wont agree to that reasonable rule then youre going to need to move

but realize the rule is not really all that enforceable rule if your style as roommate includes getting so drunk that you regularly pass out in common areas she is still in the wrong but i think you should bring your anger down several notches tell her what you need to be comfortable in the shared area of the home and for the sake of the friendship file this under a misunderstanding of one another boundaries
leaving your wife of 17 years with two kids involved probably gonna require a conversation
i cant confront her about it because it would reveal that i checked her phone which would be a huge breach of trust that could ruin our relationship

op said he risked his marriage he should know

piling on her is some self righteous fun times for internet randos but shes not here op is op needs to talk to his damn wife
if youre ready to walk away from this relationship then walk

trying to force his parents not to invite her to easter was foolish at the very least trying to change his mothers traditions for who she includes at family dinners was out of line and plainly stupid of you you picked a very specific fight  with his mother through him  which you were not going to win if you were serious about not attending with her then the actual boundary was just to let him know to send you regrets to his mothers and that youd be spending the holiday with your own family not to try to change the invite list thats not a boundary thats just being bratty and pushy with your bf of three months family that so was not a smart move 

but besides that your bf has been clear about his priorities and the boundaries he wants with her and they dont meet your needs stop fighting a war youve already lost and in the future dont try to pick fights with mothers over the guests they frequently invite into their own homes
a half a year of a break is just a breakup a chickenshit slowmoving break up 

he may not have been trying to fuck with your brain but he certainly didnt give a rats ass if he did at some point there is not much difference between this level of childish stupidity and selfishness and malice 

block him everywhere hes trash and youre good to be rid of him
dude youre almost 30 so yeah wise up love is not enough

for a single parent you also need to be compatible with the child and the family life the parent wants for the child your anxiety with the child and with her coparent after nine months of dating was a pretty reasonable dealbreaker for her to have it doesnt matter if the kid loves you the sorts of thoughts you were describing having about the child and the ex were toxic af

youre not compatible

you should probably avoid dating single parents its okay to not be good at it but its important to know that about yourself

this was my thought and i felt a bit bad about it this woman is gorgeous and has beautiful breasts they would probably change drastically if she tried to loose enough weight for a flat tummy look 

when i have less of a pouch i also have far less tits i like my stomach the most at about 135 lbs but i love my tits at 160 lbs
this would be a reaching a dealbreaker for me

my ex did this too compared me to toxic and abusive women he knew or had heard of when i expressed totally reasonable boundaries or feelings i sat quietly trying to talk to him about money while he compared me to a woman who had stabbed her husband talked to him about how he had insulted and undermined me in front of others and he compared me to a woman who had driven her husbands car into a tree to punish him 

i honestly didnt realize until that relationship was over how totally absurd this behavior was it was emotionally abusive and a silencing tactic basically anything i thought or felt that was inconvenient for him was crazy or toxic there was no way for me to say anything he didnt like without being treated like a potentially violent lunatic the issue wasnt how i said it the issue was he never ever want to have to listen to it
realistically if youve checked out of the relationship then youre almost certainly going to end up leaving and taking goober thats just the most likely outcome of what youve described here no matter how much you say you cannot do that

you do all the animal caretaking this relationship is going to end and youre going to end up taking the dog because youre the one whose life accommodates the dogs daily needs that is almost certainly what is going to happen the faster you and your bf admit to yourselves the better off all three of you will be

if you want to be sneaky about it start paying for all the vet care and dog food having the receipts will be a good idea if your bf tries to challenge the reality of this situation when you inevitably break up
some people are really bad at making choices or expressing those choices clearly to others for lots of reasons

most people are not consciously stringing anyone along they just dont know what they dont know they tell you the best truth theyve got at the time its on you to walk away if a relationship of any kind its not meeting your needs

this isnt about women or even really all that much about dating you can have totally similar communication issues and indecision dynamics with coworkers friends or family members

this is an advice sub so the advice is dating is hard most connections will not go anywhere women are human dont become bitter and resentful about women just because youre inclined to date human women
i cant imagine i would either but nothing about any of this gets addressed here until op talks to his damn wife
youve been advised to speak to your wife

youve been advised to stop this risky pinning for other womens attention and validation

youve been advised to increase your therapy sessions

take this over to rventing if you just need to type out your troubles over and over again youve been given all the sensible advice a person can get there is no magical answer that the internet is withholding from you the answer you dont like is the only answer
there is no way forward without revealing you checked her phone admitting wrongdoing aand asking her the questions that frighten you and dealing with the consequences you know it could be just friendly i use it with my sisters because we blow kisses all the time you also know it probably isnt just friendly and that at very least its a behaviour youre uncomfortable with 

sorry but im not buying your minimization here you know this snopping risks your marriage you have done this before and you will do it again this was not a onceoff youre checking up on her by violating her privacy thats the marriage youre in right now this is the marriage youre going to be in until you make different choices

play stupid  games win stupid  prizes

your current plan is gradeschoollevel shadethrowing youre a 40yearold guy with two kids do better talk to your wife
wildly

the cdc puts it at like 4363 for womenmen so 44x more whod have thought the cdc would be fooled
him and several other people not just the two of them 

pretty standard practice for young academics at conferences i snuck six of in once because money is tight and conferences are vital
exactly this

lob this grenade back into their home and tell them to sort their own shit and leave you out of it youre not the other woman in their shitty little drama
shes not the villain but she is treating op like shit because she cannot stand up for herself that is manipulative and childish 

she probably should feel insecure but that doesnt make it ops job to protect her from the reality of the man shes planning to marry
i wouldnt do it quite like this if op further enmeshes themselves and opens up the risk of debatenegotiation with a timeline threat if op is going to show mark the letter better to just do the thing rip the bandaid right off 

if op has an email for them both cc them both on the same email thank her for her message and say you absolutely understand her feelings and agree with her you absolutely will respect her wishes and not attend the wedding however you also will not lie to mark about the reason you are declining the invite 

and ask them to kindly not involve you further in any disagreement
where did they fuck

he kissed her once and op ended contact for months because it wasnt what she wanted at all

ill agree op isnt blameless but at this point shes just an inflatable bat these two morons are hitting each other with she didnt cause that mark and his fiance are telling this little drama tale and cast her in this bullshit role
it doesnt matter how wellwritten it is

what happened here is that this woman put op in an impossible position where no matter what op does she has to be the bad guy either she lies to a friend or she shows up when she knows shes uninvited all because this engaged woman cannot speak transparently and honestly with her fiance its manipulative bullshit being earnest about your manipulation and dishonesty doesnt change the core of the behaviour

if it were me id be livid with both of these people for putting me in this situation and send a photo of the letter to them both tell them of course i will not attend and to sort their shit out without involving me further

this friendship with mark is probably over because they are both a shitshow you should be opting out of anyways
you dont go you tell him youre absolutely 100 not going to go you understand her reasons and you agree with her that its best you dont attend 

and you show him the letter

its not okay for her to keep these secrets or burden you with them your loyalty is not to her its to him dont go to the wedding regardless tell him as much because of course you shouldnt go if the bride doesnt want you there but also dont let her turn you into her own dirty little secret thats not what you are you are his friend so you show him the letter

shes not protecting mark shes protecting herself she figured out a power to move to absolve herself and make you the bad guy no matter what you choose so choose friendship give him the truth wish him well stay the hell away from his wedding
i get missing that but really that should be resolvable by ya know i miss that every once and a while you damn better get outta bed and come down the hall for fun times

again i get being nervous about how this might change your patterns and dynamic but put your big girl pants on this is part of what getting older together looks like sort your shit out and stop talking about divorcing your husband because you might not be able to share a bed every night you must realize that is not the place to start this problem solving effort
you really cannot wrap your brain around having spontaneous sex but not in the hour right before you two go to bed

its not really that spontaneous if its only happening in the bedroom during the eveningnight is it thats sure not what spontaneous sex means to me 

youre 44 i get being nervous about this change but give your head a damn shake this is should be a fun problem to solve
youre not crazy

by all means wish the best for him

but also stop talking to him

take the win enjoy that final pleasant conversation and dont leave the door open to anymore more bullshit because as much as you may wish better for him its pretty damn unlikely hes any better yet if you let him back in even just a catchup occasionally odd are its not gonna keep on feeling that good

show kindness to yourself let go of the anger and of all contact youve gotten everything you need from this person already
experience of life matters

which is why he knows to keep his distance from any woman who has any
youre kidding yourself

like i understand why i know why youre going to keep trying to negotiate this but you are kidding yourself he is not ignorant he is skilled he may not be selfaware about it but he is skilled

he has a set of interpersonal tactics that work for him he has found that you are respective to these tactics when others would have reasonably cut off contact by now 

in every one of your responses you are describing a person with tactics to make you feel obligated to him and to be constantly extending the benefit of the doubt to him he violates your boundaries and then blames you for hurting his feelings because you didnt appreciate having your boundaries violated

he may not be fully conscious about what he is doing but he is fully aware of what works to make young women feel pressured to keep being nice to him when he is not being nice at all
you need to crush this guy for your own sake and his 

he absolutely sees the gift as niceness coins that can he can use to make you feel obligated to give him what he wants or tolerate his other poor behaviours 

stop assuming he doesnt know what hes doing he knows exactly what hes doing
youre dating someone who lies to you and is comfortable being with someone who is cheating on their wife 

your skill is not the problem here blow jobs are not the problem here this is not a religious hangup your gf is dishonest
how many times have you asked about this situation now im sure ive see it six or seen times so is it a dozen twenty times now

this is really not a healthy use of rrelationships at this point

youre not comfortable with this fwb arrangement if you were comfortable with it you wouldnt be posting repeatedly online looking for some sort of magical insight that is just not coming stop doing something youre not comfortable with or secure in if its fueling these sorts of questions and anxiety just stop

take your larger questions about life and relationships to a therapist and maybe stick to a vibrator for a while until youve got a better sense of your own desires and boundaries when it comes to others
lets be fair a silent bang maid he can verbally abuse without feedback or consequence
micah struck me from the get go as a situational mean girl still nasty as all hell but probably capable of selfcorrection if she made the active choice to break with her toxic friends and end those patterns shes a notverybright follower and people pleaser easily led happy to earn brownie points with the even nastier girls by playing the same game shes got no core not a lot actually going on

my youngest sister was like this as well she was a nasty piece of work with her tribe but she woke up the the dynamic when she was in her mid20s and decided to stop acting like a damn hyena got a few new friends and decided to try being basically decent to other people for a while 

micah is extremely immature for her age and i sure as shit wouldnt want to be her friend but i have some hope for her all the same
she may have thought you were joking your reaction was that ridiculous 

sometimes youre owed a swift kick in the ass dude and not a gentle pat on the head she should never have had to hold your hand through this
this is not a bid for connection 

leave her be
yeah i do think you can cultivate real friendships with men but its particularly tough at your age and its rare overall men are so encouraged to shoot their shot and see every woman in their life as a potential girlfriend if they are just persistent enough some never get past that nonsense assumption about the availability of women to their desiresneeds but some do

trouble is ya just never know which is which until you know
youre being absurd you utterly overreacted to her acting like a decent host

demanding an apology from him because she allowed him to use a room in her apartment to take an important call is the worst kind of toxic machismo bullshit youre basically broadcasting to him that you cannot handle his presence in her life and dragging him into your argument with her by taking that stand not okay your sense of possession of her space and the desire to pick a fight with him over this are huge red flags 

its not our space her space for a damn work call he needed a space apart from the group to take its not like she was giving him a lap dance while it happened or tossing her panties at him he needed a door that closed in most peoples apartments that is only the bedroom

if i was your gf id be frustrated with you too and resentful of your inability to manage your own feeling for a hot second and respect a perfectly reasonable decision if hes her friend then he is a friend she behaved like youd expect someone to for a friend

you were way off base you didnt need to be further heard you needed to get a grip

if youre not okay with her being friends with a past partner say that but if youre going to accept that this person is a friend then she gets to treat him like a friend
right there are a lot of not great options  because the whole thing is just not great  and there are some very bad options stalling until you are vacationing and putting it out there without warning is in my opinion a very bad option
exactly

and the goal here should be to rip it off before you reach peak misery and you snap and do it a totally thoughtless and likely antagonistic way

its never going to be not complicated the goal should just be to make the pain and confusion a little bit more manageable for you both
exactly it is stressful its not gonna be less stressful if you do it while in an unknown place where you have no separate corners to go to take a time out and you still have to figure out where the food is and what time you need to get to the airport it may suck to do on a weeknight but being on a trip is not gonna make this more successful unless shes agreed to use the time that way as well
you realize your behaviour here is weird right

you keep responding with what you dont want but are extremely vague on what you do want in this connection and what you are or are not getting from it you keep coldly reporting his situation and status in a way that sort of sounds like a list of grievances with him but you seem to refuse that framing as well its bizarre

if youre not comfortable with the fwb arrangement with him end it youre not his therapist or his support you dont have to be that to him just because you feel he is in need of it

if you want to date someone else do so your current list of other potentials is beside the point entirely if this fwb isnt working end it even if you dont have other great options at the moment youll live 

or maybe you really just need a vibrator for a while
i just told you im a rando online that is all i am to you thats all any of us are on reddit to you any other qualifications i might have in other aspects of my life do not apply to this exchange
im glad youre talking to your therapist about this and obviously their advice should trump randos online bit i do think that is bat shit crazy

your wife is going to feel entrapped and set up and neither of you will be able to retreat if you need too on the receiving end itll seem like you did all this work just to corner her into a really tough conversation personally i just cannot imagine a worse way to approach this than not to tell someone youre only taking them out of their space and routine so you can tell them youre miserable in the marriage

at least give her some warning that you want to have some serious conversations and reconnections during this trip let her walk into it with some informed consent
i know this is harsh but once a month is a vent session or maybe a way to address a distant issue like parental alienation or largely resolved past trauma this is the marriage youre in every day if youre not going once a week youre not going to see much progress on these sorts of issues 

there is no right moment you have to make a good enough moment before you snap and the moment becomes to urgent to avoid and it probably goes very badly 

and the good enough moment is not while travelling do not spring this on her for the first time while travelling that is an truly awful idea that will only further unbalance you both she will feel set up and she wont be wrong if this is part of your motive with all these plans you are setting her up all your work to create a gift or a meaningful time together will be spoiled if you leverage those possible moments of reconnection to instead trigger what you reasonably realize will be some conflect and youre setting yourself up for disappointment and epic failure with that plan travelling will not be the removal of barriers to this conversation it will be the removal of normalcy and safety and disruption of the patterns that actually allow for calm reconnection and thoughtfulness travelling is not the circumstances to have a difficult risky conversation within 

i cannot say this clearly enough that is a terrible plan please do not do that unless she has consented to some sort of couples retreat where she knows that conversation is a priority for this time do not do that
therapy

you need to speak to your wife and advocate for your own relationship that isnt rocket science but if your own insecurities and fears are further muddying these waters go talk to someone and get a bit more clarity to help you through these tough conversations

looking for validation outside of your marriage is an understandable impulse but you need to quash it and address the issues inside the marriage first and no i dont mean to just keep addressing them through further acts of service for your wife i mean addressing the fact that you are also a person with needs and feelings within the relationship and speaking up about the kind of marriage youd like build together
if you want to apologize apologize just apologize

what you should not do is demand more of her attention and emotional service to hear you out or patch things up if you want to apologize and admit wrongdoing then do just that and nothing else youre not entitled to trying to fix it you dont get to control her story about her own life all you can offer her fairly without her asking for more is a hundred words or so admitting you were wrong and that you understand that you hurt her and that you are sorry

if its more than about 100 words youre doing apologies wrong 

so no bullshit about your growth and maturity or anger issues treatment thats not her job to address or validate just i was wrong i hurt you i am sorry

if you want to try and rebuild a connection id strongly encourage you to speak to a therapist before you take any steps towards that if you want to apologize then just apologize without demands or expectations or excuses
im not able to say much because youre saying a whole lot of nothing what is your actual question youre just spinning yarns over and over again

what is the choice youre trying to make right now
then what the hell are you saying what is this all about what is the question here what are you not getting that you want 

you can date other people if you want to date other people right what are you looking to hear by posting over and over again on reddit
i understand being concerned but he told you unequivocally to back off so you back off
you keep asking about this situation but you never mention what you want or what youre comfortable with

why are you working so hard to comfort this man and get all wound up about his choices why trying to read his mind why talking to her why stay in something that is so messy and hard 

if you dont want to be his fwb just say so 

youre not his therapist its okay to not want to give the kind of emotional support hes looking for but you need to be honest about it stop beating around the bush you dont need advice you need to get your own head on straight and set some boundaries or end a connection that isnt working for you
youre not his therapist and as his exgirlfriend you are very limited in your role as friend as well 

he hasnt changed this about his own situation for a long time its not likely hell change it now its more likely that his comment was an attempt to get you to change back and to frighten you back into the role of supporting him the relationship as it was was working for him 

you cant save him from his own choices or his depression and trying to do so will so will probably just keep you locked in the dynamic 

you need to let it be a break up
absolutely if theyre getting pressure from other people to include children when they dont want to those are the people who are burdening them youre just seeking and clarity on a decision theyve already made as long as when you talk to them youre clear that your first plan is to follow the only information you have directly from them which is not to bring the children then youre golden they can either politely confirm that or they can say that no they really did mean to make an exception and id like to have you all there
in your position id ask my husband to call a couple and tell them that hell be attending and that you will be sending your very best and staying at home with the small children asked if that sounds good with them and if it does problem solved the answer to anyone after that is just we spoke to the bride and groom and we will come to a plan that works well

if a couple says they absolutely want you there and are happy to have the small children there for a little while then you kind of hooped and rejecting the invite outright would be rude 

this isnt fatherinlaws call to make and anyone who wants to show off the grandbabies can do that on their own time not hijacking someone elses wedding
what do the couple want what is their preference 

i dont think youre totally out of line but weddings are the kind of thing sort of thing you do need to suck it up for all this is sorta the point if the couple themselves would like you there as well as your husband and that the children are welcome for a short time yes you should probably put in the work to make that happen

if its your husband and his parents puttering around and making plans behind the couples back then your husband should call a couple and ask them exactly what theyd prefer and clarify the invite
youll probably get better advice from other trans women but your approach seems needlessly dangerous to me 

and im not sure why this is on your mind if youre in a relationship thats been exclusive for two years now whats up with that
he drunk texts you so no 

you might be just looking for platonic friends but a guy who mostly texts you drunk is a shady one not friend material
sounds like the two of you skipped some really important conversations and have been playing it by ear when it comes to money you need to quit that even if you make more than her the mental load of finical planning shouldnt lie entirely with you you two need to sit down and deal with the reality of what you actually have to meet all of your commitments and long term goals
your boyfriend doesnt trust you select your own friends and is passing judgment on you based on feeling someone else had about you when you were like 17

if hes going to behave like that you cannot fix it for him and you probably shouldnt date someone who refuses to believe you when you speak 

expect to be believed and trusted when you say a onesided high school crush wasnt a major event in your life  and you dont appreciate your bf trying to turn it into one now
how old are you 

i only had one true male friend in my 20s and he was also the husband of a close friend 

i think men generally take a longer time to learn how to be just friends what they actually want in a partner as opposed to a good friend and stop seeing every woman they know as a potential its not entirely their fault they get told a lot more stories about winning a woman over with persistence than they do about just really valuing a womans friendship 

i now have a few dear male friends but they really didnt appear until my mid to late 30s
he has clearly got other issues with this friend and his gfs choices that hes masking its hard to give much advice if he wont admit there is way more going on inside his head than some sort of personal rule about vacations
ah lucky you  so its not that
if we accept that the fundamental job of being an adolescentteen is to achieve autonomy from your parents pivot to peers and enhance your own emotional skills and selfregulation and that there is a kind of progress through somewhat standard developmental stages while they do that then interruption just means what it means ya got interrupted at times by calamity or neglect or accidents and thats not you being broken or even mentally ill necessarily thats how human children respond to those situations  they cannot learn certain ageappropriate lessons in that situation so you probably have some catch up to do in some areas that lots of other people progressed through at younger ages 

thatd be my take anyways just from my own experience in therapy 

id also say i think its pretty normal for your first few sessions to feel like everything is broken and youre a hopeless mess and to be exhausted and overwhelmed ive got in and out of therapy a few times in my life and i always have to brace myself for those first few weeks no matter how happy i am with the match of therapist its a slog
by no means trying to minimize your experiences or effortless glowup but did it suddenly get warmer where you live 

i dont get approached all that much but i would say 50 of what i get takes place in the first 2 really sunny weeks where we put the parkas away everyone is just cheerful and looking to connect just a theory
once more dont work yourself up into a snit because other people arent following your script

and dont come to advice sub if all you want is validation for your own interpretation of a personal experience advice is a thing you can take or leave very similar in that way to the feedback you receive when being rejected
dude find some grace 

as another soul blessed earlier than most with a secure attachment style and some selfknowledge get the hell out of your own skull and realize not everyone is fucking with you

mostly they are just figuring their own shit out andor not that into you 

find some of the chill you claim to have and let people be people messy complicated confused people youll have your days too and youll be happier if you assume confusion and disinterest and misunderstanding  not malice dont work yourself up into a snit cause other people arent following your scripts
bisexuals have a harder time dating lesbians than lesbians do this is a pretty well understood phenomenon and a lot of lesbians wont date bisexual woman at all its certainly easier to get a date with a straight man but that is a numbers game more than a reflection on men or women there are just way more single dudes looking to date and who will date a bisexual woman then there are bisexual womanlesbians looking to or open to date bisexual woman even just demographically speaking
its totally bit of mythology that ted bundy seduced his victims the first people he seduced were all the professional white dudes in psychiatry and policing and journalism who though he looked just like one of them 

bundy hunted constantly he broke into homes and killed women while they slept he pretended to be disabled and in need of help they women he killed didnt fall for him or date him or love him he fooled other men and became a celebrity target for some mentally ill women when incarcerated but he didnt seduce women he viewed them as objects to possess and was remorseless seduction was never his game with his victims his charm was reserved for the men who saw themselves in him
exactly i have a few men in my life who are criers and its lovely and connecting im so grateful for them sharing vulnerability is a beautiful thing but the last time i had a guy wail at me about respecting his tears he was trauma dumping and trying to turn the conversation about his bad feelings when i really needed to address his bad actions 

he was shocked and claimed sexism when i said i am glad you feel poorly about your behaviour i think you should im not able to comfort you right now i am legitimately very angry with you and am going to take some distance
this exactly im a bisexual woman and to be the pursuer is to be rejected 19 times out of 20 or better thats the situation even if you are thoughtful and picky about where you put your energy with straight men you get the doublewhammy of those who are just not interested and those who absolutely cannot handle assertive women and its not like they wear labels a lot of guys think they want to be pursued or propositioned or seduced until it actually happens and they either arent in the individual woman or are just deeply uncomfortable with the dynamic

in the end i just had to admit i didnt want to be with a man who couldnt handle me expressing my interest clearly anyway and roll with those punches
straight up my sewing machine takes way more technical skill and knowledge to maintain and repair than my gaming laptop
id like to see this dude even manage to thread an overlocker
sesh whose gonna tell him that the pretty cashier is also only just pretending to give a damn if he had a nice day or not and might even cash out black men and wish them a nice day those lying lawbreakers
and she gets to be annoyed with you and doubtful of you

you can keep repeating yourself if youd like but im gonna stop now
tell yourself whatever story you want about your own motivations your gf is perfectly reasonable to be both annoyed with you and skeptical of you 

you can dig your heels and get your way probably but her feelings are understandable and valid and it doesnt reflect great on you that you cannot be pleasant to her friend and colleague from work over a drink or two  holiday or no
thats not selfish that is you be a competent adult 

date another competent adult
drinks with a local friend is usually a great idea while on holiday 

unless it would take some massive investment of time or money in order to meet up with this friend it sounds like youre being petty and insecure
the real question here is are you comfortable with the friends with benefit role youve accepted with this man which includes this level of emotional labour and intimacy 

friends with benefit arrangements come in lots of shapes and styles we cannot read his mind any better than you can but this questions suggests you have concerns about what youve agreed too with him and what youve being involved in
its totally fair to be hurt it probably would be wise to ask her about it 

asking her does risk more pain but not knowing it likely worse by admitting youre hurt you give her a chance to acknowledge you even if shed have made different choices and at least youll better understand

its not a fight theres nothing to fight about she cant make it not hurt you and you cant change her mind its probably gonna suck just try to understand one another
great then you know that youre not his clinician and you know to stop rehearsing this fight with an imaginary version of him in your own head or working yourself into a snit with your own assumptions and actually express your own totally valid concerns and needs without the harsh judgments of his character and current choices thats the next step good luck
you didnt answer any of my questions leads me to think that no you havent spoken up at all so thats a lot of lecturing directed at a random persons online with a lot of conclusions already drawn about his character and mental health all seemingly without any substantial conversation with him you must see thats rather toxic behaviour on your part to have your mind so made up about him without ever asking or listening to him on the subject

check yourself put on your big girl pants be transparent about your needs and expectations but enter this important conversation with a tad more respect for differences than this youre trying to be partner youre not qualified to be his therapist and its not fair to toss these labels at him the first time youre clearly communicating your unhappy with his choices
have you been this frank with him have you spelled out your expectations around meals and how much time youre willing to spend with his family 

also why are you framing this as a dependancy instead of a choice you say his parents arent demanding of this so your fianc is making a clear choice for himself and not even necessarily an unhealthy one just one you would like to see changed
you dont have to be perfect to deserve basic respect and civility
hes much too old to be treating other people like this dont date a man who cannot spend 20 mins in pleasant conversation with family members you value and be on time for a meal when he is guest
always its been weeks thats not always that a significant amount of the time shes known him 

the forced timeline is doing them both a even bigger disservice than the others accountability cant be rushed like this bliss has totally reasonable feelings and fears that are going to keep cropping up for a while even if she is doing all the work she can to move past them forgiveness is rarely a light switch even when both people genuinely want it to be and forgiveness doesnt mean you magically feel good or the pain is erased and fully healed forgiveness is often given while were still hurting you cant punch someone in the face on tuesday apologize and tell them its in the past at lunch on wednesday while the bruise is still swelling they are going to legitimately say just because i forgive you doesnt mean there isnt still a pain
nothing about this changes my advice and it doesnt reflect the respect you say you have

youve shared your opinion that is what you get the risks are all hers the choice is hers shes made it you respect it or you gfto 

its not about you as a guy its about her interpersonal risk management
there is a fine line between him being upset that he is missing out which is reasonable and him trying to throw shade or punish you for going

the next time he makes a comment that stings say so ouch that hurts it feels like im being punished and thats not fair see if he can be accountable and own his own shit or if he doublesdown on blaming you for his own bad feelings
sure its possible

doesnt mean youre required to find it acceptable doesnt make him any less shitty doesnt mean youre in a secure and healthy relationship 

it doesnt make it better him being that stupid and shallow doesnt mean youre required to get over it

youre making and allowing a lot of excuses for him bottom line for me would be if he actually is that stupid ignorant and careless with other women while also betraying his gf then i wouldnt date him if all your excuses are true you still shouldnt date him thats too dumb to date
your boyfriend has a madonnawhore complex he is not interested in fixing inside himself

if your not his perfect wifey madonna then youre trash 

this is a very distinct issue from not caring for tattoos people can not much like tattoos without comparing women with them to porn stars or saying shame things like wives dont have tattoos

you got the ick because he treated some women as for sex and other women as for wifey and naturally many woman enjoy both and those roles are not defined by tattoos 

dont marry a man who can only see a woman worth on the basis of her body if you do you live with the constant risk of him deciding youre not wifey but trash and nothing you say or do will change his mind also youre likely not to have a very good sex life if he has decided its other kids of woman who are for sex and not you a man who categorizes women that way is not a safe partner
you should respect her comfort level and choice on how to manage this shes the one who had to absorb all risks and consequences for any steps she takes next not you and probably not even him 

so if she says its not worth it then its not worth it to her end of story

she handled it appropriately at the time and kept herself safe that is what matters most 

its bad enough he bullied her this way the whole thing just gets worse if you make it all about your feelings and opinions and try to bully her into a confrontation with him she doesnt want because your ego was bruised that someone did this to your girl

back off she says its handled then its handled
sleep is a vital part of human health and sanity

your fianc needs to moderate his expectations and think of others ways to address any needs he has for intimacy cuddle while you are watching a movie or listening to a podcast or something for a bit before bed kick off the covers and cuddle for a bit in the morning more hugs and touches though out the everyday activities maybe sleeping time is for sleep

hes the one ruining your relationship if he doesnt do that work to moderate himself and respect you 

you cant comprise your sleep itll literally destroy you and eventually your marriage

dont marry him until he addresses this behaviour hes too old not to know better
this is my thing the timeline pressure here is what is totally unreasonable in this case i mean unreasonable timelines are sorta the name of the game but still

it forces them both to rush through the accountability stage straight into the honeymoon while also sorta robbing bliss of that honeymoon mexico time i worry the pressure of the show will leave zack thinking his mistake is just in the past when its totally and very literally still present in the context of the damn show and it will be for a long time even if he and bliss are great together
im not in the us either but okay

36 hours is a range in which you need to manage yourself far better than this she may be disinterested and that is frustrating but one good date isnt a contract for ceaseless attention and communication
youre aware us a holiday weekend and many people will be with family right on top of normal adult obligations 

lots of people do ghost after first dates and it sucks but your expectations for contact are excessive its barely been 12 hours get a grip

you just met this woman her world doesnt revolve around you suggest a second date for sometime next week if thats what you want to see happen your anxiety is going to be your own worse enemy in this case and any other
this isnt a relationship question

forcing strangers and customer service reps to participate in your kink in however a small way is unethical

figure your shit out and keep private cashiers arent be paid enough for whatever nonsense youre up too
if you dont wish to be housewife dont marry this guy

he wants a housewife and he is willing to bully and manipulate in order to get it
ive had one stubborn dark hair on my chin since puberty and another joined in my mid30s 

never heard suggested its any sort of problem or concern mostly just trad barbs with my partner over it and his stray nose hairs
my grandmother sexist as hell in her own right and shamelessly favouring her boys said maybe this man every single time
my youngest sister is 13 years younger than me and let me tell you i really expected the comments to be even worse

some of the stuff i heard from people who assumed she was my child including from adult woman would make you vomit

it was upsetting to the point my mother started to avoid me being left alone in public spaces with my littlest sister
solving a problem responsibly and making healthy choices for yourself is an attractive quality in a grown up 

these are your insecurities thats okay you came by them honestly but dont force them into the mouths of the people who care for you
eh reddit skews young and youll get a lot of responses from teenagers and young 20s somethings who are still all up in their own childhood trauma and teenage resentments this is much more of an adult 3040s sort of relationship management question i think it takes a bit more distance to see something like this more clearly

however valid annes anger or boundaries are she doesnt get to require you to punish beth for her for the rest of beths life that is not a reasonable expectation of you youre entitled to attempt to form your own adult relationship with beth independent of anne and of your parents
my parents have failed both daughters in every possible way

this its this this is the problem and you cannot solve it for the rest of them your parents created all of these monsters and continue to support and feed the beasts they will not be slain by you alone

the only thing you can do is the thing you have done included beth in your own conception of your own family it might now work out but only by doing the work to create a connection there yourself just between you two will you learn what beth is actually capable of and might want in her connections with family members ignore annes bullying remain polite as you can be as you either accept or decline invitations from anne largely you should decline to speak to anne about beth or beth about anne 

you may also consider inviting your parents andor beth to your place at any time you know anne is busy with her inlaws or is away on vacation or the link that is a bit underhanded but it will minimize her fits and when she complains about the distance when you next invite her you can remind her how unhappy she seemed to be when you invited your parents while she was busy

if your niece is small try to maintain contact with her on holidays by sending a card or small gift even if youre not going to attend its good to maintain that holiday connection with a small child in this situation even as you need to balance other obligations and events
end contact

religating the break up is petty and counterproductive youre going to have to live with and learn from your own regret of not breaking up with him sooner when you should have because he was mean 

you cannot control the story he tells himself just stop listening to it by ending all contact with him
if there are laws in your country that preventing you from working without your parents consent then youd probably benefit way more from local advice most users on rrelationships are americans or from other very western societies 

what is it your mother wants you to do in the next few years if she doesnt want you to work do you age out of the law at some point are allowed to work without her permission
the fight about who talks longer is a distraction

the fight you need to have is the one where you tell him his actions do not reflect respect or that he values what you to say he is expressing frustration that he doesnt know what is up with you but he is also sending you silencing messages when you try to communicate

communication doesnt just mean you trying harder to be heard by him or adapting yourself so you can somehow get through to him it must also include him making real effort to listen and understand and yes that does take work work you are naturally putting in when he speaks work he has probably does naturally with nearly everyone else in his life that he values work he also has to put in to listening and understanding you 

youre never going to prove to him something he doesnt want to believe because it doesnt reflect the story and the role hes assigned to you challenege the story head on the story of my partner doesnt have meaingful things to say or if she just said it the way i wanted to hear it id listen 

it may be time to state clearly that the story needs to change and the behavior needs to change or the partnership will have to change in response
that is pretty extreme i always think its fun to tell them toronto is slightly bigger than chicago which both have about the same population as brooklyn and watch them recalculate i never mind people not knowing that relative size stuff but the electricity and igloos things bug me tho
i give your sealioning a solid b

transparent and a bit of a slip admitting that you werent asking in good faith to begin with but still a wellexecuted online rhetorical maneuver that will fool some readers
why on earth would i talk to you after that closing comment seriously use your head thats not how we express honest curiosity or ask for favours

read through the rest of this thread for specific examples of normalized nudity and toplessness or use google i dont service the curiosity of people who speak to me that way it doesnt suggest good faith engagement at all and im not here to address your personal life experience
youd be shocked by the number of americans who have asked me about igloos and sled dogs when tell them im canadian and no only a few of them were joking 

i can see new york state from my house on most days but they act like i live on a different planet
closure is bullshit

closure is what you find and create for yourself when you let go of what no longer serves you or what is unkowable it rarely if ever comes through conversations with others 

this isnt about andrew the person anymore this is about andrew the bad mental habit you break this habit with the same sort of strategies youd use to stop picking your nose or biting your nails use unpleasant interruptions to those thoughts and willpower

recognize this is really about ego and about the story in your head and about the fact that no person with one life to live can follow all paths not about the man

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw

stop acting like its that simple and safe to stand up for yourself in every context

women are not magically born knowing how to deal perfectly with these bullies but we learn quickly there can be consequences to ourselves for telling them off in class or in the workplace like murder murder is an actual risk for a woman if she chooses to tell him off pick the wrong guy and you can be shamed at school or work suffer harassment for years or possibly even get killed

stop expecting women to roll those dice each time someone is rude to her in a way them in a way that hurts the bfs fee fees
its normal

if youre not comfortable dont go over on hot days

do not try to educate them they are not savages or ignorant youre the one here is who isnt progressive and if you are an american its a good moment to learn that what you think is leftist or progressive is the states is still pretty damn rightleaning in most of the rest of the developed world obamas policies were centreright on a global scale rarely left of centre by most other places standards american politics have been dragged so far to the extreme right that what you think is insanely progressive barely scratches the surface in most places

but this doesnt even necessarily exist on a political spectrum for them its simply normal in a lot of places 

youre the one who has been misinformed by a culture that views womens bodies are inherently sexual and prioritizes performative modesty over womens actual comfort
youre 16 youre describing dating youre describing a normal failure rate for dating you go out you mostly dont vibe the vast vast vast majority doesnt get past the talkingfirst date stage thats dating 

youre also describing a rather normal amount of selfcentredness for most teenagers

youve had maybe two years behind you where you were capable of doing anything like actually dating another human being you have like 60 ahead of you relax

youre not a narcissist if you were you wouldnt worry about this and youd easily fool people into thinking you were kind and empathetic to get your way the fact you are aware of this and concerned by it probably means youre not quite as bad as you think you are 

practice active listening and consideration with other people in your life recognize that a huge part of your overtalking is probably your nerves dont get so wound up about dates i like to think of a first date as a predate its a meeting where we both decide if we even want to have an actual date if im really nervous i even think of a few questions i can ask the other person to get them talking about their interests for a bit 

youre honestly doing just fine the worst thing you can do is get all up in your own head about your own perceived terrible flaws at the age of 16 they become selffulfilling prophecies your experiences sound well within the normal and you should have some learning to do everyone does at 16 let the rest of this bs go
this im also a nonamerican who has dated in the us

i may be compatible with a uk or canadian moderate  because in most other places moderate includes some basic social supports and some degree of abortion access  but i wont risk it with an american one american moderates arent moderate at best they just dont give a fuck
come on youre 30 give yourself a swift kick you knew it was relevant

it was emotionally relevant for both of you you kept context from him that a rational person could have assumed hed like to have you left him feeling played him for a fool so as to avoid feeling embarrassed and vulnerable yourself

its easy to say you dont owe anyone the details and thats technically true but if you want to build a serious connection with someone then trust doesnt work on technicalities anymore

you dodged a conversation that you should have as a rational adult realized may have been important to a serious partner maybe you didnt want it to me important mahybe you were worried they would put too much or the wrong kind of importance on it but clearly was important enough to you that you were motivated to avoid it and took the risk away by keeping him in the dark that wasnt considerate of his feelings it wasnt very fair to either of you

if his response hurt you by all means say so

but also recognize your choice to withhold this information however much it was technically your right to do so probably also hurt him thats valid too a reasonable person could have assumed this was information hed rather have than not have as a person who cares for you and want to build a mutually enjoyable and honest romantic and sexual relationship with you
i think all manipulatorsabusers have something they can point to and say see all i do for you which often completely divorced from your actual desires or needs 

for my ex is was picking up the cheque at restaurants regardless of whether or not i have liked to stay in to eat me paying would have been emasculating of course but as the relationship began to end i was magically transformed into the bitch who never paid and i dont have savings because of your expectations
im sorry youre going through this

i know there often isnt much to do except ride it out and not provide any feedback at all to these screams for your attention cause thats all the insults are he knows hes been cut just wants whatever validation he can squeeze out of you by compelling a reaction 

ignore and document all you can at this stage really

do you have some close friends you can talk to about it its helpful to have someone to workshop all those clever responses you can never send i think like how gross it is he wanted to fuck someone with the intellect of a small child
dont date such a lousy mental health counsellor

or at least dont be reliant on someone who is not on time for your ride to work 

communication comes in a lot of forms your bf does need to extend you some trust when you decide not to make an issue of a feeling youre experiencing 

and nonverbal cues are not bad lots of nonverbal communication is positive and helps to maintain connections between people nonverbal communication is harmful when its misinterpreted or when there is too much or too little of it 

what is definitely bad for relationships is defensiveness and blameshifting
after three years together why are you suddenly concerned that someone might harass you

age gaps have risks and struggles less so as you enter your 30s but still its been three years why is this question on your brain and coming out to a bunch of randoms online now
this is probably not a great example of the problematic dynamic you are experiencing with your mother you were joking and she joked reasonably back ya dont get to pick your baby 

you might want to talk to a therapist if you find yourself dissatisfied with your relationship with your mother or frequently seeking validation where there is none to be had and there never really has been
i would have a hard boundary on being spoken to this way as well

i also wouldnt want to stay with someone who snapped at me while i was driving or pressured me to drive more aggressively than i was comfortable with that would also be a super firm boundary for me like i might have pulled the car over if you had done that to me i do not like that i would not tolerate that in a relationship sometimes we run late in life we handle our anxiety about being late better than that you did need to be told to stop that 

he didnt express his frustration well  but neither did you  and he had damn good reason to be frustrated with you by the end of this and then you jerked him around at the end again with the ill walkno i need you

next youd be wise to book an uber

your own boundary was completely valid your own behaviour was not
she is not holding a gun to your head shes crying

let her cry let her pout let everyone else treat her like the damn fool she is and ignore anyone who doesnt have that much sense

shes not forcing you youve just decided you rather be her prisoner and give up what you want on your day than see her sad

pick another dayevent to wear her dress and tell her if she cannot truly behave herself at your damn wedding she can sit at home and you wont wear it at all
it is baffling to me how many of them can simultaneously argue men are violent brainless sex monsters and also inherently more logical and designed for leadership
tell me you think that 26 salad buys you sex without telling me you think that 26 salad buys you sex
you can stop this youre just not

youre clinging to the story of a relationship that didnt even work out when you were 17 years old it when life is the simplest

its easy to romanticize the past and to keep revisiting it in your mind whenever life gets scarry or sad its harder to face the reality of a future that doesnt include the dreams you dreamt at 15
tell him if he really wants to work on this to take his commitmentphobic ass to therapy and do that damn work himself

if he doesnt do at least that you should look into what it will cost to breaktransfer this lease

there is nothing you can do to fix this for him its not about how pretty you look or how nice your nails are frankly its probably a lot about him avoiding the work of being in a relationship and pushing all the work onto you by creating emotional threats in the relationship that you feel you must respond too 

if he doesnt want to break up he needs to go do the work to fix this for himself and for the relationship if he wont be rid of him
this is going to hurt his feelings if the positions were reversed it would hurts yours this just a hurtful reality its no ones fault but it is painful 

its not overstepping to express to him that there are things youd really like to do together walking going to shows that his weight is making more difficult its not overstepping to tell him youd really be happy if he would participate in the weight loss with you 

focus on the activities you want to share dont mention appearance dont mention other people he probably will because that is where the shame hits hardest stay focused on the quality of the time you two can share together
this is grief its okay grieving is exactly what is happening right now

block andy everywhere

the only thing you need to consider in the near future is how youre going to address your parents part in this because this issue actually wasnt ever between you and andy it was between you and your parents and andy and your parents but your parents foisted it onto you they should never had said to talk to you about the value of the honda they should have said the honda was giving to her outright so its not ours anymore she doesnt owe you half of it and that is exactly what you should have said as well when andy asked they gave it us outright its not theirs anymore so its not half yours if you feel mom and dad owe you something or have agreed to help you get a car talk to them

your parents chickened out and left you holding the bag for their choices with their unstable son and you all failed to be totally clear with him because you were fearful of him responding irrationally you can see where that got you all in the end 

show them what was postedtexted to you explain you are currently going no contact with andy and that is nonnegotiable let them do with that information what they will hopefully they will recognize they made mistakes that contributed to andys confusion and angry irrational as it may be dont expect them to stay nocontact with him for long they probably give right in to whatever his demands are you stay out of it
thats unfortuante but again i have been abundantly clear with you

unless my partner told me very clearly that the package needed to be signed for or handed to an actual person for the delivery to be competedly which is functionally the same thing here i would not open that door i would assume the package would be left and we could grab it in a minute 

youve asked a question you clearly dont like my answer and thats fine you probably should try to form the question about your relationship which is the actual issue here

im done repeating myself good luck with it
yes i would not open the door for a package that was going to be set down and left i would wait a few minutes and then stand up and get it i would not open my door to a stranger not even one i may reasonably assume was a delivery person i would not let an unexpected knocking person even know i was home if i could help it 

whats the actual issue here cause its clearly not the package
dude i was super clear unless my partner had very specifically said it need to be signed for if it was just a package id assume it would be set down and wed grab it in a min without me opening the door for unknown person

you got relationship issues communication issues consideration and respect issues ask about those actual issues you asked about opening the door and i answered with plenty of particulars and caveats there is a logic to not answering the door that might or might not apply here
i wouldnt have answered the door in that situation unless my partner had very very specifically told me a package needed to be signed for otherwise id expect theyd set it down and wed grab it in a few mins 

doesnt matter what uniform they are wearing unless i know youre coming and why i dont open the door for you this means i also dont stand up and look through the peep hold alerting you to the fact im home period its not an unreasonable boundary for a person to have in life depending on where they live or have lived in the past most women i know operate in some sort of similar way 

she may have been inconsiderate in this particular situation but in general her behaviour is within the range of normal
there isnt much to do it feels insufficient because you cannot actually control her all you can do is starve her of all attention and dram to the best of your ability

you block her everywhere neither of you ever respond again you keep records of her behaviour in case you need to get the police involved

you can both also consider warning your workplace or boss that you have an ex harassing you personally i think its good to get out in front of this in the workplace and ask people to be cautious giving out your information or location 

you need to trust your friends and network to not support this harassment talk to one or two of your closest friends about the harassment and dont skimp on the word harassment and let them know you are asking all your friends to keep information about your relationship and your wedding private so as not to expose you to further abuse

anyone who doesnt completely agree with that should be uninvited but you dont have to deal with that right away right now you just have to lay down the law absolutely zero reply or contact with your ex from you and your fiance records for the police requests to friends to not share any information that could empower the abuser
you cannot communicate yourself out of someone elses choice

you cry yourself to sleep on the regular because he chooses to behave in ways that are at least inconsiderate if not downright cruel

nothing you do is gonna magically change him youve been clear hes been consistent this tactic works for him hes sticking to it

date the man he has shown you very clearly he intends to continue to be or dont date him at all
tell him the truth you dont want to date him

you dont think youre compataible you have very different approaches to dating and building romantic connections

dating is always a risk if you dont think this guy is a risk worth taking for you personally be honest and upfront about that it might seem mean but really its the kindest thing you can do is be clear and honest

even if you do decide to date your favourite restaurant on your birthday is a lot of pressure to put on yourself go get a damn coffee on a tuesday and keep expectations and pacing managed
keep your distance

if they ask give them a clear no thank you dont make excuses dont be overly grateful or flattered dont compliment them or try to build them back up dont explain why dont say you dont date coworkers unless you are serious about never dating a coworker ever dont try to protect their feelings too much because that will only make you unclear and leave them with confusion or false hope  

be clear to be kind

if they pull vague shit on you like maybe we could be clear that sounds like a bit like a date and i dont want to go on a date

it feels rude it feels mean only because women are trained to be terrified of rejecting men and to never bruise their egos buts not rude or mean its the kindest thing you can do to cut through the awkwardness as quickly as possible
i wouldnt want to stay in a relationship with someone who spoke to me like that

i also wouldnt want to stay in a relationship with someone who was always planning for the worstcase scenario was chronically overthinking or made me feel unsafe 

neither of you comes off smelling like roses here both of you probably have work to do you need to figure out if its work youre gonna do together or not
reality check fathers who ask for custody is court get it almost always they basically have to be drugaddicted and homeless before the court will take away all access and even then some sort of visitation would be likely

custody is unbalanced because men dont seek it  because so many couples default to the idea that the woman has primary or sole custody  and so many men are unwilling to make the adjustments to their lives to have actual physical custody on a regular basis

by your description your husband will have little trouble getting shared custody it will just take time to work through the system

in the meantime you need to regulate your emotions a bit better get some support and spend some time with your family or friends get some space from this ongoing crisis its slowmoving by design and that sucks but thats the reality find some peace on the path

stick with the cbt hes not gone for ever that is a nightmare youre cooking up in your head that is exactly the kind of irrational thinking your cbt should be helping you to manage
masturbation is healthy communication about sex is healthy 

there is no issue here

if youre uncomfortable hearing about it ask him to keep this subject private that is all 

feel however you feel but recognize he is doing nothing wrong and this has nothing to do with you you could be having vaginal intercourse every day of the week and he still might masturbate sometimes its perfectly healthy
i think she is rather strong and secure she is totally right the closure is largely myth and that kwame keeping circling back to micah is completely bullshit 

the trouble with chelsea is that she is putting all her energy into someone who doesnt want what she wants right now thats gonna make anyone look needy and demanding she thinks if they work hard enough they can make it work its not the worst approach but its also not true

not a red flag just a bad choice
nothing about this seems at all unusual

noncreepy men exist

there is nothing to process they had a friendly lunch
it sounds like youre just not compatible and its time to end this connection

youll meet lots of people you vibe with and can have fun dates with but who just dont fit as serious partners 

dont get angry about it just accept it and let go of what doesnt work
it seems unlikely that your parents are truly worse than your boyfriend 

they at least realized you need a job if you ever have a hope of escaping this predator 

call a domestic abuse hotline and ask for help youre in danger you may not want to go home but you cannot stay where you are
i feel like this is saying a lot more about the comparative funding of public transit
ugh that does make it way harder

id still stick with the friendly lies my friend had similar hair to yours and she went crazy for this stuff dads gonna grab some for you to try make sure you really work it in there with your nails and tell me how it goes

but ya really gotta keep your goals small offer everything is an offer you have to not get invested in whether or not she takes you up on them discipline and hygiene are the parents job regardless of whether or not your dad feels comfortable with it big sisters just offer with open hands
fair point op grace is old enough to visit you without the rest of the family can you make that work
go slow pick your battles based on how receptive your think shell be id start here

i think i can help you get your hair looking cleaner would you like that

leave your dad out of it as much as you can dont let your sister know youve been talking about her behind her back if she says yes you pick the products and you sit her back over a sink like they do at the salon

if you can get over that hurtle then you tell a little lie ya know when i was a teen and my body changed i had a hard time with body odour too can i tell ya how i learned to deal with it

sadly none of this should be done unless she says yes if this becomes a discipline issue it will just have to be your dads job your role is only as an advisor and advise requires her being consenting and open youre not the boss of her youre a person with just a bit more information than her who may have some good ideas to offer 

youre a good sister go slow really really slow small steps tackle the easiest stuff first leave things like nails and skin care to end  if every  since those will feel the most like youre trying to change who she is focus on growing up healthy not appearance
play stupid games win stupid prizes

if you pull that stunt expect it to be the beginning of the end youll be in race to be the bottom to see who can be less interested 

look its been 14 dates if you want something other than what you have with this man ask for it talk about timelines and expectations openly right now you both sound be assuming the other person is also dating other people

if you want something other than that its time to say so
if she doesnt say that then she isnt singlaing she wants more frequent contact if she does say that she might simply want more time with her friends after her breakup  many people do

like i said sooner rather than later youre gonna have to take the risk and communicate clearly and it may not go well for you thats life
what do you need i have a few hours on x day no pressure but is there anything i can do for you or would you like to just hang out for a bit im just thinking of you today and sending comforting vibes no worries if you dont respond i know youre busy im just offering anything i can 

it is repetitive memes can be good for breaking up messages of supportaffection 

reiterate that you dont need a response dont get bent outta shape if you dont get one let them off the hook explicitly
if she suggests concretely doing something in the near future would be the most clear sign not a vague we should do this again but a concrete i want to do x with you lets pick a time

no perfect clues obviously at some point youll have to risk rejection but that would be clearest sign she isnt just looking to catch up and then talk again in a few months
okayyou dont like her choices youre just not compatible 

listing your grievances real or imagined isnt going to change my advice
youre not compatible

and your insecurities may make you toxic as all hell if you dont get a grip on them there is a very real risk with this attitude that no one will ever be pure enough for you you seem to be looking for reasons to think less of them and to minimize the connection you have if you have a pattern of losing respect and affection for women because they are relatively normal human beings with full lives and dont commit to you with their hearts before they commit to you with their actual words then you need to reexamine yourself

but that doesnt make you and her compatible youre simply not so stop now
you do nothing more than text occasionally like an actual friend for two weeks

this is in a conversation you will best judge in person see how the catch up goes dont develop an agenda beyond being her friend and being willing to be transparent about your feelings of she appears open that conversation

dont try to jump the queue women are not vending machines we dont just take the next guy in line the moment were single
thats kinda my point

if youre communicating that unclearly in the heat of frustration even while taking the time to type and post to a bunch of random people online who can barely follow your story and understand the real issues in the hopes of giving you advice one might suspect you are also not communicating very clearly with your wife when the feelings are really intense and you actually give a damn about what she thinks

this isnt rventing this is for advice for advice to work we have to be able to understand one another

couples counselling i dont know if this marriage can or should survive but i know if this is how you communicate under stress nothing is gonna get better
youre trickling out information very randomly you said i skipped a chore due to lack of sex but then you totally didnt cause its her chore 90 of the time

these two things arent really related they arent the problem here

if your communication with your wife is half as bad as it is here and you have any hope of continuing this marriage go see a couples counsellor and get some tips and tactics cause shesh  whatever her struggles maybe   youre not painting a picture of yourself as someone who is easy to understand and place confidence in
your replies here are very strange

this might boil down to dont be in a marriage you dont want to be in
if you were actually trying to punish her  if you skipped getting medications she thought you would get without telling her  then you were engaging in abuse outright deliberate act of abuse of your partner 

if you genuinely forgot that is something different

the lack of sex should have nothing nothing at all to with you communicating clearly whether or not you were able to pick up necessary medications on time  these are not related issues
you need mental health support this is above the pay grade for rando advice online

we cannot tell you if youre relationship is abusive based on what youve shared here you may have reasons for concern but you havent expressed those reasons here

what i can tell you is that the story youre telling right now about this event doesnt line up with the reaction and fears youre expressing the two things arent in sync that doesnt mean your reaction isnt normal but it does mean you havent been able to line up your feelings and your words with your reality describing it as cuddling but then checking carefully for bruising just doesnt make rational sense one of those two things is not reflecting reality

take those questions to a pro
was there a reason you set this boundary in the first place has he tried to choke you previously are there are other behaviors he engages in that you think might be abusive as well do you have some past trauma that can help you understand why you reacted the way you did

attempts at choking are absolutely abusive and are the kind of abuse that is likely to escalate

it doesnt appear here that either of you believed there was any intent to choke you it seems that you both understand that a boundary was violated accidentally or do you think someone else happened here besides that

i think youd benefit from getting some mental health support your reaction doesnt quite make sense in the context youve provided here you could use some more support and a place to talk through the full details of what happened and what you thought about it
stick to your no it is sad but your answer was the right one editing services are professional services professionals are trained and they get paid your father is asking your dedicated many hours to someone hes treating as a hobby if he is not willing to pay for those professional services 

and its not your hobby

if it was a profession hed be at least trying to engage and step up to paying a professional editor and it sounds like hes not pleasant for an editor to work with is he 

youre 22 your focus should be on your own path forward not on the potential family income from the book sales tell him you just cant commit the kind of time hes looking for and dont have the skills he needs to elevate his work let him pout it out

rachel renee russell makes very literally millions of dollars a year her daughter minored majored and education and minored in fine arts at the university of michigan she is being compensated for professional services shes not supporting her mothers hobby for shits and giggles and thank yous
yes shes an adult you must tell her 

if shes concerned there has been an error that might be additionally stressful for her tell her what you did so she can plan appropriately

hey i didnt want this to confuse or worry you but i wanted to give you this gift at this difficult time and i added 1000 to your account with your case worker
they know they know why they are unsafe he at least doesnt care being a safe respectful place for you is not something he values explaining will not make him care it will only make you more vulnerable to his bad behaviour dont do that definitely dont do it yet

just tell your mother the hard facts of what is going to happen next you will not be in his company again from here on out you will not speak to him or see him you do not want an apology you want zero contact with him you are cutting him out of your life entirely she is welcome in your life only if she respects that he is not be clear if that includes not talking about him his opinions or any of her issues with him if this means only seeingvisiting her outside of their shared home say so be brutally clear

this should really not be neogiatable hes out neither he nor she is to ask about him being let back in if you ever feel ready to tolerate his presence again in any way you can initiate that conversation if they try to pressure you hang up leave walk away its not a conversation you will consent to be a part of

if your mother cannot respect those terms go extremely low contact until she realizes its that or nothing

you are not a bad person this is clearly a situation where you have to put your own oxygen mask on first you cannot help your mother right now with her relationship
no one is only awful to their female partners 

a person who can betray in that context will betray in others

generally speaking if there is a risk of physical unsafety i think you have a responsibility to either tell the other person or to end all contact with the person who is harming them 

i wouldnt stand by and watch my friend punch his gf i wont stand by and watch him betray her sexually either if you really cannot tell her then the least you can do is draw firm boundaries and let him know he can no longer confide in you how he harming her
well then tell jake that you know my bf ryan lives there and well probably see him in the evenings a few times

assuming you actually want to go with jake
just say no i mean it doesnt sound like you want too anyways  there has been a misunderstanding and it might not be malicious you travel frequently to x to see your boyfriend if you go youll be spending a fair bit of time with your bf if jake is welcome then say that but be clear your bf lives there and would be a priority for any visit you made

its that simple dont try to read jakes mind or defend any feelings youre assuming he has just tell him plainly what the deal is

its always valid for people to invite who they wanna invite and lots of people dont like hanging out with couples but its obviously silly to go to where your bf lives and expect to not include him in at least most activities
it sounds like youre making a bigger deal of this than you need too

it your partner feels they are missing something of great value in your shared sex life its on them to bring that up openly and respectfully stop twisting yourself into knots to provide something hes not even asking for 

you dont find pleasure in it makes sense you dont have a prostate 

if you dont want to do it dont stop assuming its a such a big deal for him when hes not even expressing that
your emotions are interfering and that is a thing you can talk about but it does mean the way youre currently engaging in the friendship isnt working for you youre gonna have to think about what you need to do differently to allow this to be just a friendship and to kill the inappropriate expectations you have of him as just a friend

that probably means contact needs to be reduced for a while and you need to quit the social media stalking behaviors that are upsetting you
hes not your bf youre not in the kind of relationship where its appropriate to ask him to moderate his behavior like that 

think about the boundaries you need to have for yourself do you need to stop following him in ig for a while do you need to admit youre not actually friends because your feelings run too deep for that 

you can end a friendship if it leaves you feeling conflicted and unhappy
doing this without her consent is disgusting no pass on that youre not a child that is knowable that was not okay what if a coworker or friend saw it thought she was cheating on her husband or that you had an open marriage give your head a shake youre not this stupid 

but no the fact that realizing her attractiveness to other people made you more attractive to you is rather shallow but perfectly human basically the entire physiological core behind kinks like hotwifing and cuckolding

what you need to learn how to do is find your eurake moments without acting like a little shit first
i think you need to accept he doesnt want to understand it

the problem isnt with your communication there isnt some perfect way you can phrase this to make him get the message his current comfort is dependent on him not getting the message if he got the message he wouldnt get what he wants so he wont 

he is not confused respect me as an equal and a partner when it comes to money matters and household chore division is not that hard or complicated hes choosing not to listen to you when you say things he doesnt like
100 this is totally me man have reason you lady have feelings me right you wrong 

i hope op can move pass the gaslighting and misplaced empathy to the boundaries and gtfo stage of this
how the hell did you end up living with someone who refuses to communicate with you about money or about division of labour that stonewalling shit is absolutely misogynistic thats not a feels 

thats a reality of a man who thinks the big calls are his to make and yours to live with
you cant make it right

you made a choice that choice had consequences

you can and should apologize and admit wrong going without any excuse then leave him alone hes made his call his call was clear and reasonable

sometimes you just dont get to make it right the wrong stands all you can is be better next time
pets dont come into a home without all the adults in that household being fully onboard 

there is no such thing as a pet that has zero impact on the other person 

if youre not comfortable being the back up caregiver for a snake no snake full stop
i mean its a views and followers economy and apologies are good content why wouldnt they post apologies
oh hes just a chicken shit a gameplaying chicken shit

telling you would have felt awkward and vulnerable so he didnt talking about your past sex life was way more fun 

and thats the best case scenario you know exactly what the worst case is 

reconsider being his friend he wasnt prepared to treat you like one
really cause it seems like hes the one still at the teat here
im sorry but that was extremely conveniently naive of you 

hes fine with his mothers behaviour because it means he doesnt have to be accountable to her or to you financially hes comfortable with the trade off of her behaviour for her cash 

thats not gonna change either live with it or escape it
yeah bf sounds like a little shit who is happy to let mommy and gf fight it out passive aggressively because neither of them are willing to point at him and say you youre being a shit
if parenting is important to you consider now what your options are for doing it alone you may not have any but the women i know who started thinking that way at 30 basically designed their lives around it were well equipped for single motherhood before 40 and are blissfully happy so if parenthood is a goal consider what that goals looks like without a partner 

as for the dating dont sweat it dating it hard in someways its harder when youre older but thats only because you have less time for bullshit and a richer fuller life there are plenty of men who will want you in your 30s plus a good chunk of 22 year old guys too seriously that part is a bit weird
your husband is getting rightly railed for basically wanting you to be lesser than again and to centre himself in the marriage however here are a few slightly valid points that might be buried beneath his ego

the home space become a work space is disruptive and blurs the line between working time and together time you are subsidizing your work with your shared home thats a real thing that is happening and has to be acknowledged openly 

it is more volatile you could start loosing money and quickly and have to be difficult to admit it to yourself its very easy for a personal business to turn into a loosing bet you cannot let go of 

however both of these issues can and should be addressed through open communication and balance not by putting his foot down like a stubborn toddler as if hes actually has control like that 

id recommend marriage counselling the answer right now from you should be along the lines of i hear youre seriously unhappy but i will not be ordered around like a child this conversation will be ongoing and for now i will continue as i am because its providing well for us all and its the best use i see for my time come to counselling with me and we can discuss what the future looks like in a respectful way
honestly not much imo i dont know many people who had kids in their 20s on purpose excepting those who choose lifetime secure careers with powerful unions and good pensions its almost like economic security really helps 

the risks exists for both men and women but for people in their 30s they remain pretty negligible its all just the same shit weve been doing for decades shaming women for making choices that make them feel secure and empowered treating parenting as part hobby part biological obligation or even a punishment instead of a serious and very important bit of work that people who want to sign up for should be empowered and supported
its okay to be hurt and disappointed but confrontation doesnt seem helpful to anyone here least of all yourself

plan a visit to see to them and bring a premade meal or some such choreeasing gift some moms are up and active two months in many are still healing and not on anything like a schedule yet
every single bit of this is a bf problem not a mother problem

 your 32yearold boyfriend has not prioritized or apparently shared his plan with you for paying down his education debt
 your bf has watched as your savings dwindled throughout this relationship without comment or concern it seeems
 your bf has not spoken with you to create a realistic and responsible plan for the future
 your bf accepted money first towards his downpayment then told his mom she couldnt live there

the mother isnt a problem really shes not she might not like you much she may be toxic or abusive in other ways but that isnt the issue here on the loan the issue is your bf is not transparent with you about money and doesnt have an acceptable plan he can articulate to you about his debt

i doubt he really plans to pay it all back to be honest id bet hes just accepted this holding pattern of lowkey abuse until she dies or becomes incapacitated
nah marshall needs to be the fixer and chelsea needs to be the decider but chelsea doesnt really need to be fixed and marshall communicates his own choices for himself so clearly and rationally that hed frustrate her

if they both got their own shit a bit better under control maybe but right this moment no they dont offer the other enough fuel
100 brunette was clearly queen bee and knew it and was running circles round both shelby and micah

micah is a gretchen wieners in constant search of her regina george literally the nicest thing i can say about her
both of her friends were clearly jealous if not of the engagement then of the reality tv gig at least

the thing they have is just standard toxic enmeshment shelby is getting the headlines for her drunken mess but i really felt she was just the meat shield  micayla was the queen bee and she knew exactly what she was up to spinning shit up and giving all those compliments to micah that were not really compliments and all had  at the end of them micayla knew how to bring the drama but keep her hands clean anyone with two brain cells to rub together could crush shelby which is why even paul managed that micayla is the dangerous one 

it almost made me sorry for micah because those dynamics can be hard to escape if you think that is what friendship is supposed to feel like almost until she immediately joined the pack and turned on paul like a hyena
i have never had difficulty enforcing expectations and boundaries on my friends and my partner without suggesting they are competing with one another for my time or attention

creating balance and boundaries doesnt require competition and conflict thats not naive thats just declining to live your life doing battle with needy children in grownup bodies getting rid of partners or friends who have that framing has only gotten easier and easier
no suggest she speak to a doctor now about her intention to try to get pregnant in the next year or two its a bit early for a preconception checkup but there is no reason not to ask for one if you dont have a family doctor its time for her to try seriously to find one let them tell her if her weight is a significant issue because you dont actually know  bmi is not a medically relevant scale and google isnt med school 75 of pregnant women are overweight its not the bestcase scenario but treating it like a crime isnt accurate either 

dont pretend to be an authority ask her to speak to an actual authority on what steps can be taken now or in the coming year to be in the best position possible when youre ready  


stop googling about womens health before you fall down a real rabbit hole of truly inane bullshit

  
the next step in her taking this seriously is speaking to someone who is serious and informed  


youre not out of bounds to want the best odds but youre way out of your area of expertise and that is not where you start you start by encouraging her to get support so she knows her timelines has some goals and is building relationships with her possible care team
the median number of past sexual partners for an american woman age 2549 is 43

and nearly 25 of people age 2529 are virgins youre a minority sure but youre not a myth and ya clearly have some baggage and bias associated with your perceptive status 

if youre only meeting women with a history of gangbangs something youre doing is the problem not women in general

first step watch less porn thats not women thats a reflection of your personal choices not lining up with what you claim to want in a partnership

second step seek therapy for your warped perspective on your own sexuality and the sexuality of others
yeah even more than mental health support i think where lib fails these people is by not providing them with a financial plannerpremarital counselling on legal money matters like just an hour and list of questions sesh
i agree from what we saw i thought tiffany did a totally mature sort of um but youre not racking up debt for this cool shit right vibe check and she and brett had some mostly healthy and mutual sounding joshing about being bougie 

i suspect some of that was also tiffany checking in on her own insecurities about not bringing the same funds into the marriage that brett clearly had if i were tiffany thatd be a concern for me too 

hopefully they had a more serious conversation about money offcamera but if i was dating a guy who dressed like brett did i would 100 want to make sure this was a luxury spend he had under control before i took steps forward with him when i moved in with my current bf he had a very expensive hobby and i absolutely asked him pointed questions about how he balanced that with other spending priorities and that was just moving in and splitting things 5050 not marriage
yeah i didnt really catch the judgment in him either at that moment it was more like chealse was overquick to defend herself when it really wasnt that pink it was a single ladys apartment big shrug 

there are lots of shitty conversations between these two but that one was rather sweet
my bf likes pink more than i do our compromise was deep raspberry pink accent i had to draw a really hard line against hot pink baby pink and pastel
if you truly cannot control yourself go talk to a good therapist who can give you a swift verbal kick the next time you get weak and help you approach new relationships without all the anxiety and trauma this shitty one has left you with

no one else can solve this problem for you youre gonna waste the rest of your 20s on this mans bullshit and have nothing to show for it if you dont wise up im sorry to be so harsh but it really is that simple 

stop performing that same drama with this guy that you two started with when you were like 17 its not getting better its not likely to get better better exists for you someplace else with someone else
youre not friends any longer you dont bring anything positive into one another lives

youre not getting back together you really shouldnt not even after therapy 

the best help you can give both of you is accepting that six years of on and off plus this toxicity and his untreated mental health issues is to finally call it end it for good grow with someone else someone who doesnt need you to play a perfectly calm therapist in order for them to meet the bare minimum standards of communication and be able to cope 

go be less insecure with someone who actually offers you security and someone who can handle the fact that anger happens sometimes in a longterm relationship
break up with him

you cannot stop him he feels entitled to use the images and bodies of women he knows as his own personal porn stars he doesnt care that they are not consenting or that isnt why those images exist or that would reasonably be upset by this behavior or that you are upset by this behaviour he thinks he has the right to do this he thinks he has the right to tell declare that his ex his coworker his buddys sister is a porn star now because he wants her to be

dont sit around waiting to catch him break up with him because he doesnt value consent and that is dangerous and unworthy of trust

fantasizing inside your own brain is entirely different than choosing to curate photos of people you know and wank to them reprosing photos is an action not a just a private thought only shitty little boys who dont care about consent or respect women like to pretend it isnt because the violation of women they know is pat of what they are enjoying if it wasnt theyd happily use all that free porn no problem 

the violation is the point the lack of consent is the point get rid of him
nah that would result in only contestants who had some fundamental relationship skills and were capable of transparency and honesty with those closest to them 

then there wouldnt be a show
seems like his mom just wouldnt sign a waiver
it was just awful i had to fast forward a bit because paul was working so hard to ignore how awful they were without insulting them directly i suspect this is not his first encounter with mean girls but how he didnt realize micah was one i dont know 

queen bee brunette was clearly deeply jealous and tossing shade in each of those compliments to micah  knowing that sloshed blondey would do the dirty work for her  and lord did she i was just shocked that micah immediately defended her friends totally vague something or other complaint about him he was too articulate not self depreciating enough for her tastes i dunno my 3 year old niece better communicates her upsets than that woman did

the nicest thing i can say about kwame right now is that even he doesnt deserve micah
your bf used his sister to take the heat for him when his friends sexualized one of their little sisters

look your bf isnt treating any woman that well if he only treats them well in private and not when they are being exposed to abuse and ridicule 

withdraw your ultimatum dont let your bf think its your job or his sisters job to fight his fights for him dont let him make that the womans job too hes quickly becoming the kind of guy who blames the women for making him not be a creep so he doesnt loose too much face with the asshole men expect him to demand his friends treat others with respect if he really cannot hack that dump him

dont ride this out for long he will use you and your anger as a shield from real consequences for he behaviour he is part of and is condoning and he will let them mock your rage to keep his friendship if hell do it to his own sister hell do it you
all you can do is give good advice

ideally kind and compassionate advice 

objectively the age difference alone and the newness of the relationship are plenty enough to caution against a legal contract but its not clear from your question that either of them are actually rushing into it 

stop calling her a divorcee and a single mother as if these are insults it makes you sound like youre in your 80s screaming at kids to get off your lawn you will quite rightly loose credibility if you dont accept that single parents and divorcees are not damaged goods shes not in a situation shes living a normal perfectly valid and successful life by all reports here 

and her career is the couples business not yours 

if this is a mistake its your sons to make ask him questions be concerned for his happiness give him advice final decisions belong to him   insulting her personally isnt going to change that its okay going to make you appear judgmental and unreliable
you dont need to understand 

youre 40 be the adult here and cut him out hes clearly a toxic child who brings nothing of value to your life how is this even a question 

he played out his milf fantasy and made some money while he did it hopefully you enjoyed youre bizarre barely legal fun times too now he gets to play with you like a toy whenever hes bored no get rid of him block him everywhere seehs
youre not crazy and the hard truth is youre going to need to leave to change this dynamic 

im the eldest daughter of 8 children google eldest daughter syndrome and you will find you are not alone in your frustrations many are subjected to parentification like you have been in many cases like yours the finances of large families make it seem necessary but its still not healthy or kind 

while trying to speak to your mom is good please recognize that real change is going to come from you if your mom saw this problem clearly shed address it but she seems to be trying to foist it off on your dad instead of tackling it as as a team so the odds are against that happening reinvest in trying to find a job summer camp work can be a great place for your elder sister skills to shine with appropriate compensation and long periods away from home start saving obsessively and secretly plot your pathway out of this home inside this home you will always be the eldest daughter only when you leave can you become an individual just a sister and a daughter like you deserve to be
excuse me youre right i need to be inclusive of my insane sisters
women arent a monolith we dont share a hive mind were basically sane individuals like men

if youre looking to start a family you should absolutely move to a lower cost of living area most women who want children will very very rationally balk at 33k in greater london if parenting is a goal you should probably make some changes to make that more feasible and as quickly as you can 

thats not about providing a lifestyle thats about being a compatible partner your heart isnt gonna pay for summer camp or piano lessons very few women will feel secure having a family with you because women are basically rational 

if youre looking simply date your financial health and living within your means is probably more important when it comes to compatibility youre not compatible with women who want a provider so dont pretend you are 

dating is hard everyone is screwed youre less of an outlier than you realize its just that hard
if he wont acknowledge that he owes it to you and to this marriage to work on the issue that exists solely inside of his head and results in completely inappropriate and disrespectful behaviour towards you then there is nothing you can to do fix this 

he can moderate both his feelings and his responses he does so successfully in many areas of his life he needs to recognize this one area where the skill is lacking and must be developed 

there is no resolution without that accountability and realization you cannot support him out of this until he is dedicated to walking the path out of it 

if youre never going to get angry with him for this behaviour and never admit its damaging or endangering then the relationship then its less likely hell ever be motivated to do that work the status quo works for him if you simply walk on eggs shells until hes triggered absorb this behaviour each time and accept apologies without any real commitment to change if you do that it becomes your operating agreement its the relationship youre both choosing
bf i need to be allowed to be angry with you sometimes i am angry with you and disappointed in your contributions this isnt surprising or unfair i understand this hurts your feelings im glad it hurts your feelings because that means you give a damn and i need you to give enough of a damn to change it

adhd creates struggles not assholes 

it can require some grace but not a free pass on  off all the basics certainly not a free pass on saying shitty things like we need to do better when they do not contribute is an existing issue 

your bf needs to recognize he needs to be a full participant in problem solving that doesnt mean he needs to be perfect but that means recognizing your frustrations are valid and worthy of a thoughtful response not a temper tantrum
its okay if its not worth the risk to you right now 

if youre consistently finding the conversation is getting to the we should probably meet phase and you just dont want too for whatever reason then take a damn break from the apps

dating is risky  mostly emotionally this fear of multiple peoples crazy exes seems a bit catastrophizing to me but if that is where youre at stop fighting it while chatting with individuals examine those anxieties on your own for a bit and rethink your goalsboundaries 

i keep myself safe by picking the place a friend knows where i am and basic info of who im meeting and if i am even the least bit uncomfortable taking a very roundabout way home

but most importantly i dont date when im not excited to date if it seems not worth the trouble or stress i pause the apps and go touch grass for a few months
