you should be doing what makes you feel good and he should love you as you are its weird that hes mad about this if he likes seeing you dressed up thats cool but he should give you a chance to get dressed up for something that makes sense like a nice dinner not football lol im sorry
one night stands might not be a good idea for you personally im demisexual so i only feel sexual attraction if i also feel a deep emotional connection so i never do random hookups bc i know its unhealthy for me emotionally not saying its the same for you but its clear that you are having very strong feelings towards someone who doesnt feel the same way you cant change how he feels you can only try and move forward and avoid this situation in the future
right im kind of astonished that the words trophy violent and blackmails are all being used to describe the same person
you are capable of having a healthy happy relationship even if it didnt work out for your mom she probably means well but shes misguided in thinking that all marriages end horribly lol you have to live your own life and make the choices that are right for you
a lot of manipulative people will try and keep the upper hand by always making you feel like youve messed up and you need to make it right the fact that he packed up and left over this is so extreme im embarrassed for him lol hes not trying to believe you that you mean no harm because it benefits him to act like youre the bad guy youre gonna lose your mind if you try and make it work with him
run no amount of beauty is worth being physically abused and manipulated over shell only get worse i promise you youll be 10x happier with someone who is sane loving and would never dream of hurting you on purpose
i dont feel like its that simple for this long of a relationship it kinda is though whether youve been together for a month or a decade the fact that his family does not support your relationship and not only excludes you but actively tries to replace you is a huge problem clearly hes not able to make them cut it out completely and respect your relationship together hes trying to toe the line between pleasing you and them but thats not possible because theyre opposed to you being around at all 

i know its hard but please consider if this is what you want for your future because they wont change and it will be a continual source of tension and hurt
exactly i had an ex boyfriend who used this exact method to try and warm me up to abuse repeatedly caused pain and then act like he meant no harm and i was overreacting by not liking it he will escalate it as much as he can op and in any case if a partner sees you setting boundaries as a problem you gotta go
i absolutely know how you feel im working through multiple heartbreak traumas as well and its difficult but worth it for me personally its been really helpful to just stop dating completely for the time being and focus on my healing youll know when youre ready to get back out there hugs
can you please give some examples of him needling poking the bear its hard to get a read on the situation without more context if you feel yourself getting angry do you walk away from the conversation to cool off
yes that is very manipulative for sure thats emotional abuse on top of the physical abuse im very glad you got away from him now you know to walk away at the first sign of someone not respecting your boundaries because if theyll do it once theyll do it again worse and worse big hugs to you im proud of you for getting away and learning from it
im so sorry this happened to you im concerned that you feel bad about threatening to punch him in that scenario please know that if youre ever in that situation again you need to do what you need to do to get away punch him in the face balls whatever you can your friend is the one whos fake af if shes taking his side keep them and people like them out of your life
thats really sad for her im so glad shes in therapy her innocence was taken away at a very young age due to that exposure and she needs support be a listening ear empathize with her and be supportive of her going to therapy and working through the trauma healing is very much possible and it sounds like shes doing what she can
it sounds like shes testing the waters looking for a replacement for her actual boyfriend unless thats what you want id definitely let her know that you need her to back off
try and pace yourself breakups are traumatizing and it can take a long time to recover and really start thinking clearly again theres nothing wrong with having feelings but id advice against acting on them or even trying to sort out what youre feeling towards her until youve had a few months to heal from the break up
youre allowed to feel how you feel porn is highly addictive and he may have a problem if thats a deal breaker for you thats completely fine and nothing you should feel bad about talk to him about it and see how he responds dont feel bad about how you feel or try and pretend to be cool with it if youre not
yeah and im sure that was difficult to deal with since youre only trying to help try and keep in mind that ed is a form of addiction so just like with any addict when they feel like their addiction is being threatened they will lash out even at the people who are trying to help its tough and my heart goes out to you 
personally the mundane daily life stuff from the ancient past is the most interesting to me im not that interested in battles or notable events but i love looking at ancient hair and makeup products restaurants home decor etc
it sounds like he felt cornered and accused next time  try and use more empathetic language like i love the both of you very much and your health and well being is important to me please know that if you ever need support with your ed or anything else now or in the future id like to help 

they are adults and they have to make their own decisions so theres only so much you can do im sorry
oh my usqitten has given you some solid advice that i agree with please take it to heart the next step with people like her is usually gaslighting making you feel confused and crazy for having a problem with her behavior so please try to keep a clear head and get some outside support as soon as possible
that scares me so much to know that people are being actively shamed for showing empathy empathy is like the 1 ingredient to a healthy society lack of empathy indicates a seriously emotionally unintelligent person if that becomes the ideal were screwed
whaaa familiarize yourself with darvo deny attack reverse victim and offender thats what shes doing theres nothing misogynistic about standing up for yourself and not wanting to be called names does she do this with issues you try to address
i am so very sorry that you lost your brother and father thats an enormous trauma and its very understandable that its affecting your relationships are you in therapy i think you touched on something very important when you said its the same thing i say to myself most of the time we can only give to others the amount of love and empathy that we give to ourselves if youre telling yourself that you shouldnt complain about little problems you wont be able to empathize with others problems either pain comes in all shapes and sizes youre allowed to feel upset about things even if they seem small compared to the tragedy youve experienced and other people are too try and find compassion for yourself and it will get easier to show compassion to your friends 

please give yourself a hug from me and feel free to reach out any time i care 
im afraid that cant be your problem he has to want to change make solid efforts to do so and find support along the way as it stands youre enabling him which is the last thing he needs i dont want to sound harsh because i know youre confused and caught up in all this but you have to kick him out and let him hit rock bottom out of your sight for your own sake and his
youre welcome and please do i sure benefited from support when i was going through it and im happy to help how i can 
the real nightmare is wasting even more years of your life trying fix someone whos broken wayyy beyond your ability to repair i understand im 38 and had to walk away from a narcissist almost exactly a year ago it was so hard but by the third month of being no contact i was healed enough that when he found an excuse to reach out i felt nothing but anger lol now i dont miss him at all and my only regret is sticking around for as long as i did im still single which i thought would be miserable but im so much happier than i was in that relationship but going no contact was essential to being able to move on you have to start there good luck and feel free to reach out if you need support
do you not have access to the internet at home im confused why you feel the need to just be more cautious rather than just stop doing it being careful about whos looking doesnt guarantee you wont get caught again you said yourself they monitor it and can look at the history just stop lol
educate yourself on narcissistic behavior and reading other peoples experiences they all operate from the same playbook and get you hooked on the on again off again cycle it can be very addicting and you will lose your mind if you keep letting her come back also research anxious attachment and codependent attachment im guessing youre somewhere on the spectrum of anxiously attached which makes it much more difficult to let go of people but you have to friend she will not change she will only continue to drain you of all the love and care and energy that you could be giving to someone who can return it 

blocking her is absolutely essential because by now she knows exactly how to rope you back in with the smallest interaction
you absolutely did the right thing by telling her that its not a good time to rush into things whether she wants to admit it or not shes still in a state of emotional distress and cant possibly make clear headed decisions at this point ideally you wouldnt have kissed and cuddled her but its done now so all you can do is not do it again anytime soon to be honest it sounds like this could get messy very quickly with her living with you and being unwilling to accept that you want to take things slowly
i mean yes she snitched but you gotta stop looking at inappropriate things on the school computers you will get caught again eventually and its not worth it
coming back to add congrats on getting sober and pulling your life together again that takes enormous strength and im proud of you now boot him lol
oh my bad im not sure why i thought it was it sounds like she might not even be aware of why shes getting triggered but even if she is aware the fact that she wont communicate her issue is all the more reason to try and not let it affect you too much at any age but at your age especially relationships are about learning and growing and getting to know yourself better dont let her weirdness throw you off and make you overthink something thats making you happy
thats odd i wonder if deep down shes feeling sadweird about the fact that youre in your first relationship and just trying to slow it down for her own comfort at 4 months its perfectly normal to talk every day you could try asking her if shes got any concerns but at the end of the day only you can decide whats best for you in this relationship
i hope op sees this i feel so bad for him
well regardless shes definitely into you and i think you should ask her to hang out sometime
absolutely do not keep him around kick him out change the locks and never speak to him again he ruined your life once and hell do it again narcissistic people almost always have an addiction of some kind and they will bleed you dry of your time energy and money for as long as you let them who cares that hes attractive i promise you youd be a billion times better off with a healthy happy partner who is less attractive than this mess of a person do not fool yourself into thinking you can help him or that youre his best chance to selfimprovement narcissists love it when you think youre the super special person that can save them because it incentives you to keep trying hes not going to change no matter what you do
it sounds like its way too early for either of you to really know how you feel besides that you like each other and want to see where it goes so im not sure what your question is
from what youve shared here shes 100 into you she was probably hoping for more than just what when she said shed kiss you so she took it back if shes shy then youre probably gonna have to make the next move
aww man my heart goes out to you friend i can tell that you take things very seriously when it comes to how you behave and treat others you are not a horrible person by any means your intentions were misguided but honorable 

i think you already know this but your definition of love is very skewed love is not about putting your own needs and feelings aside and suffering in silence not at all in fact you can only love others to the degree that you love yourself i gather that it might be challenging for you as you tend to intellectualize more than you feel but try to really offer yourself as much love and respect and forgiveness as you can throughout all this youve already been selfharming by way of ignoring your own needs dont double down on it by shaming yourself for the fallout if you can get into therapy i think it would be really helpful and definitely try reading some books on healthy relationships so you have a better understanding about what it means to be a good partner
i would highly recommend you stop talking to your ex for a long long time you dont owe her anything and being in contact is only going to confuse you and make it more difficult to move on enjoy life and make your own decisions
which is impossible to do in this case because she doesnt even know who she is or how shes going to be just because shes advanced in her career doesnt mean shes advanced on a personal level that can only happen through time and experience you seem like a smart guy i think you already know you need to let this go
right not to mention the inherent power imbalance of you having so much more life experience and time to get settled even if youre actively trying to make it even and be fair it wont be and your kids deserve for you to have a partner that is allin for them which it certainly sounds like she isnt in a place to be
just the fact that shes looking to settle down because its what her family wants is enough to show you that she still has a ton of growing up and selfdiscovery to do her brain wont be done developing for another 5 years buddy leave her alone for both of your sake
you can tell her that you arent ready to try and work on your relationship at this time without closing the door on the future possibility of that the dissolution of her family was very traumatizing for her im sure and we cant always help what triggers us thats not to say that she was right or fair for how she acted at all just that she may not have been in a very stable emotionalmental place at the time give yourself as much time as you need to enjoy your life without the drama and if you find yourself missing her and wanting to work on it reach out  if and when you do decide to talk to her be honest about how you felt and how it affected you if shes unwilling to acknowledge that she was hurtful its probably best to move on good luck lifelong friends are very special but remember to look after yourself first 
youre welcome im proud of you its definitely a process and im still learning alongside you its sad because our natural tendency to be empathetic and helpful and tolerant deserves to be treasured not taken advantage of im hoping for really lovely healthy future partners for the both of us
i have also attracted my fair share of abusivestalkery types they are almost always attracted to peoplepleasers because they know that if they push you in just the right way youll give them what they want build up your confidence and your ability to say no decide before you even meet someone exactly what your boundaries are and stick with them the more you know yourself and find your inner strength the more youll repel people like that and going forward limit your interactions with your ex to essential work business only
youre welcome i hope the conversation goes well
aww man im glad youre at least a little more comfortable but still that sucks dont let the fact that your mom is paying for everything keep you from being upfront about your needs and having a bed is a pretty basic need if she really cares about you having a nice time thats the least she can do and congrats on the wedding
i am so sorry youre going through this i dont know of course but its possible he could have attachment issues read up on avoidant attachment specifically but regardless of the reason which you may never know for sure allow yourself plenty of time to grieve the loss of what you had and what you hoped you could have together youre in the hardest part right now and it will get easier i promise i went through something similar and had to learn the hard way to pace myself in relationships because it really does take time to learn how another person operates on a deep level i think that as you heal and grow from this it will get easier to vet future partners and give yourself some time to feel it out before falling too deep there are people out there who will love you just as deeply as you love them i promise
another thought if you are able to you could go ahead and go find a couch or something in the house and that will kickstart the conversation in the morning when she finds you no longer on the boat
oh my you have every right to be annoyed youre the one being celebrated you shouldnt be sleeping on the floor lol im sorry babe it sounds like its too late to switch it up tonight but in the morning i would tell her that you were really uncomfortable and will need an actual bed for the remainder of the trip if you think she might be argumentative or weird about it then bring it up in the group so that others can help you figure something out
its kind of you to not want to hurt her feelings but for the future please know that its perfectly normal and reasonable to tell your partner it makes me uncomfortable to hear about your past partners and experiences i certainly dont want to hear about my partners past lol if you dont see a future with her then i think the sooner you get it over with and tell her the better and i wouldnt advise continuing with the business plan either as that could get messy very quickly
definitely bring it up if its bothering you theres a whole range of possibilities he could just be feeling a little down and its affecting his communication style he could have avoidant attachment issues and you guys getting closer triggered him etc try to open up communication and see what he says if you cant get a straight answer from him or he says nothings wrong but then continues to be distant its probably time to walk away good luck
 that makes my day thank you love
ahhhh thank you so much ive been thinking of it like a portal so looking at it through your eyes as a sun or moon adds a whole new perspective and i love it 
uartisticnoob both those comparisons are making my day thank you guys 
that means so much to me thank you
love this 
gorgeous love the title too 
thank you so much 
thank you so much 
heres a video showing a bit of my process
i love your style
thank you 
love the background colors
oops meant to write 4ft tall cardboard not 5ft anyway heres a video of my process 
yes i use brushes occasionally but i find that painting with my hands really helps me loosen up and stop overthinking everything
im glad it found you and you replied its really nice to know its not just me i have an aries stellium too lol we neeeeed the excitement
i have an aries mars so i act like i have no sense whatsoever
oh my goodness this made me cry so much wow wow wow i am so proud of you and happy for you and thankful to hear that youre doing so well 3 you have unbelievable strength and power to have made it through everything youve been through i knew you could do it 3 thank you so much for this message it means the world to know that it helped you im always in your corner and here for you any time
i have a capricorn moon so i feel bad for myself that i dont know how to feel 


well that was way too accurate
no problem good luck to both of you guys
absolutely just the fact that you already kinda talked about it even if it was just joking really helps my ex and i would joke about staying friends no matter what too and we have you might need some time to adjust and reset as individuals but just continue to be respectful and supportive of each other and youll be good
i love this so so much oh my goodness 
im so very sorry you went through that especially so many times its a heartbreak i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy and yes we do need much better resources for helping people cope and less stigma around talking about it because its so common but so rarely discussed
i mean yes of course thats a bizarre and disturbing thing to do but people dealing with extreme traumatragedy dont always react in logical or appropriate ways i had a miscarriage at 12 weeks and the grief of that alone made me kinda crazy for a while not to mention after childbirth theres a massive hormonal change and a bunch of other stuff thats challenging even when you have a healthy baby idk i just think its way too simplistic to write it off as simply wanting attention or caring about getting likes too much or whatever and i feel bad for her to go through all that and then be dragged down further bc she coped in a really weird way
oh i love these the meat one is so gross but so relatable lol something about being slightly high gets me super in touch with my intuition sometimes i end up doing what seems like completely random shit but then i end up understanding the reason why i felt compelled to do it after the fact nothing as crazy as that though usually just stuff like feeling the need to reach out to a friend and it turns out they just got bad news or something
whoa thats pretty cool did it seem unusually big to you at the time or only in retrospect after that nap like did it go from normal to big and then back to normal or just normal and then way smaller i dont know if that makes sense but i tried 
id love to hear some of your experiences if you feel like sharing
i wish i had for some reason i had the feeling like i shouldnt go in there im not sure if it was actually a bad idea or just a fear of the unknown but i couldnt bring myself to crawl in and then it was gone
this is my favorite one and i totally believe you i think kids have an ability to peer into dimensions that for whatever reason get harder to see as adults my story isnt as cool as yours but when i was a kid i looked into a pile of pillows that were kind of stacked together in a tunnel shape but somehow the tunnel went on and on like hundreds of times longer than the pillows themselves i walked away and walked back to look again and it was just back to being a normal stack of pillows
yes or like we want to be their new bff when actually were just being genuinely friendly but not like we want to be like friend friends thats the only downside of the placement imo accidentally leading people on
just curious do you feel like that in real life trying to figure out the best direction to take and keep ending up in the wrong places
i would say that the guilt and shame of killing the dog probably factored into the situation a lot but regardless please do not think that all women are like this i have spent the last 3 years trying to help my boyfriend open up cry rage whatever he needs to process his feelings every bit of progress hes made has been so incredibly rewarding and brought us closer together the only way id weed him out as a mate is if he stopped working on expressing his feelings and started trying to be all stoic again as a partner its exhausting and isolating always having to wonder what your mate is really feeling 

if you end up with another person who cant handle seeing you cry weed her out and dont look back you do not deserve that sexist bullshit
im sure theres a lot of additional factors like that but from what i understand the tradition stems from the days where talking about womens problems like periods menopause etc were taboo and so miscarriage was supposed to be kept quiet but if someone wants to tell their friends and family early on its easy enough to say that its still early and they should wait a few months before making any purchases
i actually wish the whole dont tell anyone too early notion would go away too losing your pregnancy even if you have only been pregnant for a few weeks can be so incredibly sad and if you havent told anyone then youre either alone in that pain or having to tell people that you need support from that you were pregnant and now youre not of course some people would rather be alone in that process regardless and if thats how they feel theres nothing wrong at all with keeping it quiet i just wish there wasnt a stigma around announcing too early it kind of creates a social isolation around anyone grieving before that 12 week mark
it makes me glad to see someone else talking about the just world fallacy i used to post about it online like a reverse evangelist all the time bc i think its so important for people to understand that this way of thinking is prevalent and insidious even nonreligious people do it without realizing it either to avoid having to empathize or to make themselves feel like if they just do everything right theyll be safe
im curious about the microdose my life has been changed in other ways due to a standard amount of it on separate 3 occasions over 2 years was it a one time thing and did you go into it with the intention of facing your addictions

edit also congrats on your accomplishment really encouraging to hear your progress
i have a theory that the rest of your chart plays into what kind of connections youll enjoy which is a little too complicated for an app to take into consideration for example my venus is in aries so i kinda like it when things are exciting aka complicated lol so for me a delicate or complex bond is stimulating and fun but an extraordinary or powerful bond can be boring like its too easy
what did the tire look like
ahh same here i guess its been about 2 or 3 weeks for me that ive obsessing over my jaw muscles bc something just felt off i kept trying different massage techniques to make it feel normal again this is really interesting 

did you feel it when our ribs changed
you sound like a really good person your mama is lucky to have you 
thats beautiful it seems like most souls tend to reincarnate within the same family i bet hes been really looking forward to seeing you guys again 
first of all im very sorry for your loss  thats really cool about the dream and i firmly believe that the women in a family line are super tuned in to the energy of new babies when i was pregnant with my kids i didnt want to know the gender until they were born but me my mom and my grandmother were completely positive i was having a girl and i was same thing with my next baby we knew it was a boy and he was
pluto heres a pic of my chart feel free to ask any questions 
i have those two in my second house i tend to have a lot of money or none lol
how did it work out if you dont mind sharing
this hurt my heart to read  i love people who dress however makes them happy and i hate to think of her being made to feel bad about her awesome quirky self
thank you so much 3 im okay im thankful that my dogs life was so full and happy and that she had such a peaceful ending and there are positives to being single and not having an elderly dog to tend to any more such as being more free and independent traveling etc so its really hard to cope with all at once but im trying to think of it as a new chapter with gratitude
in my 9th house on the night of the lunar eclipse i told my boyfriend for the billionth time that we needed to start doing some very things differently because i just wasnt happy in our relationship and he said hed work on it but he didnt so on june 8th i broke things off then later that night my sweet little dogs health took a serious turn for the worse and i had to put her down on the morning of the eclipse ive had her with me for 14 years she was a gemini sun and sagittarius moon im heartbroken

its amazing you were able to recognize the pain you were causing and turn it around especially after everything you went through yourself just commenting to say im proud of you and dont give up on your brother closest in age it may take time but if hes able to heal on his own he may come around to the idea of a closer relationship with you
happy birthday
thats a good life skill to have
did you get to play with them
so it was entrapment what a bastard
aww thats a good one my little boy is 4 years old now and i always wonder what random stuff hell remember
lol and of all the beverages you could have chosen to spit out you went with the one most likely to stain the carpet
aww those early childhood accomplishments are the best
how did that turn out
i have a vivid memory of standing in my cousins yard staring at a tree
im not a christian but uanotherreaderofstuff is right the bible does say that although its in matthew not revelation start on verse 34 of jesus sermon in matthew 25 hes saying that if you didnt take care of the poor imprisoned etc while you were on earth you dont get a spot in heaven
wow thats really cool would you mind sharing what sort of meaningless thoughts and views you saw yourself having as a teen i feel like i waste a lot of energy on meaningless thoughts now as an adult but im trying to improve 

thanks for sharing i hope the despair goes away completely soon and that you find more and more warmth and happiness in your life
yeah its a different song but its a similar vibe to the beach boys so im thinking op might have just misremembered slightly
are you thinking of this one 
thats a real gift i have it too with some close friends for example once i started spontaneously crying while i was in the shower and i had no idea why i wasnt even sad but my friends name came to mind immediately after so i texted him and sure enough hed just had a heartbreaking thing happen to him i think its possible our brains are silently communicating with each other in ways we cant observe with current technology and some may just have stronger communication links than others whatever it is im glad you guys found each other
thank you
you should give it a go theres some great ones on youtube you could try people seem to have a lot of success with this one  i totally get being wary but it seems like the subconscious has a mechanism of sorts that will only allow you to see what you can handle i tried many times before i saw anything and when i finally did i understood why i hadnt been able to see it before i actually participated in a thread about this recently if youre interested it seems to be a somewhat common experience
its its complicated lol but i love him very much when i saw him in the glass thing i looked at him for a long time and then i understood that hed be hurting a lot in this life then i understood a second thing that made me agree to him being my dad unfortunately i dont remember at all what that second thing was but i assume its something that im not supposed to remember just learn over time
oh wow ill have to check it out thank you for telling me
i did a past life regression once where i saw myself choosing my parents i was sat in front of a giant clear glass with a gold frame that had pictures of all the options and i could kind of flip through them like turning pages in a book but with my mind i was flipping through them thinking nope nope nope because i felt nothing when i looked at the couple until i got to my parents and i totally freaked out with excitement because i recognized my moms soul from having what felt like thousands of happy lifetimes together i said she could be my mom yes yes yes and then i looked at my dad and didnt recognize him at all but understood they were a package deal theres more details but yeah it was very interesting
oh interesting my little boy always called water by what sounded like whoa im curious now if that sound matches the word for water in another language
oh wow i love this  thank you for sharing
theoretically though if a conscious or soul if you prefer doesnt need a living brain and body to operate from then one could exist in a plant animal maybe even a drop of rain or just floating in space
22 is an incredibly powerful number in numerology its considered by many to be the most powerful master number really cool that you have a significant astrological event on that date i cant tell you what to expect but i wish you the best
adderall starts trying to make the bed while youre still in it
youre awesome thank you for saying that i sure want to be a good mother she deserves it re my big 3 yes i absolutely feel pulled in many directions a lot today my pisces sun just wants to meditate feel my feelings read tarot cards and sit with my crystals while my libra rising wants to shop for new nail polish and hang out with my boyfriend meanwhile my cap moon is telling me that all of the above is a luxury and i shouldnt indulge until my house is spotless and ive researched some investments
bless you this is all so helpful and encouraging and helps me understand whats going on in her brilliant little head going from distraught to cracking jokes is sooo her its nice to know that isnt unusual and i absolutely love the idea of turning the process of talking about her feelings into a game itself i think shed really enjoy that and it would help create a more positive association with emotional processing bc right now i think she wants to but then feels like it is too boring lol shes a great reader but shes not writing fast enough yet to keep up with all she wants to say so maybe i can create another little game for that where she can tell me what shes thinking and i write it down for her 

im a pisces sun capricorn moon and libra rising my only gemini placement is my chiron but i do have my moon and neptune in the third house
look up attachment styles and specifically anxious attachment i have this and its a struggle but being aware of it is hugely helpful
this is such lovely and helpful advice i cant thank you enough definitely sounds like my little fairy she even says no one understands me sometimes which makes my heart ache i have another question if you dont mind a lot of times when shes feeling things deeply and lashing out i take her to a private place and give her space to talk about what shes feeling she often says that first she wants to play some word games like coming up with a word for each letter of the alphabet sooo gemini and i do but then it can be almost impossible to get her to actually start talking about her feelings shell just keep suggesting other games i guess what im trying to figure out is if playing games is actually helping her or is she just avoiding processing her feelings
my 6 year old daughter has the same big 3 as you if you have any parenting advice pls share
my lifetime before this one i was human in terms of how i felt like my sense of individuality and my emotions but i looked more like a cheetah or leopard on two legs i could run and climb really really fast the planet i lived on was completely peaceful so much so that i found it almost boring i spent most of my time on a small space craft doing missions with my friends who were giant blue lobster looking guys we all communicated telepathically i remember more details about my job than anything else unfortunately i dont remember anything about my childhood and i dont remember there being anything like what we would call a couple or a family so i wonder how babies were even made there wish i could remember more maybe someday
yeah those memories were rough they were so much worse than i would have guessed as for who he is in this life the tv show is still on the air and hes still on it so i have some idea of what hes like in this lifetime it seems like hes still got some anger issues but hes come a loooooong way thats for sure i havent tried to contact him im afraid id just sound like a deranged fan lol but im okay with not meeting him in this life i feel like we reincarnate with the people who were meant to learn from in each life so if theres anything to be gained by us meeting itll happen on its own

and its a pleasure talking with you too thank you for sharing your story i was in high school when 911 happened and it was all so shocking and tragic its oddly comforting to think of the victims living new lives and the things that happened to them being a distant memory but im so very sorry that happened to you and i hope you get the answers you seek
not the person youre responding to but ive had experience with not being ready to remember certain things years ago i used to watch this tv show with a clist celebrity that isnt very interesting on his own but watching him made me feel deeply angry but also kind of aroused im not someone who easily forms emotional attachments to celebrities so this was really confusing bc the feelings were just so irrationally strong i did at least half a dozen past life regressions and never saw anything about him then years later after i had done a lot of work on personal stuff that was affecting me in this life a flood of memories came back while i was meditating that pretty much answered all my questions i wont get into the details but basically he was my uncle in a past life and he was horrible to me but i had a stockholm syndrome type of affection for him nonetheless i saw the horrific things he did to me and yeah i was definitely not ready to see that back when i first started trying 

the reasons youre not able to see it might be different but like uredseaaquamarine said youll see it when youre ready and itll probably make sense to you then why you couldnt see it before
aries
scorpio
leo
im up for almost anything but prefer that it be exciting or novel in some way i feel a little awkward being romantic in the traditional sense so flowers chocolate etc is definitely not a requirement
this is great advice thank you so much
thank you
aries
wow thats interesting i found myself reflecting on some events that i experienced in feb 2018 just this morning do you happen to have any more info

how long do you cook for
im close pisces sun cap moon and libra rising im your slightly more approachable sibling 
not that it matters but what the hell is the context of that like whos children immigrants liberals just random kids
no problem this one  from 2016 is good because it recaps the historic events that followed previous similar conjunctions like the ones had last year
it depends on what youre looking at studying theres different areas of focus like personal astrology your ownsomeone elses birth chart synastry how two peoples charts interact with each other which is used for relationships mundane astrology is used to predict events and tbh im not educated enough on the methods to help with a recommendation
i usually look at similar themes in my real life housesapts often represent the dreamers own mind so in this case it might be about wanting to make some changes in yourself but feeling like youre going from bad to worse mentally just an example but hopefully helps
theres a lot of old like years old astrology articles saying that 2020 would be a globally historic shitshow we had a whole lot of these types of conjunctions over the past year and were not done the newspaper style horoscopes and stuff are definitely bs but actual astrology the type that is ancient and takes years to learn is really very interesting
i really like em i think the piscescap combo balance each other out nicely and the libra rising gives me a nice approachable vibe
libra rising
yayyy how do you feel about the combo
hey were almost twins i have libra rising
i couldnt get into the clinical trials so i did a kind of diy version on my own but heres a good rundown on how they do it i had a friend sit with me and im so thankful id love to pay it forward so if you need someone to sit with you id be very glad to help via zoom or something
i still struggle at times with intimacy but ive come a loooong way regular therapy helped a lot as well as using mdma aka molly in a therapeutic setting i can go into more details about that if youre interested for me the biggest hurdle was admitting to myself that i needed help processing it and healing
thats so awful and so fucked up of your friends to respond that way im so sorry theres nothing lucky about having your bodily autonomy violated no matter what the violator looks like to suggest otherwise is a gross ignorant lack of empathy and understanding it took me 13 years to tell anyone what happened to me because i was so afraid of not being believed so my heart really really goes out to you knowing how much not being believed just adds to the trauma of it all
i believe you and im so sorry that happened to you please dont think that because you didnt force her off that you are to blame in any way response to trauma is automatic and we dont really get to consciously choose between fight flight and freeze i froze when i was coerced into sexual abuse as a teen and for a long time i felt shame about it but i shouldnt and neither should you
could be a past life memory
i have a few questions that would help with interpretation whos house is it are you in the same house every time or does it change what about the locations are you in the living room basement etc are there any patterns in which part of the house the attackers come through
where is your glowworm now
seems like theres quite a few of us i hope its symbolic like of an era in a spiritual sense also funny sync that you responded to me just now bc i was literally just thinking about you you wrote me some very kind encouraging words during a rough patch a few years ago and im forever thankful 
weird my boyfriend and i both had vivid dreams last night in his dream he lost his job and his house burned down in my dream my house was being torn apart an apocalyptic storm and my son was terribly injured
theyre in the very late degrees of capricorn right now and by the 21st of this month theyll be in aquarius
what are you listening to
same here i miss being able to look at the houses
im sorry when you say everybody else who do you mean
hey congrats i got off mine about 3 years ago and im so glad i did i learned that the meds were putting a damper on my positive feels too not just the negative ones so while i might have some moments once in a while of feeling much sadder than i would on meds i also get to experience a lot more excitement love happiness etc every day  btw i highly recommend taking st johns wort herbal supplements if you can theyre cheap otc nonaddictive  and as effective as some ssris at curbing depression 

anyway whats a song youve listened to lately
whats the weirdest food order youve ever gotten
well the fact you skate tells me that you arent too lazy to move your body you know how to get back up when you fall  and you like to learn new things keep it up you can apply the same energy to other things now and in the future
well maybe you just havent found out what makes you feel alive yet school is great but its not everything and failing definitely doesnt make you a loser what do you do when youre not being productive
what makes you think youre a loser
i see i dont know if it will require a harness or not then but maybe is that something that youre worried about
gah thats messed up i wonder if theres any kind of loans for stuff like this that would have lower payments im uninsured right now and thankfully my health is good but yeah its scary how fast medical debt can pile up here in the states 

and youre welcome im always here if you want to chat or vent or just need some encouragement youll see the other side of this someday and in the meantime be kind to yourself 
im so sorry for everything youre going through thats a lot why do you have to come up with the money in just two days
im sorry this happened to you thats awful you deserve better people in your life and i hope you find them
im not sure theres different types of buses but usually they dont have harnesses
i relate to this i was raised in an uberconservative environment i literally only knew of two people in my hometown who were openly liberal lol and it wasnt until my midtwenties that i felt safe expressing just how different my views are now if i can offer some advice when you do start talking about it be as calm and as humble as you can im amazed how open minded people can be when they dont feel like they have to defend themselves using phrases like i was surprised to learn or something ive been thinking about lately really helps i think it will also help a lot that you are interested in doing things differently and what you would like to see in a new political party the whole democrats vs republicans thing is so toxic and it gets people all worked up but by approaching it from a neutral perspective and making it about new ideas you can really help people open their mind even if they dont admit it to you
are you trying to decide whether you want to try it
lol i get that what part of history are you learning about rn
i hope you enjoy the new program im sure it will be a cool and safe experience
do the people around you know that you no longer agree with those views or are you keeping it quiet for now if they know how did they respond
whats one thing youd change about your life right now if you could
im afraid have massively different perspectives on this my friend i can see how you feel im being obtuse because you seem obtuse from my perspective but were not were just on very different pages and thats okay you are fully entitled to your perspective and i wish you well 
they could share that wealth to an enormously powerful beneficial extent if they chose to but they choose not to if youre a part of my company supply chain whatever and you help me earn 20 dollars and then i keep 1999 for myself and gift you with a penny i have generated wealth for you doesnt mean i am a great person doing great things for you im a selfish dick capitalizing off your work and reaping the benefits
they are not generating immense wealth for anybody but themselves and their shareholders instead of murdering a dozen or so people serial killer style they are in possession of millions of wage slaves who must grind away for decades just to hopefully have food shelter and healthcare that is not productive use in my book not at all
of course and btw i think the story of your friend giving you the crystal is so cool those spiritually intuitive kinda friends are a blessing 
i dont think its idiotic at all i think its really cool that theyll share those placements and i bet they will have a lot of understanding for each other as they grow up
i was curious too so i found this tldr he said he wanted to save the government money by hiring his own security team
as others have already mentioned thats not a good astrology app but in addition i think they have some kind of listening capability builtin because their do and dont keywords have been way too accurate for me more than once when i was redecorating my front porch i got front porch as a do for the day another time i was asking my boyfriend if we had any parchment paper and parchment was one of my dos the next day thats not astrology thats spying lol
i have the same theory the whole jesus as messiah storyline is remarkably similar to much older mythological origin stories including the virgin birth and coming back from the dead and its paul who flipped all the stuff jesus said about helping the poor on its head and said instead if a man doesnt work he shouldnt eat actually paul flipped just about everything jesus said around and christians believe what paul says jesus  uh  meant to say far more than they believe what jesus actually said christianity is 100 a religion of paul jesus the man would have wanted nothing to do with it
taxpayers are already footing the bill for their being arrested sentenced jailed on probation etc treating it as an addiction rather than a crime might very well end up being cheaper and actually help people but we will see agree withu2muckingfuch that this will serve as a good test run either way
i like you youre smart i think the democratic party has utterly failed to address the most important issues facing americans and frankly im not convinced those at the top level care one bit except for bernie of course theyd rather go hog wild combatting fringe issues and demonizing anybody who supports trump than look at themselves critically in 2016 i wrote a mildly critical comment about hillary on a liberal site and got nasty hateful messages for weeks and i even said in my comment that i do not at all support trump theres this selfrighteous fuck everybody who disagrees attitude among democrats that is gonna be the death of them if they dont change im like you still figuring out my politics but socialism seems to be the best way forward for us imo but like uapi is saying we have to start by putting up a candidate who will earnestly address the very legitimate concerns of the american heartland and stop being so damn unwelcoming to anyone who isnt already on our side 

at the end of the day humans just want to feel like theyre safe and cared for trump obviously makes people feel that way and while i dont understand why i do understand how the left makes them feel unsafe and unwelcome
definitely look into wing chun according to legend it was created by a woman which is pretty cool im a small person as well and i dont like violence so the approach of training primarily to disableescape from attackers appealed to me
i wish more people understood this
i really hope youre right my friend
conservatives say its all soros liberals say its all koch bros andor putin i think the truth is probably all of the above and much more were merely puppets on the string of the super wealthy being manipulated into turning on each other so we dont look up and realize were all being swindled by the same forces anybody who thinks the billionaires on their side are actually on their side are painfully naive its an illusion if we united as a people wed be too powerful for their absolute greed to continue going unchecked as it has been for decades and thats their worst nightmare
i really truly think that this civil war narrative is being pushed into the conversations of both sides by an outside source theres major world powers that would have a lot to gain by americans being so divided against each other i have dear loved ones on both sides and nobody i know irl wants bloodshed online though i see it brought up more and more by both sides equally and both sides seem convinced that they have no choice because the other side is already planning on it i dunno maybe im paranoid but it all just feels very  orchestrated
for sure then again it could just as well be about anger youre actually feeling towards him but its just being illustrated in a satirical and overthetop kinda way dreamland is a very symbolic and metaphorical place and the details matter for example the computer keyboard the sloppy food they both mean something specific about something in your life that is or has made you feel pretty strongly the computer keyboard might mean that this is a dream about anger youre feeling specifically in regards your communications with the outside world or perhaps while working from home the sloppy food might mean youre feeling disgust too im just spitballing but you get the idea 

hope its ok that i said all that i just get excited about dreams lol
love your style
i help people interpret their dreams as a hobby and i might be able to shed a little light quite often the people we see in our dreams arent playing the part of themselves they often represent a different side of yourself that you identify in them for example i have a very spiritual side but i also have a very logical reasoning side i have a friend darion who is pretty dismissive of anything spiritual metaphysical etc when ive had moments of feeling conflicted about these two sides of myself theyre often followed by dreams of me and darion being on bad terms even though were getting along fine so i see it as darion representing my logical side and my subconscious mind trying to tell a story that calls attention to this disconnected person within me 

just something to consider in case its helpful

i have the same placement i think it is playing out for me like this the scorpio south node means that my past lives and my past in this life tends to be filled with drama power struggles abuse of some kind and money problems i feel my mission is to find peace stability and prosperity in this life and basically stop expectingcocreating chaos i think this tumultuous time period were in with the virus and worldwide political issues is such a good opportunity to be a port in the storm so to speak the inspiring thing about this placement is that if you believe in past lives you can bet that you have already been through just about everything a person can go through and youre still here youre stronger for it and you can handle anything its okay to just relax and enjoy life and lean into those lovely taurean traits like gardening enjoying good food and indulging all your senses
absolutely my bffexhusband and i have had a lot of lives together i think it sounds so cheesy but the first night we spent together we didnt even fool around just stared into each others eyes and felt completely at home i didnt even believe in past lives at the time yet i felt like id finally found him now 15 years later hes still the only person i can just look into their eyes forever and never feel uncomfortable were divorced but we are still as close as ever weve both done past life regressions and seen lives weve had together usually as a couple or just dear friends

i have another friend that i feel for some reason was my son in a past life ive also had the experience of simply locking eyes with a stranger and thinking i know them like an instant love and familiarity and it always makes me wonder if its a loved one from another lifetime
you need to be able to heal and process and release trauma before those experiences become helpful imo ive dealt with everything from sexual abuse to homelessness and for a long time it did weaken me but years and a lot of psychedelics therapy yoga etc later i feel pretty damn powerful i think that what doesnt kill you  saying does a disservice in the same way that calling cancer patients fighters does it gives the impression that if you dont possess a superhuman ability to immediately bounce back to better than before youre somehow deficient the focus should be on healing and transmuting and being supported until you start to feel stronger 

im here for you if you ever want to chat 
my cap moon is in the 4th house and cleaning my home makes 95 of my bad feelings feel better for a little while
i have a pisces sun but a cap moon and 4 aries placements i still come across as gentle to most people at first
theres a lot of interpretations but generally i just take it as a sign im on the right path i would look into numerology if youre interested in learning more about the particular energy numbers carry you can even generate a free reading online based on your name and birthdate
it really does thank you shes amazing and i love the way her clever little mind works and i just want to support her the best i can 
that sounds just like my 6 year old gemini sunmoon daughter any parenting advice for me especially when it comes to the tantrums
to be fair a lot of things have happened this year that we wouldnt have thought would happen in a million years its kind of the theme
thats what i hope for at this point
those are great placements imo having your moon and ascendant in the same sign helps because peoples first impression of you is better aligned with your inner self descendant signs can often represent your shadow side parts of yourself that are underdeveloped but having it the same sign as your sun means those traits are much more inherent in you
amazing i have the same placement of chiron and related to all of this i started unintentionally having spiritualmetaphysical experiences at a very young age that didnt jive with the religion of my family and community it was difficult enough just to process those experiences alone and trying to explain them was impossible and socially risky so i kept quiet im still figuring out how to share my thoughts and feelings about things without sounding crazy lol
i feel the same way about my pisces suncap moon thankful to have both bc i can see myself being extremely lazy or a workaholic with just one or the other lol
if the relationship is no longer healthy and the parents cant get along they already have an unstable family unit plenty of people grow up to wish their parents had just divorced rather than stay together arguing and being passive aggressive all the time
the 29th degree sun year is said to be a time of preparation for the changes to come when your progressed sun changes signs mine changes from aries to taurus next year and i am kind of feeling that energy like im getting ready for something
if he knew anything about true astrology hed know that summing someone up based on their sun sign is ridiculous unfortunately there will always be people who have a prejudice against certain signs but thats life you geminis are awesome and he sounds like a terrible friend lol
i feel like its safe to say they hardly ever use it that way this is their time to plot and scheme amongst themselves safe from the peoples expectations and opinions getting in the way
really rough but ultimately it was all necessary for me to transform into a much more authentic version of myself
yes i hear what youre saying and i cosign your petition for everyone to stop with the gun waving
right im referring to ops comment about his real life interactions the ones that know were not racist were there last night and people with open minds were willing to hear us out and have conversations with us

and saying that i dont think its fair to dismiss what hes saying about his real life experience and intentions just because it sounds like something trolls say
its crazy and honestly it scares me im reminded of that noam chomsky quote all the time lately 


the smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion but allow very lively debate within that spectrum
im sorry but thats a stretch billions of people converse every day lol you cant attribute everything that is said and done in the real world to divisive online lingo personally i prefer to engage in good faith and if it doesnt work out i move on
why are we really at the point where wanting to have a conversation is suspicious if so then were completely screwed because exchanging ideas and perspectives is crucial for peace
woah thats crazy my first name in this life is similar to a name ive had before but dying in an alley and being reborn as ali is wild i hope remembering how tough you had it before has helped you release any guilt about having it good in this life you deserve all the best ali
yes ive done it many times probably at least a dozen times lol but its only worked twice in total ive seen 4 of my past lives one through regular meditation one through a guided meditation like this one was in a dream i had after a psychedelic trip and the most vivid and recent one ive been remembering since i was a little girl
thats funny i almost asked you if you have any fears related to big cities or alleyways honestly its really great to hear that youve had a good life this time your story was very sad and it sounds like youshe more than deserved a break this go round
do you have any experiences or feelings in this life that might be influenced by hers im always interested in the parallels like ive had a lifelong determination to only have sex with people who truly appreciate me as a person and then in one of my past life regressions i saw myself as a woman who had really low selfesteem and let herself be used by a bazillion different guys bc she thought being sexy was her only valuable quality
magician  and i relate to the description very cool thanks for sharing
thats really heartbreaking im sorry 3
well im 35 years old and im embodying my libra rising more than ever so dont hold your breath
wow this is my boyfriends placement if you dont mind me asking were you bullied or just generally made to feel small by a parent
weird i didnt sleep at all last night and my 3yo was awake until like 3am my 6yo woke up about 4am and never went back to sleep
no problem im still fairly new myself browsing this sub plus reading birth and synastry charts of people i know then looking up the placements and aspects that interest me have been my best learning tools
its giving you the option of which astrological method youd like to use placidius and whole sign are probably the most commonly used ones around here personally i prefer whole sign you can search those terms in this sub for a lot more info
did you guys get more than a one time relief payment of 1200 months ago
damn im so sorry youre going through all this 
another fireball checking in i have mars mercury and venus in aries also lilith do you mean that mars is in your third house in your natal chart or transit natal placements tell you how those energies will most clearly manifest in your life as a whole transit charts ie where mars is in your chart right now will tell you how youre currently being affected
is it in your 6th house in your birth chart or do you mean thats your current mars transit my natal mars is aries in the 7th house but right now its transiting my 6th house i am feeling super motivated in my health and wellness routines and getting a lot of things done that ive been putting off
well thats awesome youve already laid out a foundation for some really helpful stuff definitely give mdma a go if you can get your hands on some quality stuff if you need someone available to talk to during your trip id be really happy to help dm me
i think you already know this but start by putting dating wayyy on the back burner until youre in a better relationship with yourself this woman was able to use you because you dont yet fully believe you deserve to be treated as an equal as for what to do expect some trial and error and be open to trying a lot of different things i highly recommend beginning a meditation practice because over time you will learn to detach yourself from your thoughts rather than letting them run the show and negative selfimage is the product of negative thoughts about yourself run wild it sounds like you have a lot of emotional trauma with regards to women and being in society in general so therapy can help you work through a lot of things using psychedelics like mdma with the intention of revisitinghealing negative experiences has been lifechanging for me but of course you should do your research and proceed with caution etc etc also work on building healthy platonic relationships its much easier to get sucked into an unhealthy romantic relationship when you dont have a solid friend or two you can lean on for support and honest feedback 

im sorry this happened to you and i hope you keep working on yourself and your mindset because there really are great people out there who will treat you as well as you treat them
i worked in the tiny backstage of a 105 year theatre before i got laid off due to not being able to have shows anymore i dont know for sure because testing wasnt really available in my area at the time but i think i had the virus already working with internationally traveling performers and crew every day in tight quarters is challenging even without this particular virus idk if i can do that lifestyle again
it kinda blew my mind how people were celebrating it like i can understand being happy to see liberal media go down if you arent at all liberal but how could it not even cross their minds it what an awful precedent it was setting
yeah hulk hogan vs gawker and im still sad about it gawker could be hella trashy but they had some really great journalists too and were one of the very few mainstream media companies left that were not owned by a billionaire
my dad is a retired doctor and has been in a remarkable number of situations where he has been able to help people off the clock via witnessing car accidents people having heart attacks on planes and at a gas station i dont know what it is either but i like to think the universe has a way of putting brave and helpful people like you guys where theyre needed sometimes
what is the factor
not his literal house though he said my fathers house meaning the temple people had basically turned the temple into a moneymaking scheme and jesus was extremely not okay with that thus the table flipping and such
because paul the opportunist came along and claimed to be miraculously converted from the guy who loved dragging jesuss followers to be stoned to the guy who was given special permission to tell everyone what jesus really meant to say he proceeded to write tons and tons of letters that he claimed were the word of god to the point that more than half of the new testament is just paul blabbering on urging people to be judgmental saying stuff completely opposite of what jesus taught and modern christianity is entirely based on pauls teaching not jesus
rpracticaleffects especially this post
gosh i have a bunch of these and i do think some might be actual alternate timelines playing out like my dream self pops over to experience it for a little while theres a huge openair church that looks like a remodeledexpanded version of the church i grew up in i am no longer religious and i dont go to church but in these dreams it seems im still trying to play along and its very lonely disempowered feeling 

but the most frequent ones happened around 20122013 and they were scary the world was a dangerous lawless place and my ex husband we were still married at the time though and i had to be extremely careful about leaving our apartment bc there were so many violent people everywhere but every time i was there i knew that apartment complex parking lot etc like the back of my hand even though it doesnt exist in my life here 

 i really like to help people interpret their dreams because i have a gift for reading the metaphorical language of dreams but these types of dreams are just so different in the way they feel and the content is so undreamlike that when i have them i dont even try to interpret them anymore i just assume i went timeline hopping again lol
i read somewhere that the draconic nn is set to aries because of the idea that ultimately were all on a solo soul mission of some kind and aries represents that energy personally i resonate with my draconic chart in some ways more so than my birth chart but im not educated enough on it to speak to its validity
you dont have to do anything really except be mindful of your thoughts and feelings if you feel anger frustration anxiety whatever lean into it enough to see whats really under there we all have shadows and trauma and stuff weighing us down but remember that this is the energy of rebirth too releasing the old makes room for the new i like to do some symbolic things too like during the day i will clean my house really well get rid of some clutter and at night ill take a long bath or shower idk  just something about getting my environment and myself super clean while thinking about releasing and cleansing stuff that my old self went through really feels good 

you can google rituals and stuff but i suggest trying different things and seeing what feels good and helpful to you just remember to keep directing your mind
im a pisces so i cant do anything about it myself

lol my capricorn moon strongly disagrees
ooo id be interested in reading this if you have a link
im a capricorn moon my mom is a virgo moon and she had me when she was 25yo she is a cancer sun and i think thats a combo that led to difficulty expressing her emotions in a healthy way but shes improved a lot i had my first born gemini moon when i was 29 and my second child leo moon 25 years later
i think so i feel like i relate to my draconic chart more now than i would have if id seen it at a younger age but i think a lot of it depends on the souls evolution and intention for this incarnation maybe we take on the natal chart characteristics well need for this leg of the journey and for some people more than others that may mean a drastic change in how they operate compared to their draconian chart for example my exs draconic chart has a ton of capricorn and virgo placements which is baffling because he hardly has a drop of those energies in his birth chart or personality lol but his north node is in gemini so it kind of makes sense like if he came into this life with a capvirgo heavy chart itd be that much harder for him to embrace the free curious excitable gemini qualities hes meant to embrace this goround
is it really that bad i have toe thumbs and i try to tell myself its okay but i dont feel like its okay
pisces being lazy my capricorn moon almost completely cancels out my ability to be lazy unless my chores are done and im at somebody elses house where im not distracted by other things i could be getting done
when i was really little i was so gentle and looooved helping people to the point where my older brothers friends would take advantage of my kindness asking me to go get them water or whatever stuff they could have easily done for themselves and id do it one of my earliest memories of getting really pissed off is from when i was in first grade and my brothers friend told me to go get him something and i realized i was getting walked on and said no after that i was a lot less helpful for a few years lol and ive been quite wary of being taken advantage of ever since its funny looking back because thats the year i turned into a little aries im moving into taurus next year
i was just thinking about this last night my boyfriend has some troublesome aspects like pluto square venus and i have a lot of 7th house aries placements from what hes told me about his younger self i dont think we would have gotten along very well at all if we were the same age and wed dated in our twenties hes fifteen years older than me though so he has been working through a lot of relationship stuff since before i was even dating age hes also a leo but by progressions hes a virgo which i love
i have venus mars lilith and mercury all in aries in the 7th house and i endorse this comment
libra rising 25 degrees
i have mars in aries best was with fellow fire mars people 
im a cap moon and i have learned to embrace my rather mechanical structured approach to processing emotions i think it can actually be very helpful for working out problems with others or for helping people sort out their own feelings because the analytical skills i have for it help me break issues down to the root cause see how different feelings are interconnected etc
part of fortune is where you can find success so if its in capricorn in the 7th house maybe you find success by working hard alongside your significant other or a business partner 

chiron is where youre wounded but can ultimately help others heal for example mine is in gemini in the 9th house and boy oh boy does that resonate i was raised with a very strong religious doctrine 9th house stuff but from a young age was having my own spiritual experiences that didnt jive with what i was being taught so talking about my own beliefs sharing what i learned on my own gemini stuff was a liability that would have led to being told that i was wrong a sinner etc which honestly still hurts all these years later i think part of my purpose is to be brave enough to share and in doing so help others feel free of religious constraints 

lilith is a little more varied in interpretation some people say its the part of you that society rejects or a part of your life where you embrace darkness i would look at different articles about your specific placement of lilith and see what feels applicable
how did you determine which fated events were indicated by them by looking at transits or was it the symbology of the placements making it clear
internet word for small
youd rather die than live without compliments
thats crazy i have both the sun and saturn trine my mc what about you and yes im definitely used to making changes in my life some of the things ive been through just in the past year i never anticipated happening to me like a divorce sometimes i think that might be part of my growth process learning how to be stable and consistent and enjoy life despite seemingly never being able to be sure whatll happen next
yay how do you feel about your sunmoon combo i like it because i think the cap moon helps me stay grounded in reality and keeps the stereotypical pisces laziness under control but sometimes it feels like my feelings are overly filtered out because i wanna analyze them to death before i share them
well i definitely relate to my scorpio south node im oddly comfortable with crisis darkness and the idea of just burning it all down about 7 years ago i gave away almost everything i owned and drove out to the desert with no plan except to start over this was before i discovered astrology ha ha and it was right before my saturn return but i can see how it reflected both nodes kind of a south node reaction with north node intentions my mc is in cancer so that combined with my nn signhouse im wondering if my calling is at least in part to be a source of comfort and stability in other peoples time of crisis

what about you
i have nn in taurus in the 8th house which honestly feels kind of contradictory i can imagine that im meant to focus on taurean qualities like stability comfort followthrough and generally just enjoying life but the 8th house would seem to be the opposite of a lot of that
im a pisces sun capricorn moon and libra rising we should be friends
did you also feel a libra risingesque fear of displeasing other people by admitting that youre told that youre pretty because i did and still do
libra rising and i think i am pretty in a very conventional sort of way none of my facial features stand out as exceptionally good or bad i just have good symmetry i guess im clumsy but that always surprises people once they notice because im told i seem like id be very graceful lol im 54 and weigh about 115lbs so fairly petite i think most of this is aligned with the standard libra rising description except for my height as ive read they tend to be taller than average
okay im not arguing with your data as ive yet to see it myself im just saying that your phrasing gives the impression that being gay is unfortunate and even if you dont care about hurting peoples feelings i think youll get a more productive discussion out of this post if you share what youve been researching in a more neutral less negative light
saturn just entered my 5th house like 2 weeks ago so my experience is very limited but i feel the sudden urge to buckle down and complete a short film i startedabandoned two years ago whereas new creative ideas arent really coming to me ive also been doing a lot of reflecting about what i really need in a romantic relationship and what im really willing to contribute another thing i think its interesting timing that im stuck with my children almost 247 right now because its made me more aware of what they individually need from me as their mom and a lot of it seems to involve me being more structured planning ahead better etc

hopefully you get some more responses im very interested in reading about this from people who have been through it
can you give some examples might want to change your wording too lol i think i get what you mean but saying risk of sounds like being gay is a disease or something
i assume she means venus in aries maybe venus in scorpio too if going by traditional rulerships
depends on what you need us to be 
whats your rising sign im a libra rising venus in aries and my style is similar 
what country do you live in
check out rprecognition this is a lot more common than you might expect
happy birthday
same here and i was terrified to grow up i cried a lot when i was getting ready to turn 13 because i felt like i was gonna be a teen and not a kid anymore now im 35 and i guess ive accepted it but if i could be someones kid forever i would lol
listen to take a walk on the wild side first then listen to can i kick it and you cant possibly miss it
and a tiger saw a man
thats funny i had the same recurring dream as a newlywed i think sometimes our brains just run through alternate path scenarios via dreams and your emotions in the dream help you feel what making different choices might have felt like
you cant be serious lmao these are babies when i was this age i told my babysitter i was gonna cut off her head i wasnt a future murderer just a little kid copying what i heard disney villains say if you wanna predict adult personalities based on tiny childrens behavior youd have to come to the conclusion that theyre all gonna be psychopaths
thatd be great thank you
trying to avoid unnecessary trips the grocery store plus having way more time than usual to spend in my back yard definitely has me veggie gardening
wish theyd reverse it turning churches into homes even temporarily would do a lot more to help the sick and the poor  you know the people jesus said to look after
no im kind of the opposite of that if they seem uninterested i lose interest too
capricorn moon in the 4th house im cleaning and organizing the shit out of my home and putting together a homeschool plan for my kindergarten and preschool age children
hold on by alabama shakes

edit omg a slice of pi award and our bdays are on pi day this is the best ever thank you upoky23 i love you

congrats on your new baby boy im sorry you wont have visitors extra sets of hands really help with those newborns but i hope you two enjoy lots of happy healthy snuggle time 
im here if you wanna talk
i dont know if youve ever been miserably sick with the flu before but posting on reddit was probably the last thing on everyones mind and regardless of whether or not the commenters here had covid19 maybe we did maybe we didnt its not at all surprising statistically that out of over a million subscribers half a dozen or so people would have had their worst flu ever in the past few months statistically it probably happened to way more than half a dozen doesnt make us liars just unlucky
yeah just lifting a cup of water felt like a physical feat at the time

i was too out of it to post anything i honestly for the first time understood how otherwise healthy people could die from the flu but i think i wrote some texts about how at one point my fever reached 104 and i was sleeping so hard i wouldnt have even woken up to take medication if my ex hadnt stayed over to keep watch on me and  our kids and checked my forehead in the middle of the night 

edit oh and i have texts that i sent to my dad a doctor about how to watch for pneumonia bc my kiddos breathing was sounding wheezy
interesting i definitely had the worst flu of my life in december and my children caught it and both had some difficulty breathing for a few days maybe a dumb question but would that give us immunity now if it was indeed the same thing
alright well i hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend lola
asking about specific placements isnt allowed here for some reason its okay on rastrologymemes and raskatrologers though if you wanna repost this
i think you might find this post and comments really helpful
ahhh yeah that makes sense i think pisces can be a very childlike placement if its not balanced out with some strong earth or fire signs i have a lot of aries which helps and without it id probably be looking for guidance all the time in an effort to feel grounded
thats interesting i have mars and venus in aries both in the 7th house which makes me a little relationshipcrazy lol ive had to teach myself to be picky about who i date because if im not careful ill stick with people who arent actually good for me he has a lot of first house placements which do make him a little selffocused but hes definitely a relationship person his venus is in 7th as well and its actually been good for me to be with someone who has his own stuff going on because my pisces tendency to get lost in people is kind of kept at bay im more able to rememberfocus on my goals and personal activities as opposed to other relationships where i got so wrapped up in someone that i lost touch with myself all that to say pisces relationships might work better for you if shes able to accept your individuality and let it encourage her to focus on her own as well
id say trust your gut feeling pretty much regardless of placements
im so sorry for your loss youre a good sibling 
you have a lot of signs and often times the sun sign is less relevant to the personality than others for example im a pisces but i have a shit ton of aries in my chart and it shows lol so a lot of the classic pisces descriptions lazy reserved a pushover dont describe me at all put your info in a birth chart calculator and youll get a lot more insight into yourself
yes i have a bowl shaped chart and its said that people with this shape often feel incomplete as though the missing half of the chart is felt but not entirely accessible i only started studying astrology last year but looking back at the charts of people ive dated i see now that i have definitely been drawn to guys with heavy taurus gemini leo and virgo placements maybe in part because theyre bringing some of those energies to the table that i dont have a lot of on my own
definitely this has been going on for quite a few years think how many apps you have and how many of them could easily be listening with your permission per the terms and conditions
i love the 8th house its nothing to be scared of honestly yes it deals with death but also rebirth transformation contracts secrets sex etc if it makes you feel any better my 50 year old boyfriend has some of these placements and hes one of the most welladjusted and lucky mfers i know lol he does have quite a fascination with horror movies though
my saturn return was god awful although in hindsight of course i can see how myself and my life is much better because of those trials im at the end of my sade sati and its been really rough and just as lifechanging but not nearly as heartbreaking as the stuff i went through with saturn return
the flight attendant said i want this lady off my flight and then the woman started apologizing saying she was really stressed out etc
no worries i was actually responding to unettlepunk about his capricorn date

but re your post im dating a leo guy and id say your best bet is just hype him up with genuine compliments often and carry on like it never happened next time something embarrassing happens to you maybe tell him about it for laughs so he remembers embarrassing things happen to everyone
im a pisces and i listened to under the bridge obsessively in high school so i could feel all the feels
i really want to know what happened now
i love this decoding my toddlers mystery phrases is one of my favorite things about having a toddler lol i felt like a genius when i finally figured out boocoos was blues clues lykeen was lightening mcqueen etc
he looks unwell but someone showed methis clip of him dancing with little kids and its pretty damn cute so im pulling for him
i can definitely understand taking issue with him as a psychiatrist proposing that conclusion but he is far from the only one the cia did some fascinating research on the topic of consciousness that particular link is a rather dense read but its really fun to ponder all the potential implications if youre into that kinda thing
first of all thanks for engaging in convo with me respectfully secondly im not looking to convince you or anyone to believe one way or the other i do want to say though that a lot of the children remembered random people who the parents couldnt have known about and in some cases they recalled correct details that were not publicly available information also for his consciousness theories he rely on theories of quantum physics quantum mechanics theories which is not the same as pseudoscience  but i acknowledge that the birthmarks could be coincidence some kids remembered incorrect details etc 

again believe what feels right to you and be as skeptical as feels right to you im open to the idea of reincarnation but mostly in the camp of who the fuck can ever really know how this crazy universe works
thats a depressing yet empowering thought lol on the one hand i dont wanna be a bug but on the other hand now i feel like a badass for making it to the mammal level at least once fuck yeah im a mammal
lotta possibilities like maybe their past lives were on other planets or maybe not everyone is reincarnated or maybe our consciousness spends time elsewhere before returning to a physical body so theres not extra people right now just a lot more here at one time than usual

edit could also be that we reincarnate as creatures sometimes if so i would like to be a bear next time because annual hibernation sounds awesome
i think youd enjoy reading dr jim tuckers  research hes a actually continuing another u of virginia school of medicine psychiatristresearchers work dr ian stevenson so their combined collection of data from children who have past life memories spans decades most children lose these memories by age 7 or so theyve matched soooo many childrens memories with real life people its nuts interestingly most often the remembered deaths are traumatic or sudden in nature so lil suicide baby in the meme fits right in lol
just let him go i definitely understand the need for closure but some people just arent willing to have the conversation and hes pretty clearly unwilling you deserve to be with someone who wants to be with you so put your focus on that and try not to take it personally lots of great people out there will want exactly what you have to offer
dreams of having a baby are usually to do with birthing a project or a part of yourself something like that similarly a miscarriage dream can be about something that you maybe planned on or started working on that ended for whatever reason but you were happy about it so if theres something you startedended around 2 months ago that you feel good about it ending its likely symbolizing that rather than an actual miscarriage 

dream interpretation is tricky with strangers because you dont have any idea whats going on in the dreamers life and feelings that may be symbolized but hopefully that helps you get started
whenever youre listening youre really just quietly wondering how long until you can talk about yourself some more
aww yay no problem im so glad it was helpful best of luck to you and your boyfriend 
i see what you mean now thank you for clarifying and youre right i dont disagree i just wanted to point out that there are more legit options than say costar for example and for someone like me and presumably op who still has a lot to learn its kind of nice to have something simple to start with
not all astrology apps are social media based and some of them are remarkably indepth timepassages has over 70 aspects just for my birth chart with most of the descriptions being multiple paragraphs long including less known aspects like biquintile and asteroids like juno their synastry is just as indepth but you do have to pay for the individual additional charts
you sound a lot like me and my boyfriend im a pisces sun cap moon and hes a leo sag moon its been about a year for us as well and we are really compatible if you can get the app timepassages and pay 99 cents for his chart youll be able to use their compare charts feature which is awesome the most thorough and accurate synastry reading ive found it spelled out what makes us compatible really well and even explains the challenges in a helpful hopeful way
heyyy you have the same placements as my little 3 year old boy got any parenting advice for me
if you can find out his birthdate you can find out his moon sign venus north node and more which will be far more helpful than going by the sun sign alone im a pisces with a leo boyfriend and those two signs are supposedly incompatible but its a really lovely relationship
for lent im giving up a little bit of work to work on my life 

not a bad idea actually
nodal returns squares and reverses never miss me lol you can read the timing and descriptions here
i grew up in america but this one makes me sad too i feel like humans are meant to live in community and sharing taking care of each other but instead we isolate ourselves and just schedule time to not be alone once in a while
im a pisces with a leo boyfriend sometimes our love languages arent exactly aligned like he loves spoiling me with gifts and taking me to nice restaurants and stuff which is very appreciated but id be just as happy smoking a bowl whilst wearing jammies and talking about our childhoods lol im a very affirming person though which works well with his need for praise and i love his physically affectionate nature our senses of humor are pretty compatible too i think if id met him earlier in my life i wouldnt have appreciated our differences nearly as much as i do now it took a long time for me to realize that being super similar to my partner doesnt actually work out too well for me  

edit another interesting thing is that according to the synestry of some other placements we have we should be butting heads a lot and having to reign in our tempers but i have never had such a peaceful gentle relationship before and when we do have issues were able to talk a them out in a really empathetic and loving way which again may come down to having met at the right time
what was your experience like with this combo im a pisces and my baby daddy is an aries we have a 5 year old gemini and a 3 year old scorpio  i like to think our parenting styles provide a wellrounded balance but i dont know
pluto and saturn making squares oppositions and sextiles to practically everything in my chart lol basically the last two years have been an unending journey watching of everything i used to think would never change changing including my marriage got divorced this past summer doing my best to sit with the uncertainty of it all and trust that greater fulfillment and selfrealization are on the other side
aww lol they were giggling so much as they signed it i wondered if they were writing crazy stuff but i guess they were just happy to be signing it thank you
thank you
this was sad but i enjoyed reading the details thank you for sharing if you dont mind sharing how do you feel about relationships in your current life
at a theater where artists are allowed to sign the walls backstage a bunch of teenage performers wrote this  and id love to know what it says 
mr rogers for pisces sensitive gentle guy who lived to make people feel loved and empathized with he had a 29 pisces sun with moon mercury and venus in pisces too lol
wow til never really looked into these before but i just looked it up and  my life has definitely shifted dramatically right on schedule with these returnsreverse returns
no idea we lived there for 3 years and never heard anything like that before or after
birth chart and transit chart 

so very grateful for any input at all i can offer dream interpretation in return
this happened to me and my ex one time when we were the only ones in the house two really loud knocks on the bathroom door
the only place i have gemini is my chiron but feel like i relate to gemini the most of any sign
could be my partners north node is my sun sign and we have the rare and exceptional pattern it specifically says that being together supports the person hes becoming
im a cap moonpisces sun and i feel things very strongly but i wont reveal my feelings until im ready which isnt often and i can only talk about my feelings to like  3 people and even then its usually after ive ruminated over it and tried to feel better on my own for a long time
i set mine for desired  nap length  approx how long i think it will take me to fall asleep  10 minutes because it always takes me longer than i think it will
i can relate as i have a pisces suncap moon but im learning to appreciate the beauty of being able to deeply empathize with people without getting swept up in whatever is going on with them and that i can have my head in the clouds and my feet on the ground at the same time
i would definitely pass on the message even if anonymously like usubfootlover suggested who knows maybe this message could spur an awakening in her that would lead her to change her ways
in my experience youll only remember the things youre ready to see i had a deeply uncomfortable feeling of dislike almost hatred for a very minor celebrity on a show i used to watch even though i had no conscious or logical reason why years later id mostly forgotten about him but then i started thinking about him again at random times and feeling so uncomfortable i tried past life regressions many times before eventually seeing flashes of a life in which he was my horrifically abusive uncle now of course that was not a fun thing to relive but it was actually really helpful for me in working through some issues i had around sex and relationships with men but if id remembered all that earlier i dont think i would have been ready whats interesting too is that i no longer feel that anger or dislike of him anymore at all  i actually find it comforting that hes evolved over his lifetimes and is now as far as i can tell a good guy weve probably all been horrible people in the past so whatever you learn from it know that it doesnt define you now
im so sorry this happened to your girlfriend shes really lucky to have you in her corner
i think a lot of people are intimidated by those who march to the beat of their own drum because theyre unconsciously forced to confront their own conformity like were all incredibly unique at heart but when fitting in is your priority you suppress your own unique qualities and then resent the people who are able to let theirs show i hope that makes sense its something ive thought about a lot as ive dealt with it in my own way 

keep doing you you sound awesome
costar powered by pretentious delusional robots
i got caught in that cycle for a while when i was young i didnt have enough selfrespect to leave him but i had enough strength not to do what he said of course its shitty but some people just repeating what they see normalized and havent learned how much better and different a relationship can be
 my brain went to the same place and i liked it
i have taurus in my 8th house as well as ceres in taurus in the 8th
what confuses me is that my north node is taurus in the 8th house and the descriptions of having a taurus nn is basically the opposite of the 8th house nn description am i supposed to be embracing comfort and stability or learning to live without it
im so sorry you lost your son 
readingrpastlives might make you feel better
my venus is in aries and ive never related to the falls in and out of love quickly thing if i commit to someone its because im hoping it lasts forever my venus is retrograde though so that may have some impact
aww well needless to say im a big sag moon fan and yeah the needing space thing took some getting used to because i felt rejected at first but that didnt stop me because my aries venusmars loves the chase lol just curious but have you ever lived with a partner before and how do you handle your need for alone time 
my two most significant relationships including my ex who i was with for 12 years have been with guys who had a sag moon in the 1st house from my perspective their common themes are loyalty and a deep deep need for autonomy and freedom also both have a very funloving nature
i love you i can tell just by looking at you that youre a kind person and i bet youre fun to hang out with too keep being awesome the world needs more people like you
ill believe you you might enjoy checking out rprecognition
thats so weird but ive read similar stories before so youre not alone
what time was it before you blinked vs after
thats so beautiful
no prob im glad it was helpful the collective unconscious fascinates me too i started learning about it when i was studying dream interpretation and how our subconscious minds use similar themes water  emotions for example in dreams to illustrate our deeper feelings i think that and probably many other influences numerical astrological etc probably play a big role in these types of persontoperson coincidences which arent actually coincidental at all
take your kiddos with you i drove mine to randomly generated spot in the middle of a suburban neighborhood and there were like 10 deer ambling around it was wild and they loved it never know what you might see
i dont have an explanation but id say definitely keep in touch with him you can keep it light and casual and see where it goes maybe youve found each other for a reason if nothing else you know youve got a kindred spirit out there and thats always a blessing in itself
if its a metaphorical dream he probably represents a part of yourself that youd like to get reacquainted with or theres something about him that youd like to be more like think about his qualities and if theres anything about him you particularly admired could also be a glimpse into an alternate timeline

good morning you sexy beast
maybe but im glad you did i think i the way i worded that question was a little more bleak than i intended and i agree with you im still healing but its a process of getting happier and happier  and a lot of my healing has happened through metaphorical dreams like these because they help me identify what im feeling on an unconscious level which is why your question caught my eye thank you for the thoughtful response
do you also feel like you went through hard times that dramatically decreased your capacity for joy to this day because thats where i think my shitty disney world dreams come from
i have recurring locations but what happens there varies theres a ridiculously large mostly empty church that i wander around in sometimes a postapocalyptic disney world where everything is shitty and unsafe but its the best we can do
i only date people who are mature enough to value the content of someones character over the color of their skin
one of the past life memories i have is of being a woman who died in the 1960s with no spiritualreligious beliefs at all i floated above my hospital bed and just kind of hovered there for a long time before i realized that i wasnt obligated to stay in the room with my body lol after that i zipped around the world and saw things id always wanted to see like the eiffel tower before eventually making my way up to the clouds and beyond to start the betweenlives process which is a long way of saying that i think some souls need time to process the experience of not having a body or they simply arent ready to cross over because of fear or the feeling of unfinished business in this realm and thats probably where a lot of ghost sightings come from

edit i dont attribute all spiritual entities to this sort of thing though i think energy good and bad can manifest in this realm all kinds of ways and theres probably an untold number of extradimensional beings passing through at any given time that we cant fully perceive on this planet

i went to school with someone who is getting fairly well known as a comedian a few people found her annoying but most people including me thought she was funny i guess its still a little surprising just because so few people actually make it in the entertainment industry and she did it

this article is really fascinating to me they talk extensively about the pole shift and estimate the number of smaller circular structures similar to this one to be in the millions but for more indepth reading you might find this and this interesting english explorers who discovered the ruins in the late 1800s found it inhabited as is illustrated in the picture i linked above and documented some of the things locals said about it
i think it would be super awkward at first and yes painful for a while but personally i believe the vast majority of people are really good at heart and so much of the pain we cause each other is really because we ourselves are confused afraid and hurting and that telepathy would ultimately bring us closer together in a new way because wed be able to feel the pain thats causing people to act the way they do and maybe even inherently understand the source of their pain and the feeling of being understood and empathized with would change peoples lives for the better i think thered still be factions but it would be a much more massive yet simpler twosided one of good vs evil instead of the everymanforhimself sort of world we live in now but im just speculating of course
thanks for reading i have had mixed results sharing this with people in real life so its nice to be able to talk about it and not feel like im coming across as crazy haha its weird i feel a deep sense of tragedy and loss looking at pictures of the ruins and if really it was an accident that shifted the poles and caused us to lose telepathy that really would be a great tragedy to be able to communicate and empathize seamlessly and effortlessly and then suddenly everything changes for everybody in an instant and nobody understands why misunderstandings uncertainty about peoples motivations and so much more would be a problem for the first time and our resulting sense of being alone in the world would be so painful to experience all at once and if that is what happened it makes sense that there would be factions and people would start splitting up into tribes and inventing their own way of communicating like in the story of the tower of babel

edit another interesting thing about these ruins is that theyve discovered hundreds of much smaller versions of it covering a wide area around it as though the people who built it were experimenting and working their way up to the big one and it doesnt make sense as a fortress or city walls or a place for livestock or really any of the things we associate with ancient human lifestyles
i have past life memories and by far the most vivid one is of being shown the footprint of a massive structure and understanding something similar to what youre saying except the languages came to exist because of a sudden loss of telepathic abilities as a child i would see the shape of this structures footprint everywhere in clouds popcorn ceilings the floral pattern of my bedding and it drove me crazy because i couldnt put into words what it was and how i recognized it then a few years ago i ran across this image of the footprint of the great zimbabwe ruins  and it stopped me in my tracks because its the exact same shape ive remembered my whole life then i started reading more about the legends surrounding it and it sounds an awful lot like the tower of babel theres even theories about it being some sort of natural energy producing mechanism that was just too big and too powerful and the people who built it ended up accidentally shifting the magnetic poles which could indeed affect the way our brain computers link up anyway i could go on and on but its a fascinating rabbit hole to fall down for sure

or hear me out you love things about yourself that youve actually accomplished things about yourself that make you a good person or a unique individual etc and dont need to cling to where you happened to be born as a form of identity
i wanna see
as you grow and evolve youll take on characteristics of the sign following your natal sun for example im a pisces sun and i still have many of those characteristics but ive been a progressed aries sun since childhood and i relate to that because i had to learn to be more independent and assertive than the typical pisces at a young age
who always has their dms open if you need someone to talk to
not at all everyone needs to feel wanted and loved i hope you find someone who appreciates you for you really soon 
speaking with kindness hearing them out and acknowledging their feelingsperspective even if i disagree and sharing my own feelingsperspective without insisting that my way of thinking about it is the only correct way basically i make every effort to have a polite discussion rather than an argument and by doing so i find that its far more likely to go my way and even if we stay on different pages the relationship can usually carry on just fine

happy birthday
just call it a leg injury and reduce your recovery time by two weeks
i love you
aww thank you very much for saying that my man i hope you have a great day too 
youre awesome thank you for chatting with me about this i agree with you that the media is pushing it pretty hard and as someone who has  almost zero trust in the media i do have to question why but at the end of the day i think its a good thing for kids to feel free to explore the world around them without having to deal with all the cultural input theyll be dealing with the rest of their lives and if this kind of thing helps parents feel better about itnot read into it too much i think thats great 

anyway thanks again it says a lot about you that youd earnestly consider the other side and be willing to change your way of looking at it the world would be a much better place if more people were brave enough to do that i have to work on it myself all the time
ive read all your comments here and im not a fan of arguing id like to understand your side i dont get it yet but im trying it seems youre okay with your son consciously choosing to dress as a woman once hes old enough to understand that what hes wearing will be perceived as feminine and good for you i think thats great what i dont understand is why youre not okay with a little dude playing dress up before hes old enough to have picked up on all the culturalgendered associations isnt that inherently more pure in intention its like you want to teach him its not okay but then be cool about it if he does it anyway which in my personal opinion is kinda sad because then hell only be able to express himself with the knowledge that hes going against what his parents have taught him is acceptable 

i have a transgender friend who still gets emotional talking about the time as a child when they said they wanted to wear a waitress costume and their parents laughed at them and said no thats for girls it was the beginning of a 20 year long shameridden hide out in the closet until they were finally able to even think about expressing their femininity again and they still arent close with their parents statistically the odds that one of my kids will be transgender gay etc is low but regardless id so much rather be supportive of them wearing what they like than set up a precedent where they feel like they have to audit their choices based on my personal feelings as long as theyre safe and not hurting anybody i dont see any reason to get picky
if a little boy wants to wear a dress its got nothing to do with their sexuality and everything to do with wanting to look like a character they enjoy my 3 year old boy likes to put my makeup on sometimes bc mommy does it and its colorful sparkly shit that can go on your face all of which appeals to his toddler sensibilities assuming that makes him gaytranswhatever would be idiotic
i hear you on the first point but you cant just lock your door and keep sleeping when your kids wake up early unless theyre old enough to be unsupervised which takes years

i am my day job i work with artists but not doing art myself but ive been painting for a few years and sell them sometimes ultimately i want to be a filmmaker too im learning how to animate and id like to make short films what about you
oh thank you that made me smile and youre welcome please feel free to reach out any time you have a dream youd like some help figuring out of course youre the best interpreter of your dreams because youre living the experiences that lead up to having them but it always seems to help me having someone readhear mine and tell me what sticks out to them i used to have chronic nightmares as well and learning how to understand what my brain was trying to sort outtell me made a huge difference i also usually google the setting and such for common interpretations which helps like last night i had a dream that took place in a stadium and i was on a computer trying to animate i read that dreaming youre in a stadium can mean that you are trying to be more assertive and put yourself out there more which sure enough is what im trying to do with my art so it makes sense
interesting im a pisces sun cap moon and an infj makes sense since infj are known for their empathetic yet emotionally reserved ways
oh yeah i know but it still might be relevant since the description of the metaphor strangulation  stifled emotions aggression kinda fits with your description of the dog having to be kept in the garden due to being aggressive with certain people im sorry it made you feel horrible bad dreams can be really upsetting i would interpret that as your minds way of telling you that whatever the dog represents be it stifling your emotions or something else its a valuable part of yourself that you should protect no part of ourselves are ever really killed forever they just get pushed back or forgotten but theyre still there and you can nurture them 

it might be worth a try to ask yourself what the dog represents before going to bed tonight i do that sometimes and will get a new dream that illustrates it differently
hmm thats interesting i googled the meaning of dreams about strangulation and this came up 

in dreams the feeling of being strangled suggests a deliberate act of suppression strangulation suggests a violent act of suppression emotionally our more violent aggressive side may not allow us to act appropriately in certain situations  to dream of strangling someone is an attempt to stifle our own emotions

maybe something in your life has made you feel like you were too aggressive or said too much or like you had to stifle your emotional responses that might explain why your brain chose that dog specifically for this dream
possibly but that someone could also be you the subconscious usually creates a character for each part of yourself that it wants to illustrate so sometimes you are all the elements of the dream do you remember any more details like how the dog was killed how would you describe your cousins dogs personality irl
animals often represent a vulnerable part of yourself it might help to think about it metaphorically and whether you might feel like youve lost a part of your personality
mars in aries here too and same
im a pisces woman with a leo man i like our differences for the most part the biggest hurdle probably had to do with his sag moon though he doesnt like to talk about feelings until theres a problem and i could talk about feelings all day lol but ive learned to appreciate his love language of making fun plans and helping me with stuff instead of expecting him to express it my way
happy birthday 
if you look in the shared experiences section of a particular pattern some of the comments may tell you what its based on a lot of things seem to be based on the rising signmc
is your rahu different from the north node my western north node is in taurus but if i do a vedic chart i get aries rahu
me
heres what its like for me personally 

the cons too much of my self esteem is tied up in feeling accomplished i have an emotion and then i immediately feel compelled to ignore it categorize it explain it away or feel bad for feeling it in the first place lol i rarely get comfortable just  feeling i spend a lot more energy thinking about what i should and shouldnt feel 

the pros  it overrides a lot of the less helpful pisces sun traits like laziness lack of boundless and so on also makes me popular with employers as i have a very overpowering urge to work hard edit to add i like to think that as i continue to learn how to accept and integrate what im feeling it will be even more of an asset i hope i can learn to use my pisces empathy and my libra social skills combined with cap moon stoic side to be a port in the storm for others
thanks so much and btw if youre ever interested in reading professionally id love to be a client just read your kim post and its fascinating

well you sound like a good parent to me and i appreciate that we were able to chat about our different perspectives without it turning into a pointless fight all the best to you and your family 
wanting to wear someone elses clothes sure sounds like creatively experimenting to me obviously well have to agree to disagree here and thats fine but my belief is at least partially formed by experiences like when i sat across the table from a gay friend of mine last year and held his hand as he cried about the time when he was 4 years old and his conservative manly man dad made him feel ashamed for wanting to buy a barbie hes 30 years old and that shit still hurts another friend who is trans has memories of being laughed at by his parents for wanting to wear a waitress costume these parents didnt raise manlier boys by censoring their interestsexperimentation they raised boys who grew up to feel like their true selves werent good enough for their parents

im not saying youd do these things just explaining why i dont want to be the person who makes my kids feel bad about experimenting and liking what they like theyll get plenty of that from the rest of the world and when that happens ive got their back
i get you i was just responding to the other persons question of why not and i get your reason for saying no in your case but yes id let him wear his sisters clothes to school if thats what he wanted to do and she didnt mind hes only 3 but hes worn her shirt with the hearts on it out and about before lil homie just really likes hearts as long as theyre safe and not hurting anybody i try and let them figure out what they like without putting my personal feelings and bias in the mix
i have kids and i let my son wear his sisters pajamas lol theyre the same size and she doesnt mind he likes them so yeah why not
i think its all pretty much done by ai like they have certain plugin phrases for planetsignhouseaspects and the robots then string sentences together based on your transits for example my moon is in capricorn in the 4th house and my venus is in aries in the 7th house so when theres a transit happening with my moon and venus it might say something like explore what happens when you allow your sturdy emotional connection with home and family to recharge your energy for significant relationships sometimes its eerily helpful and accurate sometimes its just word salad
kids will be petty no matter what you do though id rather teach my kids to express themselves in spite of the occasional negative feedback than teach them to try and fit in my 3 year old son likes fire trucks and digging in the dirt and stuff but he also likes having his nails painted different colors he studies his options carefully and usually picks specific colors for specific fingers its cute but if later on he stops wanting to do it ill be cool with it i think theres a balance between encouraging them to be themselves and forcing them to buck the trend all the time i hope i get it right but im far from the perfect parent
thats so awesome youre definitely not alone i wasnt feeling well and didnt have the best experience last night in particular but generally i find the days before during and after a new moon and full moon to be extra beneficial for that kind of inner healing
libra rising with a lot of aries and scorpio im petite like 53 and 110lbs dark curly hair which i usually have as a pixie cut or a kind of mop top lol big brown eyes small nose often told i look like a fairy
libra rising and this moon is transiting my 8th house also my north node is taurus in the 8th house im thinking about my future a lot what will truly make me feel happy and comfortable im also feeling a strong urge to examine my inner self and what my actual wantsneeds are vs what i feel like i should wantneed my moon is in capricorn so i dont often get the urge to just let myself feel what i feel riding the wave while i can
full moons are great for releasing think about yourself as a cup and the feeling of heaviness as a symptom of being too full what behaviors fears thought patterns etc are you ready to release

edit the moon is in taurus so you can work with the energy of this specific full moon by also thinking about your five senses and indulging in pleasure take a long bath eat something yummy listen to beautiful music etc
no worries at all just wanted to offer i bet youll find the perfect deck in no time i dont use tarot myself but ive enjoyed getting readings so if you ever want to practice on someone lemme know
well they say your first deck should be given to you if youre comfortable sharing a mailing address with me send me a pm id love to gift you a deck from amazon if not no worries ive seen them in stores that sell games and any crystal or magick shop should have them
thats so cool you gotta do it keep me posted if you have time
second house is in scorpio with saturn in scorpio and uranus in sagittarius there as well i dont know what im good at but it sure isnt makingkeeping money interestingly my south node is in scorpio in the 2nd house using whole sign so it seems i should be able to overcome this but idk im still pretty new to astrology
its cool you had this dream so close to todays date of 1111 i typically read dreams metaphorically but this one might be worth looking into literally get yourself some tarot cards and learn how to read even if its just for fun
im so sorry for your loss i hope things look up for you as the days go by be patient with yourself im sure you know this but the grieving process takes time  im always here for you if you want to chat 
i have the exact same placements and disposition
thats sounds about right the circumstances of my childhood made me feel like i had to be very stoic and cheerful especially around my mom shes in a much better place now and our relationship is good so i forget how much that probably still affects me subconsciously
i think of cancer like a mama bear looks very cuddly and sweet likes to hibernate but holy shit dont mess with her or her loved ones im mostly basing this on my own mama bear who is a lovely very badass cancer and my cancer granddad who was the same way im a pisces sun with a lot of scorpio and while i have some great qualities from those placements sometimes i think theyre less practicalhelpful in the outside world than cancer qualities
oh thats really interesting my south node is in scorpio and my life came crashing down at age 27  i went full scorpio lol and basically expedited the burnitdown process myself so i could move on to rebuilding and i had a pretty major epiphany that could be called a spiritual awakening it was a rough time in my life but im thankful for it now everything i lost was just stuff id built trying to please or impress other people
oh man i totally do that lol for me its usually because something ive been ignoringsuppressing with various distraction tactics has suddenly bubbled up to the surface and i cant get it out of my mind and because i dont like to talk about my feelings until ive had time to process them alone i end up sitting there unable to pretend nothing is wrong and unable to talk about what is wrong its awkward

edit you can help by not forcing them to talk about it just let them know youre there if they want to talk 
capricorn moon i was just reading about it this placement this morning actually bc im 34 and i still dont understand my own emotions very well
id say that it applies to my current career in a sense my midheaven is in cancer and i work with a lot of emotionally sensitive people a nurturing personality isnt required for my job but it sure helps ultimately id like to be an artist fulltime and i can see how my art might take on some cancerlike qualities eventually right now its very scorpio though
wow thats awesome i cant think of a more appropriate profession based on your sunrising empathetic yet very comfortable with death
re the bowl shape i find it confusing because some of the information i read seemed to indicate that the best way to move forward in life would be to work counterclockwise starting with the first empty area which would be taurus8th house others seemed to be saying that sorting out the saturnscorpio 2nd house stuff would be the biggest factor 

re the aries at 29 degrees in the 7th house i feel confused about what it means i got married too young and i still struggle with the balance between being myself and going for what i want vs truly merging with another person and my north node is in the 7th house so i feel like this is important to figure out edit i forgot that i used whole sign for this chart which puts my north node in the 8th house 

and finally my progressed sun hits 29 degrees in aries next march which feels significant heres a pic of my progressed chart for that date in case its helpful

any help or insight suggestions etc with any of the above would be hugely appreciated 
go for it i like to learn 
what charity
why should i move my backpack off the one empty seat left on the bus when youre capable of standing why should i not be a murderer we all do a lot of things because its the right thing to do why do you want the people who run companies to be an exception so bad
im glad you mentioned infrastructure because its a great example of what im saying pipelayers provide an incredibly valuable service and the work is difficult af starting pay is about 24000 a year does that seem fair to you
yeah it would be dumb because bench pressing cars has no value getting the food i ordered in mere minutes does and just because people arent properly compensated for doing difficult work doesnt mean they shouldnt be
if you have a dog capable of standing up for hours at a time in a hot kitchen keeping track of multiple orders at a time busting ass to collect bag each order in well under 5 minutes interacting with customers many of whom are unpleasant working with computer systemscash registers and making correct change you should get that dog a tv show 

ill never understand why people think working at mcdonalds is easy i get tired just watching them
because the white car ended up on top of the red truck that tried to pull it out of the water i think
im no expert but i think thats more of a synastry question specifically where you have placements in each others 5th house maybe 4th house too
go to astro seek or horoscope yourself websites and make a birth chart using that info
lol my 5 year old has been a demanding lil punk all morning i was just telling her that she should try being positive and encouraging more often if she wants people to care enough to cooperate with her this video couldnt have come at a better time
the night i met my boyfriend he had an astounding number of conjunctions happening with his natal venus and his north node was parallel his sun sign which is kinda cool because his north node is my sun sign
mars in aries 7th house
i think just about everybody does that in one way or another
driving in a dream usually symbolizes the way your life is going so the fact that youre the one driving and nothing scary happens is a great sign probably indicates that you feel in control of your life people who are stressed about life circumstances often dream theyre driving a car with no brakes for example it being your dads car probably symbolizes having to do some things your dads way or with his permission which makes sense given your age just my perspective take it with a grain of salt
oh thats interesting sometimes i think i might be projecting and its actually me that keeps us from talking about stuff lol i feel self conscious because my circumstances at present are keeping us from being able to progress at any rate its nice to hear that sag moons are capable of getting excited about commitment  the stereotype is so bleak when it comes to sags and commitment
my boyfriend has the same placements and this describes him to a t im curious though how do you feel about talking about the future with regards to relationships hes a sag moonasc so maybe that plays into it but hell talk my ear off about nearly everything  but  the relationship even though all the other things he says and does point to him being as committed if not more so than me
hahaha thats a perfect nickname im a pisces sun so we probably have a lot of the same tendencies i have dreams where im leading a goth girl army whose weapon of choice is literal fireflies flies that zoom into buildings and burst into flames then another part of me dressed in white swoops in and saves the people i like so clearly theres a subconscious conflict within me between wanting to help everyone and wanting to watch it all burn to the ground lol
im a libra rising with pluto in scorpio in the 1st house i make a very cheerful feminine first impression and then people seem surprised when im very comfortable with the darksexualtaboo sides of life i also have very dark brown eyes
its 6 people standing with their arms in the air look at the black space between the womens legs as tall skinny women in a dress and the vulva is a neckhead once you see them youll see two men in between them and men on the far left and right sides
i have costar and use it as a quick reference point sometimes but astroseek is a lot more detailed and will give you more information such as your north and south nodes which imo are some of the most helpful things to know about yourself but i definitely recommend supplementing your knowledge by googling stuff no app or website really covers everything time passages is another great app btw
google venus in aries and read some articles then google venus in the 5th house and read some more the combination of what you read will give you a fuller picture

edit astroseek gives birth charts that include interpretation of both house and sign but its usually a very brief description
from what i can tell it can cause people to be extremely cautious about entering a relationship or even having sex i was in my 20s before i had sex and in my 30s before i had sex with someone else from what i understand thats not uncommon with venus retrograde people i really like sex id just rather be celibate than be intimate with someone i dont feel a strong connection with this thread might be helpful
science is not a belief system it does not rely on hopes and dreams

i completely agree with you which is why im sharing scientific research with you instead of my hopes and dreams i have no idea whether or not pluto or the apparent retrograde  of planets etc affects us neither do you but thanks to decades of research we can say with mathematical certainty that the cycles of the moon as well as some of the inner planets do in fact affect us i dont think you were expecting that so youre pretending like im linking you to pictures of voodoo dolls burning in sage piles rather than engaging with what ive actually written 

i also agree with you that clinging to beliefs is antiscience which is why its disappointing to see you clinging to your belief that planets have no effect on us despite being shown hard data indicating that some of them do i linked you to properly scientifically conducted research on the topic of planetary effects on humans hoping to have a cordial sciencebased discussion  it seems youre more interested in being insulting im not insulted but it feels like you want me to be and arguing against a meme that im in no way trying to defend so i dont really know how to engage with you now arguing on the internet just isnt my thing but lemme know if you ever feel like discussing research and the implications of the results

 btw i checked out your music and youre very talented i also work in film and i used to live in ocean beach
if you believe in science and i suspect that you do then approach this scientifically and see if the evidence supports your hypothesis you stated earlier that the planets moon etc do not affect personality life experiences etc conveniently this is by definition a null hypothesis which means that nearly all the research found here applies to your hypothesis statistically significant meaning that mathematically speaking the correlations cannot be attributed to random chance  evidence rejects this null hypothesis which as scientific research usually does brings up a whole slew of new questions youve already listed some really great ones in the comment im replying to now which is why its a bummer to see you close by restating your belief that its all silly and nonsensical rather than examining the evidence and seeking the answers to your own questions asking questions and examining the evidence is the best approach we humans have for learning about our universe the idea that the earth revolves around the sun was once considered silly and nonsensical too but naturally the scientists of the time kept asking questions and examining the evidence and found it to be true

and fwiw i do understand where youre coming from im 34 years old and up until may of this year i believed that astrology was a bunch of make believe woowoo nonsense and to be fair the socalled astrology seen in memes and pop culture very often is made up written by people who arent even using astrological methods to back their claims but when i ran across an article citing scientifically conducted studies showing that ancient astrological methods can be used to predict certain human behaviors and experiences to a statistically significant degree i had to accept that i might be wrong of course you are fully entitled to your beliefs and fully entitled to disregard any evidence contradictory to your beliefs but theres a lot to be said for keeping an open curious mind without open curious minds there would be no scientists
dreams are often metaphorical but this one might be a little more straightforward perhaps youve been thinking even just hypothetically about having sex and what the ramifications would be in a worst case scenario or maybe youre trying to separate your true feelings about sex from how your parents raised you to think about it just my perspective may or may not be true for you fwiw i grew up in the same kind of household and it took me a while to let go of the guiltshamefears i had about sex but ultimately these types of dreams are helpful and probably a good sign that youre letting go of some obstacles to being yourself
well now youre just being obtuse lol my second link has a long list of statistically significant data on the effects of not just the moon but many of the other planets everything is cited and you can even read many of the studies yourself and see the data if you just feel like arguing knock yourself out but calling research done by phds using blind studies and scientific methods of measurement voodoo makes no sense
in no way does it effect humans emotions or personalities or life experiences 

theres an awful lot of statistically significant data suggesting otherwise heres a very small collection of examples  and more here but theres lots more out there if youre interested
thank you for saying that i hope it helps someone im very glad youre still here 
this made me sad im sorry your parents reacted like that when what you needed  was empathy and support
i hope you feel better soon
this is so cool i cant wait to try it thank you for sharing
it could be a reflection of how you feel youre currently progressing through life for example when people are feeling good where theyre going in life they might dream of driving a nice car down a beautiful road or flying in an airplane lately ive been dreaming of being in a car thats out of control with no brakes so youre not alone lol

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

can you think of anything in your life lately that youve killed it could be a relationship an idea you decided not to pursue a part of yourself that youve suppressed or even someone whos feelings you hurt the fact that you did it without thinking but felt bad afterwards is probably a helpful clue
im so sorry to hear that 
same here and i dont relate to the typical venus in aries description very much im extremely choosy about who i have sex with and rather than lose interest quickly as venus in aries supposedly do ill stick around way longer than is healthy for me

in answer to your question op i think i interact fairly normally but under the surface im a bundle of insecurities for the beginning of the relationship and even once im settled in i have an underlying fear im not good enough ive come a long way but i still need fairly regular reassurance from my partner
thats actually an urban legend and not at all based in factual evidence the universe and i have arrived at the conclusion that youre a six foot tall pile of awesome
i would love that someone posted a dream here like a year ago where aliens invaded and created a test to determine whether she was a real human or an alien in disguise it said what did you do last summer yes or no and she was sweating it out trying to guess what the aliens thought a human would respond that needs to be a meme i still laugh when i think about it
im glad it was helpful and congrats on making big strides forward
im a straight woman and im not even on tinder but samantha has the power to change all that
definitely start keeping a dream journal it will help you start remembering them with way more clarity also check out rprecognition youre not alone
the profile pic in my dream was a little different her pose was less sassy and more fml with her shoulders slouching arms down and she was frowning but i could only find so many options for images of women in coveralls
isnt it crazy i only discovered the nodes a few months ago and i was amazed as my north node is precisely what i had realized that i needed to cultivate in myself earlier this year i showed a friend of mine how to look up his and he had the same reaction best of luck to you we got this
driving  your life path the dream with your high school friends might have been about the path you were on back then 

bridge  connection between things so it could be pastpresent and future for example where an unfinished bridge represents an uncertain future or unclear path to get what you want

busbus station  public aspect of your life journey or the parts of your life that you have less control over 

these are just some possible metaphors to consider dreams are usually little stories we tell ourselves to illustrate how we feel so think about the feelings in the dreams and what they might represent for you personally like the fear of heights you have in the dreams might represent a fear you have about falling or losing control in some aspect of your real life right now
thank you so much
normally i default to the metaphorical method of dream interpretation but this is one of those dreams that feels more spiritualenergy related to me i do think its relevant that youre doing emdr therapy right now if i had to guess id say that youre probably ridding yourself of some yucky energy that accumulated in the time you lived in that house and the therapy is bringing it to the surface to be dealt with so while im sure it was awfully scary its probably a sign of progress renergywork might be a good resource for releasing it just remember that youre safe and in control
would you mind recommending a website ive tried astroseek and the timepassages app but neither of them seem to include north node in their synastry interpretations the person im seeing now his north node is my sun sign which id think would be a good thing but im an astrology newb
how can you tell that hes activating your north node
your sister and i have the same sunmoon placements i agree about the pushover stereotype i think its because pisces are intuitive enough to recognize why someone is behaving badly and empathetic enough to give them a pass if they feel like it like if someone is going off on me about some trivial thing i can see that theyre actually stressedangry about something that has nothing to do with me and it makes me feel like figuring out whats actually bothering them more than getting defensive so from an outside perspective it looks like im just incapable of standing up for myself when actually its a conscious choice to let them off the hook and see if i can help my mars is in aries though so im fully equipped with a temper lol it just doesnt flare up easily
or to run away from peoplerelationships if you feel pressure to conform to circumstances or the partner i love aquarius so i think thats a nice placement however

oh snap thats definitely me i can hang in there for a while i just ended a 12 year marriage that i was mentally ready to leave 6 years ago but i feel very claustrophobic when a partner expects to have a lot of sway in my decisions im still trying to figure out whats fair in that regard 

and i love leos btw i have no leo in my chart and i wish i did theres just a cheerful magnetism in the leos i know that draws me in like a moth to a flame lol im currently seeing a leo sunsag moon which seems to be working out well in that he needs his freedom and respects mine the lack of communication is trying though
secondary characters often represent parts of your psyche that arent fully integrated sex kissing etc often represents the integration or merging of this part of yourself into the whole so for example if youve been working on being more assertive your subconscious might illustrate that with a dream like this thats just one possibility to consider you can try asking yourself what the man represents as you fall asleep and it may be illustrated in a different way with a new dream
my jupiter is in aquarius in the 4th house of all my placements ive probably looked into that one the least im still not sure how it manifests in my life my venus is in the 6th house and opposite the ascendant within 35 degrees according to timepassages would that be considered wiggle room mars opposite ascendant within 45 degrees i dont relate to the venus in aries descriptions very much i never knew why but what you said about the double negative and directing the typically outward tendencies onto oneself is interesting and got me thinking mine is 22 degrees so from what i understand if i were to pick up on the tendencies of another venus placement itd be taurus but i relate more to the venus in pisces descriptions
hey cool im a libra rising too i wish i could take credit for the chart analysis but it must have been someone with a similar user name im still kinda new to astrology but im glad another your friend or mary grace out there was helpful ha

my lilith is also in aries as is my mars both in the 7th house and conjunct my venus it occurred to me recently that in all my major relationships theres been an ongoing power struggle where my independence and need for autonomy is perceived as a threat to the relationship im also very choosy about who i have sex with to the point of long periods of celibacy even though i have a really high sex drive i dont even know why but i just cant do causal sex and im happy with how i look now but its been a loooong road to get here
how do you feel like it affects you im a retrograde venus in aries
ive forgotten several including the big one that seemed to cause some major glitches in the following days i take it as a sign that my jump was so successful ive just forgotten the previous timeline 
you can find out right now using this free calculator once you know what nodes you have google north node in  and read a few different sites to get a good understanding 

if you do locate your chart it should also tell you what houses your nodes are in which will give you even more insight into your souls journey
i love all of this shes very artistic but she has a short attention span so i think something that requires figuring it out as she goes would be perfect and hold her attention better thanks so much for the suggestions
this is so fascinating i absolutely give in to her wanting to quit things all the time and i would say ive been doing less discipline than id planned im a softie pisces sun lol but i can see how it is more helpful to her in the long run to teach her perseverance and responsibility now thanks for taking the time to respond its really useful stuff
wow its really good you brought this up because her dad and i are very recently divorced so theres lots of changes happening and my tendency is to keep her out of the loop unless its a big obvious thing that needs to be discussed but shes so observant that i find her asking questions that she wouldnt be asking if she hadnt already picked up on a lot of what is going unsaid thank you
if youre open to astrology calculate your birth chart and see what your north node and south node is theyre commonly known as karmic parts of the chart with the north node being the traits you should develop and the south node being what you need to overcome for example my south node is in scorpio which indicates my past lives have been dramatic and probably full of controlabuse issues this is reflected in my past life memories and has been true for my current life as well and my north node is in taurus so im meant to learn how to be in control of myself alone and build a stable enjoyable life for myself
i suppose it comes down to a matter of belief but personally i believe that our loved ones animals included can use the dream world as a vehicle to come check in on us and let us know theyre still around i had some very memorable dream moments of conversing with my granddad after he died as did several other people in my family who were close to him 

im sorry for your losses and hope it helped to be able to see them again 
this is so helpful and encouraging thank you it definitely sounds like her she loves to paint and seems to have a knack for learning languages my challenge with her is that she is very interactive she doesnt like to entertain herself and wants me to be engaged in everything she does and she wants to do a lot so im always looking for ways to keep her busy so she doesnt feel ignored when mama needs a minute 
im so sorry to hear that 
my 5 year old daughter is a gemini sun and moon pisces rising would you guys mind sharing your parenting tips what helped or would have helped little you thrive and feel supported growing up
im a pisces sun and a capricorn moon i consider it a blessing because the practical downtoearth cap qualities help me regulate my spaced out pisces tendencies
youre the best interpreter of your own dreams so the following is just my first impression take whats helpful and disregard the rest

seeing her in a gritty fast food restaurant  this was not a healthy or nurturing relationship

resembling someone you dislike  seeing with new clarity the aspects of her that didnt jive with you

all black clothing  endings closure

holding a baby  new beginnings 

fwiw i find its pretty normal and common to dream of an ex once you find a better partner when youre still single and searching it can be harder to process the emotional impact of a past relationship and harder to see it clearly too youve found someone more compatible which makes it easier for your brain to sort out what was wrong before think of it like selftherapy its possible you woke up after did you ever love me because thats not something you can really be certain of either way 

hope that helps and best of luck with your new relationship 
the hot and cold thing
ok thank you for the straightforward feedback i definitely dont want to change him i guess i just wanted to understand if this is his true nature or if im just not someone he feels safe opening up to or what
hes a leo sun not positive but i think hes an aquarius rising no aries in his main planets but a neptune in scorpio venus in gemini yes to the temper tantrum letting it go quickly though the tantrums have so far been directed at people he feels are being tricky or unfair and not at me he does get jealouspissed at the thought of guys hitting on me though
i i am so glad you told me this thats the opposite of my natural reaction lol thank you but what if he never brings up anything thats bothering him like ever until eventually hes so fed up about something that he wants to end things and its something i could have made better if only id known
does anyone here have advice on getting a sag moon partner to open up about his feelings or at least admit to having them
thats amazing if you havent already looked at the research into past lives i think youll be surprised how much evidence there is to support it jim tucker is a great place to start

that being said i find its helpful to think about it from the perspective that regardless of whether or not the memories are real these images and storylines came from your own subconscious mind so theres something in olivers experiences that you can learn from or relate to in this life i did one of those regressions and had vivid recollections of being a really sad and sexually degraded woman named marnie who married for money and then spent the rest of her life depressed and bored out of her mind ive always had a strong desire to marry for love respectown my sexuality and make my own living and maybe those hard lessons marnie learned are part of the reason why or maybe its just a story my brain told me to illustrate how i feel either way it was helpful
thanks for the update how would this affect someone with their venus in gemini
i dont know  but i do think it gets easier with practice for me the mental diet definitely seems to be helping that being said last night i found myself worrying again haha so im still learning
im reading this 44 minutes after you posted it
im so sorry for the things you never got to experience with him i bet hes so proud of you he cant stand it
first of all im really sorry youre feeling this way  

id suggest you start by manifesting better selfesteem imagine that youre happier and more confident in yourself than youve ever been imagine that youre turning heads when you walk into the room or getting compliments that make your day  whatever feels like a wish fulfilled of being a confident person to you just leave sp out of it as much as possible for now and when you do think of him try to simply intend that hes happy and fulfilled too i know its not easy and definitely give yourself a grace period of processing that anger but it will help you in the long run to work towards genuinely wishing him well in life with or without you 

once youve got that selfesteem up then work on the sp by then you may not even be interested in getting back together but if you are youll be all set to have a healthier happier relationship
sat  state akin to sleep but im not sure how it might be translated into the books youve read its the method of getting very relaxed but still awake and visualising the end result of what you intend to manifest 

sp  specific or special person its not a neville term as far as i know its used by people who have a particular person usually someone they know like a friend or an ex they want to date
damn thats exciting youre a badass and you got this
there ya go perfect step one for your new formula i like being subscribed to  rhydrohomies because its like a wholesome drinking game for me lol if im scrolling reddit and i see one of their posts i stop and drink some water it also helps me to keep a reusable water bottle i can carry around with me its a little annoying to keep up with but thats part of what makes it an effective tool for remembering to hydrate once you get used to the wonderful feeling of being well hydrated for a few days in a row i bet itll become a habit the mental clarity alone makes it worthwhile not to mention youll start to look and feel more healthy
without any specifics its hard to offer advice but generally speaking i think starting with small changes in the way youre going about life can get the ball rolling go to bed thirty minutes earlier tonight drink a little more water than usual tomorrow say hi to that neighbor you usually dont speak to
kind of depends on the context of the dream but it often represents some new or underdeveloped part of yourself could be an aspect of your personality thats ready to grow or even an idea youd like to see brought to life feel free to message me if youd like some help with anything specific from the dreams
usually overwhelming emotions maybe youve been through or are in the midst of an emotional experience the good news is that you either made it through or youre well on your way to making it through 
oh man thats a lot of stress to deal with and i think its understandable that youd feel totally overwhelmed by it but its also the kind of thing that a few years from now you could be telling a new partner or friend or colleague about and theyd say what you did that and laugh their ass off because it is so out of character for the person theyve come to know and love one of my favorite people in my life is a guy who got duis and stole shit in his younger days even spent some time in jail and now hes so damn accomplished and successful and happy that i a relatively successful woman with two kids look up to him a lot 

point is as bad as this may seem it is really and truly okay and you can get through it and come out the other side with lessons learned and a hell of a story try and cut yourself some slack were lucky to have you here and i really hope you stick around 
i often dream of my friends as a representation of some part of myself and sex dreams can often be symbolic of mergingintegratingaccepting two or more disconnected parts of yourself it might be helpful to think of the first thing that comes to mind when you think of each friend 

for example lets say kevin is really comfortable in social situations a dream about having sex with him might be your subconscious minds way of illustrating that theres a part of you that can also be comfortable around new people and you can integrate it
you would probably find rastralprojection very useful youre already halfway there
i think first and foremost you should follow what brings you joy that being said real love in my opinion doesnt involve trickery and confusion and demands of loyalty its just freely given to you as you are im wary of anyone or anything that expects you to jump through hoops to meet their needsdesires it sounds like both these fellas have you in a rather vulnerable and confused place even as they may say its for your own good you are all you need to be empowered and vibe high
i dont know that theres anything we can be 100 certain about in this realm of existence thats part of the adventure but you might find it helpful or at least entertaining to do a past life regression meditation on youtube i saw myself in vivid detail as a humanoid cheetah looking being from another planet who decided to come here to spread love and light the revelations about that life and what i was like before continued to come to me through dreams and meditation for about a year afterwards regardless of whether or not its true it all came from my subconscious mind and really helped me know myself better as well as refocus my energy and refine my goals for this lifetime
i havent experienced flips with anything but fruit loops and it seems to flip every few months for me
this reads like a message from you to yourself that you can be more assertive its all started with you saying yes to a date not because youre dying to go but because you dont want to be rude and then you stay in a very uncomfortable situation because he told you to you only get freedom in the end by doing what you want and need to do in spite of the guys orders it seems like a horror story about being passive in other words 

but thats just my interpretation and i might just be seeing it that way because i tend to be way too passive and im working on being more true to myself
gotcha thank you for clarifying were probably going to have to agree to disagree here but personally i believe holding fast to love and light is the only way to fight the dark responding with violence only begets more violence and round and round it goes nothing new about that i also believe that respecting the free will of others is essential to being truly loving and as such we cant really wake people up we find our own way when were ready
ok but what does fight mean to you as in physical violence
what do you mean by fight
is that across the street from the thinkery
four years ago at the time there were a lot of sightings reported around there and iirc there was a group of austin people who would meditate together at night in manor because it always seemed to summon ufo but i should have said it used to be a hot spot as i dont know how many have been spotted there as of the last couple years
manor seems to be a hot spot for ufo i saw one there on my 30th birthday
keep googling them theres an article for just about every number you could possibly see but know this the idea of good and bad numbers is a human concept angels will only send you love and encouragement i get 43 pretty often and i like the last paragraph of this interpretation as it often crops up when im overwhelmed by the clutter in my home or workplace

edit oops just realized you said 42 not 43 but hopefully something i said was helpful anyway
can confirm am the wife
interesting that they chose to live as the person they dont remember being i would rather continue living the life i remembered and as a family member id rather be around the person who thoughtactedremembered as the person i knew than be with a virtual stranger who only looked like my loved one
thank you
dreams of having a baby are often about birthing or in this case losing a part of yourself i think its interesting that the baby looked fake to you my guess is that the baby represents some aspect of yourself that you lost in the process of datingbreaking up with him the fact that youre not very sad about it and it didnt look real to you in the first place maybe suggests this part of yourself and wasnt a part of who you truly are 

just something to consider if it doesnt resonate disregard
happy birthday
this is a synchronicity for me i had a strong urge yesterday and this morning to lie in the grass and get some sunshine i felt a little bad about it both times because my brain was so quick to remind me that theres chores to be done gotta get ready for work etc but yesterday my 2 year old seemed to read my mind and ran into the back yard and stretched out in the grass smiling i followed suit and then did it again this morning that little bit of spontaneous relaxation just for the pleasure of it seemed to set my whole body and soul on a better track

oh my never knew about this before but its super intriguing thanks
i think so too and i wonder if the magnetic pole shift believed to have happened many thousands of years ago may have messed up earths frequencies or messed up our ability to receive them ive also wondered if this is where the tower of babel story comes from people working together to build something suddenly lose their ability to communicate and have to invent languages amongst themselves
youre welcome so glad to hear it was helpful i relate to that very much especially the fear theres always a dozen whatifs that stop me from doing things that i know would serve me and others well we can unlock those chains i believe in us 
mindless activities like riding the bus can put you in a hypnotic state much like meditation so it could have been some subconscious imagery coming through not unlike a dream it might help to think about it metaphorically bikes are used to move us forward is there a metaphorical bike youre leaving chained up when you could be well on your way to somethingsomewhere else could be a spiritual emotional or even literal journey youre ready to go on when i was ready to go back to work after having my baby but i was nervous and hesitating i started dreaming of cars stuck in a garage

it might be helpful to do some imagination work with the end result in mind imagine your excitement in telling your mom how everything is going at work imagine how you feel a little nervous on your first day imagine a year from now when you are welcoming a new employee and remembering back to when you were the new guy 
i had an interesting conversation with my husband the other day that prior to learning about the me would have turned into an argument lol we were discussing some decisions we made over the summer and the motivations behind them without going into boring detail basically the way i remember his motivations are completely different from the motivations he remembers not only having but discussing with me at length before this would have angered me and i would have thought he was delusional but seeing how me has effected us both differently some of the differences being cultural stuff that has happened since weve been married i feel like theres really no use trying to insist that im right about how i remember him feeling we might just be coming from slightly different timelines 
ohhh i get it now that makes so much sense thank you for clarifying gonna try it tonight

thats really sweet  one of my coworkers was telling me recently that his wife watched the andy griffith show every night at the same time after she passed away he was watching a game with his friend neither of them touching the remote and the channel flipped over to the andy griffith show not once but twice they were really in love and when her cancer got really bad she told him before she died that she would do her best to let him know she was saying hi from the other side he had a lot of cool experiences like this  

ps so sorry for your loss hope its a comfort to know hes never really gone 
its usually a good thing a sign that youre discovering new or long forgotten parts of yourself the windows might represent that this part of yourself gives you a new outlook on life or the world around you

probably so the subconscious tends to tell stories to help us work through whatever were consciously thinking about you might really enjoy taking something like meyers briggs to help you get to know yourself better i was in the same boat trying to figure out who i was without the outward influences and it really helped me to take this and read about my type if the first result you get doesnt feel like it describes you very well try this one 

hope that helps 
re your post title you might find it interesting to check out the recent research coming out on the nature of our dreams it would seem that they are often meant to be helpful in processing our emotions and experiences 

anyway i think the finale of the dream is quite interesting because bathrooms are where we tend to our most private business and in dreams they often represent the same thing but youre in a public bathroom which seems to be a hint that this is symbolizing a private element of your life that is difficult to keep under wraps the costume or rather pretending that you are wearing a costume makes me wonder if theres some part of yourself or your personal life that you try to disown in front of others

but you are the best interpreter of your dreams since you alone know whats on your mind and whats happening in your life if any of this was helpful awesome but if not please disregard 
asking for help is an act of strength not weakness theres nothing pathetic about it and the sooner you can accept that the faster youll be able to make some strides this has been the biggest lesson ive had to learn this year and its tough its sad because we come into the world as little babies who are completely dependant on others for survival and we accept this about ourselves naturally but over time we internalize messages about being independent and forget that humanity wouldnt have survived nor would it continue to survive without relying on each other its natural and human to need help and by asking youre giving people like me a chance to experience the joy of lending a hand 

another thing i see in your post is the negative spin youre putting on your life story i have failed at many things as well but thats just one way to look at my life i could just as easily frame my failures as many different things ive had the opportunity to learn the story we tell about ourselves is very very powerful and sets the stage for our future so look again at your life experiences and think about how much youve grown what youve learned what lessons and experiences youve had that you can utilize in your new chapter 

i also recommend taking a personality test that can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses i really like meyers briggs  which of course is not perfect but has really helped me to understand myself and how i best fit into the world 

okay i could go on and on but the most important thing i wanna say is that you are doing great housing debt wealth and all other forms of material success can never ever tell us about who you truly are you were worthy of love and acceptance the day you were born and you didnt bring a dime with you  the same is true for you now even if it doesnt feel like it i love you and im proud of you and  im here for you anytime 
dreams like this usually represent neglecting yourself in some way water often symbolizes emotions so perhaps you have some emotional cleaning out to do the big dangerous fish could represent anger sadness or some other feelings that are affecting your wellbeing 

of course this is just one possible interpretation thoughts

i have similar dreams about trying to protect my daughter from critters and other dangers i think its just a symbol of the anxiety we feel knowing that we cant protect our children from everything dangerous in the world
i just want to say how terribly sorry i am for your loss  i know that pain my first pregnancy ended in miscarriage and its a heartbreak i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy please give yourself time to grieve and reach out to me and anyone else who is willing to listen you are not alone and you never have to be im here for you anytime 
the grungy mirror likely represents not being able to see yourself clearly floods almost always symbolize an overwhelming level of emotion this could be a current situation or something from the past but typically if its set in the past there would be some indication of that in the dream which there doesnt seem to be the person trying to stop you from mopping up the water could be a lot of things think about who or what in your life is an obstacle to sorting out your feelings it could be a representation of some part of yourself that avoids working through difficult times 

the finale is a bit difficult to guess could indicate that the overwhelming emotions are workrelated but honestly im not sure 

does any of that help
the nasa solar page is down as are a bunch of other observatories 

ps truthfully i do hope its aliens 

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

ive been following this as well and one of the main reasons people have been skeptical about it being related to the sun is that other solar observatories around the world are still up and running interestingly that no longer appears to be the case list of solar observatories going offline 

very curious
i take it as a sign im on the right track i think we live in the midst of infinite timelines and repeating signs that feel positive are basically a function of the more optimal timelines
happy cake day friend thanks for sharing this great picture of your handsome pops and uncle 
you are an amazing artist this is beautiful
the most effective tip ive found is setting the intention as youve already done by jumping and carrying on as if its already done think about it like placing an online order you trust that it will come to you but you dont expect it to show up instantly or order it again and again you just place the order and know it will be delivered 

it also greatly helps to put it out of your mind as much as possible and when you do think of it practice feeling grateful for the thing youve asked for in other words think im so thankful that i get to have  rather than why havent i gotten my  yet 
ahh fair enough well i wish you the best of luck and if i can help you with your experimentation lemme know 
i think your belief in it working is pretty helpful so going into it expecting it wont work may manifest exactly that  not working i wouldnt advise you plan on trying again for the same thing rather do your best to expect the jump you already did will work that being said i typically wait at least a week between jumps 

more gradual methods can be found at rlawofattraction or rnevillegoddard ive had success with both but mostly prefer these over the jumping methods 
loving and forgiving people brings you much greater joy and peace of mind than holding onto your frustrations and pain easier said than done i know but worth the effort every time
narwals are not a fictional creature
i used to coordinate weddings brides and grooms were 10x easier to deal with than the parents of the couple tended to be moms of the bride and groom ime are very nervous about everything going well and end up being a huge nuisance trying to control everything and worrying about stuff for no reason

my most successful two cups jump ever was for more creative ideas maybe try jumping for business ideas
i was in high school learning about the french and indian war little did i know my future husband was in college also learning about the french and indian war pretty weird but we have a lot of these synchronicities from before we even met and many more since then 

i just remember feeling really sad and wondering if it would have a bigger impact on american history than the french and indian war 
i was walking through my apartment complex on a rainy night there were lots of snails on the sidewalks and i stepped on one this caused me to scream and become frozen in fear of crunching another one it took my husband a while to convince me to start walking again and almost as soon as i did i stepped on another snail rather than get stuck again or ya know watch where i was walking i decided to make a run for it crunching snails and screaming all the way home 
st johns wort its otc and remarkably effective also just taking good care of myself even or especially when i dont feel like it specifically i try to have at least one green smoothie every day so im sure i get at least 45 daily fruits and vegetables getting out in the sunshine exercising several days a week limiting my internetscreen time and making time to do creative stuff this is not medical advice by any means but personally i took antidepressants for years and they werent nearly as helpful as all of the above also finding friends who arent judgmental and will listen to my problems and empathize ive been fortunate to find a few online and irl friends like this and its lifechanging 
the smell of chlorine and sunscreen public libraries american girl stuff i often feel nostalgic around 4pm because it was my favorite time of day as a child i would get to eat snacks and watch pbs 
thats so damn cool my spiritual journey was kickstarted in a single evening early 2013 and its hard to explain just how radically lifechanging a moment like that can be when talking to someone who hasnt experienced it how awesome that yours was during an ellipse and yes please do pm me i love to chat about this stuff 
i like to meditate and beforehand i set the intention of receiving any kind of help that comes from a source of love and light however i dont think theres anything you have to do other than be willing if youve ever woken up in the morning with a new insight or just been walking along and suddenly had a revelation or clarity about a problem thats what i would consider a download 

for me days with big energy shifts or upgrades often make me feel super restless like i need to run sprints or something and in the days following i often find myself having enormously helpful dreams about my emotional life sometimes i make unplanned changes for example on 8818 which is sometimes called lions gate i suddenly lost all interest in eating meat others found that their habits and addictions were suddenly much easier to kick 

now that youre aware that these things often come in waves youll be able to make note of your own personal symptoms its different for everyone yet theres a lot of common experiences 
id love to hear about your achievements if youre comfortable sharing  i think its really cool you live in ireland i spent the summer in dublin one year and loved it my kids are only 4 and 2yo but i hope they grow up to travel and have different experiences

as for always being the one to reach out first i feel ya try not to take it too personally people are busy and caught up in the day to day world and just dont take the time to reach out sometimes it doesnt make you any less valuable or important in this world 

i love you and im proud of you please feel free to pm me anytime you want to chat 
yeah the subconscious mind is pretty cool were all different yet we dream in a lot of the same or very similar metaphors and symbols when im feeling vulnerable or exposed in some way i usually dream that im in the shower and people are just walking right in the bathroom to talk to me
this is so awesome what program do you use
the best way to make them stop is to figure out what theyre trying to tell you even stressful dreams nightmares etc are your brains way of sorting through the emotions and situations youre faced with starting school back can definitely be stressful but it could be something from your past or even worries about the future that are surfacing 

if you feel like sharing your dreams or even just some of the recurring themes id be happy to help out  
front yards usually represent the way you present yourself to others or how you feel like youre perceived toilets are typically used in private so having to use one on the lawn would seem to be a metaphor for you feeling like your privacy and personal business are exposed think about what in your life has madeis making you feel vulnerable and it might help you hone in on what your subconscious is trying to help you with
we really are my friend i love how the internet enables us to find our kinds of people 

i couldnt agree more about the monetary system i really believe well evolve out of it or it will simply collapse at some point in our lifetimes in the meantime im sending you abundance vibes with all my heart were gonna make so many people happy with our random tips gifts and donations 

edit another thought i had that seemed to come from somewhere greater than me if i really want to peacefully disrupt the system and i do what better way to do so than to open myself up to greater abundance and redistribute it myself it seems obvious now but it was a revelation when it came to mind yesterday 
you got me thinking with your post so thank you as well its funny you mention the financial stability  ive been having this realization over the past 24 hours that i dont need to be broke to be a good person not that theres anything wrong with being poor in fact i think guys like jesus and ghandi are in part why i have been afraid to accumulate money but for now i see that getting to the point where im not worried about the bills and actually have enough to take care of myself and others would better enable me to give freely and use my gifts of service its a wildly different perspective but it seems like im getting the message that being financially strapped is actually keeping me in a place where i have to think about my needs more than i would without financial stress i think too that i need to learn to trust myself im terrified to turn into a selfinterested rich person who is negligent in the needs of those less fortunate so i keep myself in a situation where im always busy trying to make ends meet which isnt really helping the less fortunate either 
the silver triangle 
i havent had the chance to watch your video yet but your title is a little synchronicity for me as ive had the phrase you cant pour from an empty cup running through my mind lately i have two children 4 and 2yo a husband a dog a cat two parttime jobs friends and family who have their own emotional and practical needs i try to fill the list goes on and i can do a lot but i tend to be selfsacrificing to the point where i simply dont take the time to nourish myself or get enough sleep 

i used to consider taking care of myself as service to self but i no longer see it that way i see that getting adequate nourishment and rest putting on clothes that make me feel confident instead of schlepping around in whatever i pull from the drawer first exercising getting out in the sunshine and putting on makeup or earrings or whatever else feels fun that day these things allow me to open my arms wider and work harder for others 

to me the only real difference is intention im refilling my cup so i have more to pour out not so i can keep it full and set it aside just for me

as for the darkworkers thing i actually never heard that term until this week but it perfectly describes my pastlife memories on a spaceship and essentially what i do best in this life i seem to have a knack for walking right up to the bad guys and diffusing situations breaking up fights etc which is kind of funny because im tiny but when i first ground myself in love and light i am somehow able to gently talk down angry men who could chuck me across the street if they wanted to lol but it is essential to do so as though they are my beloved brothers  because they are

so i consider myself a lightworker i just thrive in the presence of darkness and transmute it the best i can
this sounds like a game i would have played all day you should try rtipofmytongue  
i am so very sorry this happened i have been the first person to drive up on the scene of a fatal accident and it was horrible i was so upset i couldnt sleep all night  im glad youre reaching out to us and i hope that you can make peace with this as for what the universe is telling you dont stress about it if theres a lesson in this im sure it will be clear to you in good time 

please know that theres no shame in your feeling that you wanted no part of it its a horrendously traumatic thing to witness and our brains are wired to avoid trauma you managed to override that fight or flight reaction in order to call 911 on her behalf and thats all anyone could ask of you 

i love you and im sending you all the good vibes i can please feel free to pm me if youd like to talk about it youre not alone 
when this happens to me i like to stare at the palms of my hands sometimes i pretend im a character that just morphed into the body im in and im seeing my own hands for the first time come to think of it this is a much weirder thing that i do than the other thing i posted in this thread 

anyway it zaps me back to the present moment and its almost surreal sometimes like i suddenly feel more alive 
i take it as a sign im on the right track i think we live in the midst of infinite timelines and repeating signs that feel positive are basically a function of the more optimal timelines
im sorry im always here for you if you wanna pm 
i work with moderately famous people but the nature of my job means never talking or posting any details about it lest i lose my job 
the sheer number of great ideas for art products and businesses that come to my mind every day and i almost never do anything with them 
when you said it generated energy something clicked in my mind because when i saw the shape turn into a structure being built i felt it had tremendous importance and ive read theories that structures like the pyramids were made to generate energy and maybe even create portals or open dimensions 

tell me what you think about this image its a recreation of what the great zimbabwe ruins looked like and how they were being used in the 1500s and the people who lived in them at the time said they didnt build the walls they were built in ancient times using unknown technology heres an aerial view 

edit another potential clue looks an awful lot like a cell its got the nucleus and everything diagram 
really i was hoping someone would recognize it truly mindblowing how we share these things it makes me feel so thankful for the internet and the opportunity to compare notes 

tell me about the waves does it feel like the shape is creating the energy somehow
i dont feel bizarre but i did have an awful lot of energy both physical and mental all night long couldnt sleep a wink i wrote this to a friend at like 3am because i couldnt stop thinking about it 

theres this little mystery shape ive had in my minds eye since i was a tiny child maybe 3 or so i knew this shape so well that id constantly see it in clouds patterns textiles everywhere pareidolia but instead of a face i see a 2d twotone shape that looks something like this 

 the feelings i have at the sight of it even today are like a deep recognition and a sense of nostalgia which has always mystified me because what even is this how can i recognize something i dont remember

and then one day whilst meditating about two months ago i saw it appear in my minds eye and then transform juuuust a little bit into a birds eye view of an ancient building being constructed with ancient people working together just a super quick 8 bit quality glimpse with the implicit knowing that it was ancient

i dont know what any of it means but its jolting to have a sudden development after 30 years of having no idea what i was looking at

in addition to the meditation and suggestions already offered it might be helpful to look up some common dream interpretations of the basic elements of these images or even just contemplate and do word association with yourself 

knights make me think of armor and therefore protection but being in a coffin makes me think of the death of some form of protectionarmor many different cups makes me think of hosting or communing with many people or having an abundance of domestic resources but having them on a shelf behind a knights coffin makes those things feel less than accessible thats just my brain though needless to say it may not be remotely close to what your own self is telling you
aww i think its sweet if she was an awful person in life id totally find it sinister but it sounds like she was lovely and just wants to be in the familiar for a while longer 

im so sorry for your loss op i hope you find it comforting to know her essence is still with you 
is it okay if i post something i more or less agree with because i think paul sabotaged jesus message on purpose
im not op but id be happy to try

that lpt has a surprisingly sad ending 
this post is turning into a karma goldmine  thanks little bots maybe the last few days of downvotes were just their dark night of the code 
i like to imagine them having little bot protocol meetings 

dammit qp295 you gave uqueenameliafox 18 upvotes were downvote bots dude downvote bots now get back out there and fix this mess 
woah 18 upvotes in 2 minutes did the downvote bots have a sudden change of heart this is hilarious and awesome  

also excellent post its something ive been thinking about a lot the past few days i notice that often when i make peace with the situation im in i actually end up progressing out of it much more quickly 
i used to live in that neighborhood that blue eiffel tower looking thing is adjacent to sea world and everything else is just a large grassy area
okay thanks for letting me know i definitely dont mean to be condescending so i will think about how i can do better 
im sorry i bothered you just sharing my thoughts love you bro 
what did you guys do with them

also this is excellent rwritingprompts material
i dont claim to know how it works but i can elaborate in case its helpful i was telling myself that everything would be okay no matter what and trying not to focus on the money so much as the goal of having our needs met in fact my husband got the email  about the money almost immediately after getting off the phone with a family member we were considering moving in with so in a sense it came through the minute we gave up weird 
manifested 3300 that we were previously told wouldnt be available for many years it came when we really needed it without us even trying it was crazy like some law changed and the funds had to be released to us immediately 

my body has changed quite a bit too though tthats more of a lesson in be careful what you wish for lol i used to be athletic and pretty thicc but i desperately wanted to be skinny and petite like a ballerina through a years long process of getting sick depressed anemic etc im now so small and skinny that i often hear you should eat more i used to daydream about being told that and now it really bums me out im at the gym trying to put on muscle and eating as much as i can trying to get my booty back haha so yeah i think its all attainable just make sure you have goals youll be happy with longterm
im sure hes a great guy and thats probably why hell still be your friend after this personally im much happier now that ive grown into friendships where we dont poke at each others insecurities for fun life has a way of making us feel like crap about ourselves all on its own at best friendships are a welcome break from that not an additional source of it just my personal perspective friend to friend 
whoever you are the fact that your friend would post something like this tells me that you are someone who is so awesome that people will go out of their way to try and put you down 

dont let em you keep being awesome and dont let goofballs like op get you down 
you look like kristin cavallari
no problem i used to live in socal and took about a million visitors from back home to see the walk of fame lol theyve always looked this way in my timeline but im curious what others remember 
grey slab pink star gold letters and an icon for the type of media the celeb was best known for ex a camera for film stars

nothing wrong with feeling compassion imo there are no bad guys just lost wounded and confused souls who dont realize theyre just pawns it is sad
im really sorry about your dad i hope youre hanging in there 
im so sorry you went through that i cant imagine  sending you hugs and lots of love

im gonna copy and paste the thing i wrote in an ask reddit thread about alien abduction

not an abduction but i saw an alien in my living room about a month ago  he was blue with an enormous mushroom shaped noggin i didnt feel afraid though as he looked strangely familiar like an old friend i thought to myself why am i seeing this guy and the answer was telepathic saying you made some deals before you came here i understood this to mean that i knew him in a past life and had done him some favors so he was going to help me out in this life in some way then he disappeared

it was bizarre obviously but somehow really comforting i actually got emotional thinking about it the next day

i had a series of past life dreams after this that were intensely vivid they felt more like memories than dreams i never saw what i looked like but all my friends looked like the guy i saw in my living room we lived on a spaceship that was small but expandable like additional rooms could just kind of materialize at the push of a button

the feeling i had with them was total love and support we were workers who spread love and light everywhere we went we zipped around and took meetings with aliens who worked for the dark side so to speak we never fought with them though we just used a kind of telepathy to determine if they were willing to work with us and maybe even become less dark if they were i or one of my buddies would teleport to their ship and negotiate

eventually i got bored and wanted to try something harder so i heard that the planet earth was in trouble and needed volunteers to come and spread the light by being loving and forgiving i was told that id need to be careful not to hurt anyone i thought huh why would i ever do that its hard to explain but the dimension or atmosphere of this place i was in made it really easy to be loving all the time i was really naive like i couldnt possibly understand how much id be hurt in this life and how much id hurt others as well they tried to tell me but i just couldnt comprehend it and i was too excited about the adventure of it all

the idea was that theyd basically upload my consciousness into a baby and my next memory is being in the womb already able to sense how painful and difficult it is to be here thinking oh no i dont want to do this anymore but it was too late the dreams came to a screeching halt after that but i dont mind because if and i realize thats a big if this is at all true my focus needs to be on this life i chose and work i signed up for

edit interesting side note my whole life ive had a recurring thought that i wish i hadnt been born id have this thought a lot even in the happy times but ever since i saw my old friend and had all these dreams ive found myself thinking that im glad i was born honestly this all feels very real to me but either way its been a blessing
long answer pregnant women dont lactate unless theyre already nursing another baby milk doesnt come in until a few days after the baby is born before that what comes out is a sticky clearish substance called colostrum which is easier for the newborn to digest and contains the nutrients it needs most 

short answer shes most likely got a breastfed baby at home 
under the umbrella tree
my four year old and i were painting a picture together and i had to briefly stop when her baby brother woke up from his nap i told her id be back in a few minutes and that she could play on the ipad in my absence she typically jumps at the chance to play on the ipad so i thought nothing of leaving the paint out as i hurried off to the kids room big mistake

angered by the sudden motherdaughterpaintytime interruption she proceeded to paint all over herself the floor two cabinets and my grandparents antique pie safe 
yeah great minds think alike 
i cant speak for your mom but i really just want my kids to be happy if getting marriedbeing in a relationship wouldnt make them happy i sure wouldnt want them to fake it on my account she might just be talking about it under the assumption thats what you want you know 

at any rate youre perfect just as you are 
im so sorry  i hope things get better for the both of you soon
thinking about it metaphorically do you feel like youre unable to get control over some kind of situation in your life maybe you cant say what youre really thinking to a boss or family member food often represents nurture maybe you lack nurturing environment in your life and have to take what you can get in terms of feeling loved and cared for im not sure to be honest but thats what comes to mind at first glance
im so sorry  and im glad youre here 
i am so very sorry for what youre going through  it may encourage you to know that theres thousands and thousands of accounts of loved ones reaching out in this way letting their families know theyre okay i experienced it myself after my grandfather died science tells us that our brains operate in 11 dimensions only 4 of which are we currently able to observe and measure so theres an awful lot to our consciousness that we dont yet understand but that doesnt mean its not happening once upon a time there was no credible evidence for radio waves or electromagnetic fields  i think our consciousness is eternal and just like the internet doesnt cease to exist because your laptop dies we go on long after this particular body were inhabiting here is done 

im always here for you anytime please feel free to pm me sending lots of love to you and your family 
that was a dick move on their parts for sure but fwiw the way you turned him down so politely tells me youre a really good person i hope you findfound someone who deserves you
hey there lots to unpack here but ill do my best to help the first thing that jumps out at me is a recurring theme of overindulgence too many chocolate covered strawberries public masturbation taking things too far with the girl you werent engaged too etc the subconscious tends to use metaphors to illustrate things so it helps to think about what reallife situations and feelings might be symbolized here 

obviously theres a lot more going on in these dreams but that seems like a good place to start does that help 
i actually laughed out loud thanks for this one
i like to google angel number x with x being the number i saw and see what if anything resonates but off the top of my head 4545 is interesting from a numerology perspective because in numerology you add single digits together and then if you end up with a double digit number you reduce it to a single digit number by adding the individual digits together 

so 45 9 and 4545 18 and 189  basically any way you slice it youve got a pretty potent 9 there in numerology 9 is associated with the end of a cycle and old things falling away to make room for the new given all youve been through this year that seems pretty apt 

i dont know if thats helpful but if nothing else maybe itll give you a fun rabbit hole to fall down 

ps im so sorry for all your troubles hang in there theres brighter days ahead 
you dont pee on the whole stick lol just the cottony part that sticks out of the very end which is then covered by a plastic cap 
you can request that some of your birthday or christmas presents be donations to a cause you care about especially if you tend to get gifts you dont particularly enjoy 

but you shouldnt feel guilty be thankful you were born into abundance and thankful that you have opportunities to pay it forward i think its lovely that you recognize your good fortune and want to help others 
this is really lovely thanks 1889 man for inspiring me to be a better friend 
i can understand you being disappointed but i can also understand wanting my kids to have as normal of a childhood as possible and be able to just focus on family time when taking them places it would suck as the kid to feel like your parents career is always going to be a priority
this makes me happy i love kith and especially scott
yes waited on them in this context means they served them a meal or drinks at a restaurant i can see how it would be confusing since waited on them could also mean it took time for them to arrive
sometimes i listen to binaural beats or a meditation track on youtube but most of the time i just lie still and focus on relaxing my body from the feet up then i mentally repeat  loving phrases starting with i love myself this is a tricky one for me because i tend to dwell on my mistakes and i dont usually feel like i actually love myself at first but i keep repeating it until it feels good then i focus on my love for my family and friends much easier and finally everyone in the world and the universe after that i try to let my thoughts drift off unless some other affirmations come to mind by then im usually sinking into the deep waves and thats when the tingling and vibrating begins sometimes it causes me to come back up to a fully conscious state because i get kind of excited lol and i have to remind myself that its normal and i can let go 
i often experience this in meditation and light sleep cycles to me its like im subconsciously conversing with my angels and its a normal occurrence in that state but of course once i wake up im often left wondering what we were even talking about and the vibration thing often accompanies the chats i especially feel it in my neck and face 

sometimes ill remember key points or suggestions that are really helpful and encouraging other times ill only remember something random and seemingly nonsensical but it will make sense later this morning i could only remember them telling me something about tiny bears lol so im excited to discover whatever the heck that was about 

all of the above being said its a good idea to meditate on love and light a bit before going to sleep or meditating as i have also had the strange experience of some less benevolentfeeling interactions as well 

tldr i have no definitive answers but i know what you mean 
aww your mama sounds like my kind of person my best friends mom always said were making a memory in the same contexts i think its a nice way to look at things
im so happy youre okay i was quite sad to see you not yourself you get infinite love and forgiveness from me always everyone here does please take good care of yourself 
i had sleep paralysis once and it was a demonic cat trying to suffocate me it sucked i felt that it had this intense hatred for me i really dont know if these sleep creatures are actual demonic entities or what but its certainly not fun to experience 

the dream itself feels more metaphorical to me as dreams often are can you think of any reallife parallels the coworker may represent an aspect of yourself maybe something you do as way to escape something you cant otherwise avoid for example if you dont like your job but you cant quit the job itself could be represented by the person chasing you the fainting coworker could represent calling in sick does that help 
i think god is everything and nothing can exist outside of it because it is existence itself to be anything is to be god the source of everything i think the idea of god having personality and individuality is a manmade concept devised for various reasons heres a post i wrote here quite a few months ago which is about an experience i had which blasted my last remaining christian ideals about god out of the water well except for the god is love part that part absolutely still rings true but thats just me ultimately you have to find the truth for yourself and you may discover something different  
think about it symbolically and what barbie might represent to you subconsciously if you liked playing with them as a kid maybe its a symbol of carefree childhood joy thats just out of reach or maybe its about trying to live up to a certain image or standard of beautylifestyle and feeling like other people do it better does that help
dreams are most often symbolic and the subconscious attaches or in this case doesnt attach emotion accordingly so in this dream id guess that its really about killing some part of yourself associated with that person as a way to grow

for example maybe your mom has been a little too pushy about your career choices a dream about killing her wouldnt need to feel sad because letting go of her input and listening to your own life goals would be a helpful thing for you hope that helps but if not let me know
  true spirituality and drugs are polar opposites

im one of many people who was using a psychadelic when my life changed forever i was going through a really hard time and one night i smoked some weed and was crying out asking the universe god something to give me a reason to live then it hit me like a ton of bricks that love is the answer to life the universe and everything i knew it was true to the core of my being and it set me on a path of awakening that has continued sans drugs for five years now ive had equally profound experiences in sober meditation so i dont mean to imply that drugs are necessary at all just that some of them can and do provide a little window or cheat code into 5d that can spark enormous spiritual growth 
i sure try to be that kind of person everyone needs help and support sometimes ive been lucky to have people on reddit cheer me up when i needed it and im always glad to pay it forward 
check out rprecognition  this is a very cool and surprisingly common thing
gosh that must have been traumatizing im so sorry

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw

im really sorry youre dealing with physical disabilities and some bad luck but youre right youre a survivor and you can and will cross the ocean  i hope you have a good day too and please feel free to reach out any time 
 i dont know you but i have a feeling youre being way too hard on yourself wanna pm me and we can chat i dont have all the answers but ive hit rock bottom and bounced back to a better place more than once and id be honored to be a listening ear 
this sounds like a disagreement or misalignment between your conscious and unconscious mind youre consciously creating positive thoughts and so the icky stuff comes out of hiding to be dealt with it sucks but ultimately its a good thing because dealing with the icky stuff will allow you to feel consciously and unconsciously better about yourself

try to identify the thoughts and feelings youre having just before the selfhating thoughts pop up chances are youre experiencing shame guilt or some other difficult emotion and thinking i hate myself is a sort of mental escape hatch to avoid processing those feelings once youve identified the trigger face the source of those feelings headtohead and work through them forgive yourself forgive the situations that have hurt you or caused you to hurt others and keep up the positive affirmations

i love you 
hold up what happened with the dead body did you call the police

ive had some glitchy stuff happen after doing the two cup method but it was harmless stuff i wouldnt fault yourself for that persons death or your fils job loss unless those occurrences could somehow move you closer to your goals i really doubt theyre related i second ucoolchic101 suggestion though neville was awesome and his method is much more gentle
i think our brains subconsciously store just about everything sometimes ill have a random flashback to eating at a certain restaurant or hanging out with an old friend and then when i look back at my journal or a photo i took ill discover that it was exactly a year or many years ago its pretty cool were all a lot smarter than we consciously realize 

ps happy cake day 
im far from family too and ime ditching social media has actually made me feel more connected to them i actually have to call or text them which enables us to really talk about our struggles and hopes and stuff rather than the superficial level of interaction via social media 
i wonder if it would help to have a rprecognition link somewhere visible im fascinated by prophetic dreams and ive had one myself but since theres a whole sub dedicated to them and a lot of the dream posts here are precognitive it might cut down on the quantity if there were a link 

that being said i do enjoy the dream posts here
im sorry friend  theyre very lucky to have you around hang in there 
when my mom wants to listen to a song she just turns on the radio and says lets find it and most of the time she does its like she just knows itll be playing even if its an old song 
weird i definitely feel like theres an energy shifting tonight but for whatever reason im feeling pretty great everything feels more real somehow like im immersed in the present moment more than usual its interesting how these things hit us differently 
some of my favorite movies are the ones where the character has a lot of sadness and difficulty to overcome it would be a pretty boring movie if everything was just sunshine and rainbows from start to finish think about harry potter his parents are dead he lives with his emotionally abusive aunt and uncle and his bullying cousin then he gets into a magical school only to find out that teachers apparently hate him and some really powerful guy wants to kill him but thats why we keep watching because we know these challenges are what make it an epic story and its not the end yet its not the end of your story either and i for one would like to keep watching 
sense of adventure gentle gets excited about stuff willing to consider other peoples perspectives and either change his mind or respectfully disagree ive been married to a man like that for 11 years and hes awesome
oops thanks

edit your bio made me laugh keep up the okay work 
please listen to me i know it probably just seems like fun and spooky entertainment to interact with these different energies but it isnt a good idea at all until our technology advances enough to detect other dimensions its almost impossible to know for certain what exactly youre inviting in but regardless its almost certainly bad juju 

i might get roasted for taking you seriously because a lot of people havent had the experiences weve had but look  theres far more power and beauty in the love and light kind of energy and it offers real love and protection far better than whatever bullshit a is peddling you need to get rid of the tools youve been using and issue some firm but loving commands to them go away and repeat as needed and if youre still spiritually curious and i hope you are check out subs like rsoulnexus or rastralprojection or rluciddreaming and seek out some positive metaphysical experiences  theyre much more fun i promise 
what can you remember about them are there any recurring themes the subconscious mind tends to create nightmares in effort to help you consciously process emotions that you may be suppressing i had nightmares nearly every night for years until i learned how to understand what they were telling me im happy to help you with this if you feel like sharing youre welcome to pm me as well
the first lecture is just a long rambling monologue and its impossible to tell whether or not what theyre saying should go in your notes 
think about what the old man might represent within yourself for example a dream about killing a greedy person might mean youre trying to be more generous does that help
theres nothing wrong with wanting to be around people im not an extrovert by any means but too much alone time makes me feel crazy and kinda sad after a while i think its good and even important to get out of the house and talk to people we have a light to shine after all  

and dont do what i did and carry on for ages assuming that youre alone im amazed at how many people i meet that are every bit as awake as i am uber drivers homeless people baristas theres a lot of people waking up and have been for a while just gotta give them the space to feel like they can open up 

in the meantime im always here if you want to chat 
just to clarify i didnt mean to imply that 1010 bullies were bullied as well though i did say most ime kids and grownups who truly feel good about themselves and their place in the world tend to want others to feel good too and sadly the reverse tends to be true also

at any rate you sound like a wonderful teacher and im very glad that lil guy found his way to you 
sure seems likely to me im so sorry about your pup i hope youre able to take the time you need to grieve sometimes i find that just listening to a sad song really leaning into the feelings id typically try to avoid like sadness and letting myself have a good hard cry makes a big difference
this typically represents a situation where youve felt you had to kill some aspect of yourself for example maybe the loved one you strangled is a very funny person irl that would mean youve had to stifle your sense of humor lately does that help
i love you with all of the hearts
i bought a day pass to the swimming pool for myself and my kids so my life will have a lot more chlorine and floaties 
im in 
 consider how you should act with young children saying i love you every time they misbehave would be a terrible thing to do to them and it would be deeply and genuinely unfair to the other kids who may be suffering at the hands of unchecked bullying 

far be it from me to tell you how to parent but in my personal experience as a parent and teacher i have found the opposite to be true when my 4 year old yells at me responding to her with love and compassion is absolutely the most effective way to help her see that shes wrong i used to try and oneup her by being very stern tough love and all that but it only served to create more anger and frustration ive learned that by responding with love and compassion shes infinitely more willing to listen to what i have to say apologize and do better

as far as bullies go 1010 times they are acting out of insecurity and most of the time they are being bullied themselves often at home its not a disservice to the children who are being bullied for a grownup to let the bully know he or she is loved its the surest way to help them see that they dont need to hurt others to feel good about themselves 

none of the above has be in place of consequences or in place of explaining to them what they did wrong its just a whole lot more likely that theyll actually listen and want to change if they first feel that they are worthy of love

hmm if your so is willing it might help to join forces on this and speak your instruction out loud remember to instruct not request some people recommend burning white sage around the house as well also check out the spiritual lessons in the sidebarcommunity info as theres some specifically for protection if it persists let us know sending you all the good vibes  
the sense im getting is that the energy is less than positive dont be afraid of it or angry towards it just ground yourself in love and light and issue a firm instruction to leave your presence think of it like a neighborhood kid whos out late and needs to go home youre the adult here and you have the power to send it away

whats the thought process behind that myth its very confusing
typically yeah but some womens bodies are just like lets do this and labors can escalate very quickly with my first baby i was just chilling breathing through spacious contractions like a champ got in the tub to clean up before heading to the hospital and suddenly my contractions were less than two minutes apart my second baby came so fast that i was still gathering up my phone charger and toiletries when i felt him move down and the urge to push was so strong i couldnt walk to the car we had to call for an ambulance and within minutes there were five firefighters surrounding my bed strategizing how to get a stretcher down our narrow hallway lol if we have a third i might have to either camp out at the hospital for the last couple months or deliver it myself 
please tell your grandmother i said thank you for sharing this lovely little glimpse of her life with us 
im gonna have to take a pass on the fusion but thanks just the same and ill keep a steady stream of love and light headed your way  and im glad it was helpful

is there anyone irl you could reach out to maybe go for a coffee or something i dont know what your social life is like but for me staying inside with my own thoughts and energy can get overwhelming and confusing its important to keep a steady footing in the human world and it might help to get out of the house and do some normal stuff every day just a humble suggestion  
hey buddy things seem to be a bit muddled and confusing in your communication lately are you okay i know youve been struggling with the job search and as someone in the same boat i just wanna say that youre not alone and youre worth so much more than a job could ever encompass im sending you lots of love and light and i want you to know that im thankful for the encouragement youve given me here so many times please dont forget who you truly are you have a gift for offering clarity and support to those who feel lost just remember to reach out when you are in need of the same you dont have to have all the answers none of us do and thats why were here im always here for you k  love you brother 
i care about you 
awesome please do report back i wrote creatively unfulfilled on one and creatively fulfilled on the other i recommend doing it at night i think it helps to go to sleep with the expectation so your subconscious can adjust without the distractions of daily life have fun 
doughnut shaped
out of the thousands and thousands of people ive interacted with online ive become close friends with three of them two of the three turned out to be infjs lol i do think its a subconscious thing on some level because i was drawn to one of them long before she said anything particularly infjlike but it also makes sense that wed be drawn to people with similar values 
if it makes you feel any better participation wasnt exactly voluntary
its really up to you but the original method recommended using as few words as possible and waiting about a week between jumps 

btw my very first jump was for new creative ideas and i went from a two year streak of no creative inspiration at all to keeping a notebook with me all the time because the ideas just kept coming 
be grateful that you were able to help someone who needed it and trust that the universe will repay you with or without that persons help if you focus your attention on that specific person repaying you you shut out the infinite possibilities of the money coming back to you some other way
resonates as this days energy has been reminding me again and again that i came here to help others i get so lost in the concerns about how to pay the bills how to explain myself to others that i forget how simple my mission ultimately is
im feeling all sorts of shaken up about some conflicts with my parents some financial issues and what feels like a setback in my life and dreams its hard to know where to put my focus and i keep internalizing a lot of guilt and shame but i dont know what to ask exactly general guidance

thank you so much for offering 
how did you feel about what you were doing i had a dream where i was trying to distance myself from some girl who was shooting up and for me it was about trying to distance myself from some bad habits i have not heroin lol my habits are legal but still damaging
i think we all use it all the time because its basically just the energy we send out coming back to us eventually but i focused on the belief that the job i really wanted was mine and even though i didnt hear back from them for weeks i got the job another time i was running late for a flight and the line for security was so long there was no way i was gonna make it but i focused on the belief that i would make it and suddenly a tsa agent walked out of a side door and opened up a new line making me have to rush to get my shoes off because i was suddenly second in line 

ive also manifested money creative ideas and more feelingsbased things like confidence
the thirty minutes or so before and after my babies were born 

helping a woman get away from her boyfriend after i saw him throw her up against his car felt pretty good too im tiny but for some reason he backed down when i told him to 
trying to get somewhere in life like
whats your favorite number 

what is one of your happy childhood memories 

what do you miss the most about having both legs 

also and i know this isnt a question but i love you and im glad youre here 
give the homeless man more than 3 and some chicken nuggets because hes gonna start telling you that youre a blessing and a light that youre gonna be okay and hes gonna make you feel like you are worthy of being happy so much that as you drive away youll start crying with gratitude and have to pull over just to compose yourself its worth every penny you have on you just to experience the wholesome encouragement of someone who has been through much worse than you yet found peace and joy in just being alive 
thank you for sharing this ive been having to look at my financial situation and face the fact that ive been irresponsible and impulsive its painful and i have a lot of shameguilt about money that keeps me repeating the same patterns its really nice to see that im not the only one having to look at myself and my actions and take stock of the changes to be made i have a tendency to think that everyone else has it all figured out and im the only one screwing up 

i also see that the blame ive been placing on others is actually disempowering me making me feel like it cant be helped and that by owning my mistakes i give myself the agency to do better tough stuff to go through but my hope is that by doing so im preparing for the brighter days ahead
i love you both 
this is good advice it also helps me to remember that i can never know the full story behind someones motivations i tend to take things personally that might have nothing to do with me using your example maybe people at your sisters church make her feel guilty when she doesnt go maybe shed actually rather help you but shes afraid of being made to feel bad at church maybe she needs the unconditional love you give her more than youll ever know so your being kind about her saying no could be really healing for her and help her stop caring so much what the church people think of her obviously i dont know your sister or her situation so this is a hypothetical but youre right and thank you for sharing 
trading its something we can start doing on our own and allows just about everyone an equal chance to use their skills and work with what they have i dont know how we can upend the money system in a big speedy way but i think looking for every opportunity to simply stop using it is a great start i once coordinated a wedding for a massage therapist who gave me treatments after each planning session and totally fixed my jacked up shoulders we both felt like we got a great deal 
that is a common and enduring myth im not saying you should hate on them just that theres really no such thing as a job anyone can get they only hired 62 of applicants in 2011 and now theyre rolling out automated cashiers so theyll need even fewer human employees 
holy yes batman this is huge i was told anger is just justifiable selfrespect that wasnt allowed to express itself in time and i have found it to be true i tended to bottle things up until i exploded often hurting people who werent even the cause of my real pain they were just triggering the same feelings i had tried to suppress for far too long if this sounds like it could be the case for you as well i really recommend the book selftherapy by jay earley just reading the free introduction sample on kindle was kinda lifechanging for me and others whom ive shared it with 
i dont claim to know anything but my feeling is that the event is an ongoing process of our collective human consciousness expanding and our steady gaining of awareness about the true nature of ourselves and the universe for a great many of us it started soon after the end of 2012 and i think it will continue to gain speed throughout our lives and beyond 

so personally i dont anticipate a single day in which everything dramatically changes i think thats perhaps a 3d expectationmisunderstanding that crept into the general public because people correctly sense that things are changing and correctly sense that somethings coming but our limited human understanding of time leads us to get excited about it happening all at once but when i think about it in all the billions and billions of years of eternity a few hundred years or so of awakening on a single planet might as well be all at once does that make sense just my perspective and i may very well be wrong

as far as the burnout goes i dont think theres anything at all wrong with focusing on the down to earth stuff as long as you are tending to your own well being in fact i think getting too swept away by the spiritual chatter can be a frustration and distraction sometimes because everyones experience and purpose here is different its ultimately about discovering and utilizing your inner voice your light and your mission here and that right there is best done in my experience by drowning out everyone else and just letting your truth arise in its own time

i hope that helps and if not thats okay too just know that youre loved and cared for by me and many others and youre doing great 
one possible interpretation is 54 so the number nine its the number of endings making way for new beginnings

man its been bananas for me too i havent done a tarot for myself lately but my angel card readings  have been pinpoint accurate and yesterday umajorarcanamonk did a reading for me that was super helpful and even echoed some of what my angel cards and dreams have been telling me to a very attentiongrabbing degree 

ive started documenting the batterytime number synchronicities on my phone for example ill have 33 battery at 1022pm and theyve been off the charts on wednesday i had nine of these syncs and today im already up to four 

ive also been having really intense dreams mostly about emotional baggage related to money family and other crap im ready to let go of now its not exactly pleasurable but i know its a good thing in the long run 

the biggest thing im noticing today is a very strong urge to nourish myself i have struggled with disordered eating in the past and even though ive come a long way i still tend to skip meals or just eat a bit of something on the go but today ive been happily going after fruit fruit juice and all the water its nice

happy birthday 
wow your second paragraph is extremely similar to this remote viewing of mars circa 1 million years bc which was conducted by the cia in the 80s soooo fascinating 

i dont have any answers for you but i know somewhat how youre feeling i just keep trying to be a light in my day to day life and meditating hoping to be the change i wanna see and all that 
i have so many questions its hard to choose so either general guidance or why am i feeling unmotivated or is there something i can do to speed up my manifestations dealers choice ha and thank you as always for sharing your gifts here 
holy cow dude congrats this is all kinds of inspiring thank you so much for sharing your story

your weapon against light

 huh
ha this is timely because i just did it before checking in here i woke up before dawn due to a really upsetting nightmare about my current situation i walked into the living room and sat down with my phone opened the music app and asked if i made a mistake if the choices ive made that lead to this situation were a mistake i got three little birds by bob marley

woke up this morning smiled with the rising sun three little birds by my doorstep singing sweet songs of melodies pure and true singing this is my message to you dont worry about a thing cause every little thing is gonna be alright

i let it play all the way through and the next song on the shuffle was rhapsody in blue which has long been synonymous with adventure to me and i even used to listen to it in the early morning hours the last time i felt like my life was falling apart id kinda forgotten about it


fwiw ive had encouraging and helpful messages from music for a long time and personally i dont attribute it to this sam but rather my own angelsguides if you try again it might be worthwhile to ask for communication with only those who come in love and light 
remindme 6 months
i dont want other people to know either but what amazes me is that when i do open up i find that im sooo not alone nearly everybody save for a few very lucky people maybe have needed help from time to time and even wealthy people worry about money because they have loans that are overdue or stocks that crash or because their pal has a bigger summer house lol 

for me my fears about money are tied up in worrying that i wont spend it wisely once i have it or that ill get cocky and stop caring about people who are struggling or that ill only make enough to get on my feet but i wont be able to sustain it etc basically a lack of trust in the universe that im gonna be okay today and in the far future but im gonna be okay and you are too 

im gonna set a reminder and well check in with each other in six months i bet well have all kinds of amazing new things to share

im in the same boat as you and an affirmation kinda popped in my head a few days ago thats really been helping me money is a tool some need it some dont either way is fine 

i dont know if that helps but its allowing me to shed some layers of shame and to be okay with needing some support right now and i think that shame and fear is the thing thats been holding me back from going for things
i prank called my dad using one of those soundboard sites i was shocked by how completely unimpressed he was like uh huh yeah thats tom hanks voice got it made me see my dad in a different light i guess id never realized hed lived a whole life complete with pranks and shenanigans enough to be bored by my feeble attempt 
thats adorable
i like to keep an open mind so i dont have firm beliefs about this but the one that i been contemplating a lot lately is infinite timelines basically at any given moment were living in one of an infinite number of timelines and shifting into different ones constantly without realizing theoretically then mandela effect glitches maybe even ghost sightings would happen when we shift a little further than usual creating discrepancies in our experience of reality 
forgiveness takes a lot of strength but its so damn powerful for me it helps to remember that believing that others deserve forgiveness creates a universe in which im worthy of forgiveness too and goodness knows i need it sometimes 

it also helps me to remember that everyone has their own unique path and its not going to look like mine and thats more than okay once upon a time i mocked people who meditated and now its a huge part of my life i thought everyone else was an asshole for years before realizing that i was just as much of an asshole  point is people are going to let us down but it doesnt mean theyll never change  and actually being truly kind to them can be the very thing that sets them on the path towards change probably more than youll ever know 

just my perspective keep what resonates with you and disregard the rest 
you got it i hope you enjoy your new job 
same here i remember when it was so tiny and the love and light of it was so unique and still is that it felt really renegade but full of joy like little kids running around playing without adult supervision  gosh i love this place 
me too also the way my 4 year old uses the ipad is so wholesome it hurts she would facetime her friends every day if she could but since other people are sometimes busy she also loves to play roblox with me and her dad learn how to do magic tricks color by numbers and fire up some tunes for impromptu dance parties

i dont know why people think its an eitheror situation she loves being outside reading books painting going places technology is just an extension of the things she enjoys its not at all a replacement
some say horizontal stripes are unflattering but i think he looks very handsome
one time my husband and i took our two little ones on the train to downtown we got off the train one of us holding the 3 year old and the other pushing the baby stroller and walked past a guy who said look at that dad of the year right here i just had to laugh 
thats so thoughtful of you i dont know what teens are into these days but i think anything you do will be appreciated maybe a gift card to the neighborhood pizza place or a little themed gift basket like for for a family moviegame night
i think we exist in a stream of infinite timelines and for whatever reason they are merging and collapsing at an increasing rate so theoretically the moment you remembered playing that game with your sister would be a moment in which a timeline where that did happen folded itself into this timeline 

ive experienced this as well and i know what you mean by the memory feeling just out of reach i think its because its more like a memory of a memory your brain is trying to reach into a void where that timeline and all its events were once held but theres nothing to latch onto which creates a weird cognitive dissonance along the same lines ive had sooo many glitchy things happen to me which at the time were completely shocking yet ive noticed that unless i write them down immediately within a few days i cant even remember what happened 

at any rate welcome to this timeline i brought you a cookie 
wow this is exactly what i needed to hear its remarkable how well it fits thank you so much youre very gifted im indeed at the end of an era in my life and i think my blind spot has been thinking i need to check in with everyone else before trusting what i already know my heart is telling me thanks for the empowerment 
unless youre in desperate need of the money id say cut your losses and definitely cut contact he may be withholding the money precisely because it keeps you in contact with him if you really need the money pursue it through a third party if at all possible

at any rate im glad youre safe and sound
considering that you explicitly stated you didnt want him to replicate the story i understand you being upset i can also understand not being totally over it and ready to celebrate as if you have nothing to be upset about

however as someone who has been married almost 11 years i highly recommend taking a minute alone to scream cry kick a pillow whatever you need to do to release your frustration and then try to move on and enjoy your evening hes apologized hes trying to make it up to you and a good marriage is one of forgiveness youll be the one apologizing for something sooner or later so extend the grace to him that youd like to receive

also plan your next anniversary birthday etc together its a lot of pressure on your spouse to have to come up with an evening youll both enjoy and placing the responsibility on both your shoulders will prevent a lot of potentially disappointing celebrations

ps congrats on your one year milestone
hey there thank you for sharing your perspective abraham hicks is fully entitled to his opinion as are you personally i dont disagree with the possibility you speak of but i also think theres not a singular correct way to look at dreams our minds are too big too varied and theres no way to say with absolute certainty that a persons dreams are always made for one specific purpose 

i have found that after i set a new intention i tend to have vivid dreams set in my past for a few days and lots of emotional conflicts that bubble up i think its because as i adjust to the new reality im creating i have to address and release some old fears and feelings that would otherwise keep me tied to the old reality 

anyway thats just my two cents and if it didnt resonate with you thats okay i certainly did not mean to be offensive or frustrating to you and if i was i sincerely apologize 
i help people interpret their dreams and i lovingly disagree about nightmares predicting the future they certainly can be prophetic but far more often theyre a reflection things that youve already been through and feelings that your subconscious is still trying to process if you or anyone for that matter would like to pm me a dream id be happy to help you hone in on what your subconscious is trying to bring to your attention 
so cool i had something similar happen where i was meditating and a strange phrase popped into my head i googled it and it turned out to be a lucid dreaming technique id never heard of it never tried to lucid dream i have no idea where that phrase came from at all and soon after i had my first lucid dream its like my subconscious mind was trying to get me to try before i ever consciously considered trying

anyway i dont know how these things work i just know that youre not alone and sometimes we somehow know things before we know them 
when we first looked at our rental house it was late at night wed just found it on a rental site and wanted to see it in person before calling the property management company the next day our soontobeneighbor was freaked out by our late night appearance and walked over to yell at us being super rude and confrontational i remained calm acting as though i perceived her actions and words to be friendly i wished her merry christmas told her it was nice meeting her smiled etc the way i would have if she really were coming over to make friends 

the next time we saw her she was every bit as friendly as i was pretending she was the first time we became friends for real and she ended up being the person who petsit for our animals when we traveled shed bring gifts for my toddlers birthday and baby gifts when my son was born we love her and she and her wife love us 

tldr acting as if is a powerful tool ive been successful in transforming peoples anger into kindness many many times this is just one example
thanks for the offer any insight into my blind spots things i may benefit from paying attention to etc would be lovely  i cant shake the feeling that im missing something 
what did he call the other leg
love this idea  i got two very positive workrelated emails this week one letting me know id be paid a day early which was sent at 333pm and another offering me an ongoing gig which was sent at 1222pm 
i got a concussion a few years ago and when the paramedic asked me if i remembered who the president of the united states was i had a flashback to the scene in this movie where he says its jimmy carter and then they know somethings wrong

i have this too theres multiple realities i visit at night and the main thing they have in common is that im married to my same husband but we have no kids which is interesting because we spent the first 6 years of our marriage not planning on having kids but changed our minds and now we have two 

the one i visit the most is like a cross between hunger games and the amazing race were racing alongside others through forests and rivers but it doesnt feel fun or even remotely safe it feels like were just trying to survive but with all the alternate realities its like you describe theyre continued storylines and being there always feels normal complete with a memory bank for that particular reality

i have a halfbaked theory that our souls or consciousness travel to these places at night and learn lessons like an extra credit or night school program for the things were meant to learn in our daytoday reality
dimetapp was delicious
i have news for you thats called an episiotomy and its very real and very common 
let us know next time ill bring drinks
oh its real the cia has declassified multiple documents containing extensive research and experimentation on the phenomena concluding that its not only real but a valuable tool heres just one of many such documents you can find on their site this one  is far more in depth but absolutely fascinating 

i hope you enjoy the chance to expand your mind once upon a time i thought this stuff was hogwash too im glad i was able to accept that i didnt know everything about how the universe works because its pretty fucking magical and i was really missing out on some cool experiences 
 hugs
im so sorry that happened to you 
i love you 
general guidance would be greatly appreciated as im at something of a crossroads in my lifethank you so much for sharing your gifts 
my 4 year old watched a video about continents recently and asked me which one we were in when i told her we were in north america she thought it was amazing and jumped off the couch and said look at me im standing in north america you gotta try this so i stood up and yelled im standing in north america too its actually really fun and i would recommend it to anyone in any continent

hey look at you go youve manifested a reply so you can find this later
yes love has my back i am gonna make that my affirmation today thank you 
i think youre exactly right  weve been feeling like we should move and reach for some new thingsgoals for a while now but kept on maintaining the status quo i love your perspective and i hope this is just the end before a much better beginning 

i took your advice and sent a message to the coworker i was concerned about and she was perfectly understanding about my mistake i suggested to my boss a way of avoiding the confusion next time and he thought it was a great idea by the time i left they were both praising my work so i couldnt have asked for a better resolution next time ill do it before i leave to avoid a restless night thanks so much for your wise and very kind words

im so sorry for what youre going through it may not be much but fwiw a random internet stranger is thinking about you and your mom today 
id suggest asking your subconscious that very question today and just before going to sleep ask yourself who is this man and how can i make peace with him intend to have a followup dream about this and give it a few days keep in mind that the followup dream may consist of entirely new storylines and symbols so feel free to check in and share any dreams you may have and ill be happy to help 
 awesome im so glad to hear it was helpful

 is the buying of gambling chips in any way notable it dawned on me we didnt actually gamble we just kept buying chips

 yes its almost certainly symbolic of a recurring behavior mentality or something along those lines dreams arent big on filler content ha its probably worthwhile to try a little free association with the various elements of the dream and see what first comes to mind 

for me gambling immediately calls to mind the word risk but in this case the real risk is in not gambling youve already bought the chips so youre better off playing and possibly winning than just continuing to stockpile chips perhaps the chips represent some leverage or asset youre not using to your advantage in the dating game or at work perhaps you are comparing yourself to others and feeling like your metaphorical pile of chips are inadequate thereby making you feel unworthy of the relationship or career you desire 

just a few things to consider 


in the dream world your house represents yourself as a whole person taking a shower is symbolic of an emotional cleansing forgiveness spiritual renewal etc its significant that you saw this man before you got in the shower as it would seem to indicate that he represents something or someone who is keeping you from undergoing the emotional and spiritual cleanse that you need its entirely possible that this man is an internal part of yourself its also interesting that he is doing his own thing he isnt actually hurting you but youre afraid that he will 

i dont think this is about your potential relationship exactly it seems more like your subconscious trying to draw your attention to some fears or perceived threats that are holding you back if that doesnt resonate let me know and im happy to help you examine some other possibilities 
i have experience helping people interpret their dreams and would be happy to help you with this one can you provide all the details you can recall including the setting characters colors emotions you felt and so on 
buying the chips because the other women were suggests that youre caught in an undesirable feedback loop or that you arent being true to yourself in some way the subconscious mind likes to cast an additional character for each part of yourself that it wants to illustrate so its likely that all three women represent parts of yourself since your subconscious chose single friends specifically it may be a feedback loop within yourself that is keeping you single

the business cards are interesting because you left them in two stacks two is often used to represent the idea of a relationship you put out cards that dont direct people towards yourself but rather your uncle by way of a job he doesnt  even like this seems to be indicating that youre either not putting yourself out there at all or youre putting yourself out there in a way that is ultimately directing people away from you 

dream interpretation works best as a collaborative process so do let me know what does and doesnt resonate with you and im happy to help you hone in on what your subconscious is trying to process 
wowwwww dude i cant even tell you how much this applies to me right now theres two loved ones in particular who deserve my love and support right now but ive been withdrawn and i dont know why thank you so much 

also i got your message at 1111am and theres 33 comments in your post time for me to pay attention 
general guidance please thank you so much for your kind offer 
thanks for taking me seriously i felt pretty selfconscious posting this i  dont remember what the deals were exactly but i had a series of  past life dreams after this experience that were intensely vivid they felt more like memories than dreams i never saw what i looked like but all my friends looked like the guy i saw in my living room we lived on a spaceship that was small but expandable like additional rooms could just kind of materialize at the push of a button 

the feeling i had with them was total love and support we were workers who spread love and light everywhere we went we zipped around and took meetings with aliens who worked for the dark side so to speak we never fought with them though we just used a kind of telepathy to determine if they were willing to work with us and maybe even become less dark if they were i or one of my buddies would teleport to their ship and negotiate 

eventually i got bored and wanted to try something harder so i heard that the planet earth was in trouble and needed volunteers to come and spread the light by being loving and forgiving i was told that id need to be careful not to hurt anyone i thought huh why would i ever do that its hard to explain but the dimension or atmosphere of this place i was in made it really easy to be loving all the time i was really naive like i couldnt possibly understand how much id be hurt in this life and how much id hurt others as well they tried to tell me but i just couldnt comprehend it and i was too excited about the adventure of it all 

the idea was that theyd basically upload my consciousness into a baby and my next memory is being in the womb already able to sense how painful and difficult it is to be here thinking oh no i dont want to do this anymore but it was too late the dreams came to a screeching halt after that but i dont mind because if and i realize thats a big if this is at all true my focus needs to be on this life i chose and work i signed up for 

edit interesting side note my whole life ive had a recurring thought that i wish i hadnt been born id have this thought a lot even in the happy times but ever since i saw my old friend and had all these dreams ive found myself thinking that im glad i was born honestly this all feels very real to me but either way its been a blessing 
gosh im gonna sound completely insane but fck it not an abduction but i saw an alien in my living room about a month ago  he was blue with an enormous mushroom shaped noggin i didnt feel afraid though as he looked strangely familiar like an old friend i thought to myself why am i seeing this guy and the answer was telepathic saying you made some deals before you came here i understood this to mean that i knew him in a past life and had done him some favors so he was going to help me out in this life in some way then he disappeared 

it was bizarre obviously but somehow really comforting i actually got emotional thinking about it the next day 
winona ryder it has no effect on my life except for randomly being told i look like winona ryder from time to time

ps i like your style
beautiful thank you for sharing my brother has autism and i am a better person for having grown up with him he got a job bussing tables and my dad had to teach him about paying bills because he just wanted to give all his money away  im so glad you and kyle found each other 
ueateroflife283 remotely viewed you order food last week you picked your side and it was mashed potatoes 
youre welcome and its not a dumb question at all its normal to second guess things especially when feelings are involved i hope you have a good time on your date 
i sort of naturally believed in the loa as a child for example my mom took me to see the play annie when i was about five years old and i became obsessed i pretended to be starring in annie all the time and would practice as if id already been cast when i turned 10 just the right age for the part i saw an ad for annie auditions in my hometown newspaper and i got the part 

rediscovering the loa as an adult i found it harder to act as if but i basically use the same techniques of imagining myself in the scenario i intend to manifest so far so good 
youre welcome im only able to offer this advice because i struggle with the same things and becoming aware of it has been helping me a lot you got this 
when my daughter was three she used to tell us all kinds of stories about when daddy was a little boy always from the perspective of an adult i tried to ask her about when mommy was a little girl and she said she didnt know she also said that her baby brother was her brother before but he was a girl 

youd probably enjoy checking out rpastlives if you havent already theres some cool stories there 
i believe you mac have you read about the mandela effect 
you and op should check out rprecognition  youre definitely not alone
and i just read this comment at 1133 
i manifested a very positive conversation with my boss i really like him but he was a jerk recently and it was pretty upsetting i focused on projecting love and forgiveness towards him until the next time we worked together and the whole drive to work that morning i tried to feel grateful for the best possible outcome of the situation 

truthfully i wanted to tell him he was wrong but something in my mind told me that i should ask what i could be doing better instead so i did and he immediately responded with an apology for the way hed acted said that it wasnt my fault and that hes very happy with my work i cant even tell you how unlikely it seemed that hed ever acknowledge he was a jerk much less apologize im so thankful and surprised it was also a learning experience for me to keep an open mind about people and to stay humble and be willing to be part of the solution rather than assume theyll never change 
i really like all of rgarbagedolly advice heres a few things that jumped out to me in your post and responses

unnecessary limitations theres a lot of ways to make money besides being a massage therapist or a server so starting your own business doesnt have to be an allornothing situation unless you make it one try and open yourself up to many possibilities for earning a living and see what comes up because the possibilities are endless i have a part time job a small business and a hobby that sometimes pays and i love this combo because its never monotonous and i dont have to strictly rely on any one thing in order to have income ive also found that even though the jobs are in fairly different fields i still get clientscontacts through one job that end up being business for another

negative motivations its hard to get excited about something if theres shame attached and theres definitely some shame in the motivation to finally get out of your parents house it has the implication that youve been there too long you should have reached full independence by now etc which are making you feel bad every time you think about this goal thats supposed to bring you joy youre doing great and theres no real shame whatsoever in living with family at your age so try to focus on moving out for the most fun and uplifting reasons 

externallyplaced identity i get the impression that you feel like you need money success a home etc to feel like youre enough but you were worthy of existing on the day you were born and you didnt bring a single one of those things with you the same is true for you now it just doesnt feel like it because of over time were conditioned to think the most important thing we can do is make money theres nothing wrong with the goal of financial success but please dont measure your worth as a person that way you have much to offer just as you are and were all lucky to have you here 

i love you and im pulling for you keep us updated as you experience the sunrise in your  new beginnings
i dont think youre crazy but i do think youre freaking out for no reason  theres no chance ive been pregnant the past month and ive been seeing 333 like crazy our reality is an unpredictable place so i would ease up on the assumption that this is a sign youre having a baby ime its more likely to be a little pat on the back saying youre doing great you are loved than a prophecy

that being said the thing i recommend the most is the power of positive thinking believe that if you have another child it will be a very special child that has been planning to be with you since before you were even born believe that you will have more than enough resources and time to raise another little one believe that you are in the middle of something so much greater than yourself 

we were practically homeless when i got pregnant with my oldest and for a month or two i wasted so many tears worrying about how things could possibly work out we had to move to a new city and get different jobs etc but in the end we were able to provide for her better than i could have imagined not only that but the sacrifices we made in order to take care of her ended up putting us in a far better position to reach the very goals wed been trying and failing to achieve for years we thought we needed to hit all these goalposts before we could have a baby and it ended up being the other way around so take a deep breath and know that the universe is working in your favor baby or no baby 
this is great how long does it take you to animate about one minute worth of video in this style 
id love to will do so shortly 
careful with that your thoughts are very powerful and if there is a satan hed like nothing more than to make you feel afraid especially when you might be on the verge of some beautiful experiences ive been seeing repeating numbers a lot more recently and i try to remember to mentally express love and gratitude every time assuming that the numbers are a positive sign and guess what ive had extraordinarily good luck lately and so many things ive been working towards for years are just falling into place all of the sudden 

for every good thing that can happen to you you can find someone on the internet telling you its a bad thing you and only you can allow the energy within yourself to skew negative or positive so if you think youve got an evil entity in yourself you might as well have one simply declare yourself free of their control and you are free declare yourself open to the influences of love and light and expect miracles to believe that youre a helpless victim of darkness is to throw away your tremendous personal power and to miss out on opportunities for a happier life

ps im posting this at 1222pm and i feel great about it  dont worry be happy 
this is just one of a dozen or so websites that collect near death experience stories of course you gotta decide for yourself what to believe but it certainly makes for some interesting reading 
passionate empathetic and creative certainly describes me in fact i was working on illustrating a childrens book when i got your message ha thanks so much for the reading its a very cool gift that you have 
based on the information id say shes genuinely interested in you 
if you dont mind me asking at what age did you develop this or did you always have it i used to nanny for a little guy from age 23 who would tell me what color i was after i had a miscarriage he had no idea why i was sad but he started telling me i was gray  i moved away 5 years ago but ive always wondered if he was seeing my aura and what color hed see from me now 
check out the sub rprecognition and youll see this phenomenon is pretty common when i was 11 years old i dreamt about the grisly specifics of my pet rabbits untimely death a few days before it happened been trying to understand the nature of reality ever since 

ps im so sorry about your pup 

edit spelling
so much food for thought here  this is something ive been learning a lot about recently and i feel like its a vitally important topic for our whole society

i really respect your courage and honesty  anger is something weve all felt but many are afraid to talk about because its not considered a good emotion to have we learn from a young age that only the bad kids get angry and this shaming is reflected in the subsequent years as we become conditioned to choke it out lock it in a cage but there is no part of ourselves that can stay locked up forever just like you described eventually the banished emotion escapes and then youre dealing with the anger of the situation at hand plus an eruption of backlogged anger

but it doesnt have to be this way anger when properly integrated is just a calm steady voice of justifiable selfrespect its a small but powerful flame within that gives us the courage to ask for a raise firmly assert boundaries and protect the vulnerable when we accept that anger is a natural emotion just doing its best to protect the self or others were able to harness the selfrespecting motivation behind it and express it lovingly as soon as we feel disrespected its much much easier to keep your cool if you address what youre feeling long before you get hot 

i tell my kids its okay to be angry but you cant hurt anybody and i even suggest punching a pillow stomping etc sometimes because i firmly believe that anger has to be allowed to be released i actually did a therapy session recently where i found myself screaming fuck you into a pillow over some things that happened back in high school i couldnt believe how much lighter calmer and more forgiving i felt and still feel after that crazy stuff id unknowingly been carrying that rage around with me for 18 years 

point is your anger isnt shameful its just ready to be let out of the cage so it can become the loving safe and wellintegrated tool its meant to be just my two cents take what resonates and leave the rest behind much love to you my brother  keep it up 
you mean these books i grew up with this set and just started reading them with my own kids    
thats thankfully a myth dying in a dream is not uncommon but it is usually something that happens in symbolicmetaphorical dreams and is meant to illustrate some aspect of your emotional life

i would categorize this as a precognitive dream which is surprisingly common as well check out rprecognition for many similar accounts glad youre okay 
i pay attention to the feelings i get while considering the action if following him on ig makes you feel excited nervous in a good way joyful etc do it if you feel unpleasantly anxious or conflicted about it wait for the next possible action and see how that feels 
im so sorry you went through that  sounds terrifying youve got such an encouraging and uplifting vibe im really thankful youre okay  

your story is bound to be controversial because money is a loaded topic to begin with and its such an unexpected twist to the almost died storyline most people will probably be watching expecting to see you speak on a newfound appreciation for life and then your taking the money will seem shallow in comparison but anyone who has been greatly in need of 100 raises hand knows that the gratitude you feel once youre struggling a little bit less is anything but shallow

and none of us can say how wed react unless weve been in your shoes so dont let the criticism upset you at the same time i do suggest being willing to consider how you might have responded differently not because you did anything bad but because every moment of our lives is a sliding door to other possibilities and we can learn so much from considering the other paths we might have taken you shouldnt feel any guilt or shame though you are beautiful and deserving of everything good 
me toobut i also feel like the exhaustion and discomfort arent bad but rather temporary symptoms of having shifted in some way i was meditating last night and i quickly started to feel a really pleasant tinglingvibration the phrase ancient upgrades came to mind and i saw a 2d shape thats been coming to my mind and puzzling me since i was a child the shape started to turn into a 3d construction project being built in ancient times which was so cool aaaand then my son woke up and i had to snap out of it and go be mommy 
tldr i wonder if something leveled up in our dna or consciousness last night that were energetically adapting to today 
its a great sign it means youre on the right track in addition many believe its a sign from your angels or guides that theyre with you and proud of you you can google angel number and the numbers you keep seeing and read multiple interpretations but i think its important to remember that only you can sense the true meaning because whatever you see is for you and specific to your experience
you might want to try posting this on rretconned as theres some really interesting discussions over there about geography changes
rlostreddditors  slaying isnt quite what were about here 

its funny you mention aliens though because a few nights ago i dreamt of an alien invasion everyone was terrified including me but i intuitively knew that wishing them harm was the only way they could get me i focused all my energy on sending them love and light and it was like they had no choice but to pass on by not only was i safe my loving intentions made me uninteresting to them because provoking anger and fear is how they get their kicks 

edit by they i mean this specific group i think the vast majority of aliens are benevolent 
oh wow when i wrote the other comment i had no idea that you were the same person i responded to here i read sooo many posts but feel compelled to respond to relatively so few of them its crazy that i inadvertently reached out to you twice you and i must be on the same wavelength 

im honestly not sure why but i felt like i should delete my other comment and resend it via pm so i deleted it but i hadnt sent the pm yet if youre open to it id love to talk more about these newold friends of ours 
im on board if youre interested in illustrations 
oh my goodness youve made my day i appreciate and love you so much too and im here for you anytime 

its not vain to see your own power and potential its beautiful and essential that you do you are one of the greats embrace it life is long and sometimes its really hard but if you can learn to appreciate the hard times as a trial by fire a chance to burn off the things that are no longer serving your highest potential so that you can grow into something much greater youll soon come out on the other side like a phoenix born from ashes

you mentioned getting your whole self to cooperate and i truly get what you mean i highly recommend this book even if you only read the free sample youll get a lot of helpful realizations 

the idea is that as we go through life experiences of trauma sadness etc parts of our truest selves go into hiding while other parts of ourselves spring up to put up defences and barriers to try and stop the wounded selves from getting hurt again these bodyguard parts of self only have good intentions for you they want to protect you but sometimes theyre misguided or no longer needed

for example you have a bodyguard part of yourself thats telling you youre tired and its safer to stay in bed if you view that part of self like hes bad it only doubles down on the hurt and fear hes already feeling you have to be thankful for his efforts love him assure him that you are safe and gently tell him that he can move along now 

tldr love forgive and appreciate every single part of yourself even or especially the parts that you dont want to be anymore and they will dissipate and reintegrate back into the whole making you into a new and improved version of yourself you got this 
hugs youre never alone 

i see a lot of selfdefeating assumptions in your post such as the assumption that your brain is wired to be negative you have a beautiful brain its just in need of a little makeover

you can change anything you want and changing your way of thinking is one of the easier things to change if you dont meditate its time to start my brain is very active always going and going so i really understand what its like to feel stuck in a negative thought loop meditation trains your brain to slow down and starting with just a few minutes a day can make a noticeable difference in less than a week so start there

next write down some positive affirmations and try and think of them every single time you catch yourself having a negative thought you dont have to believe the statements are true  just start thinking about them and they will start to become your reality heres a few of my favorite affirmations

the worst is behind me
im doing a great job
im safe and loved
everything is going well for me
i have a lot to look forward to
i love myself
i love everyone
i have an abundance of money
i have an abundance of energy
i have an abundance of love
im really blessed 

i also recommend thinking thank you and i love you as much as possible you can direct your love and gratitude to yourself random strangers the universe whatever you want just practice feeling love and gratitude especially on the tough days

 i love you and im here for you anytime 
plaaahstaahk lol my brother and i loved this movie and loved to imitate his weird pronunciations
your associations make perfect sense to me in case its helpful heres my thoughts on few of them

mario kart maybe about how you are navigating through life or the games you play socially at work etc to get ahead

toilets could represent your thoughts feelings about what youre producing with your current life or something you andor others are trying to keep hidden

belly of the serpent makes me think of the wolf in sheeps clothing but its a man in snakes clothing and it feels like a trap does that parallel to a feeling you have sometimes like you have no choice but to appear threatening 

shark in the water water often represents emotions the shark could be an angry part of yourself or an emotional threat of some kind 

shopping centers often represents how you are presenting yourself or how you see yourself in relation to society 

do you have any more recurring characters thinking of your immediate associations with the people in your dreams or the recalling type of person you were back when you spent the most time with them might be helpful for identifying which parts of yourself the dream is trying to resolve for example you mentioned the exgirlfriend dreams perhaps theres a part of yourself thats still stuck in those days waiting to be reintegrated so for instance if you felt like you were selfish back then forgiving yourself and your mistakes would probably soothe those particular dreams away 
well i for one dont think youre crazy imo its entirely possible that scientists there and elsewhere are doing all kinds of crazy stuff that isnt disclosed to the general public but regardless of whether or not our universe is being tampered with i think the most important part of your comment is this 

he believed it was absolutely crucial that people need to hold true and not lose themselves 

i believe that too and i think people are doing it all on their own its amazing how many people myself included are actually living better and happier lives since experiencing these alternate dimension type dreams glitches etc and even though the recent batch of shared dreams were apocalyptic the underlying theme was that the dreamers felt calm and knew there was no reason to be afraid thats beautiful and worth taking to heart 

all of this to say dont worry be happy personally i believe theres an awakening force of love and light rolling in and its unstoppable 
i dont think it sounds stupid at all and i think your mom is blessed to have you in her life  my advice is to lead by example try new things and pass along the things that you find helpful heres my goto daily list for improving my mind and body complete with an acronym swem 

supplement getting all the vitamins and nutrients i need either through food alone or food  supplements 

water staying hydrated

exercise hitting the gym doing thirty minutes of yoga or even just dancing around the living room is great for my overall energy and mood 

meditate i try and do at least ten minutes a day 

these are just a few ideas but the point is to take care of good yourself and talk to your mom about the benefits youre experiencing wishing you both all the best 


thats amazing im in a private subreddit and the same thing happened huge influx of powerful dreams reported friday morning 
seeing the little ordinary daily life things in places like this fill me with existential dread someone washed that coffee mug set it on the wire rack to dry and then what where did they go
are you serious im so glad you shared this i cant wait to read more 
he said he doesnt remember any colors in particular do you 

i like the shared dream idea  i hadnt thought of that sometimes i wonder if our consciousness have experiences in alternate dimensions while our body is sleeping its as if some really crappy universes were destroyed and yall were all there for the end of those particular times somehow knowing that it wasnt the end of you
first of all im sorry youre feeling this way it sounds like youre under a lot of stress and some old wounds are feeling raw its understandable that youd be upset but keep breathing and know that everything is going to be okay 

the idea behind those dimensional jumping methods is that we can shape our reality if thats true then its not really possible for you to jump into the wrong dimension unless you decide that it is and if you did decide that you jumped into the wrong dimension you could simply jump into a better one 

are you familiar with the law of attraction its the same general idea but instead of trying to jump straight from one version of your life to another you set the intention to have certain changes come into your life ive had success with both approaches and i think its really just about deciding what you want for yourself and then moving forward with the assumption that your desires are already manifesting 

if you want to speed up the process then expect the best practice feeling love towards yourself and others and be grateful for everything good in your life no matter how small its pretty mindblowing how many wonderful things you can attract
beautiful the number 27 has been my favorite since i was a child it wasnt until i turned 27 that i learned its my grandmothers favorite number as well its a very special number
truthfully i dont know what it is i dont really have a belief system about this i just observe correlations and look for patterns and sometimes i notice that the people around me and everywhere i look online seem to be experiencing some very specific things within a 36 hour or so block of time this time around it was people who dont normally remember their dreams having vivid dreams people unexpectedly reconnecting with someone they lost touch with and random good things happening to people 

if you dont mind sharing what was your dream about 
im so very sorry about your friend its a sad irony that depression can make us hide away from the very people who love us and are willing to help im sure you meant more to scott than youll ever know 
do you remember what it was about
youre never alone 
anytime you wanna get stuff off your chest please dont hesitate to pm me i dont judge and id be honored to provide listening ear 
what the what my husband had that exact same dream heres another one  and another  
mazel tov gay jesus 
whoa wouldnt it be cool if that plays out in reality its like we got some kind of system upgrade that improved relationships and circumstances 
did the logo appear yesterday by chance it seems like a whole bunch of people myself included shifted to a better timelineuniverse sometime thursday night 
this has happened to me before i saw my face morph into the faces of dozens of old women and their faces reflected the emotion i was feeling in that exact moment for example i started to feel anxious and my face became the face of a woman who was anxious her whole life when i calmed down and felt happy i saw the face of a woman who was at peace her whole life 

i believe its a function of the third eye ancient cultures throughout time were well aware of the abilities of the third eye but in modern times its less common for people to hear about it so when it activates we dont know whats going on the brain is a fascinating and complex machine capable of all kinds of amazing things stay positive and start meditating if you havent already done so youre in for some beautiful experiences
im so sorry youre dealing with this my friend it sounds awful its possible that theyre going through something thats making them feel angry and aggressive and not telling you about it i would try and get them talking about it at a time when everyone is calm and happy tell them that you dont understand what changed and that the constant fighting is breaking your spirit be honest and express your feelings with love and gentleness be open to the possibility that they are just hurting i think theres a lot of truth to the phrase people who are hurting hurt people 

beyond that do what you can to create a port in the storm go to your room and listen to binaural beats meditate intend to have a healing experience with them intend for them to have healing experiences on their own practice hooponopono  and direct the energy to them know that you are safe and loved im always here anytime you want to chat 
forgive yourself love yourself and be patient we all have painful experiences that can leave us stuck in negative thought cycles you arent thinking bad thoughts because youre bad at this youre thinking that because youve been hurt so getting mad at yourself is just doubling down on the hurt youre already feeling does that make sense 

try this whenever these ughhhh thoughts come up respond to yourself with positive affirmations like im doing a great job or im a beautiful person inside and out or im thankful for how i look its okay if you dont necessarily feel like theyre true just yet by replacing the negative thoughts with positive ones youll begin a healing  process and raise your vibrations to a level where you can receive the gifts youre asking for know that you are deserving of all gifts and practice feeling grateful for the beauty that is already manifesting for you 
1 stay hydrated
2 look for every opportunity to make someones day a little better
3  practice hooponopono 
4 take a break from reading the news and social media
5 text a friend just to say youre glad theyre in your life
youre not crazy and theres nothing to worry about think of it like a little wink from the universe letting you know youre on the right track theres no real reason for it to be ominous all kinds of amazing things could happen to you 
this comment reminded me of this song that i love to listen to when i feel low because it lets me express my sadness and loss before celebrating all that i have 

i got my arms got my hands got my fingers got my legs got my feet got my toes got my liver got my blood ive got life ive got my freedom ive got life
dont worry about the rockstar example i should have worded my suggestion better

the method is just to gain confidence by pretending youre already confident imagine yourself as youd like to be perceived by others and then imagine that youre already being perceived that way as you go about your day we all put out energy to others all the time anyway be it anxious shy agitated whatever this is just the act of consciously altering your energy as you get used to the idea of projecting confidence or any characteristic really real confidence begins to grow underneath

think of it like exercise first you decide you want to be able to run 5 miles and eventually you will but it starts with jogging around the block 
i think its just the way you go about it you can be confident and also be warm and inclusive  
hey there just checking in after a little reddit hiatus im so glad my response was helpful fwiw the free of charge bit in my title was a joke  i never charge so please feel free to comment or pm me your dreams any time i relate to some of your experiences and would be happy to help however i can 
 love it
walk into the room pretending to be super famous and that everyone wants to talk to you you dont have to 100 believe it just keep mentally projecting the confidence of a rockstar and see what happens its pretty crazy how heads start to turn try it and see 
okay thank you for the solid advice kind stranger my children are quite little ages 1 and 4 so they are far more into stuff like swimming roblox dinosaurs and impromptu dance parties than anything i could possibly say on this subreddit 

but i feel ya i was raised in a very religious household and when i grew up and felt differently about religion than my parents it was really tough and i didnt know how to tell them so i hope very much that my children never feel like im pushing my personal beliefs onto them i dont feel as though i need them to be interested in or even aware of what i think about the universe i just want them to feel as safe happy and loved as i can


ps what are your thoughts on this if i may ask i dont like to argue on the internet but i am always up for a friendly discussion

i hope you have a good day 
ha because i let them watch willy wonka or because their mom enjoys pondering theoretical and practical applications of physical science either way i love you i really do 
thanks so much for sharing and congrats on the lucidity ive only had a lucid dream once and i decided to fly right away haha that was just a few months ago so im hoping it happens again soon 

im eager to hear the message of this dream if you dont mind sharing 
im glad you asked this is a pretty common one so dont feel bad  a quick way to figure this one out might be to ask yourself what do i feel guilty about 

the accidentally cheated dreams can come from the feeling that youre spending too much time on work video games thinking about other people and so on  in other words the dreams may not be about actually cheating with a girl at all but rather some other form of letting her down or simply a fear of letting her down does that help
how strange they say that we often dream of stores as a snapshot of how were considering presenting ourselves in society in that light this might be a dream about feelings of society being past its prime holding nothing new for you and yet creepily keeping tabs on you just the same however childrens dreams are a bit no more difficult to translate because childrens associations can be so different from adults 

so a good way to figure this one out might be to try and think of your life at the age you had these dreams and what your associations with stores might have been if not place i go to get stuff i need to function in society maybe place my parents take me or place i might get lost then think about the imagery and feelings you had against that backdrop 

let me know what you think
hey thats not a bad thing my husband is the same way i have vivid and memorable dreams almost nightly and his memorable dreams are few and far between maybe one or two a year 

i have a theory about this totally unproven hes a really extroverted feeler like hes able to process his emotions very well and speak to what hes feeling in the moment whereas i tend to try and avoid thinking about my feelings and sometimes i keep em suppressed and unprocessed until they come out in the form of dreams so ive wondered if those who dont remember their dreams tend to be able to process and express their emotions on the fly what say you
first of all and hope this is okay to say but id love to see this as a scene in a movie 

 as with any dream you should trust your instincts on this one your spiritual journey is your own beautifully unique thing so ill leave the spiritual interpretations up to you disregard anything that isnt resonant but heres what i see in the emotional intelligence of the dream

the setting of the girls house may be uniquely significant if she was a real girl you know if it was a random girl then the setting seems to me to be conveying that this dream is illustrating in part how you feel about yourself in societyin relation to others 

the thing that sticks out to me the most is that the painful feeling manifests immediately after being shushed by your mom you were just sharing your thoughts hurting no one and she made you feel as though you were doing something wrong your confidence was undermined and you werent able to truly stand up for yourself 

the punched in the gut feeling is one of painful shame and sadness and personally i often feel it when ive done nothing wrong i onlyfear that i have does that sound like what you expedience its a sickening feeling for me and one im only just starting to realize that i dont deserve to feel that so much of the time many many of us get traumatized by feeling shame in front of others at a young age or any age and then long after the critical condescending or angry voices that made us feel that way are no longer around we still feel the affects of them and for some it feels like what we call social anxiety and depression its exactly the kind of stuck emotions that are the subconscious 1 job to make better but it all needs to be consciously processed before the healing can begin so vivid dreams are born from that subconscious effort to help you know what you are feeling 

tldr  perhaps you have difficulty speaking your feelings and beliefs due to some negative conditioning 

ps what are the six orbs of energy and whats your interpretation of the parable 




dont want to intrude upon your own way of looking at the dream because as always you are the best interpreter of your dreams its most likely to be a culmination of the things youre experiencing and feeling so above all else trust your instincts 




this is a good one its fascinating that you were in the backyard because in dreamland backyards often represent childhood and the past experiences now behind us its as if this dream was meant to be brought with you into adulthood which certainly warrants a closer look 

to interpret a childs dream it helps to think like you did as a child bees can represent transformation as in the honeymaking process community collaboration hard work etc but to a child the association may be as simple as thing that might hurt me 

hands are usually symbolic of the work that we do whether its a child building block towers and cutting paper shapes or an adult doing the dishes and having a job we use our hands but they can also symbolize our lifes work our true calling and the fact that this dream has stayed with you leads me to think this is the case

to be bitten in a dream typically indicates feeling attacked vulnerable leeched off of or some other form of threat but whats interesting is that you feel no pain almost as if your hands were prepared for this 

to be perfectly honest i dont know what this dream is saying but if i were to guess the message id say its something like nothing can stop you from doing what you came here to do 


wow imo this was your inner self coming through with a powerfully important message thanks so much for sharing 
its my pleasure and thanks for being willing to share some of your dreams 

my first instinct is that the house at least in the first dream speaks to some feelings about growing up with your mom but its just as likely to be about your family as a whole and yourself in relation to them the age of yourself in the dream indicates that this is about lingering effects of the younger yous experiences the woman selling the house may represent parts of your moms psyche the subconscious tends to add an additional character for each part of someones personality that it wants to illustrate

bathrooms are where we tend to our most private and sometimes unpleasant business and in dreams they usually represent much the same thing the things we dont want anyone to know or see and arent a part of our public persona so its possible that theres some family drama that was kept under wraps or aspects of your familys life that were kept from you or some other form of private pain that you havent properly processed and healed from it might be pain that you experienced as a child and felt like you shouldnt tell anyone 

looking out a window typically symbolizes your view of the world or in this case the way you looked at world in the time of your life that this dream is meant to illustrate the broken down amusement park seems to say joy is gone the colorful abandoned houses may be colorful parts of yourself that you lost when you were younger or colorful parts of your family life that were ruined somehow the fact that your family is happy with the view unaware of your feelings of dread makes me think that you are the one who died in private murdered by the stranger who might still be in the house the fact that he might still be in the house suggests that your pain felt inescapable and maybe still does 

the attic represents your highest thoughts which often means spirituality forgotten or undiscovered parts of a house is a very common dream metaphor and it means that theres a part of yourself that youve lost touch with the childhood friend and her family are probably parts of yourself that you lost when you were a child and stopped spending time in this part of your spiritual life as a result its very powerful imagery and its more hopeful than it probably feels within the dream there are hidden rooms within all of us just waiting to be enjoyed again theyve just been boarded up with pain we arent ready to face again 

please dont feel discouraged by the darkness of these dreams its not indicative of anything youre doing wrong or not doing well enough i keep recommending this book for precisely this reason its helped me to understand that each and every bad self within us isnt even bad its just a defensive bodyguard self that is protecting a wounded little child self children need to be able to express their feelings and receive unconditional love and support but when that inevitably fails to happen a little piece of that child remains stuck in those bad feelings and a defensive self develops to try and stop you from reliving that pain 

as with any dream interpretation this one is subject to my own projections and experiences so i want to stress that you are the best interpreter of your dreams if any of that resonates awesome and the things that dont quite feel right are your subconscious telling you thats not it keep thinking i find that by pondering the interpretations that do feel right and then thinking about them in relation to the parts that are still confusing me things start to click into place and make sense overall 

please dont hesitate to follow up with questions other dreams etc im truly happy to help however i can 
thats beautiful its a lot like what people who participate in the therapeutic mdma trials say  that they got to know themselves underneath all the barriers theyve built up and that in itself is a catalyst for continued healing 

im glad my comment was helpful i was hesitant about posting it because the last thing i want to do is derail your positive experience by projecting my own beliefs onto it its really cool that it resonates with what you felt thanks again for sharing it was helpful for me 
your ankles are lovely 
 just my personal opinion but i think the concept of a higher self that is somehow removed or above the self is a misunderstanding ive been reading about the therapeutic mdma trials and one thing that seems to come out for everyone is a healing self within that is benevolent and somehow unaffected by the trauma of our lives it knows who we are and who we might be without the trauma weighing us down i call it the inner self or highest self because to me thinking of it as a separate entity leaves me feeling like i have to appeal to it or beckon it somehow i think its the same self that creates the dreams which bring us clarity about our emotional lives to be clear i do believe we have angels guides whatever you want to call them i just think the higher self is within and not in any way better than us because it is us 

anyway thanks for sharing your session its a gift to be able to read others experiences 
gosh this made me sad its late at night and im up holding my baby boy who is sick and started thinking of him wanting to see me not being able to talk to me idk where im even going with this except to say im sorry and i hope she gets out soon 

 virtual mom hug 


ps i believe you 
dreams like this usually happen to people who are thinking aboutpreparing to give birth to an idea a new venture of some kind etc 
isnt it amazing how much we can intuitively realize seemingly out of nowhere im starting to think there was a recent know thyself upgrade in this universe ha i keep bumping into people online and irl who are also finding peace through sudden clarity into their psyche 

and thank you same to you  
this is something ive been thinking about too ive been reading this book about the internal family systems method of therapy and its so encouraging the idea is basically that our even our bad and self destructive parts are just pieces of self doing the best they can for us because however misguided their efforts may be they are just trying to protect a wounded part of self

i used to feel bad about how frustrated and panicked id get when my husband was telling me about something complex i knew cognitively that he was just trying to share some interesting thing he learned but i couldnt stop the amygdala reactions eventually i realized that i was reacting this way because of my experiences as an adhd child and teen not being able to pay attention and feeling the intense embarrassment of not getting it like the other kids so my feelings of anger and fear about these conversations werent bad they were just screaming get out to try and protect me from feeling embarrassed again realizing that has helped me stop guilting myself for the feelings and instead i think to myself thank you frustration and anxiety for trying to keep me from reliving embarrassing situations but im okay im safe it only feels unsafe

thats just one example of many i could share as i am something of a walking ball of triggers lol its been hugely helpful for me in my healing 

edit ive also realized that by soothing these dark reactions im able to stay in the moment and let my wounded selves experience safety now when my husband wants to tell me something complex i find that i can listen and learn just fine which is healing in itself 
im sorry you experienced that dream it sounds pretty terrifying im of the belief that dreams can come in many different forms precognitive intuitive and metaphorical to name a few and sometimes as appears to be the case here theyre a combination of metaphors based on past and future events the kind i work with are the metaphorical which can tell us about whats going on in your head that you may not be consciously processing the most important thing to know is that these are my impressions of the dream and since i dont have the brain that dreamt this i cant tell you for sure what it means for you the best way to receive a dream interpretation is to ponder it disregard anything that didnt resonate and think about how the imagery and emotions correlate to your real life 

missiles are a direct and targeted attack you may want to consider ifhow you might have been feeling attacked or afraid of being attacked at the time you had this dream it could also be a dream about an attack from years ago which your subconscious is still trying to make sense of 

our friends often show up in a dream as standins for ourselves specifically the part of oneself that is reflected in the personality of the friend for example my friend g often shows up in my dreams and through context and introspection i realized that i dream of him as a standin for the part of myself that gets distant and aloof from insecurity which is one of the traits i noticed early on in g 

you have a few old friends with you and its quite possible that they all represent a part of yourself its also possible that your subconscious placed them there because the dream is reflecting an attack that occurred during the time of your life that was spent with these friends it could be both the one that dies i suspect is a part of yourself that youve lost as a result of some unexpected trauma or difficulty ie missile in your life 

having to tell his family seems like a significant plot point but its hard to say what it means a few possibilities when some part of your persona dies friends and family are typically the first to notice that something is off maybe this part of the dream reflects having to interact with your family without this lost part of yourself another possibility the family could be other parts of yourself that you have to interact with differently now 

with regards to feeling stuck my guess would be that you are ready to reintegrate this lost piece of self back into the whole but theres still some inner work to be done it could be as simple as identifying the part of yourself thats missing and intending for it to redevelop 

if any of that resonates awesome but if not thats completely okay dont try to make it fit dreams are individual creations and you are the best interpreter of your own 

edit oops i left out an important possible explanation toconsider for the friend in your dream which is that of course he may be playing the part of himself its especially likely if you went through hard times with this friend or have lost contact with him 

a good way to test this is to observe the very first thoughts and emotions you have when you think about this friend if you feel something unpleasant such as guilt sadness etc thats an emotional response that your subconscious would probably like to resolve which it often does in the form of nightmares about how you ended up feeling this way about your friend if you feel loving and neutral when you think about the friend then he probably represents a part of yourself 
if you have any recent dreams you dont mind sharing id be happy to let you know what i see
i dont disagree with you on the deceptive intentions but i still pay attention to the dates and claims because i have a hunch they are often used to distract from the real beauty of the day many people predicted feb 20th as a possible date for the event while others were predicting global chaos i had quite a huge personal breakthrough in meditation on feb 20th and yesterday i had some smaller but powerful realizations so i just think its possible that these dates are important energetically and the thing thats fake about them is what were told will happen i dont think they draw random dates out of a hat i think they try to create fear on dates when we might otherwise be especially likely to raise our vibrations 
i went from 53 to 55 by improving my posture using a foam roller on my back and retraining my back muscles to strengthen and lengthen im not sure if i manifested it or if i just had two inches worth of height hiding under a slouchweak middle back either way its pretty cool 
 sure they do people all over the world have grueling schedules and need to play sometimes no argument there 

the question of why those specific words were displayed on their signs remains 
yeah this isnt the exact article i read but its a bit better because it summarizes the results of many experiments such as the one i mentioned above mediation and violent crime 
i read an article recently about transcendental meditation it said that when 1 of the towns population practiced meditation the crime rate went down by 16  pretty incredible 
this is a good one im super intrigued by the possible implications of quantum entanglement and this could be a great example the idea being that your initial interaction and ongoing inside joke about them kept you all entangled enough to subconsciously decide to return at the same time 
haha yep i had my first lucid dreaming experience recently and it was in one of the many alternate universes i visit in my sleep i was walking down the stairs in my old sorority house and noticed that the walls were painted beige this struck me as odd because i know theyve been painted gray since i graduated my next thought was this must be a dream i can fly 

i think there must be a suspension of disbelief switch that the subconscious can flip otherwise it makes no sense whatsoever that of all the crazy things ive dreamt some walls being painted beige instead of gray would be the thing that made me go waaaait just a minute now  this cant be my daytoday reality 
she looks like a kind and lovely woman im so glad you found this photo and though its been a long time id still like to say that im sorry for your loss 
hell yeah your are really showing him whose boss
did you feel like you were gonna go crazy i dont know what my mind would do with a week of isolation
i relate to your post very much my first awakening came with the meaning of life is love hitting me like a ton of bricks and ive also gotten to experience the feeling of that ultimate love and acceptance surrounding me its hard to put into words what it feels like but if it were a drug id be hooked i think youre right about keeping an open mind i feel a bit sad for people who dont want to ask questions and explore the possibilities the universe is so mysterious and beautiful 
try keeping a dream journal you can use your phone or an actual notebook by your bed just jot down the key points of whatever dreams you had as soon as you wake up you might be surprised to see some patterns emerge and it can even help you figure out things that are bothering you subconsciously ive learned that keeping a dream journal can sort of prompt the subconscious mind to dream more effectively and helpfully and it should help you distinguish between dreamland and real life too
i dont know that it provides proof of anything new but it seems like pretty good evidence of the existence of a collective unconscious 
ha my badi got my fancy schools mixed up
i was feeling like today was special some kind of collaborative energy in the air so i checked the gcp dot and it looks like the coherence of the number generators is off the charts very interesting and i was wondering if anyone has seen it like this before 

for those who have no idea what im talking about lol heres the stanford university webpage  with information on how the data is collected
its so weird i can see your first response in my notifications but i cant click on it or read the whole thing anyway yes it is a wand the lovely man i bought it from does the woodworking part and his partner who chooses the crystals and stones was not in the store at the time he thought it might be serpentine its pretty smooth isnt cool to the touch
yours might be a true statement though you can find out for yourself that uimreallyokay is sharing the truth all you have to do is experiment no purchase necessary
dude you arent kidding its been mindblowing to me im getting chills just typing this lol its like the biggest obstacle is just realizing what the universe is really like once you accept that its operating according to your expectations you can change your life 
i dont know what it is i first started noticing how real these things are in early 2013 and it seems that a lot of people started noticing around the same time then there was another big influx of people having these experiences in december and again in february of this year maybe theres periodic shifts in energies or frequencies or something that supercharges the effects of the thoughts we have whatever it it seems to be getting stronger and more frequent
is this aventurine  thanks for sharing your gifts here
coincidence just means that two related events happened for no apparent reason it doesnt mean that there is no reason my theory is that the veil over reality started lifting a few years ago and picked up the pace around december 2017 it seems like synchronicities precognition manifestations and other thoughtpowered occurrences are off the charts these days 

my advice is to stay in a loving and grateful mindset as much as possible it supercharges these abilities and we all have these abilities btw to a degree that still surprises me even after years of practice 

 maybe if i start thinking about money itll appear in my life

it will but the key is in how you think about money if youre thinking i dont have enough money youll manifest a continuous lack of money thinking i have an abundance of moneyim thankful for an abundance of money has worked much better for me 
i have experienced that with personal changes my theory is that its something to do with collapsing timelines you can remember the facts of a collapsed timeline for a while but it eventually fades away as you progress through the remaining timelines 
yes my skin feels tight and itchy even on my back which was fully clothed all day other than that i feel great i went to bed early feeling out of sorts and irritable woke up at 333am feeling overcome with love for my husband and little ones and the rest of the world too ive been awake ever since feeling perfectly rested 
we already have the gifts weve just collectively forgotten about themno longer teach them you are capable telepathy remote viewing lucid dreaming and manifestation with or without the event some are foreseeing  
sign me up please i would be happy to help moderate as well 
im a philip k dick fan and find this interesting as he had a friend named valis who assisted him in getting his life together but his valis was a pink light and had a female voice 
i think youll find this interesting then friendly hallucinations are only rare in some places from this article 

stanford anthropologist tanya luhrmann found that voicehearing experiences of people with serious psychotic disorders are shaped by local culture  in the united states the voices are harsh and threatening in africa and india they are more benign and playful this may have clinical implications for how to treat people with schizophrenia she suggests
i find that when peoples negative energies limiting beliefs etc bring me down its because theyre mirroring something within myself like if im not experiencing any anger i can observe anger from within a bubble and just feel kind of amused and eager to help sometimes it even seems to supercharge my positive state but if im experiencing even mild pessimism for example the pessimism of others brings me wayyyyy down 

just my thoughts friend to friend 
i had a nightmare of an attack on the country maybe the world it was coming from the sky via helicopters and such and i was taking shelter with others i havent had a nightmare in ages and war isnt something that typically worries me so this seemed to come from nowhere
aww my daughter is three and doesnt understand that i actually order and pay for the groceries that get delivered i havent explained it to her because its funny and cute seeing her flip out with gratitude over everything she just goes to the door and immediately starts thanking the delivery person for random items 
a few of my friends and family have had similar experiences like watching a movie or craving a certain food and then learning they watchedate the exact same thing on the same date a few years back my theory is that the subconscious mind keeps track of a lot more than we can consciously remember so basically you listened to the song and recalled that memory because you subconsciously remembered it was the anniversary of your friends post again just a theory but it makes sense to me
this article   is pretty long so ive copied the relevant parts

all of these were minor interventions compared to its apogee the saving of phils sons life phil describes how one morning he was lying in a semisleep state when he heard the voice announce that his recently born son christopher had a potentially fatal birth defect and that urgent medical attention was needed indeed the voice was quite precise when it stated

your son has an undiagnosed right inguinal hernia the hydrocele has burst and it has descended into the scrotal sac he requires immediate attention or will soon die 

tessa acting on her husbands frantic instructions took christopher to the family doctor and it was indeed confirmed that christopher had exactly the problem the voice had described and surgery was needed

this is cool philip k dick saw a pink light that he credited with saving his little boys life
hey buddy thanks so much
woah i love these beautiful coincidences of the universe 
ive always found it really cool and interesting that albert einstein was born on pi day and now its the day stephen hawking died as well its also my birthday but i have made no significant contributions to math and science
hey neighbor i believe in you
 im really sorry for your loss
i havent seen game of thrones or avatar but the header image really gives me the creeps for some reason
i think its something to do with the frequency or energy of our thoughts but im not sure the exciting thing is that these phenomenon and things of a similar nature are being observed and studied in mainstream science now whereas in the recent past its been relegated to the mystical realm im of the opinion that our brains are naturally wired to do all kinds of cool things were mostly unaware of 

im so sorry youve been going through some hard times please dont hesitate to pm me anytime you want to talk i know how sometimes it can be easier to open up to a random stranger than a loved one and im here for ya anytime and the same goes for anyone else who happens to read this 
i relate to your post ive had two life changing experiences the first coming from a place of despair crying out for a reason to live and suddenly knowing that love is the answer to life the second was like yours in that i saw the source it was pure love and i recognized that i was a part of it and so was everything else 

so for me these are the things i know im open to a lot of ideas and i enjoy the search for the truth but im not in any hurry to believe much else  i figure that if something is true it will eventually hit me like a ton of bricks the way those other realizations did 
another floor sleeper here hmm i wonder if this is a common tendency for people like us 

my sleep last night was normal but saturday night was bananas i went to bed like normal but i seemed to linger in a meditative state for hours i kept experiencing lucid moments of processing things id just been shown by my subconscious i guess like id be semiasleep and fall into a negative thought pattern of thinking defensively then whatever was talking to me would draw my attention to the way it was pulling me into a lower vibe and exactly where on my body it was creating tension i realized that i fall into these defensive thinking patterns all the time for no real reason 

thats just a sample of the things i realized that night its never happened to me before but it was very helpful even if i was tired yesterday has anyone else experienced this
good to see you again yes exactly i had this experience on an airplane recently i was walking down the aisle holding my baby boy and i locked eyes with a guy who i instantly recognized though im sure ive never met him in this life it was bizarre we couldnt stop staring at each other then the man in front of him hit his head on the overhead compartment i winced my buddy laughed and i walked on by to find my seat 

i did a past life regression recently in which i saw myself as a little girl running around and playing chase with my soulmate who is my husband in this life and then he was just gone i guess he moved away i dont know but i never saw him after we were about seven years old i went on to live a very sad life i sought casual sex and trying to look like jayne mansfield to feel good about myself and married an older man for financial security i was miserable and never came close to any kind of spiritual awakening 

then i died and i was a little ball of light hovering around my body for a time until i finally realized i was free and i took off zipping all over the world seeing sights like the eiffel tower then i saw myself in front of the source and i was playing chase with another little ball of light that i knew was my husband in this life we were so happy to be reunited 

its sad that i was alone in that life but i see how many lessons i learned that prepared me to meet him and be with him in this life i was born with the innate sense that being able to marry my soulmate would bring me more happiness than i could ever have by living in a big house or having designer clothes even though i wasnt exactly taught that 

when i met my husband i was drawn to him immediately the first night we ever spent together was the night of hurricane katrina and he had called to make sure i was okay i was alone and worried about my family who were right in the path of the storm so he invited me over we fell asleep on his living room floor just staring into each others eyes i didnt believe in past lives at the time but the feeling that wed known each other for a long time was overpowering 

i dont know why i felt compelled to write you all that but there it is lol
my grandparents had this exact one printed and framed in their house when i was a kid thanks for the warm fuzzy throwback feels 
that was weird i havent checked the schumann in several days then suddenly felt the urge to check it a few minutes ago i guess my subconscious recognizes the feeling now 
dont let your looks stop you if you feel its something youd like to do babies love being snuggled up in big arms

source have had two babies both seem to prefer being held by our guy friends and the bigger the better 
agreed of course but i think op took a cab  it would be interesting to know if it seemed like a normal trip to the driver 
try to be detailed as possible and include any emotions you felt to get a good interpretation the subconscious is strange in that it will put important parts of the dream in what seem like unimportant details

if you want to go into detail about one of the ones that was really vivid and memorable let me know and im happy to help you figure it out 

edit btw i dont need to know private details like names or anything just any other things you can remember
awesome its so very helpful for unlocking your emotional conflicts the subconscious mind is  so interactive its incredible sometimes ill help someone with their dream symbols and the following night my dream will borrow a symbol from their dream to illustrate how i feel about something in my own life and once you begin to consciously process your dreams its like the subconscious starts working overtime to help you grow its so creative too this morning i woke up with a little poem running through my mind on repeat 

you shall know thyself and thine inner self this is my gift to you

you shall know thyself and thine inner self and then know others too
you got it and for anyone else interested pm me anytime and rest assured that i dont judge 
i enjoy helping people interpret their dreams if you feel like sharing 
do you feel like youve been forced into something lately or like someone is trying to make be you more like them rape dreams are often about feeling a loss of control it may or may not be about your dad but its almost definitely not about sex 

sorry this happened to you 
obviously quick question though why dont you just give them the message yourself 
where is this whole forced reincarnation belief coming from im open to the idea of reincarnation but this particular flavor just tastes really off to me like a disinformation campaign or something anyway it goes against the entire nature of higher beings to force anyone to do anything i have some experiences and have read the experiences of countless other people and theres no reason to be afraid the event isnt postponed its ongoing and has been for several years its the thinning of the veil that has kept us from being able to see the true and beautiful nature of our universe and ourselves which is why so many people have been experiencing glitches and the overwhelming feeling like something bigger is going on 

again theres no reason to be afraid and discord headquarters should consider integrating meditation practice into their lives 
this is awesome youve brought up some things ive thought about as well as some things ive never considered im not a lucid dreamer so what got me thinking about this possibility was when my dreams suddenly started to fall into two very distinct categories the first is what i call metaphorical dreams and theyre not linear or anything close to real life the settings and circumstances are wildly different every night and they make no sense as a storyline theyre super useful though because they help me unpack the emotional conflicts i have

but the second category started happening just a few years ago and theyre completely different ive only seen three realities but i have been to them countless times at this point to where now i know what universe im in as soon as i arrive im still married to my husband in all of them but we have no children irl we have two which i dont think we would want to have children in these realities because theyre dangerous and shitty places its like the same universe as this one and our personalities are the same but everything feels much more hopeless and frightening almost postapocalyptic like one time my husband was almost killed for his crappy bike and it felt scary but also like it happened all the time 

thats just about the only significant event thats happened though because most of the time were just walking to the car or sitting in the house or talking to friends its like things are so bad that no one has jobs or anything to look forward to and thats the other thing that makes it hard to believe these are just dreams my metaphorical dreams are like alice in wonderland levels of nonsense but these are just so real i experience them in real time and the way wethey feel is so vivid and raw and depressing that its a huge relief to wake up back in this universe 

i like where youre going with the idea of what our experience of being overtaken might feel like i hadnt thought of that i wonder if it might explain why we feel deja vu as well like maybe we already experienced the moment vicariously in another reality but it wasnt vivid enough to remember when we woke up 

this theory might also explain deja rvprecognitive dreams like maybe when a universe is very similar to ours random events that happen ahead of time in one show up in the dreams of another one thing thats often noted on rprecognition is that theres usually a detail or two in the dream thats off and if these are closely related alternate universes it makes sense that some of the specifics would be different when i was little i vividly dreamed that both my pet rabbits were attacked and killed by dogs which had never even occurred to me as a possibility before about a week later they were attacked by dogs but only one of them died its one of my earliest memories of knowing the universe is more than it seems

thanks for the response i love this stuff cant wait to hear more of your thoughts 
i got chills reading your post you really get it and yes i think we share many overlaps in experience and tendencies the way you describe the justification for our mental revenge is so apt haha its an ongoing process for me ive made it a long way but i still search my heart sometimes and find various people who i havent yet come to believe are worthy of full understanding forgiveness in meditation a few weeks ago i realized that there were 4 people i was still holding a bitter grudge against because they hurt my older brother all the way back when i was in high school i hadnt consciously thought of them often but it was a feeling of newly deepened physical relaxation as i forgave them one by one 

which reminds me of the other thing that i wanted to ask you about have you looked into the physical side of trauma at all im still learning but its fascinating how trauma is stored not just in memory but in the nervous system and body as well i thought of it because you mentioned trauma of course but also psychedelics mdma therapy is doing miracles for people with trauma of all kinds just something to consider its not going to be legally available until hopefully 2020 but some therapists will do it off the record or you could even possibly be a part of the trials or just read the method and take a diy approach im just throwing out ideas i have also read of people physically releasing trauma through acupuncture sensory derivation chambers somatic therapy and of course meditation 

im so sorry its been a really rough 15 years and i hope you are at the precipice of a whole new world of beautiful experiences im thankful for your kind words and inspired by your spirit 
i hope im not out of line but i was also born into privilege and i relate to much of what youve shared about 5 years ago i rejected the life of pursuing wealth and image and i gave away my belongings and moved to the desert everyone thought id lost my mind and were checking in on me with great concern but its probably the most sane thing ive ever done and i just wanted to tell you what i wish id done differently 

i wish id known the power of forgiveness love and unconditional acceptance i went through an awakening that led to this desert adventure so cognitively i knew these things were of utmost importance but i was still in a very bitter and judgmental mindset with regards to my parents my upbringing anyone who had a healthy savings account and all the powerful people of the world who dont care about the powerless in my mind i was doing something very wise and awakened and they were all so very wrong and lost 

it held me back i was meditating and learning but i was also stuck replaying the mental tapes from my childhood pinpointing the endless ways that i was wronged thinking of all the things that other people needed to understand imagining myself telling them and i never found the bottom of the barrel of reasons to rehash it all it was a giant toxic waste of time and energy i thought i was figuring stuff out and understanding things that needed to be understood but in hindsight none of the revelations were even useful whats been useful is realizing that people hurt others because they themselves are hurting and that the trauma i received will not go away because of time spent dwelling on the past mistakes of others but rather forgiving them and believing that im not better than them its counterintuitive but believing that im no better than anyone else has been enormously beneficial in learning to love myself 

im now a firm believer that everyones path is different and perfect for them so my evaluation of where another person should be in their own path is effectively meaningless its helped me stop looking at my parents and everyone else and seeing people who dont get it or people who fucked up and instead simply see them as souls having an experience just like me and thats opened the door for a whole world of spiritual growth that i couldnt imagine before i actually wrote a post   about one of my meditation experiences that you may find resonates 

im totally rambling and none of the above may even be useful to you so more than anything just know that youre not alone and im here for you anytime 
this is called deja vu its a very strange feeling 
what made you remember it as ww3 specifically like they were calling it that on the news as soon as it started 
i have died in a dream before too theres all kinds of things people say supposedly cant happen in a dream like die read use a computer etc etc i think its a little silly because anything can happen in dreamland its probably more accurate to say that certain things rarely happen in a dream 

anyway i tend to look at dreams metaphorically and imagine what real life experiences and emotions might be symbolized in yours i was thinking about your friend as a lost part of yourself maybe something youve suppressed as you try and play the game of life social pressure etc the house thats out of place and didnt belong in the park made you want to run out of there maybe thats symbolic of the same idea in that you lost part of yourself for fear of not fitting in and dying that seems to me like you cant truly live without this part of yourself im just telling you my impressions though i think its very very important to take interpretations with a grain of salt because you have the mind that dreamt it so your own feelings about what it means are most important

an interesting detail of your dream is that you fell to the west looking north the four directions carry an energy and meaning that incredibly is found in disparate cultures and beliefs all over the world and across time the west often symbolizes a journey to grow and fulfill a purpose think of the tribal cultures where a young man reaches a certain age and is sent on a solo journey to become a man the west is kind of like that symbolically speaking its not a journey for someone who knows nothing its a journey to grow and put to use all the things you have already learned 

the north is often used to represent death wisdom old age and completion so its very cool and interesting to me that in your dying moments of the dream you were facing north the beautiful thing about dying symbolically speaking is that you will be reborn into a better version of yourself so to tie all this together it would be a pretty exciting message about the next phase of life that your subconscious has planned for you 

id love to read more of this series of dreams and if you do feel like sharing remember that sometimes the best and most potent messages from a dream are in the details that seem unimportant at the time im also very open to the idea of dreams as portals alternate dimensions you name it so do share your theory if and when you feel like it 
it seems like a dream about the competitive nature of our society 
check out the sub rprecognition and youll find youre not alone its called deja rv
hey im not the person you were asking but i can tell you my experience it seems to me like synchronicities especially when they have a theme are like little messages from the universe theres something about jesus or religion that you are supposed to do or understand and it will help you once you get the message your syncs will probably switch to a different theme 

edit just a thought i dont want to influence your perception of the message so this is just something that was true for me personally but a huge part of my spiritual awakening came with the realization that jesus words love your neighbor as yourself  would completely change the world if everyone did it im not a christian or a follower of a particular religion but that one night of realizing the profundity of that message opened my eyes to a whole world of spiritual growth i just mention it as an example of the message being a doorway rather than the end of the messages
water bottles and cats seem to be tied for the glitchiest things in the universe
had either of you seen or thought of something that was oh no material sometimes my husband hears me calling for him when i havent said anything and its usually when i was just thinking about asking him something so ive wondered if the energy or intention or frequency of our thoughts sometimes manifest in a way that another person might perceive as audible 
i cant advise you in terms of medication but what youre describing is no way to live your greatest mission is to love and be loved and whether its real or not anything infiltrating your thoughts and frightening this you this way does not have your best interests at heart 
my husband and i have noticed the facequirks and mannerisms thing too we even have categories of peoples faces that we reference nowm ndndndd rifle  and jekekekk djejejjjrj  and  are  doing it nxnsnd f ppl khamenei vbb van rd heuejr yuri  xi w uf and on oki dorr 

sorry my 3 year old borrowed my phone and wanted to contribute to the discussion and i didnt have the heart to delete anyway ive been thinking about physics lately and how it might explain some things that we see on this sub like how when particles collide they influence and affect each other for life regardless of how far apart they end up if this applies on a human being scale it might explain things like friends and partners reading each others minds or randomly messaging each other at the same time especially in the case of separated twins since it doesnt get much more particle collisiony than sharing a womb
some men would but not all of them there are men who feel the same way due to personal or religious reasons 
deja vu is when you suddenly feel like whats happening in that moment has happened to you before but sometimes the feeling occurs when you are doing something youve never done its hard to explain but i think most people have experienced it at least once ive never had deja rv but i get deja vu 
thats awesome you have a gift check out rluciddreaming they have all kinds of tips for taking control of your dreams  
im very sorry that happened to you your theory is fascinating to me as ive been studying the way trauma is stored in the nervous system and ive never seen this particular symptom suggested in 2020 we may have mdma therapeutically available and i think its going to be amazing how many lifelong conditions subside as people are able to process and release the awful things that have happened to them i have a friend who did it and hes a palpably happier and healthier person now anyway thanks for sharing and i really wish you all the best 
i dont think theres going to be a big event i think its more likely to be many many events that unfold over time and are already unfolding and many of them may only be perceptible to some so one persons great day may be another persons crappy day and the next time theyll have the opposite experience so while im not a believer in terms of the event i love reading the messages and feelings people are getting because to me they hold weight even if the day comes and goes without any big headlines or energy shifts that effect me 

i feel bad for you op because this is not exactly a winwin situation but if i may be so bold as to make a suggestion id say let the group think it over and see what we come up with rather than declare a blanket ban i greatly appreciate this sub and your desire to keep it peaceful and i think we can manage that without silencing the people who have a message to share 

lastly thanks for all the work you do here 

edit one more thought that just came to me perhaps a slight change in the expectations we have is a key here when i think about it headline news is almost always based in things that evoke fear uncertainty and other lowvibe feels for all we know yesterday there was a 5000 increase in the number of random good deeds done by strangers the effects of which will positively impact us for generations 

but if we keep getting our hopes up about some newsworthy event well be perpetually disappointed in what otherwise might be some magical days i guess my point is that the key might be not to silence the predictions but to look at the projected dates as days where we might experience newsworthy spiritual upgrades 

yesterday i was  bursting with energy and because of the predictions for the eye passing through space and over our earth for the next few days i decided it was a good day to go deeper than usual in my meditating so i did a meditation track meant to help you meet your higher self and mine looked like a fox it helped me untangle an internal conflict about my hearts desires that has been heavy on my mind for nearly 5 years which for me was a huge event if it hadnt been for those predictions i might have chalked up my energy boost to too much caffeine and not even tried to meditate so im thankful and they werent wrong in my book 
its called deja rv and its surprisingly common check out rprecognition
