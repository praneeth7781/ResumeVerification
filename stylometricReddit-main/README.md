# stylometricReddit

For my dataset, I'm going to find a reddit user fairly active on text based subreddits, with a decent number of comments with words>100. Set aside a few comments to test the model and train the model using the last 1000 comments or so(praw-the reddit api i'm using to pull the comments only returns the last 1000 comments, some limitation with reddit's cache)
