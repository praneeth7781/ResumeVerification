I know it’s hard, but try not to feel too ashamed. Shame usually backfires because it makes you feel bad, and you just end up indulging in your habit more to escape the bad feeling. Try to be proud of yourself for every minute, hour, or day you spend doing other things. And focus on the good that will come from doing it less. Positive reinforcement is a lot more effective than negative.
Exactly!!! My ex boyfriend was rarely direct and analyzed the hell out of things people said, and I don’t know if it’ll ever stop bothering me knowing that half the stuff I said he probably assumed I actually meant some whole other thing 😭
Does it make you crazy when you sense that people are analyzing your words looking for hidden meanings and insinuations? Because almost nothing makes me more crazy than saying exactly wtf I mean and knowing someone is going to try and figure out what I *really* mean by it!! There’s nothing to figure out!! 🤣
Yessss omg when someone says something multiple different ways to make a single point I struggle so hard not to be like “I got it the first time and I’m currently on my eleventh train of thought just waiting for you to wrap it up” lmao it’s a shame we can’t 2x speed conversations the way we can videos!
Your Aries Mercury interpretation resonates with me! I can’t stand when people try and talk with a lot of layers and undertones and hidden meanings. Just give it to me straight gatdammit! My brain doesn’t want to have to analyze people’s words and I don’t want my words to be analyzed. I love talking to other Aries Mercury people because I know we’re both just saying what we mean, and the conversation moves lightning fast which matches my brain’s usual speed. And yes I have to make a very conscious effort not to dominate the conversation when I’m talking to less fiery people lol. That’s probably why every single person I’ve ever dated has been a triple fire sign guy. No one else can keep up with me 😂
It’s making me crazy. I can’t imagine that thousands and thousands of Redditors are organically interested in coming here and r/UFOs just to shit on everything lol. Most people in real life are either interested and curious or they’re not even thinking about it.
Oh I’m happy to hear that! Can I ask the gist of what they said? Im rooting for ya
I have similar placements. Pisces sun and Capricorn moon. For me, I will forgive and give second chances for as long as I can. Often at the expense of my own well-being. But there’s a certain amount of hurt that I just can’t move past, even if I want to. It’s not that I don’t forgive them, I do. But I’m deeply sensitive and if I’ve opened my heart to someone and given them my trust, only to end up being betrayed. It’s like my heart just can’t go back to feeling safe with them again, no matter how much I miss them. We love *deeply* whether we want to or not, so we’re too open and vulnerable with those we love to only let someone in halfway. That’s why Pisces tend to be all-or-nothing in their intimate connections.

But I would imagine they appreciate that you apologized and acknowledged your mistakes, even if they haven’t responded. We Pisces tend to withdraw when we’re hurting and sometimes it just takes a long time for us to come back out of our solitude. So it’s possible they just need some time. Good luck buddy 💕
It’s the weirdest feeling when it happens. I had something similar but I (think I) remember the whole thing. I was taking my kids on a road trip and I set my GPS to our destination 3 hours away. We only took one quick bathroom stop, and we didn’t cross any time zones, or make any wrong turns. It was just a straight shot on the interstate. And yet somehow when we arrived I realized that it had taken us almost 6 hours to get there. The weirdest part was that I didn’t notice any signs of the time being off until we arrived. How did I lose 3 hours when I was conscious and checking the clock regularly? It messed with my brain so bad lol.
Well it means a lot to me that you took the time!! This project is important to me and I listened to those specific parts so many times but my brain just tapped out lol. So thank you again, fellow interpreter of drawls:)
Thank you! I’m glad my rural upbringing came in handy for something haha :)
I craved salt and vinegar chips like crazy when I was pregnant with my daughter. I’d never liked them before and suddenly couldn’t get enough. And ever since she’s started eating big kid food she’s been obsessed with anything vinegar based. Olives, pickles, chips. I feel like she was sending me the cravings lol
Oh damn that’s right I forgot about that story! Poor lady:( I read a transcript of a past life hypnosis session one time where the woman under hypnosis said she intentionally incarnates in areas where a disaster will occur, specifically so that when the disaster occurs, she can help souls cross over. Because when it happens so quickly and in a scary way like that some souls just have a hard time letting go. Really interesting to think about.
Really interesting you say that. I feel like there’s a lot of different species and they have different intentions and approaches. I wrote [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Experiencers/comments/157vbvh/nhi_and_our_consciousness/jt6xxp6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3) yesterday about something similar (but from a benevolent species) that I saw last month.
Oh wow that’s really interesting, that makes sense. My late grandfather was a pilot in the Korean War. Wish I could ask him more about his experiences. Thank you for sharing this, I hadn’t seen this before.
Silverback gorillas can lift over 4000 pounds.
Isn’t that love and light the best feeling ever? If it was a drug I’d never stop taking it lol.
Ahhh this is awesome thank you SO so much!!! At 1:20 I was thinking he said assholes too but I wasn’t sure. Your translation makes sense especially since there were other people on the River that night. Are you from the Deep South too? I thought more people would be able to help but I guess the accent is more of a barrier than I thought lol. I’m from Mississippi. Thanks again:)
I think it would be tricky for a lot of native speakers to understand as well, so no worries!! I grew up not too far from where this occurred so it’s a very familiar dialect to me.
Ahhhh I think you’re right!! Thank you so much.
True. I’ve had my own experiences but thankfully they’ve all been overwhelmingly positive in nature. My heart goes out to people who have been through something like this.
The older guy (Hickson) actually said quite a bit more in his testimony than the younger man. If you scroll to the bottom of [this article](https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2020/07/13/pascagoula-ufo-alien-abduction-case-interview-recording-has-surfaced/3264064001/) you’ll find a longer recording where Hickson gives his full testimony. Parker was in a panicked state and had difficulty remaining calm enough to be interviewed. Understandably. This brief moment where he’s alone with his friend in private is the bulk of his communication that night. These recordings weren’t released until 2020 and Parker has said that listening to them made him regret that he wasn’t able to say more at that time.
That line makes me really sad too. And the way they keep saying that no one will believe them. I can’t imagine going through something so traumatizing and then have to worry about being mocked and treated like I was crazy or lying for attention.
Dang that’s annoying, thanks for letting me know. It’s just the website for the state newspaper so idk why it’s doing that. It does work on a computer though fwiw
Just a heads up, [the video of the conversation](https://www.clarionledger.com/videos/news/2020/07/13/charles-hickson-calvin-parker-recorded-talking-alien-abduction-pascagoula-river/5409533002/) doesn’t seem to work well on mobile:/
People say something like that in every post about these two. Makes me crazy. *”I bet they were gay!!”* Like okay and?  Even if they were, doesn’t change the fact that they shared an extremely strange and traumatizing event. Juvenile.
They worked together and Hickson owned land in Parker’s hometown. Not sure what you’re implying, but it isn’t unusual for people of different ages to share a hobby. Whatever happened, it wasn’t good. Parker was so distressed he literally started trying to climb the walls during part of their interview. Hickson said repeatedly that he knew he’d become a laughingstock for sharing his story but he felt it was important. I guess he was right considering 50 years later the first thing you do is suggest that them being abducted would be better than them having an affair.
I understand the dialect but I don’t have any audio tools. If you want to try and help me decipher that would be amazing, [here’s a transcript I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/157wi6e/transcript_of_private_conversation_between_ufo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)
[I’m from Mississippi so it’s easy for me lol. Here’s my transcript](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/157wi6e/transcript_of_private_conversation_between_ufo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)
Yeah Hickson’s final comment is quite chilling. I feel so bad for them:(
It’s in the second link in my post, or [you can click here:)](https://www.clarionledger.com/videos/news/2020/07/13/charles-hickson-calvin-parker-recorded-talking-alien-abduction-pascagoula-river/5409533002/) for some reason it doesn’t seem to work well on mobile though
At 2:20 I think he says something about setting a new medical record. That was a common joke people would make about any unusual physical condition when I was growing up in Mississippi. But I left it blank because I’m not sure.
The most common themes I’ve heard are that we should be nicer to each other and take better care of our planet. As for mass communication, I had a really vivid astral experience about a month ago that was along those lines, but more subtle. I saw a lot of different types of “alien” beings communicating subconsciously with millions of people on Earth. Individually. They would reveal a bit of information or visualization of themselves and then ask “Do you feel calm?” If the individual was still calm, they’d reveal a little more. Repeat and repeat. It’s been interesting over the last month to see soooo many people posting that they’re suddenly having personal experiences with UAP or visions of beings in their dreams, after a lifetime of not having any experiences like that. Seems to correlate with what I saw.
People say this after miscarriages, too. “You can get pregnant again!” I’m so sorry for the loss of your husband. Sending you love <3
That’s gut wrenching. I truly can’t imagine. I am so very sorry for your loss.
I’m really sorry for all you’ve been through. Please feel free to message me anytime. I care <3
I’m so sorry for your loss. Are there any memories of her you’d like to share? No pressure, just know that I care <3 I have a 6 year old and the thought of someone that little going through that hurts my heart.
You’re so welcome! I’m happy I could help 💕 feel free to reach out if they give you any more trouble, but hopefully they’ll move along now 😊
Weird seeing this today. I was literally just looking for this picture last night. I always wondered if he knew he was dead and doing it as a joke, or if he thought he was still alive and just participating like everybody else.
Hello fellow fireball!! I’m curious how a Gemini Mars, Aries Venus, Aqua moon would be like in relationships? Do you like to keep it moving or do you seek longterm?
I like my Aries stellium (Mars, Mercury and Venus) because it helps me be brave AF, energetic, and confident. And I like my Libra rising and Pisces sun placements because they make me polite and empathetic and with all that Aries energy I’d probably be an obnoxious asshole without them 😂
Sometimes past life memories can come up via dreams. Could you tell what era of history it was, what country? Just a possibility to consider.
No problem, I’m glad it was helpful! You can say it out loud or just in your own mind. They feel the energy more than anything, so just be kind but firm about it. If you sense that something more negative might have come in, you can always do some basic cleansing rituals. Sprinkle a little salt in the corners of your rooms, burn incense, sage or cedar (be sure to get the corners and closets), and say something like “I bless my home, and I allow only the highest and purest energies of love and light within these walls.” That should do it 💕😊
It could be one of two things: you have anxiety about your hobby and how it might affect you if spirits become attached to you, and that anxiety transferred into your sleep and gave you this dream. OR you actually did attract some spirits to you and they are now using your dream state to ask you for help. 

I would take a break from this hobby for a bit if I were you. Some people are just more open in terms of being able to receive contact from the other side, and you may be one of them. Which means that any time you do this, you’re opening yourself up to a lot of new energies who may be needy or clingy. Remember that you’re allowed to have boundaries with spirits. You can try to encourage them to go home/cross over on their own, or you can just ask them to leave and not come back. If you’re feeling generous you can look into ways to help spirits cross over, but that’s not foolproof as many of them don’t actually want to cross over and may just be wanting your attention.
Very much so. When I was a child I’d have very intense waves of a memory-like feeling from the 1960’s come over me. I was born in 1985 but this feeling would get triggered randomly and I’d think “this is exactly what it felt like in the 60’s.” I was always taught that reincarnation isn’t real so I never knew what to make of those feelings, but it sure felt real. Fast forward to a few years ago, and I started doing past life regressions. One of the 4 lifetimes I’ve seen ended with me dying in the mid to late 1960’s.

I’ve had that nostalgic feeling at other times too, though. Usually very random and intangible. And I wonder if maybe there’s just lots of little bits of memories from many different lifetimes lingering in there.
Have you ever tried a past life regression meditation on YouTube?
I’m collecting data on these orange orbs and I have a question for you and OP if you don’t mind:) did you see these orbs near pine trees?
My 6 year old son likes to tell me that I’m the most beautiful girl in the world and everybody loves me. My 9 year old daughter asks me to wait for her when I die so we can go to our next life together. Gah I love my babies so much.. just writing this is making me emotional!
Awesome, thank you so much! [This is why I’m asking,](https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/1559bpx/have_you_ever_seen_a_ufo_yes_or_no/jstsgbb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3) if you’re curious:)
Seems like there’s a lot of sightings of them in that area! I’m asking because they seem to show up around pine trees a large percentage of the time. Thanks for answering:)
It doesn’t sound nutty to me:) Do you happen to live near pine trees?
Were they pine trees, by chance?
Were the orange orbs near any pine trees?
Were the orange orbs flying near pine trees?
He became an alcoholic and his life just kinda spiraled. [Here’s an article his son wrote.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alien-abduction-ufo-wyoming-father_n_6495ddc9e4b02f808ab5a8dc?utm_source=digg)
Get out
Thank you so much for sharing your story. I know it takes a lot of courage to do so, especially when you know you’ll be met with negative responses. It’s part of why so many of us hesitate to speak out at all. I believe this is by design, and I’m highly suspicious of the number of commenters who jump to discredit people before they’ve even had time to read and reflect on the post. A lot of them could be getting paid. Others are afraid to consider that reality might not work the way they thought and they are repelled by any other way of thinking about things. Or they just think that they sound really smart by saying things like this aren’t possible, despite the fact that it’s becoming quite clear that they are indeed possible. 

The people who are genuinely curious will consider your perspective and appreciate your input. And those of us who have had our own experiences already know that your story makes a lot of sense.
I love u tooo bb!
If he’d given a lot of exciting information you’d say it was too fantastic to be real. I think the “boring” aspect lends credibility. You’re complaining that he’s not using acronyms but why should he when he knows he’s talking to civilians? And the compartmentalization of information is critical to understanding part of why people don’t speak up more often. They only know little bits of the story. Obviously you’re free to believe whatever you want. I just don’t think the reasons you stated alone are enough to discredit him.
WOW I love that!! Thank you for telling me. The fact that they were actually climbing one when it happened is really cool
I’ve seen two different versions that ultimately reflected the same thing. The more detailed one I talked about in the [fourth paragraph of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/7kcsq5/i_feel_like_i_was_healed_of_some_inherited_trauma/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) The best answer I can give you based on my own experiences is that there’s no hell like we think of in religious and cultural traditions. Dark and light are two sides of the same coin. If you’re holding onto a great deal of darkness, then when you pass you may be too dark to be able to be taken up by the light. It’s not the light punishing you or pushing you away. You’re pushing yourself away. This isn’t a permanent condition. At most it’s a momentary experience of deep darkness that makes the light finally seem much more attractive to you. So you let go of the darkness you’re holding onto and are then able to move into the the absolute unconditional love and acceptance of the light. 

Again, this is just my experience:)
I too have stepped on rogue metal mini Minecraft figures. They make LEGO feel like stepping on a cloud.
Yeah I was hopeful about that one too BUT I did make a lot of new friends with Jupiter in Aries
Well with the north node in our 7th houses it’s a very opportune time for us Libra risings to meet someone special or get married 🥰Good luck!
I feel so bad for people like this. Imagine having a completely disorienting, terrifying experience and then being mocked and accused of lying for attention when you seek help. I read a story recently about a rancher who experienced sightings and mutilations of his cattle and he turned into a running joke in his town because everybody thought he was a loony. He died homeless. It’s a shame how many people have probably been through this and died without ever being believed:’(
Wow!!! This is so interesting. I might make a post just for this phenomena because it seems like there’s a correlation there for sure. Do you happen to have any video? A friend of mine [got this video (this is a slow motion version)](https://streamable.com/cm859v) Look familiar?
Awww they’re so cute lol I love them and their love for pine trees! [This is a slow mo clip](https://streamable.com/cm859v) of a sighting. Were they similar to this?
That’s so cool, thank you so much for sharing!! Did it look anything [like this?](https://streamable.com/cm859v)
If it makes you feel better they seem really nice and I’ve only read positive encounters with them:)
Oooo fascinating! What did it look like, and did you see it’s movements?
I don’t know exactly! Last month I had a very vivid dream about these orange orb UAP and they kept telling me they like pine trees. About a week later my 9 year old daughter had a dream about going to an orange planet on a spaceship and the planet had orange pine trees. Mind you I hadn’t said anything to her about my dream. I’ve asked 2 people I know who have seen them in person and both sightings were near pine trees. So now I’m just collecting data out of curiosity 🍊🌲🧐
Same. I saw 3 UAP traveling together one time. And 3 other sightings of a single UAP.
Those are my favorite! Were you near any pine trees, by chance?
It’s only unthinkable because it’s hard to imagine something we know nothing about. They might not even need food/air/sunlight the way we do. They might source all their basic needs from the depths of the ocean. Or from another planet entirely. So many possibilities.
Ughghhh I understand!! Mine are 6 and 9 so they’re older, but at *all* ages once they start socializing it is so hard to see them deal with any kind of rejection. We see their hopes and expectations for interacting with others and we just want it to work out perfectly for them every time and of course that’s not always possible :’( 

But know that by giving her space to talk about it (even if she can’t say much!) you are showing her that you’re there to support her socially and emotionally. I did the same with my littles at that age and they still want to talk to me about everything they have going on friends, bullies, etc because they know we can process and problem solve together.

You sound like a wonderful mama 💕
Yes! The “debunked” comments are everywhere and you can tell half the time they aren’t even reading or watching the thing they’re claiming is debunked. I saw someone post a compilation video of dozens and dozens of UAP sightings. Someone responded “That sighting is debunked” and had a ton of upvotes.
My parents made this discovery about grapes. They’d both been buying red grapes for decades thinking the other preferred red. They both prefer green.
I believe so too. Amazing post and thanks for making it. Those of us who have already experienced things and are used to the idea that we’re not alone will be very much needed in helping others stay calm and adjust.
Feel free to message me if you’d like someone to talk to <3
This story started out so sad and ended up so happy!! I feel awkward at kids parties but I try to take my kids to all of them for this reason. The thought of a kid having no friends show up breaks my heart!
I never thought I’d see this either. I’m delighted and grateful.
Hahaha gotcha, that’s how he seems to be as well. Heavy on the analysis! I don’t have the patience for that so I tend to take people at face value unless I have evidence they habitually lie. Thanks for sharing your perspective!
I have a question for you. Are you able to realize/believe that other people are telling the truth? I’m an Aries Mercury, Venus and Mars so being direct and honest is my specialty. My ex was a Leo sun and Mercury and he lied a LOT. And I always wonder if he was assuming that I was lying just as much as him. Like does he think that’s just how everybody is? It’s weird to think how many times I might have said something in complete honesty that, if he was projecting his dishonesty onto me, he would have incorrectly decided I was lying or meant something else entirely. I noticed he did this a lot when he was talking about something someone else said to him. Like “Oh she said XYZ but she was probably just trying to make me think ABC” and I wondered why he always assumed deception/ulterior motive until I realized that he does that a lot himself lol. 

Not saying you’re exactly like him or anything and no judgement from me either way! I’m just wanting to understand how this trait plays out in your relationships and expectations of others:)
Ooo that’s such a good point!! Strikes are very Aries energy and they’re fighting for fairness and justice, both Libra things!  Will definitely be interesting to see how else this dichotomy will show up over the next year and a half.
Ope! It’s fixed now - thank you!!
Mine too! We get a double dose of these energies with our houses there. Last time we had this transit I met the father of my two babies. I have Libra in 1st and Aries in 7th. Are you a Libra or Aries rising?
Yes exactly! When they’re unevolved they’ll fake confidence and try to impress however they can. Lying, pretending to be someone they’re not, hiding their feelings, “borrowing” other people’s jokes and anecdotes, etc. But once they learn to accept themselves and feel real confidence from within, they’re able to stand boldly in their true self.
Here’s some info that can be helpful for reflecting on how these might effect us as a collective as well as personally. The past and current dates that we had this transit are:


North Node Aries / South Node Libra

Jan 27, 1949 – Jul 26, 1950

Aug 20, 1967 – Apr 19, 1969

Apr 7, 1986 – Dec 2, 1987

Dec 27, 2004 – Jun 22, 2006

July 18, 2023 –January 11, 2025

And the dates where we had the opposite alignment:


North Node Libra/South Node Aries

Jun 17, 1958 – Dec 15, 1959

Jan 8, 1977 – Jul 5, 1978

Aug 1, 1995 – Jan 25, 1997

February 19, 2014 – November 11, 2015

October 15, 2032 – May 22, 2032

And of course, knowing which houses you have those signs in will help you know the areas of your life these energies will be influencing :)
Thank you! 😊 I’m excited about this transit. But I’m a Libra rising with Mars, Mercury and Venus in Aries so admittedly I’m biased towards that combo 👠🔥
I attended the Austin one and I really enjoyed it. It feels so good to be able to share openly and not have to worry about being judged. /u/Metacarpals1 did a great job of providing a bit of structure, while also kind of letting the group lead itself. Knowing that there was no pressure to share, or to even be an experiencer, was nice. I wasn’t really planning to share at all, but the vibe was so accepting that I ended up sharing a lot more than I thought I would!
Don’t worry about “losing” the girls who would say it’s a turnoff for you to ask first. If someone doesn’t appreciate that you’re being respectful of their boundaries, then they’re immature and not worth your effort.
That’s so sweet:’) I understand that feeling. I hope you two find your way back to each other soon.
I’m sorry it didn’t work out, I know how much it hurts to feel that deep passion and connection but end up apart:( I believe we are destined to meet certain people at certain points in our lives. Some people we meet lifetime after lifetime. It’s possible you’ll end up together again in this life or the next. The most important thing is that you’re continuing to grow and evolve through each life. If/when you two meeting up and being together can contribute to your growth, then it will happen.
I just went to look for it and inadvertently discovered you’re in Austin? Me too! We have an Austin Experiencers meetup every other week and it’s really fun to share/hear people’s stories if you’re ever interested in joining:)
Especially if it’s a highfalutin rigamarole.
Thanks for sharing your story. /r/Experiencers is a really supportive community that might interest you:) you’re definitely not alone!
I’ve experienced this in my own way. Isn’t it incredible? I’ve often thought that if everyone on earth could just experience that feeling of infinite love, and how it really is the answer to everything, the world would never be the same. Once you’ve experienced it you can never forget the infinite power of love. Thank you for sharing <3
Maybe so! I’ve already had 3 of those via psychedelics and meditation so I’d like to think I’ve learned enough from those experiences but hey, why not go for another round 😂 There’s always more to learn!
That does help:) Honestly I wouldn’t even mind dying young if it wasn’t for my children. I just don’t want them to go through that. I really appreciate your comment and I’m happy you’re still here <3
For a long time I’ve had a feeling that I would die at age 42, which will be in 2027. So seeing all these predictions that something massive will happen that year has been kinda freaking me out lol. I’m hoping that I’ve just been sensing that it will be a life-changing year and my brain interpreted that as “I’m gonna die!”
Hey we have 2 of the same big 3! I feel like people are naturally drawn to Libra risings because we tend to have a friendly, welcoming vibe. We also have good social skills and we’re usually pretty to look at. I have a flirty energy with almost everybody without meaning to. It’s just how I am! So I have to be careful or I’ll accidentally make people think I’m super into them when I’m just trying to be fun and friendly.
I feel bad for him bc he’s clearly highly anxious but it’s also kind of hilarious. “We’re not saying what they are, or what they’re not!!” It’s like he was told he has to say something, but he’s in big trouble if he says too much, so he’s just stuttering and waving them long fingers around with one hand while gripping the podium for dear life with the other.
I wondered that as well! Could the dangerous looking planet they were trying to escape to (second to last paragraph on the last page) be earth though? Maybe the atmosphere, flora and fauna of earth a million years ago just looked so different that the remote viewer didn’t recognize it? The political aspect would make sense as well.
Thank you for sharing this. I’m so fascinated by the history of Mars. I’ve read accounts from so, so many people via dreams, remote viewing, past life regressions, etc that tell of a time when the atmosphere of Mars became corrupted and everyone had to leave. Have you ever seen [this document from the CIA](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf) where they had a remote viewer go to Mars? If not, I think you’d enjoy it!
I want that myself sometimes! I was super enthusiastic about being dominated and even encouraged him to go all out with it for quite a while. But we were 3 years into our relationship at that point and I *really* wanted to experience more intimacy and to feel special and loved in bed. He was very clearly upset so I tried to ask why, and he said liked the way we were already doing it too much and didn’t want to stop. I said we could still do that sometimes too, I just wanted to feel special and loved at least *some of* the times. Nothing changed:(
Yeah porn in general is a.. well it’s a whole can of worms and you covered a of a lot of my issues with it already. I used to try and be cool with it but the more I learned about it the more horrified I became. There’s ways to create content ethically but that seems to be a low priority for the vast majority of the people running the industry. 

And the psychological impact of having young guys grow up watching these videos where women being treated like garbage is normal really does scare me. Them growing up to be bad in bed is probably on the milder side of the negative effects that can have. It’s actually kind of comically delusional, these guys that think it’s totally cool of them to be selfish in bed FOR REAL and not just for role play. 

I actually do enjoy role playing and experimenting with dynamics but it *has* to be consensual and agreed upon beforehand. And if you are going to balk and act all disappointed because I’d like you to be as enthusiastic about my pleasure as I have been about yours then okay then, bye! 

And as you mentioned I also feel bad that porn makes guys feel less than for not having gigantic schlong. It really and truly makes no difference to me about size, if anything I prefer smaller bc I’m small. I feel like most men these days wouldn’t even believe it’s possible for a woman to prefer smaller, which makes me sad for them.
I feel like the absence of actual intimacy in porn is affecting some people’s behavior/expectations in bed very badly. I asked my last partner if he would slow down and stop acting  dominant and aggressive every single time so we could like. You know. Be more romantic, sensual, really connect as equal partners. By the way he reacted to this request you’d think I’d asked him to do advanced calculus in bed. Like he was turned off, confused and disappointed when I was *literally just asking for more sensual, reciprocal sex*
She does have trouble sleeping! She likes games and she’s very creative. The biggest challenge for her is sticking with something even if it doesn’t work out perfectly right away. Like yesterday she had an idea for a Weirdcore image she wanted to create. The instant the photo editing app didn’t do what she wanted it to do she was like “This is impossible! I’m done!!” 😂 and I never know how much I should push her to see things through or just let it go.
Definitely possible! For now I think we just have to focus on growth and healing. That’s the surest way to have a healthy relationship in the future, whether it’s with her or someone else. Good luck friend:)
I’m sorry it didn’t work out. I know it hurts.
Yes I definitely know that feeling! Have you ever considered hypnosis or a regression mediation?
A little over 3 years. What about yours?
My daughter is a Gemini sun/moon too! She’s 9 years old. Any parenting advice? 😅
That happened to me in reverse. My ex boyfriend and I had a life-changing connection. I heard his voice while I was meditating one day and then met him about 6 months later. When I first heard him speak I recognized him as the mystery voice and it blew my mind. We were deeply in love but he pushed me away and hurt me in so many different ways. Like he just couldn’t let go of his old mindsets and his single bro lifestyle to have a true partnership of love and trust with me. I don’t know why either. 

I think there’s certain people we’re destined to meet at a certain time. But if one person in the connection isn’t ready, it just doesn’t work out. But either way, you’ll both grow as a result of coming together for a time and that’s what’s most important.
That fits with a lot of people’s experiences very well, thank you for sharing! Memory wipes are so common. Do you have any feelings when you think back on the experience, good or bad?
Awww man that’s such a cute lil interaction!! 🥰🛸 I totally get it, I get the happiest giggles when I see them! It’s such a thrill. Like the feeling of being a little kid again and making a new bestie
Very good point. Between advancing AI, nukes, and climate crisis we are at quite the critical tipping point for humanity. We could really use some assistance from our more advanced and evolved space homies
Yes indeed. I think that might be one of the biggest ontological shock factors of disclosure- that they’re not just coming down from the sky. They’ve also been right there in our oceans for ..who knows how long!
Ohh my goshhh!! That’s so cool!! I can’t sleep tonight either so I’m happy you shared this right away and I get to be excited with you:):) Was there a color or shape? Tell them hi from me pls!
I’m so intrigued. That exact timeframe was one of the most significant turning points in my life. Leading up to that time I’d been quite depressed. In large part because my marriage was so difficult.

In October I got a completely unexpected job opportunity to go work on a Netflix show, so I  went to LA for 3 weeks. This gave me alone time that I’d not had in years to reflect on my true feelings, and realize just how unhappy I was.

Then I got to experience DMT for the first time, and I met aliens who told me how to find my own happiness in life. It very much changed me . So in November I finally started facing my unhappy relationship head on. (We ended up filling for divorce about 4 months later.)
 
In December I got another work opportunity, and met someone who right away helped me healing my childhood trauma. I grew a lot, and very quickly in those months. I was kinda suddenly able take the reins of my life and find my own happiness in a way that I hadn’t really even considered possible before.

Would love to hear your thoughts on this timeframe if you’re open to sharing!
You might be comforted by the things Paul Hellyer (former Canadian Minister of Defense) has said about them. He’s said that there are many (up to 80 was his estimate) benevolent NHI that have been visiting us for many years, and only maybe 1 or 2 not-so-nice ones. He also said that from their perspective we’re the ones who are a violent threat to ourselves and our planet. They want to help us advance, with our consent, but we haven’t responded super well so far. 

Essentially the exact opposite of a scary invasion movie lol
It’s not a stupid question at all and you brought up an interesting point. The number of UAP sightings and incidents increased pretty dramatically after we started dropping the big bombs. And as you said, there’s been many reports of them shutting down nuclear facilities. I suspect that the bombs probably alerted a lot of NHI who weren’t really paying us much attention before to start keeping an eye on us.
Awww. I’m sure she appreciates all you did to take care of her over the years! That’s really sweet that she’s checking in with you <3
This is purely speculation, but I wonder if at least some of the NHI are forcing our leaderships hand in some way. Or if they anticipate an event or increase in activity such that they won’t be able to hide it anyway, so they’re trying to get ahead of the game.
Well a lucid dream begins by realizing that you’re in a dream. Having full control is just something you can work up to once you have the ability to recognize that you’re in a dream. So it’s still technically a lucid dream even if you aren’t able to control it yet. Lots of people have to work just to get to the point where they can realize they’re in a dream, so you’re ahead of the game:)
It’s a lucid dream. There’s lots of techniques for learning how to control it! Check out the lucid dreaming sub.
Aww, this is lovely to hear. Thank you 💕 and no worries! If and when you feel like sharing your experiences we’re here for it ya:)
The type of people who mock others and pick apart people’s appearances, behaviors and actions as if they’re soooo much better. It’s a sure sign of insecurity and it’s very unpleasant to be around. Not to mention it’s pretty much guaranteed that if they talk shit behind other people’s backs, they’re talking shit behind your back too. Just gross.
Bystander apathy is crazy. A few months ago I had to break up a fist fight between two middle school aged boys while a bunch of dads twice my size just stood around lol. I’m glad you were there and acted quickly!
I relate, I have a 6 year old son who sees things as well! It’s hard to say what type of entity it is, but dark energies feed off of fear so unfortunately kids who are perceptive to that world make easy targets. Traditional methods of cleansing (blessing, smudging, salt in the corners, etc) are often very helpful. You can also help him exercise spiritual boundaries by going to the space where he saw it and telling the entity that it’s not welcome in your home and it needs to move along. Do this with love (which is repellent to them) and firmness. No anger, as they feed off that as well. Sometimes I’ll also visualize white light pouring out of my hands and sort of sweeping them out the door or windows with my hands. It seems to work really well, now he just comes and finds me when he sees something so I can kick it out for him lol. But I’m working on empowering him to do it too.
The majority of dreams are made by your subconscious mind as it’s trying to work through your feelings. Some dreams can be premonitions, but given your anxiety about this situation and your past trauma, I’d say this is just your brain trying to help you confront your fears. It doesn’t mean it’ll happen again.
You’re so strong, congratulations on getting on the road to recovery! I recommend smudging, which is where you use smoke to cleanse the room. I like to burn cedar, but sage or any kind of incense works. Make sure to get it in the corners. You can sprinkle salt in the corners as well. Most importantly, know that you can practice boundaries with entities just like you do with people. Be kind but firm and let them know that only the highest, most benevolent energies are welcome in your space. I suggest doing this regularly. And do your best not to feel anger or fear towards any negative energies, they like to feed off that. Love and light are repellent to dark energy, so imagining a beam of light coming from your heart and surrounding yourself and the room can really help as well.

Edit: one more thing.. you should do what’s best for you so just disregard this if it’s not helpful! But there’s a lot of ways besides Catholicism to connect with higher energies and grow spiritually. I was raised Christian and while I still appreciate the teachings of loving others and doing good, I’ve found that exploring spirituality apart from religion has been the most beneficial thing I’ve ever done.
I love this story, thank you for sharing. It’s incredibly common for people who have passed on to use the dream state to visit loved ones. I saw my grandfather about a month after he passed, early in the morning when I was just starting to wake up. I told him I was sad that he couldn’t be there to see us grandkids grow up, and that my baby sister had started walking and he missed it. And he just smiled and said “I know she started walking, I can check in on y’all from time to time!” Fast forward about 20 years and he showed back up to comfort me when I was going through a rough time. He appeared to my mom and my sister in law as well. 

Don’t worry about your words to him being less than perfect. He can feel your immense love for him very clearly <3
Vibrations are everything. If someone is in a low vibration (angry, afraid) then it’s unlikely that a benevolent spirit will be able to connect with them. So he probably tried to but couldn’t.
He may have been ready to cross over and just needed to do that first! It’s really nice that they give specific references, I feel like that helps a lot. My friend’s dad said he was going to wait for her before he fully crossed over :’) so maybe that’s why he had time to wait around and communicate more than usual. 

I’m sure you brought his mom so much comfort. And him as well!
Yeah pretty much! I was doing yoga and then out of nowhere I felt the presence of an older man, I couldn’t see him exactly but I could just tell he was a nice old guy. He basically just said “can you get Kelsey for me?” Like he wanted to talk to her through me. I’ve received messages from spirits before, but never as out of the blue as this one. I was hesitant so I stalled for like a week but the whole time I could just feel him waiting patiently lol. So I finally reached out to her and she was super open about it and invited me over. Almost as soon as I got there messages just started pouring in about all kinds of things. Lots of specific references and of course just general love and comfort. They were incredibly close and he’d died suddenly so she hadn’t really gotten to say goodbye.

It’s really an honor to be able to help people in that way. I’m open to doing it again but it hasn’t happened since.
I’ve wondered this about sightings. If everybody has them but only the people who are able to handle the experience actually retain the memories. 

I recently posted about a UAP sighting I had with another person, where I felt calm and happy when we saw it but he kinda freaked out. A couple years later, he’d completely forgot about the experience. But he remembers a previous sighting we had together perfectly fine. And it just so happens that he was pretty calm when we had that sighting. So I posted on another sub and found that a lot of people have had the same experience where they remember but their co-experiencer freaked out and then later seemed to forget. Very curious.
I’m so excited for you! I love your metaphor of the butterfly, that’s beautiful 🥰
It sounds like we are seeing very similar things, with the sparkles and blueish purplish orbs!! I see the black flecks as well sometimes, but not coming from people, at least not that I’ve noticed. The sparkles and orbs feel sooo benevolent to me. I do feel like they are beings of some kind, possibly from other dimensions which is why we’re not able to see their full form. I love them. I always giggle and say hi lol 🤗
Wow, thank you for sharing. It sounds like you had an awful lot on your plate at that time, i wonder if they were helpers of some kind showing up for you and your family.
That’s so cool that you saw them together! What size were they?
That’s adorable :’) I hope you two have many happy years together!
That’s really sad, but so lovely that you were able to receive the message and pass it along to her. I once received a message from my friend’s dad who had recently passed. I’d never met him so I was surprised he came to me, and like you I was worried about sounding crazy, but it meant a lot to my friend. I think some souls just linger until they can find a way to pass along some comfort to their loved ones. Thank you for helping him <3
Not being able to spoon is the hardest challenge I face as a single person right now:(
“There’s just 1 flying around San Diego now. There were like 20 of them earlier!”
/u/DudeManThing1983 Totally understand that this one is anecdotal! If you guys are interested in the subject, y’all might enjoy checking out the research done by Dr Jim Tucker and Dr Ian Stevenson into past life recollection [that’s been done at the University of Virginia](https://med.virginia.edu/perceptual-studies/dops-staff/jim-tuckers-bio/) for many decades. They’ve compiled a staggering number of children who recalled very specific details (including the names of family members, where they lived, what their house looked like, their occupation, etc) that were later matched to real life people. Interestingly the memories seem to disappear by around age seven. [This particular publication has some cool stories.](https://med.virginia.edu/perceptual-studies/wp-content/uploads/sites/360/2015/11/REI32-Tucker_keil-1.pdf)
Ooo that’s intriguing. Was it moving at all?
Oooo that’s very interesting that your optometrist hears that from patients a lot! Pinpoints of light is a good way to describe it. I don’t know what they are either but I usually call them “angel sparkles” lol because they feel so benevolent to me.
Have you noticed any patterns in when/where you see them?
Same!! This just brought back deeply repressed memories lol
Wow I’d never heard of this one before. That’s sad but also really cool. RIP and congrats on getting your justice Ms Zona.
“Why does it feel like I have a snake in my forehead” is my new favorite google search I’ve ever seen lol. Congrats on your awakening! As you probably know by now you’re in very good company.

https://preview.redd.it/6tm1km8qftbb1.jpeg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63d444aa3872494f3b9b193c3335073fafc139c4
What do they look like?
Wow - this is amazing! I’m so happy you shared. Isn’t it incredible how once you become open and willing, the path unfolds with such mind blowing discoveries, synchronicities and experiences? I love that you were able to help get the man’s message to Leonard :’) I often think about how good it must feel to spirits who have passed on to be able to find an open channel to communicate to their loved ones through. 

Also, Artemis was one of the first beings I connected with as well! I just love her. Sounds like you have an incredibly special calling. I’m excited for you <3
Some souls are just extra motivated to get justice it seems! [Here’s a kinda similar story.](https://www.reincarnationresearch.com/reincarnation-case-of-an-israeli-child-who-recalled-being-killed-with-an-ax-identifies-his-past-life-murderer-who-confesses/) A 3 year old boy told his family that he was murdered with an axe in his last life. He took them to his former village, pointed out who killed him, then showed them where the body and the axe were buried.
I cried instantly!! It was so helpful for me and my kids to be able to talk about healing scary feelings leftover from their past experiences.
 My kids (6 and 9) and I just watched this one last night and it sent them both into a full blown existential crisis 😂 they were both running around yelling “What if WE’RE puppets?! What if WE’RE an animation?! What if people are watching OUR show?!!” It was amazing and hilarious.
In my experience you won’t see anything that you aren’t ready to see. The subconscious mind has a way of protecting you, which is why we don’t walk around with all the bad memories of all our lives all the time! I knew I had a particular traumatic past life and did a lot of regressions to try and figure out what happened, but I wasn’t able to see it for years. By that point I was ready though. And if you do decide to try it, remember to send yourself (past and present) lots of love. You may see something traumatic but it’s kind of like watching a movie, so you aren’t necessarily fully experiencing it as if it was happening again. And even though seeing difficult memories isn’t fun.. It’s been really helpful for me to identify where some of my fears and hangups came from and work through them. Just my thoughts, the most important thing is to do what feels right to you!
That’s really cool, thank you for sharing this! It’s not uncommon at all for past life memories to come flooding up out of nowhere like that. If you’d like to see more of this lifetime, you can check out past life regression meditations on YouTube. You don’t have to be used to meditating for it to be helpful:) We live infinitely so for this particular memory to come back to you likely means there’s something you can learn from it, or something left over from that time that wants to heal within you. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Hope that helps in some way <3
We’re not even talking about weight you silly goose bot
Well there’s nothing wrong with that at all, finding the right balance for you is a lifetime journey, and it’s normal for levels to change and fluctuate. You can even learn to work with the energies to achieve certain things. I tend to utilize my masculine energy for completing tasks, communicating, and planning. My feminine energy i often use for listening, creating, and intuition. The most important thing is to send yourself lots of love and acceptance for who you are and how you feel, every day. There’s no right or wrong way to feel as long as you keep practicing loving yourself.
It’s really interesting that you have experienced a life as a man who felt and dressed feminine, and now it seems that you are experiencing the opposite in a way! Our souls want to grow and expand in each lifetime, so we very often will choose to have these opposite experiences in different ways. We will be rich, poor, attractive, unattractive, etc so that we can get to know our truest, deepest nature over time, which is ultimately not defined by any of those things. 

Perhaps part of what you’re learning is to accept and embrace both your masculine and feminine energies as one. It might help to learn more about these energies apart from the cultural perspectives. We all have both energies within us. Masculine energy is active, it helps you go forth and build! It’s an energy of doing. Feminine energy is receptive, it helps you receive and nurture things. It’s an energy of being. At our most evolved, we are able to balance both those energies within us beautifully, regardless of our outside appearances.
I’m so glad you’re here! Sounds like your journey is off to an amazing start:) First of all, I want to say that your intuition is your best guide, and from everything you’ve shared i feel you’re very well in tune with it. So I’ll share some of my experiences as they relate to yours, but of course- nothing I say is definitive so take what resonates and leave the rest. 

Your experience with the UAP is really cool and I relate to what you’re saying about how it wanted you to be able to see it! Isn’t that the most amazing thing? They’re very aware of us, and I’m glad they stopped by to say hi and get you started on your journey. I have also experienced a sudden burst of growth, dreams, and abilities after a visit. It almost seems as if part of their stopping by to see us sometimes is to give us a sort of personalized spiritual upgrade package.

The dreams could very well be a mix of things and again, your own intuition is key! If you feel that the one with the woman might have been a past life, then it very likely was. The apocalyptic one might have been a metaphor for your difficult childhood, or perhaps something else entirely.

I do believe that seeing flashes of light is a very common part of “waking up” process. We’re surrounded by dimensions and so much more we don’t normally see, but I think we’re all capable of seeing much more than we realize- and just becoming aware of that possibility can be a gateway to seeing more. I began seeing little white spots during the day when I first started meditating years ago. Now I also see Violet, blue, and gold ovals, as well white streaks. They always make me smile:) 

You’re exactly right to feel out the energy you accept in your space. Remember that you can have boundaries in the spirit realm too! The benevolent entities will respect that, as you’ve already experienced. When you aren’t sure if the vibes are right with a particular presence, try sending it love. The malevolent ones tend to be repelled by that, and the benevolent ones will appreciate it.

As for determining what sort of entity you encountered, it very well could be reptilian if that resonates with you. In general, I’d advise staying open minded and curious, because entities will make themselves more known to you when the time is right if it’s important for you to know. You may encounter things that you later discover many people have seen. You may also encounter things only you have seen! It’s a very big universe full of possibilities. 

Please feel free to message me any time if I can be of help! Thanks for sharing <3
Yay I’m glad it was helpful!
Sounds like you’re lingering in a meditative state before falling asleep. It’s like you describe, you are still conscious but your mind is able to see things without you having to imagine or really *do* anything. I highly recommend starting a meditation practice, it’s got so many benefits and you’re a natural:)
I used to have this same dream a lot! It depends on what’s going on in your life, but generally speaking it’s illustrating that you know you’re supposed be learning and growing, but you aren’t really sure *what* you should be learning or how you can learn what you need to know to be able to move forward in life. You might not be sure who to ask for guidance (trying to find the office) so you’re kind of in a limbo state. 

Does that resonate?
So thankful for this community 🥰 We appreciate all you guys do to provide us with a safe space to share and connect!
Right? Aries is literally the sign of the Warrior!
I have a Capricorn moon and Venus in Aries. I fall in love quite rarely but when I do, it happens very fast. And I try very hard (and often longer than I should) to make it last.
Absolutely. As far as sightings go I’ve had 3 separate UAP sightings with my kid’s dad. I tend to connect telepathically with people I’m dating, to varying degrees. And I’ve made 3 friends that I share dreams and mediation visions with. It’s really cool.
I definitely have flashbacks, but mostly during the day. Like you said, sometimes it’ll be a dream I haven’t thought about in years. I just randomly see the location of the dream in my mind’s eye and usually feel the primary emotion attached to the dream. Interestingly, I’ve found that when this happens with bad dreams, I can sort of tell my brain that I’ve seen enough of that one and would like to release it, and the flashbacks of that dream will stop. Took me years of uncomfortable repeating flashbacks to figure that out though!
Right like she has gossip and funny stories and opinions in there! The *last* thing she wants is secrecy!
My Scorpio sun/rising son *never* forgets an insult. When he was about 3 years old we went to a playground and a kid there refused to share his trucks. More than 2 weeks go by and i tell him we’re going back to the playground. He goes and gets his trucks and says “I not gonna share these”. I just know he was hoping that same kid would be there and he could give him a taste of his own medicine. 

My Gemini sun/moon daughter absolutely loves to learn and she will share interesting facts with anyone who will listen! She started keeping a journal but she writes “NOT PRIVATE!” on the front of each one and asks people if they’d like to read it all the time 🤣
Thank you for your kind words:) And worries at all! To be fair I have absolutely attracted creepy dudes who clearly *are* into me for that reason. So it’s certainly not always an untrue assumption. But some guys just genuinely like petite women for other reasons and I’m thankful for that.
It’s kinda weird reading this as a petite woman myself. Not picking on you, lots of people say this and I know you’re just explaining why the downvotes. It’s just weird and inadvertently insulting to hear that the only way someone would be attracted to me is if they’re a pedo.
I’m sorry people say things like that. I know how discouraging it can feel when you try and share only to be ridiculed. Just FYI /r/Experiencers is really cool and supportive place for people who have been through stuff like this:)
What makes you think so? If it makes you feel any better, from what I’ve seen doing that tends to backfire on people very badly.
I guess we’ll never know for sure, but it seems highly likely that her brother Burke did it. He had a lot of behavioral problems and had already beaten her with a golf club a year earlier. Not too much of a stretch to think he’d do it again with a flashlight:( Would also explain why the parents weren’t as adamant as you’d expect about getting the case solved.
I’m really sorry for your loss. I believe our loved ones can use dreams and other states of consciousness to connect with us. I’m sure he was very happy to see you too.
If that doesn’t work, give it a solk instead
Omg that’s awesome! I love your mom! I almost wonder if being petite in a world where physically threatening people are everywhere just makes our brains go “fuck it” at some point and then we become irrationally brave 🤣
I was about to offer my condolences but now I’m not sure what to offer. Congrats?
I got my big, muscley, drug-dealing neighbor to stop hitting and shoving his girlfriend into his car just by walking up and yelling at him to stop. I’m 5’4 and like 105 pounds. I think the unlikelihood of the fact that I was going right up to him, hollering like I could easily take him, must have made him assume I had a gun on me or something? I don’t know. But he looked legit startled and confused, and he backed off so I walked away with his girlfriend in peace. Then I drove her to her friend’s house. 

My sense of self-preservation in danger is not great lol I’ve put myself in a lot of situations where I could have been beat up or killed but so far it’s worked out just fine.
I believe we plan some things, including when we’re born, but with many possibilities left open. For example, perhaps you and another soul plan to meet at a certain point in your lives and become romantically involved. From there, you may end up breaking up, living happily ever after, or simply deciding to be friends. So the initial interactions are destined, but you can’t really determine what the outcome will be ahead of time. Too many variables. But regardless of the outcome, meeting your person will help you both grow in some way and that’s why it’s important.

Edit I missed your other question! I do think karma plays a huge role. But not in a punishing way. Our souls are meant to grow through each lifetime, so we probably can’t or won’t choose the same thing over and over. Like if you are given a lot of gifts in life like attractiveness, intelligence, material success, etc and then you use those gifts solely for your own benefit, or as a way to look down on others .. it will help your soul’s growth in the next life to experience what it’s like not to have all those gifts. So you can learn to how to be more community-minded, and that true happiness and self-worth comes from within.
I haven’t but I absolutely would!! Planning a wedding is just way too much… planning lol
I was excited to read the scientist’s account because it *perfectly* matched what I’ve seen from my past life regressions of my life on another planet. So for me it was comforting confirmation, but I understand how it could be unsettling. Just remember that whatever the truth is, it’s been that way your entire life. The only thing that’s changing is your awareness. Keep living your life to the fullest and stay grounded. You will be okay <3
I had a lot of strong Pluto aspects with my ex boyfriend. I felt a viscerally strong connection with him almost instantly. We’ve been broken up over a year and I still feel it. It’s tough. I wish things would have worked out with him because if it weren’t for his betrayal of my trust I would have never, ever wanted it to end:(
As an Aries Venus, Mercury and Mars I agree. If I like you you’re gonna KNOW it and I’ll want to see you again expeditiously. I don’t have the patience for games.
Pretty accurate actually lol. I’m a Libra rising which is possibly the friendliest rising there is. Also a Pisces sun, with Mars, Venus and Mercury in Aries in my 7th house so I’m passionate about my one-on-one relationships. That’s a fun question 😊
I’ll cover the rest of the days 🤗
Thanks to that movie I can still rapidly recite the names of all of Santa’s reindeer in order, and in an Austrian accent.
That’s so cool! I just saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/14kd713/my_son_and_i_had_same_dream_woke_up_at_the_same/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) the other day where a mother and son shared a dream. Lots of comments in there of similar stories you might like to read.
I love doing this! Sometimes I challenge myself by trying to guess the major placements of celebrities and then I look them up to see if I’m right. I usually am! It’s crazy right? Some people just scream the energy of a certain sign lol
That’s a beautiful outcome. I’m so happy for you! I’m glad you posted. I hope you continue to have beneficial experiences <3
That sounds so scary, I’m sorry you experienced that! Hat man is a crazy common entity sighting but, like you, most people are surprised to find that out! I’m fascinated by him. Or them. It’s such a common occurrence that it’s hard to believe it’s just one spirit doing all that work lol like surely there’s a team of them? But then again he’s probably not constrained by time. Hope he stays far away from you from here on out:)
Gemini in Venus has a reputation for being cheaters bc they like variety, but of course that’s not always the case!! And with it being in your 7th house you could also be drawn to long term relationships. I suggest looking for someone who is fun, intelligent, will have adventures with you and keep your mind stimulated:)
I watched this happen on Twitter and Gawker (RIP) when Hillary was running. It was so obvious, just like what’s happening here is. Tons of people appeared out of nowhere who seemed to live their whole lives just to talk about how Hillary was the greatest person of all time and harass anyone who said otherwise. But saying that it seemed coordinated/paid for of course got people further harassed. Then it turned out to be true with the whole “Correct the record” SuperPAC thing. This isn’t a political statement btw, I’m sure both sides and lots of other organizations do this. 

Long way of saying I agree with you. The amount of money it would cost to do this is minuscule to them. And the benefit of disrupting the people’s ability to effectively communicate is huge.

Edit: what a surprise that your post got removed! Gahhh.
Was the shadow man wearing a hat, by chance? 

With regards to the inter-dimensional world. When you think about how there’s likely at least 10 dimensions and we mostly only perceive 3 of them, that leaves a LOT of space for all kinds of possibilities. I suspect that what we see as shadows, ghosts, orbs, etc would look very, very different if we had the ability to perceive them in their full range of dimension. We just see whatever part of them is dense enough to materialize in the 3 dimensions we’re accustomed to.
True! I think the misperception that Pisces are endlessly, perfectly sweet and patient works to our advantage though;) People really show their true colors when they think they can get away with anything.
Yes. It was Froot Loops then Fruit Loops and then back to Froot Loops. Same with the Flin(t)stones. It’s bizarre to see a Mandela Effect that is regularly discussed go back to how it was.
It makes me crazy! Luckily I don’t come across people like that too often anymore but I have this tool in my pocket if I ever need it again 😂
Me too! I almost wish I’d told him myself but the silent satisfaction was too good.
OMG hi twin! I guess the Pisces and the Libra makes us accepting of people (as long as they treat others well) but the Capricorn just won’t let us put up with bullshit for very long lol
She’s beautiful and you were adorable! Makes me happy to know that she’s still with us and doing well 💕 Thanks for sharing!
I wish I knew!
I’m a Pisces sun, Cap moon, Libra rising. In high school there was a guy who annoyed me really bad because he was so pretentious and always trying to act smarter than everyone. So one day I  told him a nonsense word salad “philosophical quote” I’d just made up and he said “Oh yeah that’s a good one I already studied that one.” I was satisfied that I had proved to myself that he was full of shit lol
I’m so thankful science is advancing in ways that are making it harder for people to label experiencers as liars or crazy.
Oh that’s fascinating. I met my (now ex) husband in the first one and had a baby in the second one. Thanks for this tip! I’m even more curious now what this transit will bring.
Exactly this. I promise you - once you’ve had time to grieve the relationship, you will be amazed at the peace of mind that comes from letting go of someone who you love but can’t trust. You deserve to be with someone who adores you and cherishes the relationship enough that this kind of thing would never be a problem. It’s not worth the hurt and worry.
Mosquito larvae most likely
I’m really sorry for your loss. I bet that is a strange feeling indeed. Hope you’re doing okay <3
Yeah I’d be upset too if I was her. But what you did isn’t gaslighting OP. That term is chronically misused now.
I really appreciate your response!! I’ve only had acquaintances with it but no one close to me, so I’ve never felt comfortable asking. I’d think that would be really tough to deal with, especially since when you’re manic I’d imagine you probably don’t *want* to come down. Sorry about the charges you’re dealing with and I hope things turn out well for you <3
I’ve seen a past life that had my kid’s dad in it, and he’s seen at least one with me in it too. We aren’t together romantically anymore in this life but we will always be dear friends. I think we just like being in each other’s lives one way or another:)
I’m not very familiar with BPD so if you don’t feel like sharing it’s okay! But I’m just curious… what do you mean there’s no way of stopping yourself? Is it like another part of you takes over that doesn’t care about the consequences or just doesn’t think there will be any consequences?
Poor John:( I wonder what happened. I can’t tell if Mike broke up with him or died.
Sick Cycle Carousel by Lifehouse. And Breathing by Lifehouse. Been revisiting my emotional teenager feelings with that album!! All I wanted was for someone to feel about me the way he feels about whoever he’s singing about in Breathing
Please don’t waste your time. I spent 3 years encouraging an emotionally stunted man to heal and grow as a person so we could have a healthier relationship, and i shouldn’t have. Learn from my mistakes. He won’t get better, he’ll use your love and devotion as evidence that he can continue contributing far less to the relationship than you do and you’ll still keep coming around. I promise you’ll be happier being single than stuck in something like this. It’s a slow and painful heartbreak I wouldn’t wish on anybody.
That’s so sweet:’) congratulations on your 60th!
Like attracts like. She probably won’t like this suggestion but I would recommend she remove the horror movie posters and anything else that has creepy energy from the room. Even the silly ones like Chucky can provide a little portal for dark energy to come through. Put salt in the corners and burn sage or cedar. The most potent repellent to dark energy is love and light. So tell her not to hold on to feelings of anger towards whatever is doing this. That just feeds them.
If you find it let me know! I scanned the whole page looking for him:(
Exactly. We’re very unaware of the higher dimensions in modern times and so we aren’t even thinking about the multitude of entities that have been living in them for who knows how long. So then we look at the Egyptians and their mythology as a silly group of people worshipping some non-existent gods and think we’re so much smarter lol.  I don’t believe that they’re gods per se, but powerful beings that aren’t bound to space and time the way we are. They probably aren’t as active with modern humans because most modern humans don’t even understand what they are, nor do they reach the levels of consciousness needed to communicate with them. The same goes for many other deities and mythologized creatures, I’d imagine.
He’s my favorite too. I want to make friends with him.
You’re perfectly human. There’s nothing wrong with only feeling sexual attraction when you’re emotionally connected as well. I think it’s beautiful. Don’t let the hookup culture fool you, casual sex isn’t inherently better just because it’s considered normal.
Well if you haven’t already, I hope you find someone who appreciates all that you bring to the table and does everything they can to make your life better too <3
 Right? Good luck ever finding anyone who cares about you like your wife does OP. Most people these days are flaky and will bail on you the minute they see someone new and shiny, just like you’re about to do to your devoted wife. When you’re old and alone, if not much sooner, you will regret this time to the core of your being.
I love your placements!! Now pls be my nonstop source of comfort, spontaneity and emotional support bc “that’s just how you are” and let me be the curmudgeonly cynic who drains your energy by always needing to be pushed and prodded into making any kind of positive changes in my life lolol
Psychedelics are probably one of the most potent portals you will find. Meditation as well. I also love the other suggestions you’ve gotten like ley lines and the earth chakras. 

Also, try not to worry too much about the people who think you’re off your rocker. They’re the ones who are ignorant and uninformed, and the way disclosure and scientific discovery is going they’ll have to realize that sooner or later:)
Wow never thought about it like that - it is just a projection and I have heavy Neptune/Pisces influences. You just helped me understand so much about myself thank you XD
I’ve been called that a bunch of times. I’m a Pisces sun, Libra rising, with lots of Aries placements and Uranus aspects. So I’m kinda weird, hyper, and I have my own sense of fashion which I guess is MPDGish. 

Always have mixed feelings about being called that though, it feels like I’m going to be expected to fill some kind of endless inspirational role in their life and never need anything in return. But that’s just a tangent rant lol
Keep in mind- whatever is out there has been there your entire life. The only thing that’s really changing is your (and the public’s) awareness. I highly suggest mediation. Both for the mental health benefits as well as for the opportunity to slowly adjust to and even access these higher dimensions. 

There’s an old saying “first enlightenment, then the laundry”. And I think that’s very important and wise. No matter what happens, no matter how much our understanding of reality expands, we still have clothes to wash and pets to feed and stuff. So allow yourself to explore the higher dimensions but be intentional about staying grounded in the 3D as well. 

I was raised Christian and learned long ago that reality is nothing like we’re taught. Feel free to reach out if I can help:)
When I was about 11 I had pet bunny rabbits that lived in a hutch outside. The hutch was off the ground and really sturdy and our backyard was fenced in so I never really worried about them. One night I dreamt that dogs broke into the yard and killed them, and my dad had tried to save them but couldn’t. Less than a week later that’s exactly what happened:( I knew from then on that time doesn’t work like we think it does. 

More recently a coworker that I hadn’t really talked to much before (he was a temporary worker) told me in a dream he was writing a book. A few days later he told me he was writing a book lol. 

I’ve had more but those are the first two that came to mind.
You are so welcome. You deserve the support and I’m happy that I saw your post and was able to help in some way:) You’ve got a lot going on and it’s completely understandable to need to vent - everyone does sometimes! Again please feel free to reach out anytime <3 I care!
I’m glad it was helpful! There’s lots of past life regression meditations on YouTube if you feel like you want to explore deeper:)
Hahaha I assume it was just cloaking everything but it’s leg - maybe like a test run to see if I could handle that before showing me the rest of itself? Which needless to say I didn’t pass. It was bizarre and I have no definitive answers for you!
I’m happy it resonated with you:)
I see. I believe that there are probably a larger variety of species than we can even imagine, so predicting what “they” are like or how they operate isn’t really possible as they aren’t a homogenous group. But statistically yes there likely are at least some NHI that operate as you described. You might find Paul Hellyer (the former Minister of Defense of Canada) accounts comforting. He has said that the vast majority of them are benevolent and would like to help us. I think we’re kinda like the “bad neighborhood” of the universe and the majority of species are more concerned with us messing up our planet to the point where it affects other planets and species than anything. Just my humble thoughts!
Are you saying you believe the NHI themselves are malevolent?
My experiences started very young and were always with benevolent energies so that probably helped a lot! I’m pretty attuned to energy so I can feel when an entity isn’t trustworthy and i tell it to leave me be. 

That being said, I’ve still gotten startled and noped out of experiences that I wish I wouldn’t have. One time I was in my living room and saw the leg of a mantis creature walking by. Even though I could feel that it was friendly I still kinda panicked and it disappeared. It’s been 6 years and I’m still hoping they give me another chance to see them! The good entities don’t want to frighten you, so you probably won’t have an experience with them until you’re ready for it. And if/when you do, try to summon feelings of love, peace, and excitement. The good ones love that and the bad ones are repelled by it:)
Could be. But I feel like a bunker is something most people with a ton of money to spare would build anyway. I know I would. Doesn’t necessarily mean they’re planning an event. Also, nuclear fallout effects them too unless they want to stay underground forever which would get pretty old. I’m sure you know this but UAP sightings increased dramatically after we dropped the bombs, and they’ve been known to shut down nuclear sites for decades. I’m hopeful that they’re here to stop us from doing worse and maybe help us access the free energy that’s been withheld and stuff. Time will tell:)
Maybe that’s what they’re trying to help us prevent. We can hope.
I agree. I think that’s why sightings by regular people seem to be way more prevalent in the last year or two. They’re tired of trying to work with our mess of a government and they’re forcing their hands. Knowing this is probably also why government officials are coming forward with information so rapidly, and the ones who don’t have access to information are going on the record as trying to get information. They don’t want to be known as one of the ones who were keeping secrets. Crazy times. It’s a total 180 and I’m delighted.
That’s very sad but also pretty cool. I’ve read lots of accounts of people visiting a new place and past life memories flooding back. Also, souls often like to incarnate within the same family line so they can be with their loved ones again. So it’s very possible you were one of your ancestors:)
Happy 16th birthday! I’m glad you opened up and shared here. I want to respond to everything so I’m gonna break it down into a few parts. 

First of all I am so, so sorry that you were SA as a child. I was too and I know how it feels to not want anyone to know. I kept it a secret until I was 27 and I regret that a lot. I wish I’d told someone much sooner so I could get help. Even if you don’t feel like it’s affecting you, it’s still really important to be able to get therapy as soon as possible so you can work to process it. I encourage you to tell your parents, I know it’s scary but if they are good parents they’ll want to know. And hopefully they can help you find someone affordable to help you. A lot of times insurance will cover therapy as well.

It’s perfectly normal to be confused about your sexuality. It’s a spectrum anyway and you don’t have to “decide” how you feel about it. Just let yourself be open and curious and you’ll figure it out. The most important thing is to love yourself, every part of yourself:)

You shouldn’t have to be the therapist all the time. You deserve support too. Sometimes parents get overwhelmed and they start to lean on their children more than they should. You can be a listening ear if you want to but that doesn’t mean you can’t also speak up about what you’re going through and have been through. 

Friendships come and go and sometimes they come back. The future is uncertain no matter who you are or what you have going on. So try to take life one day at a time. Big hugs. Feel free to reach out anytime <3
Yeah I saw that in the article and thought about you saying you were fighting him! Crazy. Like I said I’ve never seen this guy in particular but I’ve seen other things that I later found out lots of people see. It’s a weird feeling, right? 

My kid’s dad saw the hat man a lot as a child and never knew it was a common thing either until I told him.
Aww! Thank you friend:)
Yeah he’s a busy guy lol people see him all over the world! [Here’s a basic article](https://chillinkristen.medium.com/the-hat-man-whats-this-shadow-person-got-under-his-cap-863c0a12f95c) but there’s lots more info out there if you’re curious. I’ve never seen him myself but I find him very fascinating. 

Edit: That article describes him as malicious/dark but I don’t know if that’s always true. Plenty of people seem to have neutral encounters with him.
He got 6 perfect shots:) big hugs to you and your son <3
The hat man! Very common entity sighting.
There’s tons of information about astral travel on the CIA website and other organizations have been studying it for decades. It’s very real and it sounds like you two traveled together. Very cool:)
This made my day thank you:)
I think we’re slowly but surely moving towards cooperation as a species. I think a huge step towards that is going to be realizing that we are far from alone in this universe, and that other species have evolved to cooperate. That we are primitive in comparison to the way other beings operate and we can do better. And those of us who have been able to access these higher dimensions and beings will be able to help those who haven’t to adjust to new ways of thinking and being.
What do you mean? A destination for myself or humanity?
This will sound cheesy but I think we’re all special. We humans have a tendency to look for, or to try and create, hierarchies. And some people might look at those of us who can see and perceive things others can’t as being extra special. But I see it more like we have a certain role to play in the collective, it’s no better or higher than anyone else’s calling. It’s just maybe a bit unusual lol.
Oh my goodness, I am so sorry this is happening to you. How awful. I’m a mama and I can’t imagine not taking this seriously or defending you however I could. I would have probably been to jail by now for punching him! I wish I could give you a hug. This is so understandably hard for you to deal with and I’m glad you reached out for support. 

That little piece of shit boy will end up in jail for something eventually. Or get his ass beat for messing with the wrong person. He’s disgusting and cruel and he doesn’t deserve to be breathing the same air as you. 

You are so, so precious and worthy and you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect. I’m so sorry that you’re in an environment that’s making you feel otherwise, but please understand that what other people think or say about you has nothing to do with the the real you.

I know it feels like you’ll be in this pain forever but I promise it will pass. You won’t even think about most of these people someday. Please message me anytime, I care and I’m here for you.
I don’t even bother trying to convince skeptics of anything anymore. At this point, with quantum physics confirming that much of what we’re experiencing is not only possible but probable, and with high level and highly educated officials confirming that extra-dimensional beings are present on earth. If someone still wants to believe I’m crazy for saying that I’ve seen things, that’s on them. They’re the ones that are being unscientific.

I keep my experiences to myself unless I’m confident the person I’m talking to is open minded. And even then I only reveal what I feel comfortable revealing, which is often just a small fraction of my experience.

But if you do feel like trying to demonstrate that you aren’t being unscientific, you can point them to scientific sources on how there are likely at least 10 dimensions, and how our eyes see less than half a percent of the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn’t always work but it can help people realize that just because they can’t see it with their own eyes doesn’t mean it’s not real.

Remember that as disclosure continues on, the skeptics are going to have no choice but to accept that reality is not what they thought. I’ve had people who would get so annoyed and argumentative with me talking about aliens, eventually end up realizing they were wrong and start asking me questions. 

Also, that reaction of mocking you or trying to discredit your experience is likely coming from a place of fear. They’re scared to consider that we aren’t alone and they are just trying to comfort themselves into not believing it by turning on you.
Where did he think eggs came from? I need to know pls don’t let me down.
I’m sorry this happened to you. I’m not familiar with these particular creatures but I do have a suggestion that might help you avoid such encounters. Make a habit of consciously sending loving, protective white light into and surrounding yourself and your home. You can practice boundaries with entities just like you do with humans. I’m not saying it’s foolproof but it can really help.
This is so cool, thank you for sharing! Are you familiar with Philip K Dick’s experiences with ET? They helped him save his child’s life by informing him of a very serious medical condition the child had that he was unaware of. Your father calling you guys when you’re sick before you even told him reminded me of that:)
I’m so sorry this is happening to you <3 That’s awful and I know it hurts. As the other commenter said be sure you get tested. I can relate. I was in a relationship where I was very encouraging of his sexual exploration and wanted him to feel so safe and comfortable talking with me about his kinks and stuff. I was also clear that i was open to polyamory if it was something he wanted to explore and he always said he wasn’t interested. Then I found out that I had an STD and of course the only person I’d had sex with was him. It hurts a lot when you’re so open and willing to accommodate and then they just go and do as they please behind your back, with no regard for you or your well-being. But you will pick yourself up and move on and find great happiness. Just give yourself lots of time and lots of love. He’s shown you that he can’t be trusted. You’ll look back and be so proud of yourself for leaving him to his own devices. 

Sending you big hugs. Feel free to message me anytime.
Moon and Venus signs will tell you a lot more about how you operate in relationships than sun sign.

Example I’m a Pisces sun so I do love to romanticize but my practical Capricorn moon and my fiery Aries Venus will override and cut a toxic person off with a quickness no matter what time they text me lol
Yes! Many (if not most) of these beings are from higher dimensions so our brains and eyes literally can’t perceive what they actually look like. We just see the shimmers or shadows or orbs or whatever other aspect of them is dense enough to show up in the 3D.
I think it went something like this: 
- Boomers created the bullshit (with the help of some Silent Gen) 
- Gen X knew it was bullshit but were outnumbered so resigned to it and participated
- Millennials been screaming that it’s all bullshit since 2008 and were called whiny and entitled for not wanting to participate  
- Gen Z is now joining in the fight so we are no longer so outnumbered and can maybe actually join together and do something. I hope.
That’s so cool! All the Egyptian deities are powerful and helpful in their own ways I’m sure, but he’s the only one I’ve met so far. Just my personal experience: his energy is very interesting - he can alternate between being the fearsome deliverer of karmic justice and this surprisingly goofy friendly guy. Depending upon how he feels about you and your deeds, I guess! But he’s definitely a protector of those who are trying to bring love and fairness to this world.
This resonates very well with the information I’ve received. With love and compassion and encouraging others in their self-empowerment being the main focus for me. It’s frustrating sometimes because much of humanity is stuck in a materialistic mindset where they feel they must compete rather than cooperate with others. But very large numbers of people are waking up so I’m very grateful and hopeful for the future.
That’s a really sad first memory:( I’m so sorry. Hugs.
Thanks for sharing:) I’ve definitely had similar experiences. Perhaps next time you can let go a bit more if you’re comfortable. Leaving your body and astral traveling is amazing and it sounds like you have a lovely helper to guide you
In at least one of my past lives I was one of those catlike people <3 made me happy to see you mention them:) did you ever get a sense of where the ones you interacted with came from?
Well it worked out nicely bc I got to hear more of your awesome music! 

One more piece of advice, if I may, from my personal experience regarding meeting spirits. They tend to show themselves to us when we most need them, but they are always there regardless. So if you don’t meet Thoth right away it doesn’t mean he doesn’t like you. When he introduced himself to me last year he said it was because I was getting a lot of negative energy sent to me from certain people and energies, and he was blocking it for me and returning it to them karmically. At other times I’ve had alien encounters that helped me with my mental health. I’ve met the spirits of deceased artists who helped me with my paintings. My late grandfather checked in with me when I was having a really hard time going through divorce. Stuff like that:) so yeah just be open and meditate and see what happens!
You’re welcome! I’d love to DM:)
We’re completely surrounded by things we can’t see. There’s [at least 10 dimensions](https://phys.org/news/2014-12-universe-dimensions.amp) and the visible light that humans can perceive is [less than half a percent of the actual spectrum](https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/articles/visible-light-eye-opening-research-nnsa#:~:text=The%20entire%20rainbow%20of%20radiation,is%20known%20as%20visible%20light.com) so yeah. There’s no one single giant truth that all experiencers know, other than that there’s *much* more to reality than what our (almost completely) blind human eyes usually see. We’ve seen into those dimensions or have seen pieces of that “missing” visible light enough to know that aliens, fairies, whatever else we have seen are absolutely real. Some people cannot handle that thought, and will try and find any way they can to convince themselves that if they can’t see it, it’s not real. It’s scary to them. But it exists regardless, just like the color red continues to exist whether a colorblind person believes in it or not.
Ohhh I met you the other day in my post about memory gaps after a sighting! I’m sorry I didn’t recognize your username at first:) But I love your style and your drumming and your passion for it, thanks so much for sharing <3
 I would love to hear your music if you’re open to sharing! Really cool that you write your own. According to the Egyptians  written words are Thoth’s thing too:)
lol yeah it’s easy for me to say it’s adorable when I’m not the one coming face to face with it!! I just like how it defended it’s eye shape by comparing it to Spider Man’s eyes. Makes sense as a way to try and ease a child’s fears. 

It reminds me of my little brother when we were kids, he said that a big “monster” creature had come in his room, and she brought a baby monster with her that was very cute so he wouldn’t be afraid. It seems like they have a lot of strategies for making contact with certain people without scaring us too bad.

Did you feel or sense anything in particular when they held your hand?
This is adorable lol. I’ve had so many experiences yet I’ve never met a grey!! If I ever do get to meet one I hope it’s one like Uppo:)
For me it happened out of the blue one day while I was meditating. He told me that he is protective of me and that he especially likes a friend of mine who I had just recently met. So I texted that friend about it and turned out he had just finished painting a portrait of Thoth. I had no idea. My friend and I had never even talked about him before. 

He seems to be drawn to artists, writers, and most importantly people who are very fair minded. He is benevolent but he can dole out karma like a boss so he’s not one to take lightly. I would suggest just kind of mentally saying hi to him as you go into meditation or sleep and see what happens:)
Ooo I wonder the significance of the broken/missing top then. And isn’t that the best feeling? When you have a visceral experience that is so real and impossible to forget and then you learn of someone else having seen the exact same thing? I wonder what happened to poor Mars so long ago:( I’ve read some very sad past life hypnosis stories of people who were there long ago and they felt so devastated by the sudden destruction of the climate. To me it almost sounds like a nuclear catastrophe of some kind but I don’t know, it could just as easily be a comet or a technology failure or something. I’ve never had any astral or RV experiences with Mars myself but I’m quite curious about it.
This is a lovely response and absolutely resonates. Thanks so much! The first time I saw one was as a child and it had such a friendly energy, as do the ones I’m seeing now. It’s really cool that they’re protectors, makes me feel extra thankful to be seeing them:)
Just whatever information you feel like sharing, really. I keep seeing them in my dreams this week:)
For the most part, no names. One exception to this is Thoth. He introduced himself by name about a year ago. I know him by his Egyptian name though Djehuty. He’s cool and has a very protective energy and I feel thankful that he seems to like me bc damn it would be scary to be on his bad side lol
Do you have any experiences or insight into the orange orb type of ships?
There’s been reports for decades of them shutting down our nuclear facilities, dodging missiles and running circles around our jets. If they wanted to hurt us they would have by now. And I think we’re about as much of a threat to them as a toddler with a toy sword is to a grownup.
It’s also a lot easier for us to stay calm and receptive when we’re sleeping or meditating and I feel like not scaring us is a big priority for them.
I’m curious have you or /u/voodoo-lord ever read [this remote viewing report](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf) from the CIA website that takes place in ancient Mars? The viewer describes giant pyramids and obelisks and gentle giants. Really cool experience OP thanks so much for sharing.
Absolutely. My dreams, intuition and ability to sense energy is popping off too. It’s been extra ramped up since Sunday. 

It feels like our conscious minds are expanding. Stay grounded, loving and fearless everybody:)
I love it! Setting a reminder on my phone:)
Wow this is synchronous. I have been dreaming about these orange orbs a lot lately! I saw one when I was a kid:) it was cute lol. 

Thanks for sharing this theory it makes a lot of sense. I suspect that they probably use all sorts of methods and make use of elements we humans can’t see or fully comprehend just yet. 

Would you mind sharing about the orange orb you saw? Like where were you, what did it do? Edit: never mind I found your old post! Love it and I’m glad I found you bc like I said I keep dreaming/thinking about the orange ones all the sudden. It feels there’s a lot of them hanging around earth for the past week or so.

Edit again: do you happen to recall what kind of trees it was hanging out above when you first spotted it? The ones I see seem to like pine trees so I was just curious:)
You’re welcome. I might not be able to relate to everything you’ve been through but I know how much it hurts to have your trust betrayed. To feel guilt about mistakes. And I’ve been able to work through a lot of trauma over time and learn to release myself from a lot of pain. If I can help you too I’m happy to do it. 

So pls feel free to message any time, I care:)
Love this question!

I remember my first nightmare clearly. I was about 4 or 5 years old. The dream took place late at night, at my grandparents house, with my whole extended family gathered together. We all knew that “the wolves were coming”. This was absolutely terrifying. It wasn’t clear what the wolves were going to do to us, just that it was very very bad and there was nothing we could do to save ourselves. There were giant purple clocks on the wall, loudly ticking the time away. Other than that it was silent. All we could do was wait for the wolves to come.
Wow I wish we could chat in real life I could talk about all this for hours!!! I have astral traveled to just one ancient site but it changed the way I view humanity for sure. Love this comment thank you for responding:)
That’s so sweet :’) thank you for sharing this story. It’s a lovely reminder of how even a simple word or gesture can make someone’s life better. I hope you’re doing well and that your family continues to learn to love and support you as you are.
That’s really tough. I’m sorry you’re going through this. Other than informing your friends parents or a school counselor about it there’s only so much you can do. Be prepared to explain your concerns to your friend and remind them that they don’t deserve to be treated that way.
I’m glad you’re still here. Hope you’re doing okay <3
Thanks so much for the recommendation! I’m very interested, especially in the Antediluvian, so I will check those out:)
I love this! Really thought-provoking, thanks to you (and ChatGPT) for sharing your thoughts:)
You’re welcome💕 always here if you want to chat.
Hey I’m really sorry for your loss friend <3 Grief is a weird process. Some days you might feel energized and focused on what needs to be done, other days you might feel lost like you can’t think straight. It can even change by the hour. Just know that there’s no right or wrong way to feel at any given time. When you do feel like crying, really let it out. It helps so much. 

Lots of love to you and your family.
This made me laugh so hard. I can’t imagine how painful that would be to try and snort. I hope he’s doing well wherever he is lol.
I agree, that certainly seems to be the deciding factor in all these cases: Those who freak out, forget. Those who stay relatively calm, recall.

I can only speak for my personal experiences and how they’ve felt to me, but I always sense that they just want to make sure I see them, and sort of introduce themselves gently. 

Perhaps by sprinkling sightings and experiences throughout people’s lives they’re identifying who can handle their presence and who will be overwhelmed by fear. Much more polite than the Hollywood UFO movie way of just barging in, doing what they want and leaving chaos and confusion in their wake lol. 

I wonder what their next steps will be. I’m looking forward to seeing what happens:)
Hey I appreciate you taking my perspective into consideration! You’re a great writer btw:)
I was with you all the way up until the end. There’s no reason at all to assume this is cause for alarm. It’s beautiful, and most people are reporting feeling great today. It’s not my place to tell you how to feel, but personally I think fear is not needed or helpful at this time.
Its a measurement of the earth’s magnetic frequencies, so imagine it like a heartbeat chart for the earth. You’d expect it to have lines going up and down and that’s about it. All we can say right now is that it’s entirely unprecedented and beyond what any of us would have thought possible. Personally I’ve been in a funk and woke up today feeling amazing. Many people are saying similar. So anecdotally I think it’s a great thing:)
Thank you so much! It is indeed very freeing:) I’m headed to the backyard now to paint some more!
I’m so sorry that happened to you friend <3 I’m glad you had the ability to channel all those heavy emotions through music. I do the same with my art. It’s therapeutic for sure. I hope you’re doing better now.

Damn 30 orbs that’s a lot. It’s interesting that you guys were with his folks. Do you remember what their reaction was like?
That first one is so odd - like he was READY to deny it right away lol. 

Your second one is similar to an experience I had when I was about 11 years old. I was hanging out on some land my parents had just bought. I talked to my older brother for a few minutes and then wandered out into a field by myself. The last thing I remember was just spinning and frolicking around having fun. Then suddenly I woke up lying on the ground. I wasn’t in any pain. I somehow sensed that more time had passed than the 5 or 10 minutes since I’d seen my brother. So I went and found him and asked how long I’d been gone and he said “at least an hour.” For some reason I felt totally chill about it but didn’t want to tell him or my parents. 

I agree it seems like some of us are monitored or something. Because it seems like people either have zero sightings/experiences or they have several.
Yes! Super vivid dreams! I’m so excited right now. I’ve been checking this almost daily for about 5 years and it’s never, ever looked anything remotely close to this. I’m so excited!
Assuming you mean it’s me that’s delusional, do you consider all of the Air Force pilots, dept heads of the US and many other countries, as well as countless other citizens who report sightings delusional too? How hard is it for you to believe that we’re not alone in this universe and that our space-traversing technology might be primitive in comparison to other species? To me it seems more likely than not, but of course I respect your right to differ.
Eeeesh yeah that would have really freaked me out! I wonder what they were doing. I always feel like there must be some kind of purpose to them being seen when and where they are, considering how they seem to be able to cloak/zip away as they please.
Wow that song is powerful, so much emotion and intensity! I’m so glad you shared it. I’ve always wished I could be a drummer but I lack the coordination lol. [Here’s a video of me painting like a crazy person](https://youtube.com/shorts/D-uo7ielJYI?feature=share) bc why not. Always nice to meet a fellow creative soul:) 

I’m sorry he distanced himself from you, that sucks. I feel like with all the disclosure ramping up, folks like him are going to have a hard time adjusting. But eventually they will get used to the idea that we’re not alone and who knows, maybe you can patch things up.

Edit: unless of course he’s not of this earth himself, in which case i have no idea how disclosure might affect him!
Oooo see that’s super interesting because it seems like that would indicate that they do a memory wipe of some kind, but it’s faulty. Or maybe it’s designed that way idk. Maybe by setting it so that you only recall it when it’s a few days later, you’re able to process the experience without as much panic. Did you happen to notice any missing time? I read a story of a couple that had a similar sighting but there was a few hours missing from their recollection.
Wow I’m not generally afraid of UAP, but your particular sighting probably would have freaked me out too! It’s cool that she was able to eventually communicate with you about why she was downplaying it before. That must have been a relief for you on some level.
lol I truly appreciate the empathy! Honestly the experience of him suddenly not remembering it was almost as startling as the sighting itself. If Brett ever forgets pls update me:)
Nope:( I had left my phone on my blanket in the middle of the yard when I went inside to get him. The sighting was only about 15 seconds long and happened as soon as we stepped off the back porch. But tbh I understand now why so many people don’t take videos, even when they have a sighting with phone in hand. It’s such a completely overwhelming experience that most people are going to have some kind of amygdala based response lol. I can absolutely see how it would activate a freeze response for many people and that primitive survival instinct takes precedence over filming
Wow that’s fascinating, thank you! Quite a few comments in there about people experiencing memory loss after having one of these sightings.
Oh man that’s creepy. Almost sounds like some sort of mind programming. Does he just change the subject or go silent until you do?
Ooo would you mind linking me to info on this?
lol I mean whistleblowers have been known to say the Nordics walk among us so who knows! Either way it’s curious that he doesn’t want to recall or talk about it. The cognitive dissonance of not wanting to believe but also seeing proof with their own eyes is very very uncomfortable for some people I guess.
Is it though? I was raised Christian and it seemed about 50/50 on whether or not Christians believed aliens could exist. I’ve even heard John 10:16 Jesus saying “I have other sheep that are not of this fold” interpreted as possibly referring to beings on other planets. 

Not trying to argue, just curious what makes you say it’s unbiblical.
Ohhh that’s interesting. I guess maybe she remembers then but just tries not to. I’m glad at least your son remembered and can talk about it. I’m curious what your mom will say. Update me if you can!
That’s not true at all. I’ve been mediating for years and I agree that the benefits are life changing. But I’ve also done MDMA for therapeutic purposes and experienced permanent, life changing results from that as well. I healed more from my trauma in one day with MDMA than I had in years of therapy combined. I was able to get off of antidepressants for good. 

When done properly, the benefits last a lifetime.
I’m so glad it’s not just me!!! I really wish I knew why this happens. If my kid’s dad was the type to disbelieve or just try and ignore things I’d assume he blocked it out of his mind on purpose but he’s not like that at all, he’s very open minded and curious. 

I wonder if the aliens themselves would have reason to remove certain people’s memories? But if so, why would they take his and your wife’s memories but not ours?? 

I’d love to hear more of your story if you’re interested in sharing:) I’m curious what your wife’s reaction was to it at the time? And did you two talk about it afterwards? Do you know about how long after the sighting she seemed to forget?
Thanks for sharing your experience, it’s really cool:) I have several but here’s two of my favorites:

- I left my body by accidentally astral projecting. I woke up one morning but laid there with my eyes closed bc I didn’t want to get up yet. But the fear of oversleeping for work kept me right in that perfect in-between meditative state, so that when I finally decided to sit up I just floated right out of my body towards the ceiling lol. I knew what was happening so I tried to get the mechanics right and move intentionally, but it was tricky. I finally got enough of a hang of it enough to start floating towards one of my paintings to see if I could touch it, but then my snooze alarm went off and I floated gently back to my body. Intriguingly, it seemed to be an alternate timeline or something because it was a different house entirely until I got back into my body. But I knew it was my house. 

- This one might not count because it was during a past life regression, so it’s more like a memory of leaving my body that I saw in first person. It was the 1960’s and I was a woman in my 40’s, very sick in the hospital. I was sleeping and all the sudden I was floating above my body. I had no spiritual or religious beliefs in this lifetime so I was just floating there like “WTF do I do now?” for what felt like a long time 😂 Until I finally realized that I had no obligation to stay there with my body. Then I was a little ball of light and I zipped around the world looking at the Eiffel Tower and stuff I’d always wanted to see, then I went up to a very heavenly looking place and reunited with my long lost childhood best friend. He’s the father of my children in this life and still my best friend.
Wow! I’ve never read a NDE quite like this before. Thank you so much for sharing. I’m glad you came back, and wish all the best for you and your loved ones:)
It’s so crazy to think about right? How not only are we blind to other dimensions, but we see less than half a percent of the electromagnetic spectrum! That’s why it makes me a little crazy when people say that aliens, fairies, or whatever else can’t possibly be real. To me it’s like a color blind person refusing to believe the color red could be real.
That’s crazy! I can’t imagine something like that becoming routine but I guess just about anything does if you do it long enough.
I’m so intrigued. I wouldn’t have guessed this was so common. I guess it’s hard to know but are these likely to be .. murdered and stashed bodies?
Tell him that you’re concerned about him, that you’ve been noticing him acting differently, that you love him and you want to help. Remind him that you guys are supposed to be together in good times and bad and that you won’t think any less of him for having a hard time. If he’s reluctant to go to therapy on his own, offering to go together might help.
Oh sweetheart, what you’re feeling is completely understandable. Allow yourself plenty of time to grieve, for the relationship and the friendships, and the future you hoped to have with them. Don’t feel bad for feeling sad, that’s just adding shame on top of the sadness. Let yourself cry and listen to sad songs and whatever else you need to do to get it out. But make sure to keep doing things you enjoy, too. Look for opportunities to make new friends by volunteering or joining groups that do activities you like or would like to try. 

Things will get better a little at a time. Hugs 💕
I’m so sorry for all you experienced, both the painful of your dad loss and the complete lack of support from your partner. Not to mention the cheating. That’s awful. If you can trust a woman on the internet enough to accept some internet hugs, then::: hugs:::
Try going to therapy if you can. They can help you work through the feelings of guilt and shame, and also help you figure out why you did these things in the first place. Have you ever heard the expression “hurt people hurt people?” It’s true, usually when people cause others pain it’s because they have some unresolved issues that are causing them to act like they are. Getting to the bottom of that will be really helpful in forgiving yourself as well as doing better going forward. Big hugs <3
Well wanting to be a better person is the best place to start:) Try to forgive yourself, we all make mistakes and have regrets. It may be too late to get this person back in your life but you can grow and do better and be better for the next person.
Yeah, I’ve been the ex in this situation and at a certain point it just starts to feel like just they apologize to get you back into their life so they can hurt you again. It’s possible your ex won’t want to hear it no matter what you say. But if you really want to, say something like “I deeply regret the pain I caused you. I’m so sorry for my actions and for the way I made you feel. I care about you very much and I hope you are doing well.”
I would focus more on the apology than the gift. Express your remorse and acknowledge your mistakes without making excuses. Without knowing what you did it’s hard to say what you should write specifically, but that’s a good start.
It’s very much okay that you can’t be fully supportive of your friends in a genuine way right now. It doesn’t make you a bad friend at ALL. For now, you can go through the motions by following a simple formula. Listen, empathize, and reflect. For example “I’m sorry you’re going through this at work right now. It sounds really frustrating.” For bonus points you can ask a follow up question and just listen some more. Most of the time people just need to vent more than anything. But don’t put pressure on yourself, if they’re good friends they’ll understand that you can’t be at full friend capacity right now. 

Sincere condolences for the loss of your sister. Be patient with yourself and kind to yourself.
Man. Matthew 6 is jam packed with things most Christians try so hard to ignore. I guess that’s true of most things Jesus said though.
I don’t expect anyone to believe me but I saw the leg - just the leg - of one of these guys walk through my living room about 6 years ago. It felt like my heart stopped. I’ve always wondered if it meant to be seen or if it was just a brief inter-dimensional glitch.
Just because people have it worse doesn’t mean you aren’t supposed to be sad or upset about things. Remember that you’re still growing and changing, your brain won’t even be done developing for like 7 more years:) You do have a lot to look forward to, and it’s not hopeless. As for the social anxiety and assuming the worst, try and remember that people are busy with their own lives and it isn’t a reflection of you. I sometimes forget to message people that I love very much for like.. days lol. Try and get involved in some new hobbies and learn new things. Life will get better, be kind to yourself.
My heart hurts for you. I’m so, so very sorry. I can’t imagine the pain you must be feeling. Please get into therapy as soon as you possibly can. You need and deserve the support. Sending you lots of love and hugs.
I think it’s time to tell your mom everything. About the phone, and waking up to him touching you. All of it. I know it’s really hard and scary and uncertain, but the spying alone in so messed up and she needs to know what her husband is doing. For her protection and yours. He won’t stop and he can’t keep getting away with it. You and your mom aren’t safe.
I’m so sorry that you’ve had your feelings dismissed and been made to feel like a burden. Humans are social creatures and it’s natural to want to belong and feel supported. I’m always here if you want to chat.
I’m really sorry. I can only imagine how sad and stressful that must be. For what it’s worth, this internet stranger is thinking of you and sending you hugs. And cozy blankets and chamomile tea:)
First of all happy birthday 💕 I’m sorry you’re going through all this. That’s a huge amount of stress on your father that I’m sure he is still traumatized by. So try not to take his words too personally, I’m sure he loves you very much. Give it a little more time and hopefully you two can talk it out.
Oh sweetie it’s gonna be okay. I’m sorry. I felt very similarly at your age and it felt like I’d feel like that forever but guess what. It didn’t. Looking back I’m, so, so thankful I held on because I had no idea at the time how much better life could be. Please don’t worry about being a burden or them needing to spend more money. I promise you they’d rather spend every penny they have than lose you. You deserve to be happy. Be kind to yourself and keep doing things you enjoy, even when you don’t feel like it. I’m always here if you want to chat <3
lol a dancing monkey. Exactly! I’m sure there’s plenty of people out there who feel the same and will appreciate a genuine person being themselves. So don’t lose hope. And thank you 💕
You do deserve better! I really benefited from taking some time off from dating to work on my confidence and building up my sense of self. Until you really respect yourself enough to not put up with people’s bullshit you’ll keep attracting the bullshit people:)
I’m a 38 year old woman but I very much relate. Online dating is so messed up. You have to try and post the best pics and describe yourself in a cute catchy way and then be witty in texts and it all just feels so forced and fake. And yeah, people are very flakey. I feel like everyone has it in their heads that someone better is just a swipe away so they’re not even trying to get to know anybody in depth. Also a lot of men get really mad if you aren’t trying to sleep with them on the first date. Like… scary mad. 

I’m at the same point as you, not giving up but not interested in putting in much effort anymore either. I do hope you find someone great tho:)
Seconding this! Learning about my north node sign and house has helped me immensely. Especially since many of us tend to shy away from the very things we’re meant to be working towards.
Could definitely be past lives! It’s also possible to accidentally remote view in a dream, in which case they would be strangers and your subconscious just kinda clicked onto their channel. I have experienced both and for me, viewing past lives feels very personal, I *know* it’s me. Whereas remote viewing feels more distant and unfamiliar, even though I’m seeing it from their perspective.

Edit to add: just as an example, I’ve seen a lifetime in which I was a little tribal boy. Even though his life was nothing like my current life, everything about it felt so real and relatable and like a memory. In remote viewing I’ve accidentally seen through the perspective of a woman my age with a similar lifestyle yet she felt like a complete stranger.
Maybe he was just glad to see you, and the words didn’t seem so important as just making sure you knew that he knew you were there <3 I’m so sorry for your loss.
I’ve seen a life in multiple past life regressions plus a few vivid dreams where I was a catlike/humanoid being on another planet. Most of my friends were these giant blue lobster looking guys. I liked to run fast and climb trees. The terrain was not too different from earth. But everyone lived in small houses with no hierarchies or government or money. Just communities. This might sound weird but .. It was *so* peaceful that it was kind of boring to me personally sometimes. So I would periodically go on spaceships to negotiate with other species in other ships that were not as peaceful as us. And basically try and persuade them to be nicer to each other lol. But when I was on the ships I couldn’t run and climb so I’d get stir crazy and frustrated. So it was always kind of a challenge of being under stimulated one way or another.
Stay hydrated, and only watch/listen to stuff that’s happy and positive:) it’ll wear off eventually I promise!
I’m so sorry <3
This is so heartbreaking, I’m so sorry you went to this nightmare. I wish I could give you a hug. I’ve had to do a lot of healing work myself and would be happy to chat any time. Just reach out <3
It really helped me feel better about death. I hope it helps you too💕 wishing you all the best
I’m sorry for your loss. He was lucky to have someone like you in his life who cared about him. Are you in contact with his mom at all? It might be healing to reach out to her and let her know that you’re thinking of her and remember her son fondly. I did that for the mom of an old friend of mine who passed and I’m glad I did, I felt weird about it bc he and I hadn’t talked for years but she was so grateful.

Also, it might be helpful for you to search up stories about people’s near death experiences. There’s tons of them online and they are so cool. The vast majority of people experience total peace and acceptance. I’m sure your friend did too.
First of all I want to acknowledge that you have stepped up in this kiddos life and are doing your best to support her. I know it’s not easy. 

Try and keep in mind that she’s at an incredibly difficult age right now, between the hormones and her brain developing and changing rapidly, you gotta understand that she’s just going to be challenging a lot of the time. It’s not personal and it’s not even indicative of her true personality. I couldn’t stand my mom when I was that age and now I adore her lol. That, combined with the difficulty of having an unhealthy mom is I’m sure really hard for your stepdaughter. There’s nothing wrong with her being excited about a new room or wanting to be with her mom, even if it isn’t at all in her best interests. So try not to hold that against her. It worries me that y’all decided “if she wants to act like an adult she can deal with it like an adult.” Please don’t keep her out of the conversation and cause her more pain and frustration just to teach her a lesson. She needs support and understanding here. She’s going to be an adult before you know it and she’ll remember this time. Please take breaks and take care of yourself so you’re able to handle her teenage years with love, care and most of all empathy. And make sure you’re incorporating plenty positive reinforcement for her efforts at school. It’s far more healthy and uplifting than punishments.

Edited to add a sentence:)
I really think you should get into therapy if you possibly can. It sounds like you’re holding onto a lot of pain from the relationship (understandable) and you could use some help sorting it out. Guilt is helpful if it helps you learn how to be a better person but if it’s holding you back from being able to live a good life or feel like you deserve to be happy than that’s not helping anyone. The world doesn’t benefit from you feeling like shit about yourself forever. 

Also, karma is a tricky thing. Sometimes it can take years for people to learn from their mistakes. Some people never do. You can’t assume she’s happy just because she’s pretending to be on the internet.
I’m glad to hear that. It’s a long road but you’ll feel better little by little. Be patient with yourself. And again I’m so sorry for everything you’ve been through.
You do deserve to be happy. Obviously cheating is wrong but so is physical abuse! Everybody makes mistakes. It’s okay. You can learn from this not to stay in an unhealthy relationship, especially if there’s abuse of any kind. And I really doubt they’re as happy as they seem. It sounds more like they teamed up to try and hurt you. I’d strongly suggest blocking them both and moving on with your life. Learn about healthy relationships and how they work, so you’re better able to find healthy partners and be a healthy partner.
That’s horrible. I’m so sorry the “justice” system failed you so badly. I’m proud of you for having the strength to come forward and go through all this. Are you able to get into therapy? You need support to help you heal. It takes time but you’ll get through this <3 feel free to reach out to me anytime. I care.
Oh sweetie, you’re a wonderful sister. Please know that you did the best you could in the situation and honestly you handled it way better than a lot of adults would!! Your parents need to know. Your brother needs to be able to get help and support to process and heal from this. And your cousin needs to be in jail. 

I’m so very sorry this happened to you both. I’m glad you posted here. The relationship between you and your brother will be okay, I promise you that he’ll be glad you told your parents. Maybe not right away, but soon enough. Sending lots of love. Feel free to message if you want to chat.
I read your whole post and damn, I am so very sorry you’ve experienced so many tragic losses. My heart goes out to you. I can understand why you’d be afraid to make friends now, after so much trauma. I think it might be worth trying to find another therapist. Unfortunately some of them just suck and anyone who would tell you simply get a pet isn’t a good fit. You need help to unpack and process all of this. I’m so glad the mushrooms were helpful. The amazing thing about them is that they actually help you create new neural pathways in your brain, so they can help you heal from trauma on a physical level. Literally re-wiring your thought processes:) Have you ever looked into microdosing them? It might be worth a try! Also if you’re open to it and can do so safely, mdma is incredibly healing when taken in a peaceful environment with the intention to heal trauma. 

I’m always here if you want to chat. It’s not trauma dumping to want to express what you’re feeling to someone who cares. And I care.
I’m sorry <3  would talk to your lawyer about it. But in most places releasing that type of content without your consent would get him in a lot of trouble. I know it sucks, but personally I wouldn’t bring it up to him. Like you said, it probably would just make him more likely to be manipulative about it. Hugs.
Going to university right after high school is overrated and a lot of times just a bad idea! It’s not realistic or fair to expect people that young to know what they want to do for the rest of their lives! I love your dream of being a florist:) I suggest finding a job at a florist so you can learn about the business while saving up money. When people ask you about what you’ll be studying, you don’t have to tell them that you didn’t get accepted. Just say that you’re going to take some time to work and help your family out. And remember that you don’t have to go to school to study English or literature! The internet is an endless resource and you can learn the things that interest you most. 

Also, I’m very sorry for the loss of your mom. I’m a mom and I just want to say that you’re doing great and I’m very proud of you <3
Wait what’s that? I eat avocados every day I wanna try it!
For me it was very vivid imagery. It was like watching a movie where you don’t know what will happen next, but it played out very quickly in a few “scenes”. Depending on the lifetime you see you may experience some unpleasant emotions, but even those are very helpful for understanding what affects they have on you in this lifetime. And you can always stop it at any time.
Well I’m a (mostly) white person, I’m horrified by racism and would never defend it. I don’t hang out with anyone who would. I really think you need to get out in the real world a little more and spend less time on the internet, friend. Your perspectives are very skewed and it’s causing you to live in a really ugly version of reality. I’m not saying that the world is all rainbows and sunshine but there’s so much more kindness and compassion than you seem to realize.
Social media is dangerous because it shows you more of what you respond to, good or bad. For every woman (or man!) on the internet you see doing awful things, there’s thousands more going through life being loving, caring people. I was in a relationship with a very narcissistic guy and because I searched up narcissistic men on TikTok suddenly my FYP was full of toxic men doing horrible things. It would be easy to start believing all men are like that but I know it simply isn’t true. You’ll miss out on all the good things (and people) in life if you’re focused on the bad.
If you’re happy with being single then there’s nothing broken at all. Society makes romantic relationships seem like the ultimate form of happiness in life but that’s simply not true. So don’t beat yourself up about it:) Do the things that make you happy and focus on your friendships. If later on you feel like dating, go for it, but do it because you want to and not because you feel like you’re supposed to.
I’m sorry. For some reason a lot of people think that it’s fine to make comments about someone’s weight as long as they’re skinny and not overweight. It’s weird, and it’s really rude. Don’t be afraid to tell people that you don’t want to hear comments about your body, or how much you’re eating. It’s none of their business.
I’m really sorry. It’s hard to lose a connection with someone. She definitely should have answered you honestly when you asked if she was in a relationship. Give yourself time to feel sad about it, and know that little by little you will feel better. You deserve to be loved and appreciated. And you deserve to be with someone who can be honest with you. You’ll find someone. And in the meantime please give yourself a hug from me <3
You’re so welcome love, you deserve all the kindness and support you can get!! I know what you mean about not being able to bring yourself to say the words out loud. I was 27 before I finally told someone. But the minute I finally said it out loud to someone I felt enormous relief. I know it can feel like you’re the only person in the world who’s been through this, but sadly it’s not uncommon at all. Therapists are there to help and they are trained to help with this exact situation, including the feelings of shame and guilt, which are also very common. 

I’m here for you anytime you want to talk <3
That’s really cool you were able to lucid dream a little bit! I’ve only managed it twice and both times I woke up as soon as I realized lol. 

[AuntyFlo](https://www.auntyflo.com) is probably my favorite, it has a massive amount of dream interpretations and usually has a few possible meanings for each one, depending on context.
It sounds like you have a lot of conditioning and ideas about what men “should” be like that are confusing you. You are YOU and you are a unique person with lots to offer. I’d suggest putting down the porn and the romance books for a while, both are complete fiction and not at all a realistic idea of what it is to be in a relationship. Women are diverse and they are looking for different things, so try not to get caught up in the idea that all women want this or that. One woman’s fantasy is another woman’s nightmare lol. I know it sounds cliche, but try to just focus on learning who you are, apart from all these other people’s opinions. The more you learn to be who you are, the more you’ll find people who appreciate you:)
I am so very sorry this happened to you. My heart hurts for you. The only responsibility that man had was to protect you, and he did the opposite. It was NEVER your fault, and you were NEVER to blame. Even if you straight up asked him to, it would still be entirely and completely his fault. Have you been able to get into therapy? 

Sending you lots of love.
I promise you, even the people who seem like they never have to question themselves or how they fit in.. still do. I worked with celebrities for years and you would be amazed at how many of those people were *cripplingly* insecure. No matter how rich, famous, beautiful, straight, whatever you are… real happiness only comes from within. Self-acceptance is a journey and for me it didn’t come until my early 30’s after lots of therapy, including some alternative therapy.

Also, you mentioned not feeling like you fit in with the current queer culture. Please know that’s totally okay! There’s something painful but beautiful about not quite fitting in anywhere - it means you have something special to offer to the world and if you try to fit perfectly into a little box you’ll never shine the way you’re meant to.
There’s a whole lot of philosophies and religions that are based on these ideas, so I don’t know of one particular name to give you. But you might enjoy checking out /r/reincarnation and /r/pastlives there’s discussions and tons of amazing stories.

Past life regression meditation is where you go into a meditative state and (with the help of a hypnotist IRL or on the video) you are able to look at a life you’ve lived before. It doesn’t always work so don’t get discouraged. I’ve probably done it at least a dozen times but I’ve only seen 4 lives. [Here’s a good one,](https://youtu.be/pKM2i3pi5b8) but there’s lots more if that one doesn’t work for you. 

Also.. If you’re on TikTok, I highly recommend searching “Christian deconstructing”, there’s a huge community of people who are going through the same process you are and it’s very encouraging:)
I understand. It’s a process and it’s not always linear. I’m proud of you for working on your healing, it’s not easy and you are strong.
I’m sorry this is happening to you. Dreams are your subconscious mind’s way of trying to make you face what you’re feeling in real life. Unfortunately it does this by writing crazy scripts packed with metaphors. Since you often dream about being trapped, I’d imagine you are feeling trapped in some way in your real life. You can Google any detail of your dreams and the meaning and find lots of possible interpretations. But feel free to message me if you like:)
I was raised Christian and now I believe exactly what you described:) I did some past life regression meditations on YouTube that totally changed my perspective. If you scroll down through my old posts I wrote about it in one called “I feel like I was healed of some inherited trauma while meditating” where I described one of my experiences. That one left me unable to believe in a God that would send people to hell ever again. 

I know how hard it is to leave religion, especially when you’ve been in it your whole life and your friends and family are in it too. But remember that you and only you get to decide what you believe. And you don’t even have to decide! Give yourself time and space to just be open minded and curious and explore and let your heart guide you:)
Wow, that’s actually pretty special. I study dreams and my advice would be to try and work with them. As soon as you open your eyes in the morning, write down (or type in your phone) every detail of the dreams that you can remember. You can learn a lot about what your subconscious mind is trying to tell you by googling the meaning behind various aspects of your dreams. For example people who are in a stressful, out of control situation in life often dream of being in a speeding car they can’t properly drive or with brakes that don’t work. 

But meanings aside, just the act of starting the day by writing out your dreams will help you create a clearer distinction between waking and dreaming time. And side note, there’s a lot of fun things you can do with dreams (like lucid dreaming and astral projection) that might be easier for you than most:)
I’m so sorry this happened to you, and so sorry that the adults who should have protected you failed to do so. You deserved better. If you haven’t already, going to therapy could really really help. SA affects us in ways that aren’t always obvious. But you can work through it I promise.
Hahaha “This Johnny Cash guy is gonna make a name for himself someday. I can feel it.”
I love that :) did anything in particular prompt you to start coming up with it?
A most delicious discovery!
I remember having a sore throat when I was little and noticing how good it felt to breathe the steam coming from the dishwasher. I definitely thought I was going to be famous for discovering that steam relieves sore throats.
It’s hard to explain to anyone who hasn’t experienced it. A massive… *something* flew over my car, silently, late at night on my 30th birthday. My husband and I were freaking out and staring in disbelief, and it did occur to me to get my phone out but I just didn’t. I couldn’t stop staring, and I didn’t want to miss anything. I get why people who haven’t seen anything like that would think that it would be second nature to whip out the phone. But it just felt like a very low priority to me in that moment for some reason.
I would be very tempted to “accidentally” not make it to the bathroom every time I needed to vomit for the rest of the shift. The only thing that would stop me is knowing someone who is also underpaid would have to clean it up:(
If y’all aren’t in contact I think it would be best to keep it that way.
I agree with you. Perhaps I should have worded it differently and said that she should be with someone who loves her as she is:)
You should be doing what makes you feel good and he should love you as you are. It’s weird that he’s mad about this. If he likes seeing you dressed up that’s cool, but he should give you a chance to get dressed up for something that makes sense like a nice dinner. Not football lol. I’m sorry.
You are capable of having a healthy happy relationship even if it didn’t work out for your mom. She probably means well but she’s misguided in thinking that all marriages end horribly lol. You have to live your own life and make the choices that are right for you.
RUN!!! No amount of beauty is worth being physically abused and manipulated over. She’ll only get worse. I promise you you’ll be 10X happier with someone who is sane, loving and would never dream of hurting you on purpose.
“I don’t feel like it’s that simple for this long of a relationship.” It kinda is though. Whether you’ve been together for a month or a decade, the fact that his family does not support your relationship and not only excludes you, but actively tries to replace you, is a huge problem. Clearly he’s not able to make them cut it out completely and respect your relationship together. He’s trying to toe the line between pleasing you and them, but that’s not possible because they’re opposed to you being around at all. 

I know it’s hard, but please consider if this is what you want for your future. Because they won’t change, and it will be a continual source of tension and hurt.
Can you please give some examples of him needling, poking the bear? It’s hard to get a read on the situation without more context. If you feel yourself getting angry do you walk away from the conversation to cool off?
Yes that is very manipulative for sure. That’s emotional abuse on top of the physical abuse! I’m very glad you got away from him. Now you know to walk away at the first sign of someone not respecting your boundaries. Because if they’ll do it once they’ll do it again, worse and worse. Big hugs to you. I’m proud of you for getting away and learning from it:)
I’m so sorry this happened to you. I’m concerned that you feel bad about threatening to punch him in that scenario. Please know that if you’re ever in that situation again, you NEED to do what you need to do to get away. Punch him in the face, balls, whatever you can. Your friend is the one who’s fake af if she’s taking his side. Keep them and people like them out of your life.
That’s really sad for her:( I’m so glad she’s in therapy. Her innocence was taken away at a very young age due to that exposure and she needs support. Be a listening ear, empathize with her and be supportive of her going to therapy and working through the trauma. Healing is very much possible and it sounds like she’s doing what she can.
You’re allowed to feel how you feel. Porn is highly addictive and he may have a problem. If that’s a deal breaker for you, that’s completely fine and nothing you should feel bad about. Talk to him about it and see how he responds. Don’t feel bad about how you feel or try and pretend to be cool with it if you’re not.
Yeah, and I’m sure that was difficult to deal with since you’re only trying to help. Try and keep in mind that ED is a form of addiction so just like with any addict, when they feel like their addiction is being threatened they will lash out, even at the people who are trying to help. It’s tough and my heart goes out to you 💕
Personally, the mundane daily life stuff from the ancient past *is* the most interesting to me. I’m not that interested in battles or notable events but I love looking at ancient hair and makeup products, restaurants, home decor etc.
It sounds like he felt cornered and accused. Next time .. Try and use more empathetic language like “I love the both of you very much, and your health and well being is important to me. Please know that if you ever need support with your ED or anything else, now or in the future, I’d like to help.” 

They are adults and they have to make their own decisions, so there’s only so much you can do. I’m sorry.
Oh my. /u/sqitten has given you some solid advice that I agree with, please take it to heart. The next step with people like her is usually gaslighting, making you feel confused and crazy for having a problem with her behavior. So please try to keep a clear head and get some outside support as soon as possible.
That scares me so much to know that people are being actively shamed for showing empathy. Empathy is like the #1 ingredient to a healthy society. Lack of empathy indicates a seriously emotionally unintelligent person. If that becomes the ideal we’re screwed.
Whaaa? Familiarize yourself with DARVO. Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. That’s what she’s doing. There’s nothing misogynistic about standing up for yourself and not wanting to be called names. Does she do this with issues you try to address?
I am so very sorry that you lost your brother and father. That’s an enormous trauma and its very understandable that it’s affecting your relationships. Are you in therapy? I think you touched on something very important when you said “it’s the same thing I say to myself most of the time”. We can only give to others the amount of love and empathy that we give to ourselves. If you’re telling yourself that you shouldn’t complain about “little” problems, you won’t be able to empathize with other’s problems either. Pain comes in all shapes and sizes. You’re allowed to feel upset about things, even if they seem small compared to the tragedy you’ve experienced. And other people are too. Try and find compassion for yourself and it will get easier to show compassion to your friends. 

Please give yourself a hug from me, and feel free to reach out any time. I care 💕
I’m afraid that can’t be your problem. He has to want to change, make solid efforts to do so, and find support along the way. As it stands, you’re enabling him, which is the last thing he needs. I don’t want to sound harsh because I know you’re confused and caught up in all this, but you HAVE to kick him out and let him hit rock bottom out of your sight. For your own sake and his.
Coming back to add, congrats on getting sober and pulling your life together again. That takes enormous strength and I’m proud of you:) now BOOT him! lol
Oh my bad, I’m not sure why I thought it was! It sounds like she might not even be aware of why she’s getting triggered. But even if she is aware, the fact that she won’t communicate her issue is all the more reason to try and not let it affect you too much. At any age, but at your age especially, relationships are about learning and growing and getting to know yourself better. Don’t let her weirdness throw you off and make you overthink something that’s making you happy.
That’s odd. I wonder if deep down she’s feeling sad/weird about the fact that you’re in your first relationship and just trying to slow it down for her own comfort. At 4 months it’s perfectly normal to talk every day. You could try asking her if she’s got any concerns, but at the end of the day only you can decide what’s best for you in this relationship.
I hope OP sees this. I feel so bad for him:(
Well regardless, she’s definitely into you and I think you should ask her to hang out sometime:)
Absolutely do not keep him around. Kick him out, change the locks, and never speak to him again. He ruined your life once and he’ll do it again. Narcissistic people almost always have an addiction of some kind and they will bleed you dry of your time, energy, and money for as long as you let them. Who cares that he’s attractive? I promise you you’d be a billion times better off with a healthy, happy partner who is less attractive than this mess of a person. Do NOT fool yourself into thinking you can help him or that you’re his best chance to self-improvement. Narcissists love it when you think you’re the super special person that can save them because it incentives you to keep trying. He’s not going to change no matter what you do.
It sounds like it’s way too early for either of you to really know how you feel besides that you like each other and want to see where it goes. So I’m not sure what your question is.
From what you’ve shared here she’s 100% into you. She was probably hoping for more than just “what” when she said she’d kiss you, so she took it back. If she’s shy then you’re probably gonna have to make the next move.
Aww man, my heart goes out to you friend. I can tell that you take things very seriously when it comes to how you behave and treat others. You are NOT a horrible person, by any means. Your intentions were misguided, but honorable. 

I think you already know this, but your definition of love is very skewed. Love is not about putting your own needs and feelings aside and suffering in silence. Not at all. In fact, you can only love others to the degree that you love yourself. I gather that it might be challenging for you as you tend to intellectualize more than you feel, but try to really offer yourself as much love and respect and forgiveness as you can throughout all this. You’ve already been self-harming by way of ignoring your own needs. Don’t double down on it by shaming yourself for the fallout. If you can get into therapy I think it would be really helpful. And definitely try reading some books on healthy relationships so you have a better understanding about what it means to be a good partner.
You’re welcome! I hope the conversation goes well:)
Aww man, I’m glad you’re at least a little more comfortable but still.. that sucks! Don’t let the fact that your mom is paying for everything keep you from being upfront about your needs. And having a bed is a pretty basic need! If she really cares about you having a nice time that’s the least she can do! And congrats on the wedding:)
I am so sorry you’re going through this. I don’t know of course, but it’s possible he could have attachment issues. Read up on avoidant attachment, specifically. But regardless of the reason, which you may never know for sure, allow yourself plenty of time to grieve the loss of what you had and what you hoped you could have together. You’re in the hardest part right now and it will get easier, I promise. I went through something similar and had to learn the hard way to pace myself in relationships, because it really does take time to learn how another person operates on a deep level. I think that as you heal and grow from this, it will get easier to vet future partners and give yourself some time to feel it out before falling too deep. There are people out there who will love you just as deeply as you love them, I promise.
Another thought, if you are able to you could go ahead and go find a couch or something in the house, and that will kickstart the conversation in the morning when she finds you no longer on the boat.
Oh my. You have every right to be annoyed! You’re the one being celebrated, you shouldn’t be sleeping on the floor lol. I’m sorry babe. It sounds like it’s too late to switch it up tonight but in the morning I would tell her that you were really uncomfortable and will need an actual bed for the remainder of the trip. If you think she might be argumentative or weird about it then bring it up in the group so that others can help you figure something out.
Definitely bring it up if it’s bothering you! There’s a whole range of possibilities, he could just be feeling a little down and it’s affecting his communication style. He could have avoidant attachment issues and you guys getting closer triggered him. Etc. Try to open up communication and see what he says. If you can’t get a straight answer from him or he says nothings wrong but then continues to be distant, it’s probably time to walk away. Good luck:)
💕🙈 that makes my day, thank you love!!!!
Ahhhh!! Thank you so much!!! I’ve been thinking of it like a portal so looking at it through your eyes as a sun or moon adds a whole new perspective and I love it 💕☀️🌖
/u/artisticnoob both those comparisons are making my day, thank you guys!! 💕🥰💕
That means so much to me, thank you!!
Love this!!! 💕🦜
Gorgeous! Love the title, too 💙
Thank you so much!! 💕🥰
Thank you so much!! 💕💕💕

I love your style!
Thank you! 💕💕
Love the background colors!
Oops, meant to write 4ft tall cardboard! Not 5ft. Anyway here’s a video of my process:) [https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRqYLr1X/](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRqYLr1X/)
Yes! I use brushes occasionally but I find that painting with my hands really helps me loosen up and stop overthinking everything:)
I’m glad it found you and you replied, it’s really nice to know it’s not just me!! I have an Aries stellium too lol. We neeeeed the excitement!
I have an Aries Mars so I act like I have no sense whatsoever
Oh my goodness, this made me cry so much!!! Wow wow wow I am so proud of you and happy for you and thankful to hear that you’re doing so well <3 you have unbelievable strength and power to have made it through everything you’ve been through. I knew you could do it <3 thank you so much for this message, it means the world to know that it helped you. I’m always in your corner and here for you any time!
I have a Capricorn moon so I feel bad for myself that I don’t know how to feel. 


^Well that was way too accurate.
No problem:) good luck to both of you guys!
Absolutely. Just the fact that you already kinda talked about it (even if it was just joking) really helps. My ex and I would joke about staying friends no matter what, too:) and we have. You might need some time to adjust and reset as individuals, but just continue to be respectful and supportive of each other and you’ll be good.
I love this so so much oh my goodness 😍💕
I’m so very sorry you went through that, especially so many times. Its a heartbreak I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. And yes we do need much better resources for helping people cope, and less stigma around talking about it because it’s so common but so rarely discussed.
I mean, yes of course that’s a bizarre and disturbing thing to do, but people dealing with extreme trauma/tragedy don’t always react in logical, or “appropriate” ways. I had a miscarriage at 12 weeks and the grief of that alone made me kinda crazy for a while. Not to mention after childbirth there’s a massive hormonal change and a bunch of other stuff that’s challenging even when you have a healthy baby. Idk.. I just think it’s way too simplistic to write it off as simply wanting attention or caring about getting likes too much or whatever. And I feel bad for her to go through all that, and then be dragged down further bc she coped in a really weird way.
Oh I love these!! The meat one is so gross but so relatable lol.. something about being slightly high gets me super in touch with my intuition. Sometimes I end up doing what seems like completely random shit but then I end up understanding the reason why I felt compelled to do it after the fact. Nothing as crazy as that though, usually just stuff like feeling the need to reach out to a friend and it turns out they just got bad news or something.
Whoa that’s pretty cool.. did it seem unusually big to you at the time? Or only in retrospect after that nap? Like did it go from normal to big and then back to normal, or just “normal” and then way smaller? I don’t know if that makes sense but I tried :)
I’d love to hear some of your experiences if you feel like sharing!
I wish I had:( for some reason I had the feeling like I shouldn’t go in there. I’m not sure if it was actually a bad idea or just a fear of the unknown but I couldn’t bring myself to crawl in. And then it was gone.
This is my favorite one, and I totally believe you! I think kids have an ability to peer into dimensions that for whatever reason get harder to see as adults. My story isn’t as cool as yours but when I was a kid I looked into a pile of pillows that were kind of stacked together in a tunnel shape, but somehow the tunnel went on and on like hundreds of times longer than the pillows themselves. I walked away and walked back to look again and it was just back to being a normal stack of pillows.
Yes or like we want to be their new BFF when actually we’re just being genuinely friendly but not like we want to be like *friend* friends. That’s the only downside of the placement imo. Accidentally leading people on!
Just curious, do you feel like that in real life? Trying to figure out the best direction to take and keep ending up in the wrong places?
I would say that the guilt and shame of killing the dog probably factored into the situation a lot. But regardless, please do not think that all women are like this. I have spent the last 3 years trying to help my boyfriend open up, cry, rage, whatever he needs to process his feelings. Every bit of progress he’s made has been so incredibly rewarding and brought us closer together. The only way I’d weed him out as a mate is if he stopped working on expressing his feelings and started trying to be all stoic again. As a partner it’s exhausting and isolating always having to wonder what your mate is really feeling. 

If you end up with another person who can’t handle seeing you cry, weed HER out and don’t look back. You do not deserve that sexist bullshit.
I’m sure there’s a lot of additional factors like that, but from what I understand the tradition stems from the days where talking about “women’s problems” like periods, menopause, etc were taboo and so miscarriage was supposed to be kept quiet. But if someone wants to tell their friends and family early on, it’s easy enough to say that it’s still early and they should wait a few months before making any purchases.
I actually wish the whole “don’t tell anyone too early” notion would go away, too. Losing your pregnancy, even if you have only been pregnant for a few weeks, can be so incredibly sad. And if you haven’t told anyone then you’re either alone in that pain, or having to tell people that you need support from that you were pregnant, and now you’re not. Of course some people would rather be alone in that process regardless, and if that’s how they feel there’s nothing wrong at all with keeping it quiet. I just wish there wasn’t a stigma around announcing “too early”. It kind of creates a social isolation around anyone grieving before that 12 week mark.
It makes me glad to see someone else talking about the Just World Fallacy. I used to post about it online like a reverse evangelist all the time bc I think it’s so important for people to understand that this way of thinking is prevalent and insidious. Even non-religious people do it without realizing it, either to avoid having to empathize or to make themselves feel like if they just do everything “right”, they’ll be safe.
I’m curious about the micro-dose. My life has been changed in other ways due to a standard amount of it on separate 3 occasions over 2 years. Was it a one time thing, and did you go into it with the intention of facing your addictions?

Edit: also, congrats on your accomplishment, really encouraging to hear your progress:)
I have a theory that the rest of your chart plays into what kind of connections you’ll enjoy, which is a little too complicated for an app to take into consideration. For example my Venus is in Aries so I kinda like it when things are “exciting” AKA complicated lol. So for me, a Delicate or Complex bond is stimulating and fun but an Extraordinary or Powerful bond can be boring. Like it’s *too* easy.
What did the tire look like?
Ahh same here!! I guess it’s been about 2 or 3 weeks for me that I’ve obsessing over my jaw muscles bc something just felt off. I kept trying different massage techniques to make it feel normal again. This is really interesting. 

Did you feel it when our ribs changed?
You sound like a really good person. Your mama is lucky to have you 💕
That’s beautiful. It seems like most souls tend to reincarnate within the same family. I bet he’s been really looking forward to seeing you guys again!! 💕💕💕
First of all I’m very sorry for your loss 💕 That’s really cool about the dream, and I firmly believe that the women in a family line are super tuned in to the energy of new babies. When I was pregnant with my kids I didn’t want to know the gender until they were born. But me, my mom and my grandmother were completely positive I was having a girl, and I was. Same thing with my next baby, we knew it was a boy and he was!
Pluto! [Here’s a pic of my chart, feel free to ask any questions! ](https://ibb.co/J2kjvZ6)
I have those two in my second house. I tend to have a lot of money or none lol.
How did it work out, if you don’t mind sharing?
This hurt my heart to read :,( I love people who dress however makes them happy and I hate to think of her being made to feel bad about her awesome, quirky self.
Thank you so much <3 I’m okay, I’m thankful that my dog’s life was so full and happy, and that she had such a peaceful ending. And there are positives to being single and not having an elderly dog to tend to any more, such as being more free and independent, traveling. etc. So it’s really hard to cope with all at once, but I’m trying to think of it as a new chapter, with gratitude.
In my 9th house. On the night of the lunar eclipse I told my boyfriend (for the billionth time) that we needed to start doing some very things differently because I just wasn’t happy in our relationship, and he said he’d work on it but he didn’t, so on June 8th I broke things off. Then later that night my sweet little dog’s health took a serious turn for the worse, and I had to put her down on the morning of the eclipse. I’ve had her with me for 14 years. She was a Gemini Sun and Sagittarius moon. I’m heartbroken.
It’s amazing you were able to recognize the pain you were causing and turn it around. Especially after everything you went through yourself. Just commenting to say I’m proud of you:) and don’t give up on your brother closest in age, it may take time but if he’s able to heal on his own he may come around to the idea of a closer relationship with you.
Happy birthday!!
That’s a good life skill to have.
Did you get to play with them?
So it was entrapment! What a bastard.
Aww that’s a good one. My little boy is 4 years old now and I always wonder what random stuff he’ll remember:)
lol and of all the beverages you could have chosen to spit out, you went with the one most likely to stain the carpet.
Aww.. those early childhood accomplishments are the best!
How did that turn out?
I have a vivid memory of standing in my cousin’s yard, staring at a tree.
I’m not a Christian, but /u/AnotherReaderofStuff is right, the Bible does say that, although it’s in Matthew not Revelation. Start on verse 34 of [Jesus’ sermon in Matthew 25](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3fsearch=Matthew%2b25&version=NIV&interface=amp). He’s saying that if you didn’t take care of the poor, imprisoned, etc while you were on earth you don’t get a spot in heaven.
Wow that’s really cool. Would you mind sharing what sort of meaningless thoughts and views you saw yourself having as a teen? I feel like I waste a lot of energy on meaningless thoughts now as an adult but I’m trying to improve. 

Thanks for sharing, I hope the despair goes away completely soon and that you find more and more warmth and happiness in your life:)
Yeah it’s a different song but it’s a similar vibe to The Beach Boys so I’m thinking OP might have just mis-remembered slightly.
Are you thinking of [this one? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/kepohv/back_in_the_beforefore_times/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
That’s a real gift, I have it too with some close friends. For example once I started spontaneously crying while I was in the shower, and I had no idea why. I wasn’t even sad. But my friend’s name came to mind immediately after so I texted him and sure enough he’d just had a heartbreaking thing happen to him. I think it’s possible our brains are silently communicating with each other in ways we can’t observe with current technology, and some may just have stronger communication links than others. Whatever it is I’m glad you guys found each other:)
Thank you:)
You should give it a go! There’s some great ones on YouTube you could try, people seem to have a lot of success with [this one. ](https://youtu.be/YxXZhRNd-Cs) I totally get being wary, but it seems like the subconscious has a mechanism of sorts that will only allow you to see what you can handle. I tried many times before I saw anything, and when I finally did I understood why I hadn’t been able to see it before. I actually [participated in a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/pastlives/comments/lnlkie/911_past_life/go1gv0j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) about this recently if you’re interested. It seems to be a somewhat common experience.
It’s.. it’s complicated lol. But I love him very much. When I saw him in the glass thing I looked at him for a long time and then I understood that he’d be hurting a lot in this life. Then I understood a second thing that made me agree to him being my dad. Unfortunately I don’t remember at all what that second thing was. But I assume it’s something that I’m not supposed to remember, just learn over time?
Oh wow! I’ll have to check it out, thank you for telling me:)
I did a past life regression once where I saw myself choosing my parents. I was sat in front of a giant clear glass with a gold frame that had pictures of all the options, and I could kind of flip through them like turning pages in a book but with my mind. I was flipping through them thinking Nope, nope, nope.. because I felt nothing when I looked at the couple. Until I got to my parents, and I totally freaked out with excitement because I recognized my mom’s soul from having what felt like thousands of happy lifetimes together. I said “SHE could be my MOM?! Yes yes yes” and then I looked at my dad and didn’t recognize him at all, but understood they were a package deal. There’s more details but yeah, it was very interesting.
Oh interesting.. my little boy always called water by what sounded like “whoa”. I’m curious now if that sound matches the word for water in another language.
Oh wow.. I love this 💕 thank you for sharing
Theoretically though, if a conscious (or soul, if you prefer) doesn’t need a living brain and body to operate from then one could exist in a plant, animal, maybe even a drop of rain or just floating in space.
22 is an incredibly powerful number in numerology, it’s considered by many to be the most powerful “Master Number”. Really cool that you have a significant astrological event on that date. I can’t tell you what to expect but I wish you the best:)
Adderall starts trying to make the bed while you’re still in it.
You’re awesome, thank you for saying that! I sure want to be a good mother.. she deserves it:) Re: my big 3 yes I absolutely feel pulled in many directions a lot! Today my Pisces sun just wants to meditate, feel my feelings, read Tarot cards and sit with my crystals, while my Libra rising wants to shop for new nail polish and hang out with my boyfriend. Meanwhile my Cap moon is telling me that all of the above is a luxury and I shouldn’t “indulge” until my house is spotless and I’ve researched some investments.
Bless you, this is all so helpful and encouraging and helps me understand what’s going on in her brilliant little head. Going from distraught to cracking jokes is sooo her. It’s nice to know that isn’t unusual. And I absolutely *love* the idea of turning the process of talking about her feelings into a game itself, I think she’d really enjoy that, and it would help create a more positive association with emotional processing bc right now I think she wants to but then feels like it is too boring lol. She’s a great reader but she’s not writing fast enough yet to keep up with all she wants to say, so maybe I can create another little game for that, where she can tell me what she’s thinking and I write it down for her. 

I’m a Pisces sun, Capricorn moon and Libra rising. My only Gemini placement is my Chiron, but I do have my moon and Neptune in the third house.
Look up “attachment styles” and specifically “anxious attachment”. I have this and it’s a struggle, but being aware of it is hugely helpful.
This is such lovely and helpful advice. I can’t thank you enough! Definitely sounds like my little fairy. She even says “No one understands me” sometimes which makes my heart ache. I have another question if you don’t mind.. a lot of times when she’s feeling things deeply and lashing out, I take her to a private place and give her space to talk about what she’s feeling. She often says that first she wants to play some word games, like coming up with a word for each letter of the alphabet (sooo Gemini!) and I do. But then it can be almost impossible to get her to actually start talking about her feelings. She’ll just keep suggesting other games. I guess what I’m trying to figure out is if playing games is actually helping her or is she just avoiding processing her feelings?
My 6 year old daughter has the same big 3 as you. If you have any parenting advice pls share.
My lifetime before this one I was “human” in terms of how I felt, like my sense of individuality and my emotions. But I looked more like a cheetah or leopard on two legs. I could run and climb really, really fast. The planet I lived on was completely peaceful, so much so that I found it almost boring. I spent most of my time on a small space craft doing missions with my friends, who were giant blue lobster looking guys. We all communicated telepathically. I remember more details about my job than anything else. Unfortunately I don’t remember anything about my childhood, and I don’t remember there being anything like what we would call a couple or a family, so I wonder how babies were even made there. Wish I could remember more, maybe someday.
Yeah those memories were rough, they were so much worse than I would have guessed. As for who he is in this life, the TV show is still on the air and he’s still on it, so I have some idea of what he’s like in this lifetime. It seems like he’s still got some anger issues, but he’s come a loooooong way, that’s for sure. I haven’t tried to contact him, I’m afraid I’d just sound like a deranged fan lol. But I’m okay with not meeting him in this life, I feel like we reincarnate with the people who we’re meant to learn from in each life, so if there’s anything to be gained by us meeting it’ll happen on it’s own.

And it’s a pleasure talking with you too! Thank you for sharing your story. I was in high school when 9/11 happened and it was all so shocking and tragic. It’s oddly comforting to think of the victims living new lives, and the things that happened to them being a distant memory. But I’m so very sorry that happened to you, and I hope you get the answers you seek.
Not the person you’re responding to but I’ve had experience with not being ready to remember certain things. Years ago I used to watch this TV show with a C-list celebrity that isn’t very interesting on his own, but watching him made me feel *deeply* angry but also kind of.. aroused? I’m not someone who easily forms emotional attachments to celebrities so this was really confusing bc the feelings were just so irrationally strong. I did at least half a dozen past life regressions and never saw anything about him. Then years later, after I had done a lot of work on personal stuff that was affecting me in *this* life, a flood of memories came back while I was meditating that pretty much answered all my questions. I won’t get into the details but basically he was my uncle in a past life and he was horrible to me, but I had a Stockholm syndrome type of affection for him nonetheless. I saw the horrific things he did to me and yeah.. I was definitely not ready to see that back when I first started trying. 

The reasons you’re not able to see it might be different, but like /u/redseaaquamarine said you’ll see it when you’re ready. And it’ll probably make sense to you then why you couldn’t see it before.
Aries!
Scorpio
Leo
I’m up for almost anything but prefer that it be exciting or novel in some way. I feel a little awkward being romantic in the traditional sense, so flowers, chocolate, etc is definitely not a requirement.
This is great advice, thank you so much:)
Thank you!
Aries
Wow that’s interesting. I found myself reflecting on some events that I experienced in Feb 2018 just this morning. Do you happen to have any more info?
My son is a Scorpio Sun and rising, Leo moon. He’s only 4 years old though. Any advice you may have for me as a parent would be appreciated:)
How long do you cook for?
I’m close.. Pisces Sun, Cap moon and Libra rising. I’m your slightly more approachable sibling ;)
Not that it matters but what the hell is the context of that? Like, who’s children? Immigrant’s? Liberal’s? Just random kids?
No problem.. [this one ](https://mauihawaiitheworld.wordpress.com/2016/11/20/future-predictions-when-saturn-conjuncts-pluto-in-2020/?fbclid=IwAR3sNkwi8sbXaEZizeXuL_L15RqmbOvMKjeaBmcJZcV1eVcgAgT1F2KrXnY) from 2016 is good because it recaps the historic events that followed previous, similar conjunctions like the ones had last year.
It depends on what you’re looking at studying. There’s different areas of focus, like personal astrology (your own/someone else’s birth chart), synastry (how two people’s charts interact with each other), which is used for relationships. Mundane astrology is used to predict events, and tbh I’m not educated enough on the methods to help with a recommendation.
I usually look at similar themes in my real life. Houses/apts often represent the dreamer’s own mind. So in this case, it might be about wanting to make some changes in yourself but feeling like you’re going from bad to worse, mentally. Just an example but hopefully helps:)
There’s a lot of old (like, years old) astrology articles saying that 2020 would be a globally historic shitshow. We had a whole lot of these types of conjunctions over the past year and we’re not done. The newspaper style horoscopes and stuff are definitely BS but actual astrology, the type that is ancient and takes years to learn, is really very interesting.
I really like em.. I think the Pisces/Cap combo balance each other out nicely, and the Libra rising gives me a nice, approachable vibe.
Libra rising
Yayyy! How do you feel about the combo?
Hey we’re almost twins:) I have Libra rising.
I couldn’t get into the clinical trials so I did a kind of DIY version on my own. But [here’s](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/08/14/746614170/mdma-aka-ecstasy-shows-promise-as-a-ptsd-treatment) a good rundown on how they do it. I had a friend sit with me and I’m so thankful, I’d love to pay it forward so if you need someone to sit with you, I’d be very glad to help via Zoom or something.
I still struggle at times with intimacy, but I’ve come a loooong way. Regular therapy helped a lot, as well as using MDMA (aka Molly) in a therapeutic setting. I can go into more details about that if you’re interested. For me, the biggest hurdle was admitting to myself that I needed help processing it and healing.
That’s so awful, and so fucked up of your friends to respond that way. I’m so sorry. There’s nothing lucky about having your bodily autonomy violated, no matter what the violator looks like. To suggest otherwise is a gross, ignorant lack of empathy and understanding. It took me 13 years to tell anyone what happened to me because I was so afraid of not being believed. So my heart really, really goes out to you, knowing how much not being believed just adds to the trauma of it all.
I believe you and I’m so sorry that happened to you. Please don’t think that because you didn’t force her off that you are to blame in any way. Response to trauma is automatic and we don’t really get to consciously choose between fight, flight and freeze. I froze when I was coerced into sexual abuse as a teen and for a long time I felt shame about it. But I shouldn’t, and neither should you.
Could be a past life memory.
I have a few questions that would help with interpretation.. who’s house is it? Are you in the same house every time or does it change? What about the locations.. are you in the living room, basement, etc? Are there any patterns in which part of the house the attackers come through?
Where is your GlowWorm now?
Seems like there’s quite a few of us. I hope it’s symbolic, like of an era in a spiritual sense! Also.. funny sync that you responded to me just now bc I was literally just thinking about you! You wrote me some very kind encouraging words during a rough patch a few years ago and I’m forever thankful 🥲
Weird, my boyfriend and I both had vivid dreams last night. In his dream he lost his job and his house burned down. In my dream my house was being torn apart an apocalyptic storm and my son was terribly injured.
They’re in the very late degrees of Capricorn right now, and by the 21st of this month they’ll be in Aquarius.
What are you listening to?
Same here. I miss being able to look at the houses!
I’m sorry. When you say everybody else, who do you mean?
Hey congrats! I got off mine about 3 years ago and I’m so glad I did. I learned that the meds were putting a damper on my positive feels too, not just the negative ones. So while I might have some moments once in a while of feeling much sadder than I would on meds, I also get to experience a lot more excitement, love, happiness, etc. every day.  BTW I highly recommend taking St. John’s Wort herbal supplements If you can. They’re cheap, OTC, non-addictive,  and as effective as some SSRIs at curbing depression. 

Anyway, what’s a song you’ve listened to lately?
What’s the weirdest food order you’ve ever gotten?
Well the fact you skate tells me that you aren’t too lazy to move your body, you know how to get back up when you fall,  and you like to learn new things. Keep it up:) You can apply the same energy to other things now and in the future.
Well maybe you just haven’t found out what makes you feel alive yet. School is great but it’s not everything, and failing definitely doesn’t make you a loser. What do you do when you’re not being productive?
What makes you think you’re a loser?
I see, I don’t know if it will require a harness or not then, but maybe. Is that something that you’re worried about?
Gah. That’s messed up!! I wonder if there’s any kind of loans for stuff like this that would have lower payments? I’m uninsured right now and thankfully my health is good but yeah.. it’s scary how fast medical debt can pile up here in the states. 

And you’re welcome. I’m always here if you want to chat or vent or just need some encouragement. You’ll see the other side of this someday and in the meantime, be kind to yourself 💕
I’m so sorry for everything you’re going through. That’s a lot. Why do you have to come up with the money in just two days?
I’m sorry this happened to you. That’s awful. You deserve better people in your life, and I hope you find them:)
I’m not sure. There’s different types of buses, but usually they don’t have harnesses.
I relate to this.. I was raised in an uber-conservative environment (I literally only knew of two people in my hometown who were openly liberal lol) and it wasn’t until my mid-twenties that I felt safe expressing just how different my views are now. If I can offer some advice, when you do start talking about it, be as calm and as humble as you can. I’m *amazed* how open minded people can be when they don’t feel like they have to defend themselves. Using phrases like “I was surprised to learn..” or “something I’ve been thinking about lately..” really helps. I think it will also help a LOT that you are interested in doing things differently, and what you would like to see in a new political party. The whole Democrats vs Republicans thing is so toxic and it gets people all worked up. But by approaching it from a neutral perspective and making it about new ideas, you can really help people open their mind. Even if they don’t admit it to you:)
Are you trying to decide whether you want to try it?
lol I get that. What part of history are you learning about rn?
I hope you enjoy the new program. I’m sure it will be a cool and safe experience:)
Do the people around you know that you no longer agree with those views, or are you keeping it quiet for now? If they know, how did they respond?
What’s one thing you’d change about your life right now, if you could?
I’m afraid have massively different perspectives on this, my friend. I can see how you feel I’m being obtuse, because you seem obtuse from my perspective. But we’re not, we’re just on very different pages, and that’s okay. You are fully entitled to your perspective and I wish you well 💕
They could share that wealth to an enormously powerful, beneficial extent if they chose to, but they choose not to. If you’re a part of my company, supply chain, whatever, and you help me earn 20 dollars, and then I keep $19.99 for myself, and gift you with a penny, I have generated wealth for you. Doesn’t mean I am a great person doing great things for you. I’m a selfish dick capitalizing off your work and reaping the benefits.
They are not generating immense wealth for anybody but themselves and their shareholders. Instead of murdering a dozen or so people, serial killer style, they are in possession of millions of wage slaves who must grind away for decades just to hopefully have food, shelter and healthcare. That is not productive use in my book, not at all.
Of course! And btw I think the story of your friend giving you the crystal is so cool. Those spiritually intuitive kinda friends are a blessing 🤗
I don’t think it’s idiotic at all:) I think it’s really cool that they’ll share those placements, and I bet they will have a lot of understanding for each other as they grow up.
I was curious too so I found [this.](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/13/us/nixon-dropping-protection-by-secret-service.html) TL;DR he said he wanted to save the government money by hiring his own security team.
As others have already mentioned, that’s not a good astrology app. But in addition I think they have some kind of listening capability built-in because their “Do and Don’t” keywords have been way too “accurate” for me more than once. When I was redecorating my front porch I got “Front Porch” as a Do for the day. Another time I was asking my boyfriend if we had any parchment paper and “Parchment” was one of my Dos the next day. That’s not astrology that’s spying lol.
I have the same theory. The whole Jesus as Messiah storyline is remarkably similar to much older mythological origin stories, including the Virgin birth and coming back from the dead. And it’s Paul who flipped all the stuff Jesus said about helping the poor on its head and said instead “If a man doesn’t work, he shouldn’t eat.” Actually, Paul flipped just about everything Jesus said around and Christians believe what Paul says Jesus .. uh .. *meant to say* far more than they believe what Jesus actually said. Christianity is 100% a religion of Paul. Jesus the man would have wanted nothing to do with it.
Taxpayers are already footing the bill for their being arrested, sentenced, jailed, on probation, etc. Treating it as an addiction rather than a crime might very well end up being cheaper, and actually help people. But we will see. Agree with/u/2MuckingFuch that this will serve as a good test run either way.
I like you. You’re smart. I think the Democratic Party has utterly failed to address the most important issues facing Americans, and frankly I’m not convinced those at the top level care one bit. Except for Bernie of course. They’d rather go hog wild combatting fringe issues and demonizing anybody who supports Trump than look at themselves critically. In 2016 I wrote a mildly critical comment about Hillary on a liberal site and got nasty, hateful messages for WEEKS. And I even said in my comment that I do not at all support Trump. There’s this self-righteous, fuck everybody who disagrees attitude among Democrats that is gonna be the death of them if they don’t change. I’m like you, still figuring out my politics, but socialism seems to be the best way forward for us IMO. But like /u/api is saying, we have to start by putting up a candidate who will earnestly address the very legitimate concerns of the American heartland. And stop being so damn unwelcoming to anyone who isn’t already on “our” side. 

At the end of the day, humans just want to feel like they’re safe and cared for. Trump obviously makes people feel that way, and while I don’t understand why, I do understand how the left makes them feel unsafe and unwelcome.
Definitely look into [wing chun!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Chun) According to legend it was created by a woman, which is pretty cool. I’m a small person as well and I don’t like violence, so the approach of training primarily to disable/escape from attackers appealed to me:)
I wish more people understood this.
I really hope you’re right, my friend.
Conservatives say it’s all Soros, Liberals say it’s all Koch Bros and/or Putin. I think the truth is probably all of the above and much more. We’re merely puppets on the string of the super wealthy, being manipulated into turning on each other so we don’t look up and realize we’re all being swindled by the same forces. Anybody who thinks the billionaires on “their side” are actually on their side are painfully naive. It’s an illusion. If we united as a people we’d be too powerful for their absolute greed to continue going unchecked as it has been for decades. And that’s their worst nightmare.
I really, truly think that this Civil War narrative is being pushed into the conversations of both sides by an outside source. There’s major world powers that would have a lot to gain by Americans being so divided against each other. I have dear loved ones on both sides and nobody I know IRL wants bloodshed. Online though I see it brought up more and more by both sides equally, and both sides seem convinced that they have no choice because the other side is already planning on it. I dunno, maybe I’m paranoid but it all just feels very ... orchestrated.
For sure! Then again it could just as well be about anger you’re actually feeling towards him, but it’s just being illustrated in a satirical and over-the-top kinda way:) Dreamland is a very symbolic and metaphorical place, and the details matter. For example the computer keyboard, the sloppy food.. they both mean something specific about something in your life that is or has made you feel pretty strongly. The computer keyboard might mean that this is a dream about anger you’re feeling specifically in regards your communications with the outside world? Or perhaps while working from home? The sloppy food might mean you’re feeling disgust, too. I’m just spitballing but you get the idea:) 

Hope it’s ok that I said all that! I just get excited about dreams lol
Love your style!
I help people interpret their dreams as a hobby and I might be able to shed a little light.. quite often the people we see in our dreams aren’t playing the part of themselves. They often represent a different side of yourself that you identify in them. For example, I have a very spiritual side but I also have a very logical, reasoning side. I have a friend (Darion) who is pretty dismissive of anything spiritual, metaphysical, etc. When I’ve had moments of feeling conflicted about these two sides of myself, they’re often followed by dreams of me and Darion being on bad terms, even though we’re getting along fine. So I see it as Darion representing my logical side, and my subconscious mind trying to tell a story that calls attention to this disconnected “person” within me. 

Just something to consider in case it’s helpful:)
I have the same placement:) I think it is playing out for me like this.. the Scorpio south node means that my past lives, and my past in this life, tends to be filled with drama, power struggles, abuse of some kind, and money problems. I feel my mission is to find peace, stability and prosperity in this life and basically stop expecting/co-creating chaos. I think this tumultuous time period we’re in with the virus and worldwide political issues is such a good opportunity to be a port in the storm, so to speak. The inspiring thing about this placement is that if you believe in past lives, you can bet that you have already been through just about everything a person can go through, and you’re still here. You’re stronger for it, and you can handle anything. Its okay to just relax and enjoy life, and lean into those lovely Taurean traits like gardening, enjoying good food, and indulging all your senses.
Absolutely. My BFF/ex-husband and I have had a lot of lives together, I think. It sounds so cheesy but the first night we spent together we didn’t even fool around, just stared into each other’s eyes and felt completely at home. I didn’t even believe in past lives at the time yet I felt like I’d finally found him. Now 15 years later he’s still the only person I can just look into their eyes forever and never feel uncomfortable. We’re divorced but we are still as close as ever. We’ve both done past life regressions and seen lives we’ve had together, usually as a couple or just dear friends.

I have another friend that I feel, for some reason, was my son in a past life. I’ve also had the experience of simply locking eyes with a stranger and thinking “I know them” like an instant love and familiarity, and it always makes me wonder if it’s a loved one from another lifetime.
You need to be able to heal and process and release trauma before those experiences become helpful, IMO. I’ve dealt with everything from sexual abuse to homelessness and for a long time it did weaken me. But years (and a lot of psychedelics, therapy, yoga, etc) later I feel pretty damn powerful. I think that “what doesn’t kill you ..” saying does a disservice in the same way that calling cancer patients “fighters” does. It gives the impression that if you don’t possess a superhuman ability to immediately bounce back to better than before you’re somehow deficient. The focus should be on healing and transmuting and being supported *until* you start to feel stronger. 

I’m here for you if you ever want to chat ❤️
My Cap moon is in the 4th house and cleaning my home makes 95% of my bad feelings feel better. For a little while.
I have a Pisces sun, but a Cap moon and 4 Aries placements. I still come across as gentle to most people. At first;)
There’s a lot of interpretations but generally I just take it as a sign I’m on the right path:) I would look into numerology if you’re interested in learning more about the particular energy numbers carry. You can even generate a free reading online based on your name and birthdate.
It really does, thank you! She’s amazing and I love the way her clever little mind works, and I just want to support her the best I can 💕
That sounds just like my 6 year old Gemini sun/moon daughter:) Any parenting advice for me? Especially when it comes to the tantrums?
To be fair.. A lot of things have happened this year that we wouldn’t have thought would happen in a million years. It’s kind of the theme.
That’s what I hope for at this point.
Those are great placements IMO.. having your moon and ascendant in the same sign helps because people’s first impression of you is better aligned with your inner self. Descendant signs can often represent your shadow side, parts of yourself that are underdeveloped. But having it the same sign as your sun means those traits are much more inherent in you.
Amazing, I have the same placement of Chiron and related to all of this. I started unintentionally having spiritual/metaphysical experiences at a very young age that didn’t jive with the religion of my family and community. It was difficult enough just to process those experiences alone, and trying to explain them was impossible (and socially risky) so I kept quiet. I’m still figuring out how to share my thoughts and feelings about things without sounding crazy lol.
I feel the same way about my Pisces sun/Cap moon! Thankful to have both bc I can see myself being extremely lazy or a workaholic with just one or the other lol.
If the relationship is no longer healthy and the parents can’t get along, they already have an unstable family unit. Plenty of people grow up to wish their parents had just divorced rather than stay together, arguing and being passive aggressive all the time.
The 29th degree sun year is said to be a time of preparation for the changes to come when your progressed sun changes signs. Mine changes from Aries to Taurus next year and I am kind of feeling that energy. Like I’m getting ready for something.
If he knew anything about true astrology he’d know that summing someone up based on their sun sign is ridiculous. Unfortunately there will always be people who have a prejudice against certain signs, but that’s life. You Geminis are awesome:) And he sounds like a terrible friend lol.
I feel like it’s safe to say they hardly ever use it that way. This is their time to plot and scheme amongst themselves, safe from the people’s expectations and opinions getting in the way.
Really rough, but ultimately it was all necessary for me to transform into a much more authentic version of myself.
Yes I hear what you’re saying, and I co-sign your petition for everyone to stop with the gun waving!
Right.. I’m referring to OP’s comment about his real life interactions: “The ones that know we’re not racist were there last night and people with open minds were willing to hear us out and have conversations with us”

And saying that I don’t think it’s fair to dismiss what he’s saying about his real life experience and intentions just because it sounds like something trolls say.
It’s crazy and honestly it scares me. I’m reminded of that Noam Chomsky quote all the time lately.. 


“The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.”
I’m sorry but that’s a stretch. Billions of people converse every day lol.. you can’t attribute everything that is said and done in the real world to divisive online lingo. Personally I prefer to engage in good faith and if it doesn’t work out, I move on.
Why? Are we really at the point where wanting to have a conversation is suspicious? If so then we’re completely screwed because exchanging ideas and perspectives is crucial for peace.
Woah that’s crazy! My first name in this life is similar to a name I’ve had before, but dying in an alley and being reborn as “Ali” is wild. I hope remembering how tough you had it before has helped you release any guilt about having it good in this life:) You deserve all the best, Ali!!
Yes I’ve done it many times.. probably at least a dozen times lol but it’s only worked twice. In total I’ve seen 4 of my past lives. One through regular meditation, one through a guided meditation like this, one was in a dream I had after a psychedelic trip, and the most vivid and recent one I’ve been remembering since I was a little girl.
That’s funny, I almost asked you if you have any fears related to big cities or alleyways! Honestly it’s really great to hear that you’ve had a good life this time. Your story was very sad and it sounds like you/she more than deserved a break this go ‘round!
Do you have any experiences or feelings in this life that might be influenced by hers? I’m always interested in the parallels, like I’ve had a lifelong determination to only have sex with people who truly appreciate me as a person. And then in one of my past life regressions I saw myself as a woman who had really low self-esteem and let herself be used by a bazillion different guys bc she thought being sexy was her only valuable quality:(
Magician 🎩 and I relate to the description. Very cool thanks for sharing!
That’s really heartbreaking, I’m sorry <3
Well I’m 35 years old and I’m embodying my Libra rising more than ever so don’t hold your breath;)
Wow this is my boyfriend’s placement. If you don’t mind me asking were you bullied (or just generally made to feel small) by a parent?
Weird, I didn’t sleep at all last night and my 3yo was awake until like 3am. My 6yo woke up about 4am and never went back to sleep.
No problem! I’m still fairly new myself. Browsing this sub, plus reading birth and synastry charts of people I know then looking up the placements and aspects that interest me have been my best learning tools.
It’s giving you the option of which astrological method you’d like to use. Placidius and Whole Sign are probably the most commonly used ones around here. Personally I prefer Whole Sign. You can search those terms in this sub for a lot more info.
Did you guys get more than a one time relief payment of $1200, months ago?
Damn. I’m so sorry you’re going through all this 💕
Another fireball checking in:) I have Mars, Mercury and Venus in Aries, also Lilith. Do you mean that Mars is in your third house in your natal chart, or transit? Natal placements tell you how those energies will most clearly manifest in your life as a whole. Transit charts (ie where Mars is in your chart right now) will tell you how you’re currently being affected.
Is it in your 6th house in your birth chart? Or do you mean that’s your current Mars transit? My natal Mars is Aries in the 7th house, but right now it’s transiting my 6th house. I am feeling super motivated in my health and wellness routines, and getting a lot of things done that I’ve been putting off.
Well that’s awesome, you’ve already laid out a foundation for some really helpful stuff:) Definitely give MDMA a go if you can get your hands on some quality stuff. If you need someone available to talk to during your trip I’d be really happy to help, DM me!
I think you already know this, but start by putting dating wayyy on the back burner until you’re in a better relationship with yourself. This woman was able to use you because you don’t yet fully believe you deserve to be treated as an equal. As for what to do, expect some trial and error and be open to trying a lot of different things. I *highly* recommend beginning a meditation practice because over time you will learn to detach yourself from your thoughts rather than letting them run the show. And negative self-image is the product of negative thoughts about yourself run wild. It sounds like you have a lot of emotional trauma with regards to women and being in society in general so therapy can help you work through a lot of things. Using psychedelics like MDMA with the intention of revisiting/healing negative experiences has been life-changing for me, but of course you should do your research and proceed with caution etc etc. Also work on building healthy platonic relationships. It’s much easier to get sucked into an unhealthy romantic relationship when you don’t have a solid friend or two you can lean on for support and honest feedback. 

I’m sorry this happened to you, and I hope you keep working on yourself and your mindset because there really are great people out there who will treat you as well as you treat them:)
I worked in the (tiny) backstage of a 105 year theatre before I got laid off due to not being able to have shows anymore. I don’t know for sure because testing wasn’t really available in my area at the time but I think I had the virus already. Working with internationally traveling performers and crew every day in tight quarters is challenging even without this particular virus, idk if I can do that lifestyle again.
It kinda blew my mind how people were celebrating it, like I can understand being happy to see liberal media go down if you aren’t at all liberal but.. how could it not even cross their minds it what an awful precedent it was setting?
Yeah, Hulk Hogan vs Gawker and I’m still sad about it. Gawker could be hella trashy but they had some really great journalists too and were one of the very few mainstream media companies left that were not owned by a billionaire.
My dad is a retired doctor and has been in a remarkable number of situations where he has been able to help people off the clock, via witnessing car accidents, people having heart attacks on planes and at a gas station. I don’t know what it is either but I like to think the universe has a way of putting brave and helpful people like you guys where they’re needed sometimes.
What is the factor?
Not his literal house though, he said “my fathers house” meaning the temple. People had basically turned the temple into a money-making scheme and Jesus was extremely not okay with that. Thus the table flipping and such.
Because Paul the Opportunist came along and claimed to be miraculously converted from the guy who loved dragging Jesus’s followers to be stoned to the guy who was given special permission to tell everyone what Jesus *really* meant to say. He proceeded to write tons and tons of letters that he claimed were the word of God to the point that more than half of the New Testament is just Paul blabbering on urging people to be judgmental, saying stuff completely opposite of what Jesus taught. And modern Christianity is entirely based on Paul’s teaching, not Jesus.

Gosh I have a bunch of these and I do think some might be actual alternate timelines playing out, like my dream self pops over to experience it for a little while. There’s a huge, open-air church that looks like a remodeled/expanded version of the church I grew up in. I am no longer religious and I don’t go to church, but in these dreams it seems I’m still trying to play along and it’s very lonely, disempowered feeling. 

But the most frequent ones happened around 2012/2013 and they were scary. The world was a dangerous, lawless place and my ex husband (we were still married at the time though) and I had to be extremely careful about leaving our apartment bc there were so many violent people everywhere. But every time i was there, I knew that apartment complex, parking lot, etc like the back of my hand even though it doesn’t exist in my life here. 

 I really like to help people interpret their dreams because I have a gift for reading the metaphorical language of dreams, but these types of dreams are just *so different* in the way they feel and the content is so un-dreamlike... That when I have them I don’t even try to interpret them anymore. I just assume I went timeline hopping again lol.
I read somewhere that the Draconic NN is set to Aries because of the idea that ultimately we’re all on a solo soul mission of some kind, and Aries represents that energy. Personally I resonate with my Draconic chart, in some ways more so than my birth chart, but I’m not educated enough on it to speak to its validity.
You don’t have to do anything really except be mindful of your thoughts and feelings. If you feel anger, frustration, anxiety, whatever lean into it enough to see what’s really under there. We all have shadows and trauma and stuff weighing us down. But remember that this is the energy of rebirth, too. Releasing the old makes room for the new. I like to do some symbolic things too, like during the day I will clean my house really well, get rid of some clutter, and at night I’ll take a long bath or shower. Idk .. just something about getting my environment and myself super clean while thinking about releasing and cleansing stuff that my old self went through really feels good. 

You can google rituals and stuff but I suggest trying different things and seeing what feels good and helpful to you, just remember to keep directing your mind
I’m a Pisces, so I can’t do anything about it myself.

lol my Capricorn moon strongly disagrees.
Ooo I’d be interested in reading this if you have a link:)
I’m a Capricorn moon, my mom is a Virgo moon and she had me when she was 25yo. She is a Cancer Sun and I think that’s a combo that led to difficulty expressing her emotions in a healthy way but she’s improved a lot. I had my first born (Gemini moon) when I was 29 and my second child (Leo moon) 2.5 years later.
I think so, I feel like I relate to my Draconic chart more now than I would have if I’d seen it at a younger age. But I think a lot of it depends on the soul’s evolution and intention for this incarnation. Maybe we take on the natal chart characteristics we’ll need for this leg of the journey, and for some people more than others that may mean a drastic change in how they operate compared to their draconian chart. For example my ex’s Draconic chart has a ton of Capricorn and Virgo placements, which is baffling because he hardly has a drop of those energies in his birth chart or personality lol. But his north node is in Gemini so it kind of makes sense, like if he came into this life with a Cap/Virgo heavy chart it’d be that much harder for him to embrace the free, curious, excitable Gemini qualities he’s meant to embrace this go-round.
Is it really that bad? I have toe thumbs and I try to tell myself it’s okay but I don’t feel like it’s okay.
Pisces being lazy. My Capricorn moon almost completely cancels out my ability to be lazy, unless my chores are done and I’m at somebody else’s house where I’m not distracted by other things I could be getting done.
When I was really little I was so gentle and looooved helping people to the point where my older brothers friends would take advantage of my kindness, asking me to go get them water or whatever, stuff they could have easily done for themselves, and I’d do it. One of my earliest memories of getting really pissed off is from when I was in first grade and my brothers friend told me to go get him something and I realized I was getting walked on and said NO! After that I was a lot less helpful for a few years lol, and I’ve been quite wary of being taken advantage of ever since. It’s funny looking back because that’s the year I turned into a little Aries. I’m moving into Taurus next year:)
I was just thinking about this last night! My boyfriend has some troublesome aspects like Pluto square Venus and I have a lot of 7th house Aries placements, from what he’s told me about his younger self I don’t think we would have gotten along very well at all if we were the same age and we’d dated in our twenties. He’s fifteen years older than me though so he has been working through a lot of relationship stuff since before I was even dating age. He’s also a Leo but by progressions he’s a Virgo which I love.
I have Venus, Mars, Lilith and Mercury all in Aries in the 7th house and I endorse this comment!
Libra rising 25 degrees:)
I have Mars in Aries. Best was with fellow fire Mars people. 🧨
I’m a cap moon and I have learned to embrace my rather mechanical, structured approach to processing emotions. I think it can actually be very helpful for working out problems with others or for helping people sort out their own feelings, because the analytical skills I have for it help me break issues down to the root cause, see how different feelings are interconnected, etc.
Part of Fortune is where you can find success. So if it’s in Capricorn in the 7th house, maybe you find success by working hard alongside your significant other or a business partner. 

Chiron is where you’re wounded but can ultimately help others heal. For example mine is in Gemini in the 9th house and boy oh boy does that resonate, I was raised with a very strong religious doctrine (9th house stuff) but from a young age was having my own spiritual experiences that didn’t jive with what I was being taught. So talking about my own beliefs, sharing what I learned on my own (Gemini stuff) was a liability that would have led to being told that I was wrong, a sinner, etc. which honestly still hurts all these years later. I think part of my purpose is to be brave enough to share, and in doing so help others feel free of religious constraints. 

Lilith is a little more varied in interpretation. Some people say it’s the part of you that society rejects, or a part of your life where you embrace darkness. I would look at different articles about your specific placement of Lilith and see what feels applicable.
How did you determine which fated events were indicated by them? By looking at transits or was it the symbology of the placements making it clear?
Internet word for “Small”
You’d rather die than live without compliments.
That’s crazy! I have both the sun and Saturn trine my MC. What about you? And yes I’m definitely used to making changes in my life. Some of the things I’ve been through just in the past year I never anticipated happening to me, like a divorce. Sometimes I think that might be part of my growth process.. learning how to be stable and consistent and enjoy life despite (seemingly) never being able to be sure what’ll happen next.
Yay! How do you feel about your sun/moon combo? I like it because I think the Cap moon helps me stay grounded in reality and keeps the stereotypical Pisces laziness under control. But sometimes it feels like my feelings are overly filtered out because I wanna analyze them to death before I share them.
Well I definitely relate to my Scorpio south node. I’m oddly comfortable with crisis, darkness, and the idea of just “burning it all down.” About 7 years ago I gave away almost everything I owned and drove out to the desert with no plan except to start over. This was before I discovered astrology, ha ha and it was right before my Saturn return. But I can see how it reflected both nodes, kind of a south node reaction with north node intentions. My MC is in Cancer, so that combined with my NN sign/house.. I’m wondering if my calling is (at least in part) to be a source of comfort and stability in other people’s time of crisis.

What about you?
I have NN in Taurus in the 8th house, which honestly feels kind of contradictory. I can imagine that I’m meant to focus on Taurean qualities like stability, comfort, follow-through, and generally just enjoying life. But the 8th house would seem to be the opposite of a lot of that.
I’m a Pisces sun, Capricorn moon and Libra rising. We should be friends:)
Did you also feel a Libra rising-esque fear of displeasing other people by admitting that you’re told that you’re pretty? Because I did and still do!
Libra rising and I think I am pretty in a very conventional sort of way. None of my facial features stand out as exceptionally good or bad, I just have good symmetry I guess. I’m clumsy but that always surprises people once they notice because I’m told I *seem* like I’d be very graceful lol. I’m 5’4” and weigh about 115lbs, so fairly petite. I think most of this is aligned with the standard Libra rising description, except for my height as I’ve read they tend to be taller than average.
Okay, I’m not arguing with your data as I’ve yet to see it myself. I’m just saying that your phrasing gives the impression that being gay is unfortunate and even if you don’t care about hurting people’s feelings, I think you’ll get a more productive discussion out of this post if you share what you’ve been researching in a more neutral, less negative light.
Saturn just entered my 5th house like 2 weeks ago so my experience is very limited BUT I feel the sudden urge to buckle down and complete a short film I started/abandoned two years ago. Whereas new creative ideas aren’t really coming to me. I’ve also been doing a lot of reflecting about what I really *need* in a romantic relationship, and what I’m really willing to contribute. Another thing, I think it’s interesting timing that I’m stuck with my children almost 24/7 right now because it’s made me more aware of what they individually need from me as their mom, and a lot of it seems to involve me being more structured, planning ahead better, etc.

Hopefully you get some more responses. I’m very interested in reading about this from people who have been through it.
Can you give some examples? Might want to change your wording too lol, I think I get what you mean but saying “risk of...” sounds like being gay is a disease or something
I assume she means Venus in Aries, maybe Venus in Scorpio too if going by traditional rulerships.
Depends on what you need us to be 😩
What’s your rising sign? I’m a Libra rising, Venus in Aries and my style is similar 👯‍♀️
What country do you live in?
Check out /r/precognition this is a lot more common than you might expect:)
Happy birthday!
Same here and I was terrified to grow up. I cried a LOT when I was getting ready to turn 13 because I felt like I was gonna be a teen and not a kid anymore. Now I’m 35 and I guess I’ve accepted it but if I could be someone’s kid forever I would lol.
Listen to “Take a Walk on the Wild Side” first then listen to “Can I Kick It” and you can’t possibly miss it.
And a tiger saw a man.
That’s funny, I had the same recurring dream as a newlywed! I think sometimes our brains just run through “alternate path” scenarios via dreams, and your emotions in the dream help you feel what making different choices might have felt like.
You can’t be serious lmao. These are babies. When I was this age I told my babysitter I was gonna cut off her head. I wasn’t a future murderer, just a little kid copying what I heard Disney villains say. If you wanna predict adult personalities based on tiny children’s behavior you’d have to come to the conclusion that they’re all gonna be psychopaths.
That’d be great, thank you!
Trying to avoid unnecessary trips the grocery store plus having way more time than usual to spend in my back yard definitely has me veggie gardening!
Wish they’d reverse it. Turning churches into homes, even temporarily, would do a lot more to help the sick and the poor .. you know, the people Jesus said to look after.
No I’m kind of the opposite of that, if they seem uninterested I lose interest too.
Capricorn moon in the 4th house. I’m cleaning and organizing the shit out of my home and putting together a homeschool plan for my kindergarten and preschool age children.
Hold On by Alabama Shakes
Mine also! Happy birthday, birthday twins 🎂

Edit: omg a slice of pi award! And our bdays are on pi day! This is the best ever thank you /u/poky23 I love you 💕🥧💕
The article is wrong, it was actually a single dad banana. He’s still married but separated while he and his wife try and work out their differences.
Congrats on your new baby boy! I’m sorry you won’t have visitors (extra sets of hands really help with those newborns!) but I hope you two enjoy lots of happy, healthy snuggle time 💕
I’m here if you wanna talk:)
I don’t know if you’ve ever been miserably sick with the flu before but posting on Reddit was probably the last thing on everyone’s mind. And regardless of whether or not the commenters here had COVID-19 (maybe we did, maybe we didn’t) it’s not at all surprising, statistically, that out of over a million subscribers, half a dozen or so people would have had their worst flu ever in the past few months. Statistically it probably happened to *way* more than half a dozen. Doesn’t make us liars, just unlucky.
Yeah. Just lifting a cup of water felt like a physical feat at the time.
I was too out of it to post anything, I honestly for the first time understood how otherwise healthy people could die from the flu.. but I think I wrote some texts about how at one point my fever reached 104 and I was sleeping so hard, I wouldn’t have even woken up to take medication if my ex hadn’t stayed over to keep watch on me and  our kids and checked my forehead in the middle of the night. 

Edit: oh and I have texts that I sent to my dad (a doctor) about how to watch for pneumonia bc my kiddos breathing was sounding wheezy.
Interesting. I definitely had the worst flu of my life in December and my children caught it, and both had some difficulty breathing for a few days. Maybe a dumb question but.. Would that give us immunity now if it was indeed the same thing?
Alright well I hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend lola
Asking about specific placements isn’t allowed here for some reason:( its okay on /r/astrologymemes and /r/AskAtrologers though if you wanna repost this!
I think you might find [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/btz4ns/most_cap_moons_and_some_sag_moons_yes_you_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and comments really helpful!
Ahhh, yeah that makes sense. I think Pisces can be a very childlike placement if it’s not balanced out with some strong earth or fire signs. I have a lot of Aries, which helps, and without it I’d probably be looking for guidance all the time in an effort to feel grounded.
That’s interesting. I have Mars and Venus in Aries both in the 7th house which makes me a little relationship-crazy lol. I’ve had to teach myself to be picky about who I date because if I’m not careful I’ll stick with people who aren’t actually good for me. He has a lot of first house placements which do make him a little self-focused but he’s definitely a relationship person (his Venus is in 7th as well) and it’s actually been good for me to be with someone who has his own stuff going on because my Pisces tendency to get lost in people is kind of kept at bay. I’m more able to remember/focus on my goals and personal activities as opposed to other relationships where I got so wrapped up in someone that I lost touch with myself. All that to say, Pisces relationships might work better for you if she’s able to accept your individuality and let it encourage her to focus on her own as well.
I’d say trust your gut feeling pretty much regardless of placements:)
I’m so sorry for your loss, you’re a good sibling 💕
You have a lot of signs, and often times the sun sign is less relevant to the personality than others. For example I’m a Pisces, but I have a shit ton of Aries in my chart and it shows lol. So a lot of the classic Pisces descriptions (lazy, reserved, a pushover) don’t describe me at all. Put your info in [a birth chart calculator](https://horoscopes.astro-seek.com/#birthchart) and you’ll get a lot more insight into yourself:)
Yes, I have a bowl shaped chart and it’s said that people with this shape often feel incomplete, as though the “missing” half of the chart is felt but not entirely accessible. I only started studying astrology last year, but looking back at the charts of people I’ve dated, I see now that I have definitely been drawn to guys with heavy Taurus, Gemini, Leo, and Virgo placements. Maybe in part because they’re bringing some of those energies to the table that I don’t have a lot of on my own.
Definitely. This has been going on for quite a few years. Think how many apps you have and how many of them could easily be listening with your permission per the terms and conditions.
I love the 8th house.. its nothing to be scared of, honestly. Yes it deals with death but also rebirth, transformation, contracts, secrets, sex, etc. If it makes you feel any better, my 50 year old boyfriend has some of these placements and he’s one of the most well-adjusted and lucky mfers I know lol. He does have quite a fascination with horror movies though:)
My Saturn return was god awful, although in hindsight of course I can see how myself and my life is much better because of those trials. I’m at the end of my Sade Sati and it’s been really rough and just as life-changing but not nearly as heartbreaking as the stuff I went through with Saturn return.
The flight attendant said “I want this lady off my flight” and then the woman started apologizing, saying she was really stressed out, etc.
No worries I was actually responding to /u/nettlepunk about his Capricorn date:)

But re: your post, I’m dating a Leo guy and I’d say your best bet is just hype him up with genuine compliments often and carry on like it never happened. Next time something embarrassing happens to you maybe tell him about it for laughs so he remembers embarrassing things happen to everyone!
I’m a Pisces and I listened to Under the Bridge obsessively in high school so I could feel ALL the feels!
I really want to know what happened now
I love this. Decoding my toddler’s mystery phrases is one of my favorite things about having a toddler lol. I felt like a genius when I finally figured out “boocoos” was Blue’s Clues, “Lykeen” was Lightening McQueen, etc.
He looks unwell but someone showed me[this clip of him dancing with little kids](https://youtu.be/FUHlDlL_LbY) and it’s pretty damn cute so I’m pulling for him
I can definitely understand taking issue with him as a psychiatrist proposing that conclusion but he is far from the only one. The CIA did some [fascinating research](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf) on the topic of consciousness, that particular link is a rather dense read but it’s really fun to ponder all the potential implications if you’re into that kinda thing.
First of all thanks for engaging in convo with me respectfully. Secondly I’m not looking to convince you or anyone to believe one way or the other:) I do want to say though that a lot of the children remembered random people who the parents couldn’t have known about, and in some cases they recalled correct details that were not publicly available information. Also, for his consciousness theories he rely on theories of quantum physics/ quantum mechanics theories which is not the same as pseudoscience.  But I acknowledge that the birthmarks could be coincidence, some kids remembered incorrect details, etc. 

Again, believe what feels right to you and be as skeptical as feels right to you! I’m open to the idea of reincarnation but mostly in the camp of “who the fuck can ever really know how this crazy universe works.”
That’s a depressing yet empowering thought lol. On the one hand I don’t wanna be a bug but on the other hand now I feel like a badass for making it to the mammal level at least once. Fuck yeah, I’m a mammal!!
Lotta possibilities, like maybe their past lives were on other planets. Or maybe not everyone is reincarnated. Or maybe our consciousness spends time elsewhere before returning to a physical body so there’s not “extra” people right now, just a lot more here at one time than usual.

Edit: could also be that we reincarnate as creatures sometimes. If so I would like to be a bear next time because annual hibernation sounds awesome
I think you’d enjoy reading [Dr Jim Tucker’s](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_B._Tucker)  research. He’s a actually continuing another U. of Virginia School of Medicine psychiatrist/researcher’s work (Dr Ian Stevenson) so their combined collection of data from children who have past life memories spans decades. Most children lose these memories by age 7 or so. They’ve matched soooo many children’s memories with real life people it’s nuts. Interestingly most often the remembered deaths are traumatic or sudden in nature so lil suicide baby in the meme fits right in lol
Just let him go. I definitely understand the need for closure but some people just aren’t willing to have the conversation and he’s pretty clearly unwilling. You deserve to be with someone who wants to be with you, so put your focus on that, and try not to take it personally. Lots of great people out there will want exactly what you have to offer:)
Dreams of having a baby are usually to do with “birthing” a project, or a part of yourself, something like that. Similarly, a miscarriage dream can be about something that you maybe planned on or started working on that ended for whatever reason. But you were happy about it, so if there’s something you started/ended around 2 months ago that you feel good about it ending, it’s likely symbolizing that rather than an actual miscarriage. 

Dream interpretation is tricky with strangers because you don’t have any idea what’s going on in the dreamer’s life and feelings that may be symbolized, but hopefully that helps you get started:)
Whenever you’re “listening” you’re really just quietly wondering how long until you can talk about yourself some more.
Aww yay! No problem, I’m so glad it was helpful! Best of luck to you and your boyfriend! 🥰💕
I see what you mean now, thank you for clarifying. And you’re right, I don’t disagree. I just wanted to point out that there are more legit options than say, Co-Star, for example. And for someone like me (and presumably OP) who still has a lot to learn it’s kind of nice to have something simple to start with.
Not all astrology apps are social media based, and some of them are remarkably in-depth. TimePassages has over 70 aspects just for my birth chart, with most of the descriptions being multiple paragraphs long. Including less known aspects like bi-quintile, and asteroids like Juno. Their synastry is just as in-depth, but you do have to pay for the individual additional charts.
You sound a lot like me and my boyfriend! I’m a Pisces sun, Cap moon and he’s a Leo, Sag moon. It’s been about a year for us as well and we are really compatible. If you can get the app TimePassages, and pay 99 cents for his chart, you’ll be able to use their “compare charts” feature which is awesome. The most thorough and accurate synastry reading I’ve found. It spelled out what makes us compatible really well, and even explains the challenges in a helpful, hopeful way.
Heyyy you have the same placements as my little 3 year old boy:) Got any parenting advice for me?
If you can find out his birthdate you can find out his moon sign, Venus, north node and more which will be far more helpful than going by the sun sign alone. I’m a Pisces with a Leo boyfriend and those two signs are supposedly incompatible, but it’s a really lovely relationship.
For lent I’m giving up a little bit of work to work on my life. 

Not a bad idea actually.
Nodal returns, squares and reverses never miss me lol. You can read the timing and descriptions [here.](https://www.tdjacobs.com/2018/07/22/nodal-returns-squares-and-reverse-returns/)
I grew up in America but this one makes me sad too, I feel like humans are meant to live in community and sharing, taking care of each other but instead we isolate ourselves and just schedule time to not be alone once in a while.
I’m a Pisces with a Leo boyfriend. Sometimes our love languages aren’t exactly aligned, like he loves spoiling me with gifts and taking me to nice restaurants and stuff, which is very appreciated, but I’d be just as happy smoking a bowl whilst wearing jammies and talking about our childhoods lol. I’m a very affirming person though which works well with his need for praise:) And I love his physically affectionate nature. Our senses of humor are pretty compatible, too. I think if I’d met him earlier in my life I wouldn’t have appreciated our differences nearly as much as I do now. It took a long time for me to realize that being super similar to my partner doesn’t actually work out too well for me.  

Edit: another interesting thing is that according to the synestry of some other placements we have.. we should be butting heads a lot and having to reign in our tempers. But I have never had such a peaceful, gentle relationship before, and when we do have issues we’re able to talk a them out in a really empathetic and loving way. Which again may come down to having met at the right time
What was your experience like with this combo? I’m a Pisces and my baby daddy is an Aries. We have a 5 year old Gemini and a 3 year old Scorpio.  I like to think our parenting styles provide a well-rounded balance but I don’t know.
Pluto and Saturn making squares, oppositions and sextiles to practically everything in my chart lol. Basically the last two years have been an unending journey watching of everything I used to think would never change.. changing. Including my marriage (got divorced this past summer). Doing my best to sit with the uncertainty of it all and trust that greater fulfillment and self-realization are on the other side.
Aww lol they were giggling so much as they signed it I wondered if they were writing crazy stuff but I guess they were just happy to be signing it:) Thank you!
Thank you!
This was sad but I enjoyed reading the details. Thank you for sharing. If you don’t mind sharing, how do you feel about relationships in your current life?
At a theater where artists are allowed to sign the walls backstage. A bunch of teenage performers [wrote this](https://imgur.com/a/dVGvPId)  and I’d love to know what it says 😊
Mr Rogers for Pisces. Sensitive, gentle guy who lived to make people feel loved and empathized with. He had a 29* Pisces sun, with moon, mercury, and Venus in Pisces too lol.
Wow, TIL! Never really looked into these before but I just looked it up, and  my life has definitely shifted dramatically right on schedule with these returns/reverse returns.
No idea, we lived there for 3 years and never heard anything like that before or after.
[birth chart and transit chart ](https://imgur.com/a/BOh71YE)

So very grateful for any input at all. I can offer Dream interpretation in return!
This happened to me and my ex one time, when we were the only ones in the house. Two really loud knocks on the bathroom door.
The only place I have Gemini is my Chiron but feel like I relate to Gemini the most of any sign.
Could be, my partner’s north node is my sun sign and we have the Rare and Exceptional pattern. It specifically says that being together supports the person *he’s* becoming.
I’m a Cap moon/Pisces sun and I feel things very strongly, but I won’t reveal my feelings until I’m ready, which isn’t often, and I can only talk about my feelings to like ... 3 people. And even then it’s usually after I’ve ruminated over it and tried to feel better on my own for a long time.
I set mine for desired  nap length + approx how long I think it will take me to fall asleep + 10 minutes (because it always takes me longer than I think it will).
I can relate as I have a Pisces sun/Cap moon. But I’m learning to appreciate the beauty of being able to deeply empathize with people without getting swept up in whatever is going on with them. And that I can have my head in the clouds and my feet on the ground at the same time:)
I would definitely pass on the message, even if anonymously like /u/subfootlover suggested. Who knows, maybe this message could spur an awakening in her that would lead her to change her ways.
In my experience, you’ll only remember the things you’re ready to see. I had a deeply uncomfortable feeling of dislike, almost hatred, for a (very) minor celebrity on a show I used to watch, even though I had no conscious or logical reason why. Years later I’d mostly forgotten about him, but then I started thinking about him again at random times and feeling so uncomfortable. I tried past life regressions many times before eventually seeing flashes of a life in which he was my horrifically abusive uncle. Now of course that was not a fun thing to relive, but it was actually really helpful for me in working through some issues I had around sex and relationships with men. But if I’d remembered all that earlier I don’t think I would have been ready. What’s interesting too is that I no longer feel that anger or dislike of him anymore at all .. I actually find it comforting that he’s evolved over his lifetimes and is now, as far as I can tell, a good guy. We’ve probably all been horrible people in the past, so whatever you learn from it, know that it doesn’t define you now:)
I’m so sorry this happened to your girlfriend. She’s really lucky to have you in her corner.
I think a lot of people are intimidated by those who march to the beat of their own drum because they’re unconsciously forced to confront their own conformity. Like, we’re all incredibly unique at heart but when fitting in is your priority you suppress your own unique qualities, and then resent the people who are able to let theirs show. I hope that makes sense, it’s something I’ve thought about a lot as I’ve dealt with it in my own way. 

Keep doing you, you sound awesome:)
Co-Star: powered by pretentious, delusional robots.
I got caught in that cycle for a while when I was young. I didn’t have enough self-respect to leave him but I had enough strength not to do what he said. Of course it’s shitty but some people just repeating what they see normalized and haven’t learned how much better and different a relationship can be.
 My brain went to the same place and I liked it.
I have Taurus in my 8th house, as well as Ceres in Taurus in the 8th.
What confuses me is that my north node is Taurus in the 8th house, and the descriptions of having a Taurus NN is basically the opposite of the 8th house NN description. Am I supposed to be embracing comfort and stability or learning to live without it?
I’m so sorry you lost your son ❤️❤️❤️
Reading/r/pastlives might make you feel better
My Venus is in Aries and I’ve never related to the “falls in and out of love quickly” thing. If I commit to someone it’s because I’m hoping it lasts forever. My Venus is retrograde though so that may have some impact.
Aww! Well needless to say I’m a big Sag moon fan 🥰And yeah the needing space thing took some getting used to because I felt rejected at first. But that didn’t stop me, because my Aries Venus/Mars loves the chase lol. Just curious but have you ever lived with a partner before and how do you handle your need for alone time ?
My two most significant relationships (including my ex who I was with for 12 years) have been with guys who had a Sag moon in the 1st house. From my perspective their common themes are loyalty and a deep, deep need for autonomy and freedom. Also both have a very fun-loving nature.
I love you! I can tell just by looking at you that you’re a kind person, and I bet you’re fun to hang out with, too. Keep being awesome, the world needs more people like you!
I'll believe you! You might enjoy checking out /r/precognition
That's so weird, but I've read similar stories before so you're not alone!
What time was it before you blinked vs after?
That's so beautiful!
No prob, I'm glad it was helpful! The collective unconscious fascinates me too! I started learning about it when I was studying dream interpretation and how our subconscious minds use similar themes (water = emotions, for example) in dreams to illustrate our deeper feelings. I think that, and probably many other influences (numerical, astrological, etc) probably play a big role in these types of person-to-person "coincidences" which aren't actually coincidental at all:)
Take your kiddos with you! I drove mine to randomly generated spot in the middle of a suburban neighborhood and there were like... 10 deer ambling around. It was wild and they loved it. Never know what you might see!
I don't have an explanation but I'd say definitely keep in touch with him. You can keep it light and casual and see where it goes.. Maybe you've found each other for a reason. If nothing else you know you've got a kindred spirit out there and that's always a blessing in itself:)
If it's a metaphorical dream.. He probably represents a part of yourself that you'd like to get reacquainted with, or there's something about him that you'd like to be more like. Think about his qualities and if there's anything about him you particularly admired. Could also be a glimpse into an alternate timeline:)
As a late-nights working mom of a 3 and 5 year old "quiet time" is vital to my sanity lol. Just having even fifteen minutes or so to myself really helps me regroup and keep going.
... What did she keep in there?
Kenan
Good morning you sexy beast.
Maybe but I'm glad you did! I think I the way I worded that question was a little more bleak than I intended, and I agree with you. I'm still healing but it's a process of getting happier and happier:)  And a lot of my healing has happened through metaphorical dreams like these, because they help me identify what I'm feeling on an unconscious level, which is why your question caught my eye. Thank you for the thoughtful response.
Do you also feel like you went through hard times that dramatically decreased your capacity for joy to this day? Because that's where I think my shitty Disney World dreams come from.
I have recurring locations, but what happens there varies. There's a ridiculously large, mostly empty church that I wander around in sometimes. A post-apocalyptic Disney World where everything is shitty and unsafe but it's the best we can do.
I only date people who are mature enough to value the content of someone's character over the color of their skin.
One of the past life memories I have is of being a woman who died in the 1960s, with no spiritual/religious beliefs at all. I floated above my hospital bed and just kind of hovered there for a long time before I realized that I wasn't obligated to stay in the room with my body lol. After that I zipped around the world and saw things I'd always wanted to see, like the Eiffel tower, before eventually making my way up to the clouds and beyond to start the between-lives process. Which is a long way of saying that I think some souls need time to process the experience of not having a body, or they simply aren't ready to cross over because of fear, or the feeling of unfinished business in this realm, and that's probably where a lot of "ghost" sightings come from.

Edit: I don't attribute *all* spiritual entities to this sort of thing, though. I think energy, good and bad, can manifest in this realm all kinds of ways. And there's probably an untold number of extra-dimensional beings passing through at any given time that we can't fully perceive on this planet.

P.s. I was raised Christian as well. Welcome to the wonderful world of following your own path, wherever it may take you:)
A shuttle cock for bad mitten sounds like the title of a whimsical porn written by a children’s book author.
My boyfriend has never said "I love you" to me, even though I've said it to him many times. He's incredibly kind and affectionate and generous and thoughtful which makes me * feel* loved. But not hearing it is really starting to hurt.
I wrote about mine [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/7kcsq5/i_feel_like_i_was_healed_of_some_inherited_trauma/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
I went to school with someone who is getting fairly well known as a comedian. A few people found her annoying but most people, including me, thought she was funny. I guess it's still a little surprising just because so few people actually make it in the entertainment industry and she did it.
I think the idea that anyone can be a "bad" dancer is silly.. Just move your body in whatever way feels good to you, whether alone or with people! Those who make fun probably just wish they were brave enough to dance:)
It's never too late to turn things around, Geraldo.
I said no one of either gender should be forced into killing /being killed.. Didn't expect  that to be an offensive statement.
How about the kind of equality where no one of either gender gets forced into killing/being killed on behalf of some rich dudes.
My moon is in Capricorn and I feel like I'm good at stepping up to the plate for other people. Not so much for myself lol. Definitely feel guilty about my irresponsibility on a daily basis, but guilt doesn't seem to motivate me so I'm trying to be more self-affirming.
Yes! Been getting a normal amount of sleep at night yet feeling desperate for naps and caffeine just to get through the day. Way more dreams than usual, too.
[This article](https://grahamhancock.com/tellingerm1/) is really fascinating to me, they talk extensively about the pole shift and estimate the number of smaller circular structures similar to this one to be in the millions. But for more in-depth reading you might find [this](https://books.google.com/books?id=OY3lDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT78&lpg=PT78&dq=great+Zimbabwe+ruins+devil+built+it&source=bl&ots=AC0ZnInfRu&sig=ACfU3U3IMie9yQOwQR9Ce3etT7vrzS48Zw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwib54Gur-bmAhUJXc0KHdTDD-I4ChDoATAGegQIBBAB#v=onepage&q&f=false) and [this.](https://books.google.com/books?id=48hvDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA174&lpg=PA174&dq=great+Zimbabwe+ruins+magnetic+pole+shift&source=bl&ots=uNZUFtdb2e&sig=ACfU3U2pJuGBgNvEgYws-MyUkokGi33lsQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjAhbfHr-bmAhXRWc0KHbk_ApUQ6AEwGHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false) interesting. English explorers who "discovered" the ruins in the late 1800s found it inhabited as is illustrated in the picture I linked above, and documented some of the things locals said about it.
I think it would be super awkward at first, and yes painful for a while. But personally I believe the vast majority of people are really good at heart, and so much of the pain we cause each other is really because we ourselves are confused, afraid and hurting. And that telepathy would ultimately bring us closer together in a new way because we'd be able to feel the pain that's causing people to act the way they do, and maybe even inherently understand the source of their pain. And the feeling of being understood and empathized with would change people's lives for the better. I think there'd still be factions, but it would be a much more massive, yet simpler two-sided one of good vs evil instead of the every-man-for-himself sort of world we live in now. But I'm just speculating, of course.
Thanks for reading:) I have had mixed results sharing this with people in real life so it's nice to be able to talk about it and not feel like I'm coming across as crazy, haha. It's weird. I feel a deep sense of tragedy and loss looking at pictures of the ruins. And if really it was an accident that shifted the poles and caused us to lose telepathy, that really would be a great tragedy. To be able to communicate and empathize seamlessly and effortlessly and then suddenly everything changes for everybody in an instant and nobody understands why. Misunderstandings, uncertainty about people's motivations, and so much more would be a problem for the first time, and our resulting sense of being alone in the world would be so painful to experience all at once. And if that is what happened, it makes sense that there would be factions and people would start splitting up into tribes and inventing their own way of communicating, like in the story of the Tower of Babel.

Edit: another interesting thing about these ruins is that they've discovered hundreds of much smaller versions of it covering a wide area around it, as though the people who built it were experimenting and working their way up to the big one. And it doesn't make sense as a fortress, or city walls, or a place for livestock, or really any of the things we associate with ancient human lifestyles.
I have past life memories, and by far the most vivid one is of being shown the footprint of a massive structure and understanding something similar to what you're saying. Except the languages came to exist because of a sudden loss of telepathic abilities. As a child I would see the shape of this structure's footprint everywhere.. In clouds, popcorn ceilings, the floral pattern of my bedding, and it drove me crazy because I couldn't put into words what it was and how I recognized it. Then a few years ago I ran across [this image of the footprint of the Great Zimbabwe Ruins ](https://images.app.goo.gl/9AsrW5cpC3D13do98) and it stopped me in my tracks because it's the exact same shape I've remembered my whole life. Then I started reading more about the legends surrounding it and it sounds an awful lot like the Tower of Babel. There's even theories about it being some sort of natural energy producing mechanism that was just too big and too powerful and the people who built it ended up accidentally shifting the magnetic poles, which could indeed affect the way our brain "computers" link up. Anyway I could go on and on but it's a fascinating rabbit hole to fall down, for sure.
Or.. Hear me out.. You love things about yourself that you've actually accomplished, things about yourself that make you a good person, or a unique individual, etc. and don't need to cling to where you happened to be born as a form of identity.

As you grow and evolve, you'll take on characteristics of the sign following your natal sun. For example, I'm a Pisces sun, and I still have many of those characteristics, but I've been a (progressed) Aries sun since childhood. And I relate to that because I had to learn to be more independent and assertive than the typical Pisces at a young age.
Who always has their DMs open if you need someone to talk to?
Not at all. Everyone needs to feel wanted and loved. I hope you find someone who appreciates you for you really soon :)
Speaking with kindness, hearing them out and acknowledging their feelings/perspective even if I disagree, and sharing my own feelings/perspective without insisting that my way of thinking about it is the only correct way. Basically I make every effort to have a polite discussion rather than an argument and by doing so I find that it's far more likely to go my way. And even if we stay on different pages, the relationship can usually carry on just fine.
I am!
Happy birthday!
Just call it a leg injury and reduce your recovery time by two weeks!
I love you
Aww thank you very much for saying that my man, I hope you have a great day too 😊
You're awesome, thank you for chatting with me about this. I agree with you that the media is pushing it pretty hard, and as someone who has  almost zero trust in the media I do have to question why. But at the end of the day I think it's a good thing for kids to feel free to explore the world around them without having to deal with all the cultural input they'll be dealing with the rest of their lives.. And if this kind of thing helps parents feel better about it/not read into it too much, I think that's great. 

Anyway thanks again, it says a lot about you that you'd earnestly consider the other side and be willing to change your way of looking at it. The world would be a much better place if more people were brave enough to do that. I have to work on it myself all the time.
I've read all your comments here and I'm not a fan of arguing. I'd like to understand your side. I don't get it yet but I'm trying. It seems you're okay with your son consciously choosing to dress as a "woman" once he's old enough to understand that what he's wearing will be perceived as feminine, and good for you.. I think that's great. What I don't understand is why you're not okay with a little dude playing dress up *before* he's old enough to have picked up on all the cultural/gendered associations. Isn't that inherently more pure in intention? It's like you want to teach him it's not okay but then be cool about it if he does it anyway, which (in my personal opinion) is kinda sad because then he'll only be able to express himself with the knowledge that he's going against what his parents have taught him is acceptable. 

I have a transgender friend who still gets emotional talking about the time as a child when they said they wanted to wear a waitress costume and their parents laughed at them and said no, that's for girls. It was the beginning of a 20 year long, shame-ridden hide out in the closet until they were finally able to even think about expressing their femininity again, and they still aren't close with their parents. Statistically the odds that one of my kids will be transgender, gay, etc is low but regardless, I'd so much rather be supportive of them wearing what they like than set up a precedent where they feel like they have to audit their choices based on my personal feelings. As long as they're safe and not hurting anybody I don't see any reason to get picky.
If a little boy wants to wear a dress it's got nothing to do with their sexuality and everything to do with wanting to look like a character they enjoy. My 3 year old boy likes to put my makeup on sometimes.. Bc mommy does it and it's colorful sparkly shit that can go on your face, all of which appeals to his toddler sensibilities. Assuming that makes him gay/trans/whatever would be idiotic.
I hear you on the first point but you can't just lock your door and keep sleeping when your kids wake up early. Unless they're old enough to be unsupervised, which takes years.

I walked through my apartment complex after a light rain and the sidewalk was covered in snails. Just... So many snails. It freaked me out but I kept on walking, until I crunched one. At which point I screamed and took off running, crunching snails and screaming all the way home.

Give yourself time to grieve, Ryan. We're here for you.
Well done, Linda and Michael! Amicably co-parenting with your ex can be challenging, but the rewards are so worth the effort.
Pattern
I am! My day job I work with artists but not doing art myself. But I've been painting for a few years and sell them sometimes. Ultimately I want to be a filmmaker too! I'm learning how to animate, and I'd like to make short films. What about you?
Oh thank you, that made me smile:) And you're welcome.. Please feel free to reach out any time you have a dream you'd like some help figuring out. Of course you're the best interpreter of your dreams because you're living the experiences that lead up to having them, but it always seems to help me having someone read/hear mine and tell me what sticks out to them. I used to have chronic nightmares as well, and learning how to understand what my brain was trying to sort out/tell me made a huge difference. I also usually Google the setting and such for common interpretations which helps. Like last night I had a dream that took place in a stadium, and I was on a computer trying to animate. I read that dreaming you're in a stadium can mean that you are trying to be more assertive and put yourself out there more, which sure enough is what I'm trying to do with my art, so it makes sense.
Interesting, I'm a Pisces sun, cap moon and an INFJ. Makes sense since INFJ are known for their empathetic yet emotionally reserved ways.
Oh yeah I know, but it still might be relevant since the description of the metaphor (strangulation = stifled emotions, aggression) kinda fits with your description of the dog having to be kept in the garden due to being aggressive with certain people. I'm sorry it made you feel horrible.. Bad dreams can be really upsetting. I would interpret that as your mind's way of telling you that whatever the dog represents, be it stifling your emotions or something else, it's a valuable part of yourself that you should protect. No part of ourselves are ever really "killed" forever, they just get pushed back or forgotten but they're still there and you can nurture them. 

It might be worth a try to ask yourself what the dog represents before going to bed tonight. I do that sometimes and will get a new dream that illustrates it differently.
Hmm that's interesting.. I googled the meaning of dreams about strangulation and this came up: 

*In dreams the feeling of being strangled suggests a deliberate act of suppression. Strangulation suggests a violent act of suppression. Emotionally, our more violent, aggressive side may not allow us to act appropriately in certain situations. ... To dream of strangling someone is an attempt to stifle our own emotions.*

Maybe something in your life has made you feel like you were too aggressive, or said too much, or like you had to stifle your emotional responses? That might explain why your brain chose that dog, specifically for this dream.
Possibly, but that someone could also be you. The subconscious usually creates a character for each part of yourself that it wants to illustrate, so sometimes you are all the elements of the dream. Do you remember any more details, like how the dog was killed? How would you describe your cousin's dog's personality IRL?
Animals often represent a vulnerable part of yourself. It might help to think about it metaphorically, and whether you might feel like you've lost a part of your personality
Mars in Aries here too and same.
I'm a Pisces woman with a Leo man. I like our differences for the most part. The biggest hurdle probably had to do with his Sag moon though. He doesn't like to talk about feelings until there's a problem and I could talk about feelings all day lol. But I've learned to appreciate his "love language" of making fun plans and helping me with stuff instead of expecting him to express it my way.
Happy birthday! 🎈
If you look in the "shared experiences" section of a particular pattern, some of the comments may tell you what it's based on. A lot of things seem to be based on the Rising sign/MC.
Is your Rahu different from the north node? My western north node is in Taurus but if I do a Vedic chart I get Aries Rahu.
Me:)
Here's what it's like for me personally: 

The cons: Too much of my self esteem is tied up in feeling accomplished. I have an emotion and then I immediately feel compelled to ignore it, categorize it, explain it away, or feel bad for feeling it in the first place lol. I rarely get comfortable just ... feeling. I spend a lot more energy thinking about what I "should" and "shouldn't" feel. 

The pros:  It overrides a lot of the less helpful Pisces sun traits like laziness, lack of boundless, and so on. Also makes me popular with employers as I have a very overpowering urge to work hard. Edit to add: I like to think that as I continue to learn how to accept and integrate what I'm feeling, it will be even more of an asset. I hope I can learn to use my Pisces empathy and my Libra social skills, combined with Cap moon stoic side to be a port in the storm for others.
Thanks so much, and btw if you're ever interested in reading professionally I'd love to be a client. Just read your Kim post and its fascinating!
Could you recommend a site for calculating midpoint in synastry charts?

Well you sound like a good parent to me, and I appreciate that we were able to chat about our different perspectives without it turning into a pointless fight:) All the best to you and your family 💕
Wanting to wear someone else's clothes sure sounds like creatively experimenting to me. Obviously we'll have to agree to disagree here and that's fine. But my belief is at least partially formed by experiences like when I sat across the table from a gay friend of mine last year and held his hand as he cried about the time when he was 4 years old and his conservative, manly man dad made him feel ashamed for wanting to buy a Barbie. He's 30 years old and that shit still hurts. Another friend who is trans has memories of being laughed at by his parents for wanting to wear a waitress costume. These parents didn't raise manlier boys by censoring their interests/experimentation.. They raised boys who grew up to feel like their true selves weren't good enough for their parents.

I'm not saying you'd do these things, just explaining why I don't want to be the person who makes my kids feel bad about experimenting and liking what they like. They'll get plenty of that from the rest of the world, and when that happens, I've got their back.
I get you, I was just responding to the other person's question of why not. And I get your reason for saying no in your case. But yes I'd let him wear his sister's clothes to school if that's what he wanted to do and she didn't mind. He's only 3 but he's worn her shirt with the hearts on it out and about before. Lil homie just really likes hearts! As long as they're safe and not hurting anybody I try and let them figure out what they like without putting my personal feelings and bias in the mix.
I have kids and I let my son wear his sister's pajamas lol. They're the same size and she doesn't mind. He likes them so yeah.. Why not?
I think it's all pretty much done by AI. Like they have certain plug-in phrases for planet/sign/house/aspects and the robots then string sentences together based on your transits. For example my moon is in Capricorn in the 4th house, and my Venus is in Aries in the 7th house, so when there's a transit happening with my moon and Venus it might say something like "Explore what happens when you allow your sturdy emotional connection with home and family to recharge your energy for significant relationships." Sometimes it's eerily helpful and accurate, sometimes it's just word salad:)
Kids will be petty no matter what you do, though. I'd rather teach my kids to express themselves in spite of the occasional negative feedback than teach them to try and fit in. My 3 year old son likes fire trucks and digging in the dirt and stuff but he also likes having his nails painted different colors. He studies his options carefully and usually picks specific colors for specific fingers. It's cute. But if later on he stops wanting to do it I'll be cool with it.. I think there's a balance between encouraging them to be themselves and forcing them to buck the trend all the time. I hope I get it right but I'm far from the perfect parent.
That's so awesome! You're definitely not alone:) I wasn't feeling well and didn't have the best experience last night in particular but generally I find the days before, during and after a new moon and full moon to be extra beneficial for that kind of inner healing.
Libra rising with a lot of Aries and Scorpio. I'm petite, like 5'3" and 110lbs. Dark, curly hair which I usually have as a pixie cut or a kind of mop top lol. Big brown eyes, small nose. Often told I look like a fairy.
Libra rising, and this moon is transiting my 8th house. Also my north node is Taurus in the 8th house. I'm thinking about my future a lot, what will truly make me feel happy and comfortable. I'm also feeling a strong urge to examine my inner self and what my actual wants/needs are vs what I feel like I *should* want/need. My moon is in Capricorn so I don't often get the urge to just let myself feel what I feel. Riding the wave while I can:)
Full moons are great for releasing. Think about yourself as a cup and the feeling of heaviness as a symptom of being too "full." What behaviors, fears, thought patterns, etc are you ready to release?

Edit: the moon is in Taurus, so you can work with the energy of this specific full moon by also thinking about your five senses and indulging in pleasure. Take a long bath, eat something yummy, listen to beautiful music, etc.
No worries at all, just wanted to offer:) I bet you'll find the perfect deck in no time! I don't use tarot myself but I've enjoyed getting readings so if you ever want to practice on someone lemme know!
Well they say your first deck should be given to you:) If you're comfortable sharing a mailing address with me, send me a PM. I'd love to gift you a deck from Amazon! If not, no worries.. I've seen them in stores that sell games, and any crystal or magick shop should have them.
That's so cool.. You gotta do it! Keep me posted if you have time:)
Second house is in Scorpio, with Saturn in Scorpio and Uranus in Sagittarius there as well. I don't know what I'm good at but it sure isn't making/keeping money. Interestingly my South Node is in Scorpio in the 2nd house (using whole sign) so it seems I should be able to overcome this? But idk.. I'm still pretty new to astrology.
It's cool you had this dream so close to today's date of 11/11:) I typically read dreams metaphorically but this one might be worth looking into literally.. Get yourself some tarot cards and learn how to read! Even if it's just for fun.
I'm so sorry for your loss. I hope things look up for you as the days go by. Be patient with yourself.. I'm sure you know this but the grieving process takes time.  I'm always here for you if you want to chat ❤️
I have the exact same placements and disposition!
That's sounds about right! The circumstances of my childhood made me feel like I had to be very stoic and cheerful, especially around my mom. She's in a much better place now and our relationship is good, so I forget how much that probably still affects me subconsciously.
I think of Cancer like a mama bear. Looks very cuddly and sweet, likes to hibernate, but holy shit don't mess with her or her loved ones. I'm mostly basing this on my own mama bear, who is a lovely, very badass Cancer, and my Cancer granddad who was the same way. I'm a Pisces sun with a lot of Scorpio and while I have some great qualities from those placements, sometimes I think they're less practical/helpful in the outside world than Cancer qualities.
Oh that's really interesting. My south node is in Scorpio and my life came crashing down at age 27 .. I went full Scorpio lol and basically expedited the burn-it-down process myself so I could move on to rebuilding. And I had a pretty major epiphany that could be called a spiritual awakening. It was a rough time in my life but I'm thankful for it now. Everything I lost was just stuff I'd built trying to please or impress other people.
Oh man I totally do that lol. For me it's usually because something I've been ignoring/suppressing with various distraction tactics has suddenly bubbled up to the surface and I can't get it out of my mind. And because I don't like to talk about my feelings until I've had time to process them alone, I end up sitting there unable to pretend nothing is wrong, and unable to talk about what *is* wrong. It's awkward.

Edit: you can help by not forcing them to talk about it, just let them know you're there if they want to talk :)
Capricorn moon. I was just reading about it this placement this morning actually, bc I'm 34 and I still don't understand my own emotions very well!
I'd say that it applies to my current career in a sense. My midheaven is in Cancer and I work with a lot of emotionally sensitive people. A nurturing personality isn't required for my job, but it sure helps. Ultimately I'd like to be an artist full-time, and I can see how my art might take on some Cancer-like qualities eventually. Right now it's very Scorpio though.
Wow that's awesome, I can't think of a more appropriate profession based on your sun/rising. Empathetic yet very comfortable with death!
Re: the bowl shape, I find it confusing because some of the information I read seemed to indicate that the best way to move forward in life would be to work counterclockwise, starting with the first empty area, which would be Taurus/8th house. Others seemed to be saying that sorting out the Saturn/Scorpio 2nd house stuff would be the biggest factor. 

Re: the Aries at 29 degrees in the 7th house, I feel confused about what it means.. I got married too young and I still struggle with the balance between being myself and going for what I want vs truly merging with another person. And my north node is in the 7th house so I feel like this is important to figure out. Edit: I forgot that I used Whole Sign for this chart, which puts my north node in the 8th house. 

And finally.. My progressed sun hits 29 degrees in Aries next March, which feels significant. [Here's a pic of my progressed chart for that date.](https://imgur.com/a/C4oOMFO) In case it's helpful.

Any help or insight, suggestions, etc with any of the above would be *hugely* appreciated 🤗
Go for it I like to learn 🤓
What charity?
Why should I move my backpack off the one empty seat left on the bus when you're capable of standing? Why should I not be a murderer? We all do *a lot* of things because it's the right thing to do. Why do you want the people who run companies to be an exception so bad?
I'm glad you mentioned infrastructure because it's a great example of what I'm saying. Pipelayers provide an incredibly valuable service and the work is difficult AF. Starting pay is about $24,000 a year. Does that seem fair to you?
Yeah it would be dumb because bench pressing cars has no value. Getting the food I ordered in mere minutes does. And just because people aren't properly compensated for doing difficult work doesn't mean they shouldn't be.
If you have a dog capable of standing up for hours at a time in a hot kitchen, keeping track of multiple orders at a time, busting ass to collect /bag each order in well under 5 minutes, interacting with customers (many of whom are unpleasant), working with computer systems/cash registers and making correct change you should get that dog a TV show. 

I'll never understand why people think working at McDonald's is easy. I get tired just watching them.
Because the white car ended up on top of the red truck that tried to pull it out of the water. I think.
I'm no expert but I think that's more of a synastry question. Specifically where you have placements in each other's 5th house, maybe 4th house too.
Go to astro seek or horoscope yourself websites and make a birth chart using that info:)
Lol my 5 year old has been a demanding lil punk all morning. I was just telling her that she should try being positive and encouraging more often if she wants people to care enough to cooperate with her. This video couldn't have come at a better time.
The night I met my boyfriend, he had an astounding number of conjunctions happening with his natal Venus. And his north node was parallel his sun sign, which is kinda cool because his north node *is* my sun sign.
Mars in Aries, 7th house
I think just about everybody does that in one way or another.
Driving in a dream usually symbolizes the way your life is going. So the fact that you're the one driving and nothing scary happens is a great sign, probably indicates that you feel in control of your life. People who are stressed about life circumstances often dream they're driving a car with no brakes, for example. It being your dad's car probably symbolizes having to do some things your dad's way, or with his permission, which makes sense given your age. Just my perspective.. Take it with a grain of salt:)
Oh that's interesting.. Sometimes I think I might be projecting and it's actually me that keeps us from talking about stuff lol. I feel self conscious because my circumstances at present are keeping us from being able to progress. At any rate it's nice to hear that Sag moons are capable of getting excited about commitment :) The stereotype is so bleak when it comes to Sags and commitment!
My boyfriend has the same placements and this describes him to a T! I'm curious though.. How do you feel about talking about the future with regards to relationships? He's a Sag moon/asc so maybe that plays into it but he'll talk my ear off about nearly everything * but * the relationship. Even though all the other things he says and does point to him being as committed if not more so than me.
Hahaha that's a perfect nickname! I'm a Pisces sun so we probably have a lot of the same tendencies! I have dreams where I'm leading a goth girl army whose weapon of choice is literal fireflies.. Flies that zoom into buildings and burst into flames. Then another part of me, dressed in white, swoops in and saves the people I like. So clearly there's a subconscious conflict within me between wanting to help everyone and wanting to watch it all burn to the ground lol
I'm a Libra rising with Pluto in Scorpio in the 1st house. I make a very cheerful, feminine first impression and then people seem surprised when I'm *very* comfortable with the dark/sexual/taboo sides of life. I also have very dark brown eyes.
It's 6 people standing with their arms in the air. Look at the black space between the women's legs as tall skinny women in a dress and the vulva is a neck/head. Once you see them you'll see two men in between them and men on the far left and right sides.
I have co-star and use it as a quick reference point sometimes, but astroseek is a lot more detailed, and will give you more information. Such as your North and South nodes which (imo) are some of the most helpful things to know about yourself! But I definitely recommend supplementing your knowledge by Googling stuff, no app or website really covers everything. Time Passages is another great app btw!
Google "Venus in Aries" and read some articles. Then Google "Venus in the 5th house" and read some more. The combination of what you read will give you a fuller picture.

Edit: astroseek gives birth charts that include interpretation of both house and sign, but it's usually a very brief description.
From what I can tell it can cause people to be extremely cautious about entering a relationship or even having sex. I was in my 20s before I had sex and in my 30s before I had sex with someone else. From what I understand, that's not uncommon with Venus retrograde people. I really like sex, I'd just rather be celibate than be intimate with someone I don't feel a strong connection with.

I completely agree with you, which is why I'm sharing scientific research with you instead of my hopes and dreams. I have no idea whether or not Pluto, or the apparent "retrograde"  of planets, etc affects us. Neither do you. But thanks to decades of research, we *can* say with mathematical certainty that the cycles of the moon, as well as some of the inner planets, do in fact affect us. I don't think you were expecting that, so you're pretending like I'm linking you to pictures of voodoo dolls burning in sage piles rather than engaging with what I've actually written. 

I also agree with you that clinging to beliefs is anti-science, which is why it's disappointing to see you clinging to your belief that planets have no effect on us, despite being shown hard data indicating that some of them do. I linked you to properly, scientifically conducted research on the topic of planetary effects on humans, hoping to have a cordial, science-based discussion.  It seems you're more interested in being insulting (i'm not insulted, but it feels like you want me to be), and arguing against a meme that I'm in no way trying to defend, so I don't really know how to engage with you now. Arguing on the internet just isn't my thing, but lemme know if you ever feel like discussing research and the implications of the results.

 Btw I checked out your music and you're very talented. I also work in film, and I used to live in Ocean Beach:)
If you believe in science, and I suspect that you do, then approach this scientifically and see if the evidence supports your hypothesis. You stated earlier that the planets, moon, etc do not affect personality, life experiences, etc. Conveniently, this is by definition a null hypothesis, which means that nearly all the research [found here](https://www.astrologer.com/studies) applies to your hypothesis. Statistically significant (meaning that, mathematically speaking, the correlations cannot be attributed to random chance)  evidence rejects this null hypothesis. Which, as scientific research usually does, brings up a whole slew of new questions! You've already listed some really great ones in the comment I'm replying to now. Which is why it's a bummer to see you close by re-stating your belief that it's all silly and nonsensical, rather than examining the evidence and seeking the answers to your own questions. Asking questions and examining the evidence is the best approach we humans have for learning about our universe. The idea that the earth revolves around the sun was once considered silly and nonsensical too, but naturally the scientists of the time kept asking questions and examining the evidence, and found it to be true.

And FWIW I do understand where you're coming from. I'm 34 years old and up until May of this year I believed that astrology was a bunch of make believe woowoo nonsense. (And to be fair, the so-called "astrology" seen in memes and pop culture very often *is* made up, written by people who aren't even using astrological methods to back their claims.) But when I ran across an article citing scientifically conducted studies showing that ancient astrological methods can be used to predict certain human behaviors and experiences to a statistically significant degree, I had to accept that I might be wrong. Of course you are fully entitled to your beliefs, and fully entitled to disregard any evidence contradictory to your beliefs, but there's a lot to be said for keeping an open, curious mind. Without open, curious minds there would be no scientists:)
Dreams are often metaphorical, but this one might be a little more straightforward. Perhaps you've been thinking (even just hypothetically) about having sex, and what the ramifications would be in a worst case scenario. Or maybe you're trying to separate your true feelings about sex from how your parents raised you to think about it. Just my perspective, may or may not be true for you! FWIW I grew up in the same kind of household, and it took me a while to let go of the guilt/shame/fears I had about sex. But ultimately these types of dreams are helpful and probably a good sign that you're letting go of some obstacles to being yourself:)
Well now you're just being obtuse lol, my second link has a long list of statistically significant data on the effects of not just the moon, but many of the other planets. Everything is cited and you can even read many of the studies yourself and see the data. If you just feel like arguing, knock yourself out. But calling research done by PhDs using blind studies and scientific methods of measurement "voodoo" makes no sense.
*In no way does it effect humans' emotions or personalities or life experiences.* 

There's an awful lot of statistically significant data suggesting otherwise. [Here's a very small collection of examples. ](https://www.near-death.com/paranormal/astrology/scientific-evidence-suggestive-of-astrology.html) And [more here.](https://www.astrologer.com/studies) But there's lots more out there if you're interested.
Thank you for saying that, I hope it helps someone. I'm very glad you're still here ❤️
This made me sad. I'm sorry your parents reacted like that when what you needed  was empathy and support.
I hope you feel better soon!
This is so cool, I can't wait to try it. Thank you for sharing!
It could be a reflection of how you feel you're currently progressing through life. For example, when people are feeling good where they're going in life they might dream of driving a nice car down a beautiful road. Or flying in an airplane. Lately I've been dreaming of being in a car that's out of control with no brakes, so you're not alone lol.
Can you think of anything in your life lately that you've "killed"? It could be a relationship, an idea you decided not to pursue, a part of yourself that you've suppressed, or even someone who's feelings you hurt. The fact that you did it without thinking, but felt bad afterwards is probably a helpful clue.
I'm so sorry to hear that. ❤️
Same here, and I don't relate to the typical Venus in Aries description very much. I'm extremely choosy about who I have sex with and rather than lose interest quickly (as Venus in Aries supposedly do) I'll stick around way longer than is healthy for me.

In answer to your question OP I think I interact fairly normally, but under the surface I'm a bundle of insecurities for the beginning of the relationship, and even once I'm settled in I have an underlying fear I'm not good enough. I've come a long way but I still need fairly regular reassurance from my partner.
That's actually an urban legend and not at all based in factual evidence. The universe and I have arrived at the conclusion that you're a six foot tall pile of awesome.
I would love that. Someone posted a dream here like a year ago where aliens invaded and created a test to determine whether she was a real human or an alien in disguise. It said "What did you do last summer? Yes or No?" And she was sweating it out trying to guess what the aliens thought a human would respond. That needs to be a meme I still laugh when I think about it.
I'm glad it was helpful! And congrats on making big strides forward:)
I'm a straight woman and I'm not even on Tinder but Samantha has the power to change all that.
Definitely start keeping a dream journal, it will help you start remembering them with way more clarity. Also check out /r/precognition you're not alone:)
The profile pic in my dream was a little different, her pose was less sassy and more "FML" with her shoulders slouching, arms down, and she was frowning.. but I could only find so many options for images of women in coveralls.
Isn't it crazy? I only discovered the nodes a few months ago and I was amazed, as my north node is precisely what I had realized that I needed to cultivate in myself earlier this year. I showed a friend of mine how to look up his and he had the same reaction. Best of luck to you, we got this!
Driving = your life path. The dream with your high school friends might have been about the path you were on back then. 

Bridge = connection between things. So it could be past/present and future, for example, where an unfinished bridge represents an uncertain future or unclear path to get what you want.

Bus/bus station = public aspect of your life journey, or the parts of your life that you have less control over. 

These are just some possible metaphors to consider. Dreams are usually little stories we tell ourselves to illustrate how we feel. So think about the feelings in the dreams and what they might represent for you personally. Like the fear of heights you have in the dreams might represent a fear you have about "falling" or losing control in some aspect of your real life right now.
Thank you so much!
Normally I default to the metaphorical method of dream interpretation, but this is one of those dreams that feels more spiritual/energy related to me. I do think it's relevant that you're doing EMDR therapy right now. If I had to guess, I'd say that you're probably ridding yourself of some yucky energy that accumulated in the time you lived in that house, and the therapy is bringing it to the surface to be dealt with. So while I'm sure it was awfully scary, it's probably a sign of progress. /r/energy_work Might be a good resource for releasing it, just remember that you're safe and in control:)
Would you mind recommending a website? I've tried astroseek and the TimePassages app but neither of them seem to include North node in their synastry interpretations. The person I'm seeing now, his north node is my sun sign which I'd think would be a good thing but I'm an astrology newb.
How can you tell that he's activating your north node?
Your sister and I have the same sun/moon placements:) I agree about the pushover stereotype. I think it's because Pisces are intuitive enough to recognize *why* someone is behaving badly and empathetic enough to give them a pass if they feel like it. Like if someone is going off on me about some trivial thing, I can see that they're actually stressed/angry about something that has nothing to do with me, and it makes me feel like figuring out what's actually bothering them more than getting defensive. So from an outside perspective it looks like I'm just incapable of standing up for myself, when actually it's a conscious choice to let them off the hook and see if I can help. My Mars is in Aries though so I'm fully equipped with a temper lol.. It just doesn't flare up easily.
*or to run away from people/relationships if you feel pressure to conform to circumstances or the partner. I love Aquarius so I think that's a nice placement, however.*

Oh snap that's definitely me. I can hang in there for a while (i just ended a 12 year marriage that I was mentally ready to leave 6 years ago) but I feel very claustrophobic when a partner expects to have a lot of sway in my decisions. I'm still trying to figure out what's fair in that regard. 

And I love Leos btw.. I have no Leo in my chart and I wish I did! There's just a cheerful magnetism in the Leos I know that draws me in like a moth to a flame lol. I'm currently seeing a Leo sun/Sag moon which seems to be working out well in that he needs his freedom and respects mine. The lack of communication is trying, though.
Secondary characters often represent parts of your psyche that aren't fully integrated. Sex, kissing, etc often represents the integration or "merging" of this part of yourself into the whole. So for example if you've been working on being more assertive, your subconscious might illustrate that with a dream like this. That's just one possibility to consider. You can try asking yourself what the man represents as you fall asleep, and it may be illustrated in a different way with a new dream.
My Jupiter is in Aquarius in the 4th house. Of all my placements I've probably looked into that one the least.. I'm still not sure how it manifests in my life. My Venus is in the 6th house and opposite the ascendant within 3.5 degrees, according to TimePassages. Would that be considered wiggle room? Mars opposite ascendant within 4.5 degrees. I don't relate to the Venus in Aries descriptions very much.. I never knew why but what you said about the double negative and directing the typically "outward" tendencies onto oneself is interesting and got me thinking! Mine is 22 degrees so (from what I understand) if I were to pick up on the tendencies of another Venus placement it'd be Taurus? But I relate more to the Venus in Pisces descriptions.
Hey cool I'm a Libra rising, too! I wish I could take credit for the chart analysis but it must have been someone with a similar user name.. I'm still kinda new to astrology! But I'm glad another "Your friend" or "Mary Grace" out there was helpful, ha:):)

My Lilith is also in Aries, as is my Mars, both in the 7th house and conjunct my Venus. It occurred to me recently that in all my major relationships there's been an ongoing power struggle, where my independence and need for autonomy is perceived as a threat to the relationship. I'm also very choosy about who I have sex with, to the point of long periods of celibacy, even though I have a really high sex drive. I don't even know why, but I just can't do causal sex. And I'm happy with how I look now, but it's been a loooong road to get here!
How do you feel like it affects you? I'm a retrograde Venus in Aries.
I've forgotten several, including the big one that seemed to cause some major glitches in the following days. I take it as a sign that my jump was so successful I've just forgotten the previous timeline :)
You can find out right now using [this free calculator.](https://www.findyourfate.com/astrology/northnode.html) Once you know what nodes you have, Google "North node in ___" and read a few different sites to get a good understanding. 

If you do locate your chart, it should also tell you what houses your nodes are in, which will give you even more insight into your soul's journey:)
I love all of this. She's very artistic but she has a short attention span so I think something that requires figuring it out as she goes would be perfect, and hold her attention better. Thanks so much for the suggestions:)
This is SO fascinating.. I absolutely give in to her wanting to quit things all the time, and I would say I've been doing less discipline than I'd planned. I'm a softie Pisces sun lol but I can see how it is more helpful to her in the long run to teach her perseverance and responsibility now. Thanks for taking the time to respond, it's really useful stuff!
Wow it's really good you brought this up because her dad and I are (very) recently divorced, so there's lots of changes happening, and my tendency is to keep her out of the loop unless it's a big, obvious thing that needs to be discussed. But she's so observant that I find her asking questions that she wouldn't be asking if she hadn't already picked up on a lot of what is going unsaid. Thank you.
If you're open to astrology, calculate your birth chart and see what your north node and south node is. They're commonly known as karmic parts of the chart, with the north node being the traits you should develop, and the south node being what you need to overcome. For example, my south node is in Scorpio which indicates my past lives have been dramatic, and probably full of control/abuse issues. This is reflected in my past life memories and has been true for my current life as well. And my north node is in Taurus, so I'm meant to learn how to be in control of myself alone and build a stable, enjoyable life for myself.
I suppose it comes down to a matter of belief, but personally I believe that our loved ones (animals included) can use the dream world as a vehicle to come check in on us and let us know they're still around. I had some very memorable dream moments of conversing with my granddad after he died, as did several other people in my family who were close to him. 

I'm sorry for your losses, and hope it helped to be able to see them again ❤️
This is so helpful and encouraging, thank you! It definitely sounds like her.. She loves to paint and seems to have a knack for learning languages. My challenge with her is that she is very interactive, she doesn't like to entertain herself and wants me to be engaged in everything she does, and she wants to do a LOT! So I'm always looking for ways to keep her busy so she doesn't feel ignored when mama needs a minute :)
I'm so sorry to hear that. ❤️
My 5 year old daughter is a Gemini sun and moon, Pisces rising. Would you guys mind sharing your parenting tips? What helped (or would have helped) little you thrive and feel supported growing up?
I'm a Pisces sun and a Capricorn moon. I consider it a blessing because the practical, down-to-earth Cap qualities help me regulate my spaced out Pisces tendencies:)
You're the best interpreter of your own dreams so the following is just my first impression. Take what's helpful and disregard the rest!

Seeing her in a gritty fast food restaurant = this was not a healthy or nurturing relationship

Resembling someone you dislike = seeing with new clarity the aspects of her that didn't jive with you

All black clothing = endings, closure

Holding a baby = new beginnings 

FWIW I find it's pretty normal and common to dream of an ex once you find a better partner. When you're still single and searching, it can be harder to process the emotional impact of a past relationship, and harder to see it clearly, too. You've found someone more compatible which makes it easier for your brain to sort out what was wrong before. Think of it like self-therapy. It's possible you woke up after "Did you ever love me?" Because that's not something you can really be certain of either way. 

Hope that helps, and best of luck with your new relationship :)
The hot and cold thing?
Ok, thank you for the straightforward feedback! I definitely don't want to change him, I guess I just wanted to understand if this is his true nature or if I'm just not someone he feels safe opening up to or what.
He's a Leo sun, not positive but I think he's an Aquarius rising. No Aries in his main planets, but a Neptune in Scorpio. Venus in Gemini. Yes to the temper tantrum /letting it go quickly, though the tantrums have (so far) been directed at people he feels are being tricky or unfair and not at me. He does get jealous/pissed at the thought of guys hitting on me, though.
I... I am so glad you told me this. That's the opposite of my natural reaction lol. Thank you! But what if he never brings up anything that's bothering him, like ever, until eventually he's so fed up about something that he wants to end things and it's something I could have made better if only I'd known?
Does anyone here have advice on getting a sag moon partner to open up about his feelings, or at least admit to having them?
That's amazing! If you haven't already looked at the research into past lives, I think you'll be surprised how much evidence there is to support it. Jim Tucker is a great place to start.

That being said, I find it's helpful to think about it from the perspective that regardless of whether or not the memories are "real", these images and storylines came from your own subconscious mind. So there's something in Oliver's experiences that you can learn from or relate to in this life. I did one of those regressions and had vivid recollections of being a really sad and sexually degraded woman named Marnie who married for money and then spent the rest of her life depressed and bored out of her mind. I've always had a strong desire to marry for love, respect/own my sexuality and make my own living, and maybe those hard lessons Marnie learned are part of the reason why. Or maybe it's just a story my brain told me to illustrate how I feel. Either way, it was helpful:)
Thanks for the update! How would this affect someone with their Venus in Gemini?
I don't know!  But I do think it gets easier with practice. For me the mental diet definitely seems to be helping. That being said, last night I found myself worrying again haha.. So I'm still learning!
I'm reading this 44 minutes after you posted it:)
I'm so sorry for the things you never got to experience with him. I bet he's so proud of you he can't stand it:)
First of all I'm really sorry you're feeling this way ❤️ 

I'd suggest you start by manifesting better self-esteem. Imagine that you're happier and more confident in yourself than you've ever been. Imagine that you're turning heads when you walk into the room, or getting compliments that make your day .. Whatever feels like a "wish fulfilled" of being a confident person to you. Just leave SP out of it as much as possible for now. And when you do think of him, try to simply intend that he's happy and fulfilled, too. I know it's not easy, and definitely give yourself a grace period of processing that anger, but it will help you in the long run to work towards genuinely wishing him well in life, with or without you. 

Once you've got that self-esteem up, then work on the SP. By then you may not even be interested in getting back together, but if you are, you'll be all set to have a healthier, happier relationship.
SAT = "State akin to sleep", but I'm not sure how it might be translated into the books you've read. It's the method of getting very relaxed, but still awake, and visualising the end result of what you intend to manifest. 

SP = Specific or Special person. It's not a Neville term as far as I know. It's used by people who have a particular person (usually someone they know, like a friend or an ex) they want to date.
Damn, that's exciting.. You're a badass and you got this!
There ya go, perfect step one for your new formula! I like being subscribed to  /r/hydrohomies because it's like a wholesome drinking game for me lol. If I'm scrolling Reddit and I see one of their posts I stop and drink some water. It also helps me to keep a reusable water bottle I can carry around with me. It's a little annoying to keep up with, but that's part of what makes it an effective tool for remembering to hydrate:) Once you get used to the (wonderful) feeling of being well hydrated for a few days in a row I bet it'll become a habit. The mental clarity alone makes it worthwhile, not to mention you'll start to look and feel more healthy!
Without any specifics it's hard to offer advice, but generally speaking I think starting with small changes in the way you're going about life can get the ball rolling. Go to bed thirty minutes earlier tonight, drink a little more water than usual tomorrow, say hi to that neighbor you usually don't speak to:)
Kind of depends on the context of the dream but it often represents some new or underdeveloped part of yourself. Could be an aspect of your personality that's ready to "grow", or even an idea you'd like to see brought to life. Feel free to message me if you'd like some help with anything specific from the dreams.
Usually overwhelming emotions. Maybe you've been through (or are in the midst of) an emotional experience. The good news is that you either made it through or you're well on your way to making it through :)
Oh man, that's a lot of stress to deal with and I think it's understandable that you'd feel totally overwhelmed by it. But it's also the kind of thing that, a few years from now, you could be telling a new partner or friend or colleague about and they'd say "What?!? YOU did that?!" And laugh their ass off because it is so out of character for the person they've come to know and love. One of my favorite people in my life is a guy who got DUIs and stole shit in his younger days, even spent some time in jail. And now he's so damn accomplished and successful and happy that I (a relatively successful woman with two kids) look up to him a lot. 

Point is, as bad as this may seem, it is really and truly okay and you can get through it and come out the other side with lessons learned and a hell of a story. Try and cut yourself some slack.. We're lucky to have you here and I really hope you stick around. ❤️
I often dream of my friends as a representation of some part of myself. And sex dreams can often be symbolic of merging/integrating/accepting two (or more) disconnected parts of yourself. It might be helpful to think of the first thing that comes to mind when you think of each friend. 

For example, let's say Kevin is really comfortable in social situations. A dream about having sex with him might be your subconscious mind's way of illustrating that there's a part of you that can also be comfortable around new people, and you can integrate it.
You would probably find /r/astralprojection very useful. You're already halfway there!
I think first and foremost you should follow what brings you joy. That being said, *Real* love, in my opinion, doesn't involve trickery and confusion and demands of loyalty. It's just freely given to you as you are. I'm wary of anyone or anything that expects you to jump through hoops to meet their needs/desires. It sounds like both these fellas have you in a rather vulnerable and confused place, even as they may *say* it's for your own good. You are all you need to be empowered and vibe high.
I don't know that there's anything we can be 100% certain about in this realm of existence.. That's part of the adventure:) But you might find it helpful, or at least entertaining, to do a past life regression meditation on YouTube. I saw myself in vivid detail as a humanoid cheetah looking being from another planet who decided to come here to spread love and light. The revelations about that life, and what I was like "before", continued to come to me through dreams and meditation for about a year afterwards. Regardless of whether or not it's "true", it all came from my subconscious mind and really helped me know myself better, as well as refocus my energy and refine my goals for this lifetime.
I haven't experienced flips with anything but Fruit Loops, and it seems to flip every few months for me!
This reads like a message from you to yourself that you can be more assertive. It's all started with you saying yes to a date, not because you're dying to go but because you don't want to be rude. And then you stay in a very uncomfortable situation because he told you to. You only get freedom in the end by doing what you want and need to do in spite of the guy's orders. It seems like a horror story about being passive, in other words. 

But that's just my interpretation, and I might just be seeing it that way because I tend to be way too passive and I'm working on being more true to myself:)
Gotcha, thank you for clarifying:) We're probably going to have to agree to disagree here but personally I believe holding fast to love and light is the only way to "fight" the dark. Responding with violence only begets more violence and round and round it goes. Nothing new about that. I also believe that respecting the free will of others is essential to being truly loving and as such we can't really "wake people up". We find our own way when we're ready.
Ok but what does "fight" mean to you? As in physical violence?
What do you mean by fight?
Is that across the street from the Thinkery?
Four years ago. At the time there were a lot of sightings reported around there, and IIRC there was a group of Austin people who would meditate together at night in Manor because it always seemed to "summon" UFO. But I should have said it *used to* be a hot spot, as I don't know how many have been spotted there as of the last couple years.
Manor seems to be a hot spot for UFO, I saw one there on my 30th birthday:)
Keep googling them, there's an article for just about every number you could possibly see. But know this: the idea of "good" and "bad" numbers is a human concept, angels will only send you love and encouragement. I get 43 pretty often and I like the last paragraph of [this interpretation](http://sacredscribesangelnumbers.blogspot.com/2011/07/angel-number-43.html?m=1) as it often crops up when I'm overwhelmed by the clutter in my home or workplace.

Edit: oops, just realized you said 42 not 43:) but hopefully something I said was helpful anyway!
Can confirm. Am the wife.
Interesting that they chose to live as the person they don't remember being. I would rather continue living the life I remembered, and as a family member I'd rather be around the person who thought/acted/remembered as the person I knew than be with a virtual stranger who only looked like my loved one.
Thank you!
Dreams of having a baby are often about birthing (or in this case losing) a part of yourself. I think it's interesting that the baby looked fake to you. My guess is that the baby represents some aspect of yourself that you lost in the process of dating/breaking up with him. The fact that you're not very sad about it and it didn't look real to you in the first place maybe suggests this part of yourself and wasn't a part of who you truly are. 

Just something to consider:) If it doesn't resonate, disregard!
Happy birthday!
This is a synchronicity for me.. I had a strong urge yesterday and this morning to lie in the grass and get some sunshine. I felt a little bad about it both times because my brain was so quick to remind me that there's chores to be done, gotta get ready for work, etc. But yesterday my 2 year old seemed to read my mind and ran into the back yard and stretched out in the grass, smiling. I followed suit and then did it again this morning. That little bit of spontaneous relaxation, just for the pleasure of it, seemed to set my whole body and soul on a better track!
Reading this at 11:11 😊
Oh my, never knew about this before but it's super intriguing.. Thanks!
I think so too, and I wonder if the magnetic pole shift believed to have happened many thousands of years ago may have messed up earth's frequencies, or messed up our ability to receive them. I've also wondered if this is where the Tower of Babel story comes from. People working together to build something suddenly lose their ability to communicate and have to invent languages amongst themselves.
You're welcome, so glad to hear it was helpful! I relate to that very much, especially the fear. There's always a dozen what-ifs that stop me from doing things that I know would serve me and others well. We can unlock those chains, I believe in us 😊
"Mindless" activities like riding the bus can put you in a hypnotic state much like meditation. So it could have been some subconscious imagery coming through, not unlike a dream. It might help to think about it metaphorically. Bikes are used to move us forward, is there a metaphorical bike you're leaving chained up when you could be well on your way to something/somewhere else? Could be a spiritual, emotional or even literal journey you're ready to go on. When I was ready to go back to work after having my baby but I was nervous and hesitating, I started dreaming of cars stuck in a garage.
Feel free to send me a message.
If you're open to the idea, check out the subs for past lives and reincarnation. 
You just made me lol for real 
Full of blood.
That only music allowed is a solo performance by Kenny G.
I thought he meant it like if you're afraid of death it would mean that you love life. But I may have misunderstood!
It might be helpful to do some imagination work with the end result in mind. Imagine your excitement in telling your mom how everything is going at work. Imagine how you feel a little nervous on your first day. Imagine a year from now, when you are welcoming a new employee and remembering back to when you were the new guy:) 
I had an interesting conversation with my husband the other day that, prior to learning about the ME, would have turned into an argument lol. We were discussing some decisions we made over the summer and the motivations behind them. Without going into boring detail, basically the way I remember his motivations are completely different from the motivations he remembers not only having, but discussing with me at length. Before, this would have angered me, and I would have thought he was delusional. But seeing how ME has effected us both differently, some of the differences being cultural stuff that has happened since we've been married, I feel like there's really no use trying to insist that I'm right about how I remember him feeling. We might just be coming from slightly different timelines! 
Ohhh I get it now, that makes so much sense! Thank you for clarifying, gonna try it tonight:)
Do you set an alarm for every 90 minutes?
If Nikola Tesla and Johnny Depp had a baby.
That's really sweet 😊 One of my co-workers was telling me recently that his wife watched the Andy Griffith Show every night at the same time. After she passed away, he was watching a game with his friend, neither of them touching the remote, and the channel flipped over to the Andy Griffith Show not once, but twice! They were really in love and when her cancer got really bad, she told him before she died that she would do her best to let him know she was saying hi from the other side. He had a lot of cool experiences like this. ❤️ 

ps so sorry for your loss, hope it's a comfort to know he's never really gone. 
It's usually a good thing, a sign that you're discovering new or long forgotten parts of yourself. The windows might represent that this part of yourself gives you a new outlook on life, or the world around you.

You look like little [Michael Yagoobian](https://goo.gl/images/QHq3G1) before he turns evil which makes me want to take you home with me and love you. If you're up for adoption please let me know before it's too late. 
Love your style!!
Probably so, the subconscious tends to tell stories to help us work through whatever we're consciously thinking about! You might really enjoy taking something like [Meyers Briggs](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test) to help you get to know yourself better. I was in the same boat, trying to figure out who I was without the outward influences, and it really helped me to take this and read about my type. If the first result you get doesn't feel like it describes you very well, [try this one!](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp) 

Hope that helps 💕
Re: your post title, you might find it interesting to check out the recent research coming out on the nature of our dreams. It would seem that they are often [meant to be helpful in processing our emotions and experiences.](https://walkerlab.berkeley.edu/reprints/Gujar-Walker_CC_2011.pdf) 

Anyway, I think the finale of the dream is quite interesting, because bathrooms are where we tend to our most private business, and in dreams they often represent the same thing. But you're in a public bathroom, which seems to be a hint that this is symbolizing a private element of your life that is difficult to keep under wraps. The costume, or rather pretending that you are wearing a costume, makes me wonder if there's some part of yourself, or your personal life that you try to "disown" in front of others.

But you are the best interpreter of your dreams, since you alone know what's on your mind and what's happening in your life. If any of this was helpful, awesome, but if not.. Please disregard! 💕
Asking for help is an act of STRENGTH, not weakness. There's nothing pathetic about it, and the sooner you can accept that, the faster you'll be able to make some strides. This has been the biggest lesson I've had to learn this year, and it's tough. It's sad because we come into the world as little babies who are completely dependant on others for survival, and we accept this about ourselves naturally. But over time we internalize messages about being independent, and forget that humanity wouldn't have survived, nor would it continue to survive, without relying on each other. It's natural and human to need help, and by asking, you're giving people like me a chance to experience the joy of lending a hand. 

Another thing I see in your post is the negative spin you're putting on your life story. I have "failed" at many things as well, but that's just one way to look at my life. I could just as easily frame my "failures" as many different things I've had the opportunity to learn. The story we tell about ourselves is very, very powerful, and sets the stage for our future. So look again at your life experiences, and think about how much you've grown, what you've learned, what lessons and experiences you've had that you can utilize in your new chapter. 

I also recommend taking a personality test that can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses. I really like [Meyers Briggs ](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test) which of course is not perfect, but has really helped me to understand myself and how I best fit into the world! 

Okay, I could go on and on but the most important thing I wanna say is that you are doing great!! Housing, debt, wealth, and all other forms of material "success" can never, ever tell us about who you truly are. You were worthy of love and acceptance the day you were born, and you didn't bring a dime with you 😉❤️ The same is true for you now, even if it doesn't feel like it. I love you and I'm proud of you. And  I'm here for you anytime! 
Dreams like this usually represent neglecting yourself in some way. Water often symbolizes emotions, so perhaps you have some emotional "cleaning out" to do. The big, dangerous fish could represent anger, sadness, or some other feelings that are affecting your well-being. 

Of course, this is just one possible interpretation. Thoughts?

I have similar dreams about trying to protect my daughter from critters and other dangers. I think it's just a symbol of the anxiety we feel, knowing that we can't protect our children from everything dangerous in the world:(
I just want to say how terribly sorry I am for your loss 💔❤️ I know that pain, my first pregnancy ended in miscarriage and it's a heartbreak I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Please give yourself time to grieve, and reach out to me and anyone else who is willing to listen. You are not alone, and you never have to be. I'm here for you anytime ❤️❤️
The grungy mirror likely represents not being able to "see yourself" clearly. Floods almost always symbolize an overwhelming level of emotion. This could be a current situation, or something from the past, but typically if it's set in the past there would be some indication of that in the dream, which there doesn't *seem* to be. The person trying to stop you from mopping up the water could be a lot of things, think about who or what in your life is an obstacle to sorting out your feelings. It could be a representation of some part of yourself that avoids working through difficult times. 

The finale is a bit difficult to guess.. Could indicate that the overwhelming emotions are work-related, but honestly I'm not sure. 

Does any of that help?
The [NASA solar page](https://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/realtime-images.html) is down, as are [a bunch of other observatories.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9f09og/comment/e5tmii0?st=JLYM359O&sh=7d2622cc)

I've been following this as well, and one of the main reasons people have been skeptical about it being related to the sun is that other solar observatories around the world are still up and running. Interestingly, that no longer appears to be the case: [list of solar observatories going offline](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9f09og/comment/e5tmii0?st=JLYJTEYQ&sh=bf315261) 

Very curious!
I take it as a sign I'm on the right track. I think we live in the midst of infinite timelines, and repeating signs that feel positive are basically a function of the more optimal timelines:)
Happy Cake Day, friend! Thanks for sharing this great picture of your handsome pops and uncle 😊
You are an amazing artist. This is beautiful!
The most effective tip I've found is setting the intention (as you've already done by jumping) and carrying on as if it's already done. Think about it like placing an online order. You trust that it will come to you, but you don't expect it to show up instantly, or order it again and again, you just place the order and know it will be delivered. 

It also greatly helps to put it out of your mind as much as possible, and when you do think of it, practice feeling grateful for the thing you've asked for. In other words, think "I'm so thankful that I get to have ____" rather than "Why haven't I gotten my ____ yet??" 
Ahh, fair enough! Well I wish you the best of luck and if I can help you with your experimentation lemme know ☺️
I think your belief in it working is pretty helpful, so going into it expecting it won't work may manifest exactly that - not working! I wouldn't advise you plan on trying again for the same thing. Rather, do your best to expect the jump you already did will work! That being said, I typically wait at least a week between jumps. 

More gradual methods can be found at /r/lawofattraction or /r/NevilleGoddard I've had success with both but mostly prefer these over the jumping methods. 
Loving and forgiving people brings you much greater joy and peace of mind than holding onto your frustrations and pain. Easier said than done, I know, but worth the effort every time.
Narwals are not a fictional creature.
I used to coordinate weddings. Brides and grooms were 10x easier to deal with than the parents of the couple tended to be. Moms of the bride and groom IME are very nervous about everything going well, and end up being a huge nuisance trying to control everything and worrying about stuff for no reason. 
That's cool! Who knows, you may find that you have more in common with your sister than you thought, and you could encourage each other/manifest together ❤
My most successful two cups jump ever was for "more creative ideas". Maybe try jumping for business ideas?
I was in high school, learning about the French and Indian War. Little did I know, my future husband was in college, also learning about the French and Indian War. Pretty weird but we have a lot of these synchronicities from before we even met, and many more since then. 

I just remember feeling really sad, and wondering if it would have a bigger impact on American history than the French and Indian War. 
I was walking through my apartment complex on a rainy night. There were lots of snails on the sidewalks, and I stepped on one. This caused me to scream, and become frozen in fear of crunching another one. It took my husband a while to convince me to start walking again, and almost as soon as I did I stepped on another snail. Rather than get stuck again, or ya know, watch where I was walking, I decided to make a run for it, crunching snails and screaming all the way home. 
St John's Wort. It's OTC and remarkably effective. Also just taking good care of myself, even (or especially) when I don't feel like it. Specifically I try to have at least one green smoothie every day so I'm sure I get at least 4-5 daily fruits and vegetables, getting out in the sunshine, exercising several days a week, limiting my internet/screen time, and making time to do creative stuff. This is not medical advice by any means, but personally I took antidepressants for years, and they weren't nearly as helpful as all of the above. Also, finding friends who aren't judgmental and will listen to my problems and empathize. I've been fortunate to find a few online and IRL friends like this and its life-changing. 
The smell of chlorine and sunscreen. Public libraries. American Girl stuff. I often feel nostalgic around 4pm because it was my favorite time of day as a child, I would get to eat snacks and watch PBS. 
That's so damn cool!! My spiritual journey was kickstarted in a single evening early 2013, and it's hard to explain just how radically life-changing a moment like that can be when talking to someone who hasn't experienced it. How awesome that yours was during an ellipse! And yes please do PM me, I love to chat about this stuff! 
I like to meditate, and beforehand I set the intention of receiving any kind of help that comes from a source of love and light. However I don't think there's anything you *have* to do other than be willing. If you've ever woken up in the morning with a new insight, or just been walking along and suddenly had a revelation, or clarity about a problem, that's what I would consider a "download". 

For me, days with big energy shifts or upgrades often make me feel super restless, like I need to run sprints or something! And in the days following I often find myself having enormously helpful dreams about my emotional life. Sometimes I make unplanned changes, for example on 8/8/18 which is sometimes called "Lion's Gate" I suddenly lost all interest in eating meat. Others found that their habits and addictions were suddenly much easier to kick. 

Now that you're aware that these things often come in waves, you'll be able to make note of your own personal symptoms. It's different for everyone yet there's a lot of common experiences. 
I'd love to hear about your achievements, if you're comfortable sharing :) I think it's really cool you live in Ireland. I spent the summer in Dublin one year and loved it! My kids are only 4 and 2yo but I hope they grow up to travel and have different experiences.

As for always being the one to reach out first, I feel ya. Try not to take it too personally. People are busy and caught up in the day to day world, and just don't take the time to reach out sometimes. It doesn't make you any less valuable or important in this world. 

I love you and I'm proud of you. Please feel free to PM me anytime you want to chat! 
Yeah, the subconscious mind is pretty cool! We're all different yet we dream in a lot of the same (or very similar) metaphors and symbols. When I'm feeling vulnerable or exposed in some way, I usually dream that I'm in the shower and people are just walking right in the bathroom to talk to me.
This is so awesome! What program do you use?
The best way to make them stop is to figure out what they're trying to tell you. Even stressful dreams, nightmares, etc are your brain's way of sorting through the emotions and situations you're faced with. Starting school back can definitely be stressful, but it could be something from your past or even worries about the future that are surfacing. 

If you feel like sharing your dreams, or even just some of the recurring themes I'd be happy to help out  
Front yards usually represent the way you present yourself to others, or how you feel like you're perceived. Toilets are typically used in private, so having to use one on the lawn would seem to be a metaphor for you feeling like your privacy and personal business are exposed. Think about what in your life has made/is making you feel vulnerable and it might help you hone in on what your subconscious is trying to help you with.
💚We really are, my friend!! I love how the internet enables us to find our kinds of people 😊

I couldn't agree more about the monetary system. I really believe we'll evolve out of it, or it will simply collapse, at some point in our lifetimes. In the meantime, I'm sending you abundance vibes with all my heart! We're gonna make so many people happy with our random tips, gifts and donations! 😄💸

Edit: another thought I had that seemed to come from somewhere greater than me.. If I really want to peacefully disrupt the system (and I do!) What better way to do so than to open myself up to greater abundance and redistribute it myself? It seems obvious now, but it was a revelation when it came to mind yesterday! 
You got me thinking with your post, so thank you as well!! It's funny you mention the financial stability - I've been having this realization over the past 24 hours that I don't need to be broke to be a good person. Not that there's anything wrong with being poor, in fact I think guys like Jesus and Ghandi are in part why I have been afraid to accumulate money. But for now, I see that getting to the point where I'm not worried about the bills, and actually have enough to take care of myself AND others, would better enable me to give freely and use my gifts of service. It's a wildly different perspective, but it seems like I'm getting the message that being financially strapped is actually keeping me in a place where I have to think about my needs *more* than I would without financial stress. I think too, that I need to learn to trust myself. I'm terrified to turn into a self-interested rich person who is negligent in the needs of those less fortunate, so I keep myself in a situation where I'm always busy trying to make ends meet, which isn't really helping the less fortunate, either. 
The silver triangle! 
I haven't had the chance to watch your video yet, but your title is a little synchronicity for me as I've had the phrase "You can't pour from an empty cup." running through my mind lately. I have two children (4 and 2yo) a husband, a dog, a cat, two part-time jobs, friends and family who have their own emotional and practical needs I try to fill, the list goes on! And I can do a lot, but I tend to be self-sacrificing to the point where I simply don't take the time to nourish myself or get enough sleep. 

I used to consider taking care of myself as "service to self", but I no longer see it that way. I see that getting adequate nourishment and rest, putting on clothes that make me feel confident instead of schlepping around in whatever I pull from the drawer first, exercising, getting out in the sunshine, and putting on makeup or earrings or whatever else feels fun that day.. These things allow me to open my arms wider and work harder for others. 

To me, the only real difference is intention. I'm re-filling my cup so I have more to pour out, not so I can keep it full and set it aside just for me.

As for the dark-workers thing, I actually never heard that term until this week, but it perfectly describes my past-life memories on a spaceship, and essentially what I do best in this life. I seem to have a knack for walking right up to the "bad guys" and diffusing situations, breaking up fights, etc, which is kind of funny because I'm tiny. But when I first ground myself in love and light, I am somehow able to gently talk down angry men who could chuck me across the street if they wanted to lol, but it is essential to do so as though they are my beloved brothers - because they are!

So I consider myself a light-worker, I just thrive in the presence of darkness, and transmute it the best I can.
This sounds like a game I would have played all day! You should try /r/tipofmytongue :)
