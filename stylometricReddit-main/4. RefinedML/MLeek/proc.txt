if you were looking for someone who is eager to have children and be a stay at home parent and therefore needed a provider then sure lead with your salary 

if what you want is a partner who is also independent and driven lead with that
shitty behaviour on that first date sounds like dating just the risk of dating and not really a political leaning issue 

maybe you want to enforce a bit more chatting before agreeing to meet
14 years ago i sucked it up and met his ex i was nervous and threatened but she was good people i didnt always like their dynamic but it was a friendship no doubt 

6 years ago she was the only one who asked me if i was okay she was concerned about how she saw me being treated that relationship

4 years ago when he and i broke up she was the second person i called after my own mother since these shes been one of the first ive called for every major life event weve flown across the county 5 times for long visits 

i know its not everyones experience but its hard when i see these sorts of questions not to imagine how much poorer my life would be without her in love didnt last forever but our shitty ex boyfriend had excellent taste in women
its not your fault that this adult person doesnt make good choices to care for himself

or kind choices when it comes to how he treats you

no matter what your flaws were what he did texting you a year later and then blocking you was unkind dont feel guilty be slightly pissed with him he lobbed an emotional grenade at you either because he didnt realize he wasnt actually capable of speaking with you or because he just wanted the drama even if it wasnt completely intentional attentionseeking and shitdisturbing it still was unkind

you already had this figured out hes not sad because of you hes sad because he has a toxic and untrue story he tells himself about you hes cast you as a character in his personal pity play its not really about you youre not doing anything to him hes doing it to himself and then making bad choices that make you seem complicit but youre not its a character he likes to make you play but youre not person he is making you out to be

give yourself a break and let it go
if you dont trust her judgment dont date her

its okay to be uncomfortable but thats a problem you solve by leaving a relationship that doesnt work for you not by insisting her ignore her own judgements about someone shes known for years 

they are barely in contact at this point youre being absurdly insecure
you should be waiting for the other shoe to drop

maybe it wont but the odds arent good and you shouldnt be putting you faith in this change 

right now you are performing service a lot of a highly feminized and necessary sort of service for him hes comfortable with you in that role he likely feel grateful but also he is under no work stress or financial stress and hes probably a bit dependent on you still 

as he becomes more independent and needs to return to work it is likely he will return to past behaviours

you are right to be skeptical and you should speak with him about your concerns that he will change back as soon as hes placed under stress or his need of you is less
im pretending to have valid criticism of social media and how many men engage with it but really im just shaming and insulting women who dont arouse me personally
ditto my 30s have brought me more attention from men than my 20s ever did and a little bit of it is even gracious and positive in ways it never ways in my 20s 

a man on the street yesterday eyed me over and i was ready for the hit but he said those shoes that hair those sunnies youre pure joy today and then he just kept walking no demand for further attention or time he actually just complimented me it is mindblowing to remember it is possible to say something to a woman you dont know that was only meant to lift them up and not to disempower them or remind them that they are a sexual option for you
the quick trick that often helps is to not say what youre doing wont get you what you want but to say are you sure that is what you want because it doesnt seem to me that what youre doing right now is moving you towards that
i dont want her to doubt herself

its okay for people to doubt themselves if their current choices arent lining up with what say they want to achieve its okay to ask questions and point out that what they say they want isnt lining up with what they are doing that is exactly the moment you need to doubt yourself a bit and reconsider either what youre doing or what it is you actually want
im not sure what youre looking for

youve described a person who knows why she is dating for fun experience and status not a serious partnership and is choosing this for herself on balance she sounds content thats fine the only real problem here is that you think the younger person easily mistakes the appearance of maturity in an older person for actually being mature

thats not unique to young women dating older men we all do make that mistake from like 5 years old to 50 years old with our teachers and bosses and parents everyone older than us we have to be constantly remembering and relearning that isnt the case and most of us struggle with that lesson in our teens and 20s

im not sure what elaboration youre looking for im talking about misogynistic comments about women over 30  and youre talking about your one friends personal pretty selfaware dating choices at this moment in her own life i think you might be at risk of being overinvested in this one persons dating life and looking to draw more connections that actually exist
because 30 often actually equals  sufficient life experience and a wide enough list of her own responsibilities already to be fully over your crap

i watched nearly all of the women in my peer group get into thier 30s and realize they have been lied to men arent overgrown eightyearolds with sex drives but competent human beings who can manage their own shit and be expected to treat us as human beings the incels like to frame this realization as a hatred for men but honestly im not sure i really loved any of the men in my life until i realize this was true for all of them they can do it many choose not to 

i also watched my twin brother go through the realization that women are not stupid dependants and decide he wanted a partner who saw him as a person first and not a stoic provider it does cut both ways but like most misogyny it cuts more women deeper and in a more deadly way so we react more strongly
itll be much easier for you to not have contact with her mother when shes not locking herself in a hotel room and refusing to communicate with you and others

i understand how you are feeling but we are teenagers and you were in crisis i was scared your mother involved me and i needed support and communication from the adults involved in that moment those adults included your mom expecting me to ghost your mother during that situation when i was scared your mother was scared and you were refusing to communicate with either of us is not fair to me

you were not doing what her ex did and sharing her secrets 

she had created a highstress situation where no one could have thought clearly about her boundaries because they were addressing her behaviour if she wants to be angry with her mother for involving you she needs to take that up with her mother once you were involved expecting you to ghost her mother during that situation is ridiculous if she wants things handled differently she has a lot of power in the future to behave differently herself and bring the panic and drama down like nine notches

dont grovel acknowledge her feelings but be clear you behaved reasonably in an unreasonable situation and if she doesnt like it she needs to not put other people in that situation
i mean we make fun of men for not knowing how much work goes into the no makeupnatural look but selfgratifying little liars like this arent helping anyone
these asshats all men are inherently violent and sexstarved animals not be trusted around the women i have assigned value to 

also these asshats i dont understand why the woman wont give me the benefit of the doubt im actually a nice guy who just believeswhenitsconvientforhim that all men are violent sexstarved animals these women must be worthless sluts who only want violent sexstarved animals
you need to let the blame go for good before you talk to her this should not be you picking a fight and behaving like she did a bad bad thing to you

this should you be letting her know you didnt like how you left the subject and letting her know what your beliefs and insecurities are and then listening to hers sincerely and with the assumption shes a decent person who isnt out to get you but actually wants mutual understanding as well

if she wants an exact talley or your number is too high for her then youre just not compatible no one is wrong or evil youre just wrong for each other
youre absolutely overthinking and ascribing malice where there may only be understanding between longterm friends 

the look was just as likely if not more likely to be about your gf being chronically late than about you telling 

and yes a couple bickering in a group setting is awkward or can be charming or even annoying that is a thing you should try not today do but these level of sensitivity is excessive

you cannot share your own frustrations  like her being late  and bicker like that in front of them and then be frustrated when people feel they have insight recognize you have helped to create this dynamic and that you are probably misreading it and assuming there is way more negativity in it than there is

you need to get your own brain in order your friends didnt do anything to you
what she is telling you now is that from the beginning she was manipulative gameplaying and testing you she downloaded tinder only because she wanted you to respond a certain way and now shes calling it cheating that you treated her like she was an honest person who said what she meant 

now she is either for a excuse to blame you and keep you insecure in this relationship or an excuse to break up with you 

either way this woman has told you that shes the one who from the beginning was being unkind and reasonable  and plans on continuing that way 

dont be in that relationship if its a break up great thats the right outcome here for you
so you believe she was wrong to ask and your answer was perfect and you are still twisting yourself into knots because of the ways you are assuming she might have interpreted your ideal answer 

give your head a shake this is not about her right now her asking isnt the issue youre working through right there 

your partner isnt responsible for addressing every passing bad feeling youre having and certainly not for reading your mind 

she didnt do you wrong  she just did something that didnt work for you  but if you want to build something real with her you need to actually talk to her about your beliefs and insecurities
this id be so frustrated by his cowardice and avoidance right now

its been fives days he had said nothing

that bodes really poorly for his ability to be accountable and make change

my ex did this hed blow up over a game or us running late over a miscommunication or at a uber driver or waiter and withdraw for days then hed suddenly become cuddly and affectionseeking i mistook this for an apology for the longest time but he never apologized he was just self soothing taking a time out and pressuring me into providing him with validation when he was done seething about it

definitely talk to him about maybe including your disappointment at needing to broach the subject and do the emotional heavy lifting here when he was the one who behaved poorly
nope probably not gonna work out might anything might but the odds are bad

relationships can go through periods of reduced contact by mutual agreement that is tough but can be workable if both people know what theyve actually agreed to specifically like how many callstexts in a week are expected and visits if any 

but if you and she cannot agree what a committed girlfriendboyfriend relationship looks like during these next six months then its a breakup and attempts to stay in contract without those sorts of very clear agreements on what that contact looks like exactly are just gonna cause drama and hurt feelings 

if you cant have those tough conversations about your needs and how much contacttime is needed to maintain this connection then its a breakup and its more likely than not to remain one in six months time
why stay in a relationship with someone who you need to ignore in order to maintain really basic selfesteem why do you have to show him these comments dont impact you what does that achieve they do impact you because of course they do youre human you pretending better that they dont hurt isnt going to stop the comments or improve anything 

you cant keep drinking position every day and only wonder how to feel better or pretend to feel better about drinking poison every day 

drinking poison every day is gonna cause pain 

if your man is posioning you every day get rid of him
yeah thats not a blip

thats a selfabsorbed jerk who isnt just rejecting you or giving you pointers hes outright insulting you 

i have never called someone i love a horny mess except as a compliment
you tell your friends you dont particularly want to hang out with him in a group setting and ask them if its something that is a priority for them during the trip 

youre not selfish for not exposing yourself to a situation you reasonably believe you will not find pleasant or enjoyable

if you actually want to have a coffee with him say so but you dont do you not really thats fine give yourself permission to close this door and if your friend would really like to grab a drink with him take yourself to a show or something everyone will be fine they are grownups and can make choices about how they spend their energy just like you can
everything that he used to say he likes i do and now hes telling me he hates it and its killed the mood

is this what hes actually saying have you told him this is how youre experiencing his behaviorrejection of you

because a person who cares about you and wants to have mutually enjoyable sex with you should be appalled if my partner said this to me id be devasted and willing to walk through fire to correct that and work with them on our sex life 

he should not want to say things that leave you with this impression

is it possible this isnt a blip and youre boyfriend is behaving like a real piece of shit right now in more ways than just boundarybusting texts
this is unlikely to work

if youre broken up then youre broken up and six months is a long time to be broken up 

if she has limited time youd both be better of discussing what the relationship needs to look and behave like within those limits

it you break up then youre broken up and those regular calls and texts are more likely to hurt than anything else because the expectations will be completely unclear
hun i say this with love but ya aint teenagers some dry list from cosmo in the 90s aint gonna feel very validating 

you need think first about what makes you feel sexy odds are very very good that anything that makes you feel good about yourself even just a bit will work for him just dandy

also the dumbass is a 34yearold man he needs to be able to tell you what really gets his engine running and you need to consider what on that list overlaps with the kinds of things that might make you feel confident if something on his list is revolting to you ignore it easy 

focus on what piques your curiosity or makes you feel sexy or even just pleasantly silly
this is disrespectful and bullying behavior

dont try to make him understand you are right

require him to acknowledge he is harming his very new relationship with you when he refuses to listen to you and treat your opinions with the respect they deserve
red flag

hes 32 even if this is a thing he wants he should know that a it is objectively fast and b that he shouldnt be using his past or his hurt to pressure you

dont try to read his mind speak for yourself today

youre not doing that its too soon for you 

he doesnt need to understand he needs to show he can respect a simple reasonable boundary youre not ready to discuss moving in together
dont do it the truth wont help you much if at all far more likely this will delay your healing and cause a spiral 

not knowing is the hardest part  ill never ask my ex though i enjoy him not being part of my life too much and there would be no reason to believe any answer he gave hed lie either to protect himself or to wound me 

real closure comes when you just let go of what you can never know for sure and accept they have nothing for you nothing you either want or need
youre off limits do not do this

you have every reason to believe this contact would be unwelcome

your motivations are purely selfserving this is not just a geunie thank you it it an attempt to reengage someone who has made it very very clear they do not want contact with you no matter how much you claim its not an attempt to get her attention and validation and renew contact with her it is exactly that and everyone involved knows it

she has no obligation to address your experiences or your personal growth

also its been two damn months your selfreported change is just not believable i am sorry but as an outsider looking in the idea that you have made significant lasting changes in two months is an absurdity no reasonable person would extend you the kind of benefit of the doubt youre looking for 

do not do this
end it

hes holding a gun to the head of the relationship because he doesnt like how you engage with your parents thats lunacy and not fixable 

maybe you do need new strategies for dealing with your parents but youll get those in therapy not from an overbearing bf
no shes not wrong for asking

it was a disagreement a moment of imperfect compatibility between your views it wasnt a violation to ask

its okay for her to have questions that make you feel momentarily uncomfortable

its also okay to not answer

its okay for a couple to disagree on subjects like this

you feel icky about it because you didnt express your disagreement

you feel like shit because your own actions didnt line up with your own beliefs

that doesnt mean she was wrong for asking it means you didnt recognize and honour your own beliefs and boundaries when she did and that is a shitty feeling but its not once she forced on you she just asked you didnt handle the question the way you would have liked to that doesnt make her the bad guy for asking
its dealt with

your fianc has told her that her behaviour changes nothing 

she gets to have her little pity party and you and your fianc get to ignore her 

there is nothing to deal with right now let her sulk as things progress your fianc can inform her of what his expectations of her are in terms of her behaviour and you can discuss what the next steps are if she continues to make inappropriate comments 

you cant prove to her that you dont hate his family because it wasnt a reality to begin with she wont respond to evidence or argument so the answer from your fiance is simply i dont agree and that and if you are going to keep saying it i am going to stop speaking with you i

its not a problem you have to solve that she feels badly she gets to go off and sit in the corner and feel as shitty as she wants to she just doesnt get to throw her verbal shit at either of you
i do not like women who are not quiet and slightly fearful of me
hah the too blunt makes me laugh like you want us to be gentler and more subtle about the fact were fully human 

i hope people who say that really mean the satire wasnt always on point and sometimes fell a bit flat or got cluttered in so many unresolved plot lines id agree with that but even without sharing your thoughts perspective entirely blunt sounds like tone policing to me
immediately skeptical 

abusive people can weaponize anything  so sure possible  but when i listen to men who have been abused i dont hear this phrasing 

this phrase belongs to men who have been dumped by someone who didnt want to have sex with them or who choose to stay in a relationship where there was obvious sexual incompatibility not struck with a weapon
thats certainly how i took it i thought those last two mins or so were some of the best satire in the movie 

i also thought it was a great way to make the viewer confront their own sense of injustice for the kens they only got a bit of token representation ok what do you want immediate parity regardless of qualification or experience affirmative action reparations or redistribution tell me exactly how equity should have been immediately achieved for the kens and then tell me why it wouldnt be appropriate in the real world
no poor man is going to complain when people start liking them for his wealth

basically every study on lotto winners would directly dispute this
i know you dont want to hear this but you do need reevaluate how other people may experience your words because it really doesnt take much

you got piled on here and that sucks but the take away could be that when youre honest about your beliefs about other women it really turns a lot of other women off so you either need to change how you speak about other women or how you think about other women or both or youll continue to struggle to connect

i believe you when you say you dont think youre doing it but i doubt its true i doubt based on how you choose to speak here that youve just been unlucky 100 of the time possible but at 29 not super likely that it is entirely everyone else who is the problem

with men you can reflect these sorts of passive negative attitudes about other women being jealous or belittling and theyll pretty much never call you on it they tend to agree and be open to that framing of women and their friendships and these comments can be super subtle your version of speaking normally may include assumptions and biases youre not able to see right now you really should keep an open mind on this one with women you havent built a secure connection with and a foundation of trust the words youve used here are only going to inform them that you are exactly that kind of woman that you are trying to avoid

adult women who dont like those mean girl vibes are really hypersensitive to them and will withdraw their emotional effort incredibly quickly if they get a whiff of it the judgement might not be fair or snap or shallow but its also strong and in selfdefence much the same way youre sensitive to feeling belittled or competed with if you find you are only encountering women who hand over those sorts of bad vibes and arent ever connecting with ones who dont youre doing yourself a disservice by not looking inward at this point

or just decide not to pursue female friendships at all which is a choice i think is totally valid opting out is always an option opting out actively and without resentment can even sometimes even be a good way to release irrational assumptions that are impacting you it sounds like you may have experienced that when it comes to dating men
yes the movie took several well aimed swings at wokeness i dont know what they are about either 

i literally saw a random guy this morning posting and getting a lot agreement that the barbie movie was proof no one cared about mens mental health

and im baffled because a barbie did a way better job addressing men dealing some valid big feels than average and b it would never have occurred to me to whine that misson impossible didnt adequately address abortion rights
i mean the legitimate thing you need to do with that sort of feedback is go okay youre not able to reflect in a helpful way on this or were just not compatible either way okay byeeee 

most people you ask for this sort of feedback arent gonna be able to reflect on it very well its why i rarely bother its tough to find someone who a doesnt like you much and b is able to reflect thoughtfully and generously enough to explain why in a way that is helpful
this might be a good example of a selffulfilling prophecy

you can justifiably disagree with this take but this assumption of extreme malice and intensity of response is going to continue exactly the dynamic you want to avoid

any woman who is not into this energy giving or receiving it is gonna do exactly what uwinnimae said and probably just quietly stay away from you you think youre defending yourself but all youre doing is making it clear youre not safe to engage with the women who are gonna continue to engage with you after being on the receiving end of this sort of response would only be assholes who like the drama

i disagree that you need to speak to the women who feel wronged by you some if not most of them probably were assholes lots of people are but you do need to refine your assholedetection both by not overapplying the belittle and jealous labels and also by just not engaging when you feeling those labels do apply because choosing to respond to this and respond in this way was a misfire and the kind of thing that is gonna reinforce your existing patterns and keep you feeling isolated
unfortunately it creates a selffulfilling prophecy because you end up attracting exactly the kind of people who will mistreat you as a matter of course

exactly cause the only woman who is going to say oh totally women are always jealous of me too teehee are the women who are gonna pull exactly the sort of shit op wants to be avoiding
personal reflection not medical advice

most of my cycles are fine but every once and a while i have a rough one and a muscle relaxant like robax gets me through it doesnt actually stop the cramping  it doesnt impact those muscles  it just stops it from impacting your skeletal muscles as much so your back and shoulders and hips all the other places where you feel it or get tight with the stress of it thats what i really need not the cramping itself but the way the bad cramping causes the rest of my body to seize and sort of echos through since you said the walk is stressing you out it might be a thing to give a try but if youve never taken them before i wouldnt take em until youre safely at home they might zonk you out a bit

id call it if you can you might even find the walk helps
honestly the only reason to see it right now is to best appreciate them losing their shit over it 

my two cents its a good movie a few laughoutloud moments but it was also kind of all over the place it was at least 25 minutes too long with too many plotlines that didnt quite come together in the end 

the way these guys are twisting themselves in tantrums though thats the real show this week
yes she very clearly validated his feelings apologized for her wrongdoings clarified her feelings for him broke up with him and gave him some really good advice on finding his worth as an individual this is like a b break up at least 

which this man can clearly see is not barbie just being a decent person to another person but is actually barbie abandoning ken to ride the cock carousel and refusing to fulfill her assigned feminine role as kens personal therapist and sex object
hes not misleading you or trying to tell you halftruths

hes told you the exact truth and drawn a clear reasonable boundary

i really dont know what you dont understand he is ashamed its dirty he doesnt want it to reflect on himself and how you see him youve gotten the message more clearly than most people would offer it and it makes total sense

it is a reasonable feeling you cannot cure him of or declare yourself magically exempt from its a boundary you need to respect

even if you cannot perfectly comprehend everything that is true for him its time to accept this as true for him and lay the hell off of it i really dont know why you think it would need any further explanation or any challenging at all  it doesnt  youre 22 his parents home shouldnt be central to his selfidentity even if hes stuck living in it for a while longer

if you are worried about his comfort in your parents home ask him if he is worried about anything about the visit dont micromanage or assume ask tell him if something does comes up tell him you hope hell share it with you so you can support him and help him figure out any normsexpectations that are unique to your family all families are unique meeting them is stressful its not just a classwealth thing
i think the third possibility is a bit of bad luck with some poor boundaries with asshole women which has been turned itself into a selffulfilling narrative

ucroftygirl by the time i hit my late 20s women who told me they had no female friends or that said things like women have always been horrible to me for no apparent reason were huge red flags and reason enough in themselves to avoid friendship with that woman like honestly if you told me what you said above over coffee id be cooling it with you big time

i know its not fair but ive also been burned by women in friendships  we all have  and a lot of us have been burned by people who talk like that about other women

if you are ever giving new potential women friends in your life the vibe or the narrative that you suspect all women of jealousy and drama and betrayal then the mature and secure women who are not inclined to that behaviour are more likely to avoid you not step up to prove you wrong about themselves 

id suggest you reconsider and maybe reframe this as an issue of your own peoplepleasing urges and struggle to select your friends well instead of an issue of other women always do x

if we had coffee and you said ive made some bad choices with female friends in the past and accepted treatment i shouldnt have itd be taken 100 differently than women are always jealous of me
no no no it is stated that someday the kens will enjoy the same equity that women do in the real world

which is the finest shade in the whole film
barbie is gonna keep this sub lively for a while 

besides the obvious i cannot imagine what an idiot you have to be to believe that barbie was still individually responsible for kens wellbeing at the end of that movie
youre unhappy youre disconnected being grateful for someone who cooks isnt gonna sustain a relationship youre allowed to be not okay with cocaine use even just a little he doesnt get to declare it doesnt impact you that is your call 

go to therapy alone first decide if you actually want to work on this relationship or not
they dont estrus is part of many female mammal cycles but not in humans or the great apes were kind of an exception as mammals with placentas go but we are the exception

some women do experience changes in their level of arousal or sexual interests at different points in their cycles  and not always coinciding with ovulation  but we do not experience heat like cats or horses its not a thing human bodies do

fun theory the reason we dont need estrus is because weve used sex for bonding and pleasure for several hundreds of thousands of years what he calls the a bonus is likely why the biological function was not a necessary use of energy for the females of these species but dont get at these types with any real evolutionary science especially not the kind that says human women actually do like sex
i honestly thought that was one of the things they got right and presidentsnarrators responses were perfect cause otherwise were talking about affirmative action edi initiatives and possibly even reparations brilliant way to force the viewer to address their feelings of injustice when the kens only get thrown a bonetoken representation  and in a world where they were by systemic design utterly incapable and locked out of any leadership roles
the patriachy looked fun and appealing

i mean yes in the world of barbieland it was funny but it also immediately dissolved into war and the complete breakdown of responsible governance the moment the kens experienced some uncomfortable feels so yeah lets pass on that in a world with actual nukes

i actually do agree that ken had a wonderful beginning of an arc of realizing that neither barbie nor the patriarchy was a replacement for basic selfesteem autonomy and personal purpose i dont feel like they totally hit the mark but it was a great note for women at the beginning of their own feminist journeys  the man you love wont save you and feminism doesnt fix your life either you save you inside a fucked up and flawed system 

i honestly didnt love the movie  it was solid fun but not brilliant  but one of the best things was how they tried to let ken be a pickme who began  just began  to see the error of that but also didnt make barbie solely responsible for fixing him or supporting him in this next stage

it was pretty meta but most of that flew right over this mans head i guess cause he still seems to think feminism is braburning and power suits and cannot be not pink and sparkles
its been two years hes not new to this hes making an active choice to keep his relationship and his friend group entirely separate he made that choice during a fight with you and then he kept it up for months afterwards 

and that is a valid choice a person can make but that it doesnt mean you need to be okay with it 

you need to put your fomo aside you say youre not entitled but you are still talking about your sense of entitlement to being included on occasion and thats not the issue and not something you get to control you dont even actually want to be friends with these people the only issue here is the way your bfs choices undermine your trust in him and dont help to create the kind of relationship you want to be in

these people these individuals do not want to be your friends and frankly it doesnt sound like scapegoating they dont like you they dont want contact with you as much as you dont want it to be relevant to your question it is sounds like a few of them have good reason to simply not like you and thats fine they dont have to like you the question is how your bf balances that its not a question of forcing them to include you on occasion
if someone is scapegoating you here its your bf

hes not just leaving the shit hes the one who took the dump

the group didnt do it it didnt just happen he did it

the group isnt doing this to you your bf is they dont have to like you them not liking you much can be totally fair but isnt even the core of the problem here sometimes we dont vibe with our partners group and thats okay youre not entitled to being one of the crew they dont owe you any reply its not on them to do the work to be on friendly terms with you if they dont want to reaching out to them directly because your bf is treating you poorly was a mistake

but that isnt all of what happened here and your relationship is absolutely not perfect if your bf is only able to maintain his close friendships by throwing you under the bus with them it is reasonable to fear that is what he has done

you need to stop scapegoating the group or feeling entitled to inclusion with them youre not what do need to stand up for is your need to be respected and secure in your relationship with your bf hes the one who has lost your trust and hurt you feelings because of how hes chosen to engage with these other people 

this is 100 a choice your bf has made and is keeping on making to spend his time with people who you very reasonably fear blame you for all of his choices  because that is exactly the dynamic your bf has encouraged from them

hes playing them and you off one another to keep his life comfy and his game is threatened if you actually encounter one another or treat one another with basic humanity
i heard some of the same comments from men they were baffled that the good guys didnt immediately make full space at the top for the kens with total equity 

so you mean affirmative action with maybe some reparations redistribution of the dream homes perhaps that penny dropping yet 

ken got more than a lot of women or poc ever gets when he got one apology and the external recognition there might be more to him as a person
telling someone not to eat poison is not the same as telling them you personally refuse to respect them as an individual human being based on their choice of clothing and threatening that those other people who you are constantly empowering and educating to also not respect them might do them harm
those are concerning things to like about oppenheimer 

not the human innovation collaboration and achievement not complex moral questions and big mistakes and scientists struggling with how truth is used by power 

nope men just like the big bang and blood bath eh 

they think so little of their own
bullshit 

she didnt know until she was told he was sparing only himself he didnt tell her so he didnt have to do the work and face the risks and consequences of his actions
no 90 of men struck by lightning were fishing golfing or playing another sport at time 

as per usual it their own fucking machismo that gets em
i think the relationships that never quite happen are the hardest to get over you stay stuck in the honeymoon phase the whatif phase you dont know their shitty habits and bad choices yet 

so probably a bit yeah but realistic less than you are 

whats important now is you figuring out why youre having trouble letting your fantasy of this woman go because you barely knew her its the fantasy the hope the whatif of it all youre hung up on not the person ask yourself why
red flag might be a bit much for that comment other things are def red flags here but it was one sign among many this guy is going to be ongoing problem in any healthy transparent relationship agreement
not surprised but wouldnt want to picture it isnt a healthy place for a man who is already messing around behind your back id expect a comment more like id be happy for you if you were also getting off while i was gone even if im nervousfearful of hearing about it

overall youre just not dealing with a man who is anything like a good headspace to be your partner in nonmonogamy even if nonmonogamy doesnt bother you or even works for you
this is as big a deal to you as it is to you i dont think anyone else could make that call

some artists really like having a clear separation between their partner and their work others couldnt bear that youll have to figure out which one you are

you could also speak to him about his boundaries and limits in storytelling if you think of his as your audience some of the time you may find it rewarding to learn what he prefers and where he draws the line for some it can be a good challenge to write within guidelines very good practice if you want to write professionally  youll often have guidelines
for context i have been in ethically nonmonogamous relationships and i would dump this man 

you had a reasonable understanding you were monogamous  trust doesnt work on technicalities you both knew he what he was  implying was different than what he was doing  and he made you do the work of catching and confronting him coward as well as liar 

and hes already warming up to the argument its okay if i do it but not if you do it 

its okay to have a nonmonogamous agreement and when you choose not to tell him what you were pretty sure was up you were kind of beginning that kind of agreement however since that he has shown you hes not actually capable of it not in a respectful or healthy way 

he made you take on the tough emotional work of his breaking the exclusivity agreement when you do become upset and at some point you will because that is all relationships monogamous ones and otherwise he will turn around and tell you its your own fault this is not a man who is taking an accountability hes just fearful of you making him take any 

i would expect right now youre not upset because youd already accepted his cowardice and his dishonesty but i think need to realize now how much worse  not just if he keeps sleeping with others clearly he is going to do that  but it gets if he continues to shove off all the work of addresses his betrayal onto you its one thing to have low expectations of someone its another to be cool with nonmonogamy but its a third entirely to be tied to be a person who cannot actually address and take account for their own choices
im not calling you a woman hater 

im calling you flawed im saying you made a mistake and misogyny was a part of your error 

what makes you dumb in this specific case is your refusal to even entertain it or be intellectually curious about it you may be very smart man in other cases but here you are being that

i keep on telling you there were other appropriate and respectful ways to end the conversations you were not finding pleasant or acceptable  but your just keep telling me why you dont have to believe your sister
what discussion do you want to have

the real one where you were hurt and tired and lashed out in anger at your sister in way that was not productive kind or even half as truthful as you tell yourself or the misogynistic discussion one where you keep telling us you were just being reasonable and she was too emotional and not to be believed

cause if you want to talk about how you were tried and fed up and hurt and did something stupid and damaging to your relationship im here for it with nothing but support cause weve all been there but if youre only here to discuss how your sister wasnt even abused and youre the one magical person on this planet who totally immune from misogyny and were only being logical go ahead and block me i cant offer you anything for that

if you cannot acknowledge wrongdoing here what advicediscussion is even possible youve committed exactly the crime you accused your sister of
you need an airbnb or friends couch for a few weeks or a safe place to park overnight its really that simple isnt it

and you need legal advice

it gets confusing here which house is the subject here who owns what and where the children are fulltime but if the house is yours that josh is currently in then you need legal support to get him out if its both yours and josh then you really need legal advice if your husband is still in the home you two shared with the children you may have a legal right to be there but morally youd be a nutcase to try to enforce that in this context neither of you should want any risk of josh targeting the home the children are in 

so airbnb couch or car is what ya got

youre not going to convince your stxhb this is okay nothing about this is okay
you can take the first tiny steps start therapy even if its just over text message or zoom

take some leave and visit family or friends without her

its not your fault youre being abused abuse works because it is easy to feel beaten down and trapped and it is hard to leave that is how abusers get away with it youre suffering because anyone in your position would be suffering abuse hurts youre reacting like a perfectly normal person may react to extreme emotional abuse 

try to take some small little steps to crave out a separate space for yourself with therapy as a mentalemotional space or by visiting friendsfamily without her the small steps lead to bigger ones and the direction you need right now is just away from her so you can build up a bit more strength and get away for good
me too you should definitely ask me out or that sounds great what are we gonna do on our date next time

you can probably afford to be a bit cheeky here when you put it on him to make the next plansuggestion while also reinforcing your interest in him
mostly its not legal where i live

so i wore steeltoed boots for a long while when i worked the late shift and walked home i have a knife but honestly ive never considered it really for selfdefence its just a tool i carry like a pencil and tap measure but in a pinch i guess id reach for it i feel like most weapons are more likely to be turned on me

but the boots i used em twice would recommend if they suit your lifestyle just a little bit of practice and the element of surprise becomes yours i dont know what happened to the first guy but the second guy i got pretty good in the shin and then flat of the palm to the face he was still lying in the parking lot a half hour later so my buddy called an ambulance for him
because you wont shut up about it you seem to think its really really important that she left a marriage where  by your standards and your report  there was absolutely no abuse or mistreatment youve made sure to tell everyone that repeatedly you seem to think this is a very important justification for your behaviour 

you literally say that fact is why youre skeptical of her narrative skeptical of what exactly not sure why do you think that is such an important fact to undermine her and justify you that she wasnt beaten 

and why do you continue to ignore the fact that this conflict  about you being tired of her venting  should have been addressed by admitting your own limits and preferences and making some boundaries on those conversations that would have been the actual reasonable response to your actual problem instead you declared yourself an authority on her marriage and attacked her character

you were hurt by some of what she said i get it but you dont seem to realize you were not beacon of logic here thats not what happened you didnt address your hurt you made some shitty hurtful and ignorant remarks lashing out at her while angry and hurt yourself 
i agree thats the point

op only blames his sister only has awful things to say about her without offering much evidence and really appears to think she wasnt entitled to a divorce  or pain and anger  for anything less than abuse that rose to the level he had determined to be sufficient

thats misogyny it just is she may also be a shitty person  some women are  but op tried to enforced standards on her due to her gender and went on a character attack about a subject he had limited information and a whole heap of bias about and she was rightly having none of that shit the fact that an unkind gendered attack on her was the only tool he had to deal with conversations he didnt want to be a part of followed by a totally insincere apology a year later is really sad damn adult man needs some better interpersonal skills
ive read everything youve repeatedly doubled down on your misogyny including the belief she was too emotional to understand her own divorce and that you naturally as a rational man understood better plus the empty threats of physical violence if she had been abused in way a you considered worthy  its such standard sexist scripting im embarrassed for you 

the thing is we are all prone to some amount of misogyny it doesnt make you a monster it makes you a human being who was wrong repeatedly wrong then and here 

the fact you cant accept that and didnt even bother to address my constructive advice about boundaries suggests you will go on being misogynistic your lack of belief or even basic consideration of reality dont protect you from that it indicts you

its good you apologized even if you didnt mean it its kind of ironic that youre actually guilty of the exact thing you accused her of an inability to acknowledge your own wrong doing and the limitations of your own perspective
in your shoes i absolutely would bring it up with her directly and in the framing of i know its not a thing eitherof us can solve but joe is clearly all up in feelings about bf planning to propose im sorry hes stressing and i wish men werent such drama llamas how are you doing with it

this achieves a few things one it puts the reality out there on the table but paired with the assumptions that you and she both know joe is the one who is having big feels and behaving not so great two it gives her a chance to share her own feelings if she has any those feelings could be yes i wish wed be engaged first or those feelings could be i cannot believe joe is making this about you and your bf 

your bf really should also tell joe that no actually on second thought he wont be giving him a heads up because hes clearly a bit upset about it and that is not fair to anyone involved  this is not about him or about mary he can find out as the rest of the friends do afterwards
it sounds like you think he was blameless because he didnt beat her and she was only entitled to abandon him if he hurt her badly enough according to your standards 

that is misogynistic do you really think your culture is free of misogyny and you are also personally immune because you are clearly demonstrating you are not 

its good you apologized by your own description you were the egocentric difficult and misogynistic that doesnt make her perfect in her marriage  you dont know that and never will  that just makes you specifically wrong in this conversation 

you should have spoken up for your own limits and boundaries if you were finding these conversations draining not gone on the attack its okay to not be available to someone for endless venting but your attack on her character was informed by misogyny pretending it wasnt makes you sound like an idiot
if youre invited youre invited

if you want to ask him hey you sure you didnt want this to be a guys thing then ask him but he invited you so probably not
i have no difficulty seeing the difference between someone being objectively attractive someone i might enjoy having sex with and someone being someone i would want to pursue any sort of sexual relationship with

most of my longterm friends arent gonna fall into the middle of the venn diagram but a few might and we may still just be good friends with the sexual attraction being a nonissue

maybe its being bisexual but this just doesnt confuse me any and im always shocked when it confuses others like not having a crush can be tricky at times but not having sex with someone for any reason isnt difficult at all its really not and friendship is a series of chosen actions and mutual agreeements not a passing thought
call the bluff

if he needs to make you the very very bad guy in every fight address it headon and tell him that if that is honestly what he believes about you he has no business dating you 

if that is who he really thinks you are  someone who really intends to hurt him in that way  then one of you needs to leave this that is toxic for you both its toxic if its true and its toxic if its not 

if he cannot believe you or extend any trust to you when you speak about your own thoughts but instead tries to force you to respond to his accusations and assumptions about your intentions and character then he really just thinks youre a shit human being 

he thinks he knows your mind better than you do and that he has figured you out youre shit doesnt matter what you say or feel he knows that youre shit 

and an adult man knows what hes doing with these attacks on some level hes going to keep doing it because the kind of relationship he wants to be in includes calling his partner a shit human being whenever he doesnt get everything he wants
also pregnancy

emotionally i think my risk feels about the same or may even have gone down physically my risk has gone way up but not because im afraid of assault
it does suck but hopefully in a little while itll just become further validation for leaving a role where you werent really considered or met with much empathy beyond oh gee i wonder what this means for her relationship and lets start jostling for her position right under her nose 

just sounds to me like you had correctly understood this wasnt a place to make more meaningful connections give yourself a pat on the back coast through it and focus on your own plans
im sorry this happened to you

i get the desire but please realize that now that the reason you mishandled is cause your basically decent and reasonable you cannot outasshole him hes a bigger asshole than youll ever be with more natural skill nothing you will do can hurt and frightening him the way hes hurt and frightened you you dont have that power over him you probably cannot shame him or make him recognize wrong doing dont try itll only hurt you 

my advice text him back that you felt pressured to take his number but have found his comments about your age and your body inappropriate and unwelcome and do not want to speak further no im sorry no thank you just do not speak to me again text or in person

then when he blows up your phone with awfulness send it to the gym and let them know why you either expect a full refund or a promise that there is no risk of you ever encountering him on their property again  

on the off chance he does the right thing and leaves you alone forever then rest assured youve shamed him as much as was humanly possible 

youre only power is in being reasonable and letting other people see it because men like this will not be 

he is probably not a pedophile  it doesnt help your cause to exaggerate youre not prepubescent  but he is aggressively targeting very young women at someone business and if they dont care plenty of women on yelp will
yeah shes broken up with him a few times but mostly in comics that were published after margot started playing her i havent done a deep dive but i can only think of one break up that actually stuck and took place before margots version of harleen in 2016 

and i just dont think the comics have the same impact on the culture the movies do in the 2010s and beyond not to take anything from the writers who were already contributing to the characters shift but they dont make the same impact on the broad public after suicide squad that robbie version was harley quinn and even suicide squad has a bit of a hint of where they were going with her
while i agree that people are going to become more skeptical that is actually why the crime has to be the same whether the images are real or not

because the shame the attack is the point not the truth the people who dont want to attack women wont even when the image is real the people who do want to attack and offend and shame will even when the image is fake

the abuser is not disempowered as long as they find a welcoming audience and when it comes to sexually degrading a woman they will be able to find that still

it may be extremely difficult to enforce but that doesnt mean we dont acknowledge that it is a crime changing the tools doesnt make any other sort of crime okay we wouldnt say oh we have deep fake voices now so identity fraud over the phone is cool your fault if you recorded your voice too much or didnt let the bank know not to give you access that way
wild i was just watching secret invasion and thinking wow she still reads hella young for her age
i never would have typecast gosling as ken but on the interview circuit hes clearly having the time of his damn life
yeah i had liked harley well enough in the cartoon as a little girl but the early comics turned me off of the character and off of dc entirely for a while
no she was a producer i kind of skimmed over op mentioning a role because i knew she was a producer did some press for it and that film uniquely pissed people off

honestly she has a producer credit on so much awesome stuff dollface and maid jump to mind really hope she gets to take a crack at tank girl havent heard much on that for a while
margots version is far far less sexualized than nearly all of the comic books or video game versions of the character making your comparison only to the 1992 childrens version is a bit disingenuous and doesnt really speak to the fact that that version was still subjected to some transparently terrible physical and emotional abuse the relationship wasnt healthier because her flesh was covered in a skintight suit nonrevealing usually wouldnt make one think skintight by the by 

its perfectly accurate to say she desexualized the character pretty significantly at this point

sexualization isnt all about how much of a womans middrift is showing
yeah it would totally be unwatchably cringe probably even for a lot of those guys who are now deep into their 30s and 40s and who never thought about what they were actually looking at before abuse really transparent abuse

i almost wish it was done so these men could see it through adult eyes and some of them would be able to reconsider like when he tossed her out of the window because she had almost beat batman and his ego couldnt take it or the time she disappeared for a year and he didnt notice or the time she started to get a bit too independent for his tastes so he showed her all the corpses of the women hed loved before who were dressed just like her the carton was bad enough the comics were insanely bad
i think this was even promising young women started before that margot robbie reclaimed harley quinn  from the manicpixie who worshiped jokers cruelty toxicity and emotional terrorism of her and hypersexualized nympho  and there are a huge number of millennial men who will never forgive her for hq becoming a full supercool human being independent of her abuser 

plus there is this huge group of bitter men online that dont like that women like things have full vivid internal lives with formative experiences and fandoms from childhood to adulthood and have real economic and cultural power now they used to be able to gatekeep us out of their real fandoms but that is getting a bit less effective lately so they need to burn down anything that sniffs of serious fandom or nostalgia and doesnt service them and only them
im glad you have a good care team and connected with someone right away on this for your ed im exactly your height and weight and have the same bmi if someone wrote that i appear at a visual observation to be my stated age and moderately obese id just think yeah as a visual observation as something that appears to be true to an observer that checks out

im not saying what the doctor did was okay but i really dont know  it certainly seems careless and like there should be better standards for noting those sorts of observations about a persons body  but i think your disordered thinking is also trying to have it both ways although i dont have an ed my anxiety does this to me a lot tries to make the bad thing simultaneously true as the real thing to absolutely maximize my unhappiness if bmi is bullshit and there is no clinical definition of obese that im aware of that isnt rooted in bmi so its bullshit its not a clinical fact and im not really certain it was being presented as one

fatphobic yes problematic yes but documented clinically false statement i think that might be the ed really getting its claws into you and twisting you up and you might want to challenge the idea that that anything clinically true could have been documented regarding bmi in my mind observation and appears is actually where that sort of thing belongs not presented as as some sort of objective fact
you talk about sex and partying with a tenyearold 

but putting that aside these men dont seem to realize this is a really good way to only attract profoundly immature women who do act out and who cannot carry on adult conversations because if you dont believe any other kind of woman exists you will not recognize them and they will quickly decide to stay the fuck away from you
i always enjoy the ones who run in and say body count is correlated to cheating when the strongest predictor of infidelity is being male followed closely by having cheated in the past and having come from a family of origin where the adults cheated 

if youre arguing men shouldnt date women with 20 partners because that risk of cheating is unacceptably high youre also arguing women shouldnt date men at all if were accepting those deeply flawed studies that is how the pure maths actually breakdown thats the comparable risk
hes just an asshole

when he doesnt have you anymore hell blame it on the weather or the economy or his friends partners youre his emotional punching bag because he doesnt want to take accountability for his own life

if youre not ready to break up at least start inviting others to these activities with you and start living your own life again
regardless of the validity of her fears id never recommend anyone marry someone who expresses their concerns through emotional manipulation and insults against cultureupbringingcharacter there is no way this ends well if that is what she thinks or how she fights
all that work just to try to rob you of the delight youre taking in your ignorance and failing anyways because your position has little basis in reality to begin with nah i can see how youre treating others so ill pass on that offer
yes that was my vibe as well feels scammy and not like there was anyway for op to bring up it up without exactly this response 

someone who doesnt want a prenup is fine thats not the marriage they want i get it but what was said here was exceptionally manipulative and designed to silence op 

even making some allowances for english as a second language this was an extremely emotionally manipulative and insulting response  sponsoring someone can be very expensive and very complicated legally a prenup could protect them both and allow her more confidence in planningbuilding in her own life even if the marriage doesnt work out a prenup cannot go below the legal minimums op would owe and it might actually give her more protection if she choose to leave the country after a separation
found the person who had no idea what a prenup actually is beyond what they read on page 6
thats not just someone saying no to a prenup that is someone who is gonna blame the culture anytime something comes up in this relationship she doesnt like she basically said you dont have thoughts or values or feelings of your own just a american culture she has contempt for

shes not just wrong but she actually cannot be worked with to find a middle ground once shes behaving that way 

im a bit concerned how this ldr even began
do you mean like globally

cause yes if youre including women in developing nations you are unusual 

in some mba programs you will also appear to be the minority 

but 62 of master students in the us in 2022 were women so no youre not that special

and lots of complete morons making way less than 100k have mbas
i dont think i missed it at all i would just skip right to the walking away part because arguing is pointless getting a big emotional reaction from you probably validating experience for them and might even prolong or escalate the engagement 

once your trying to get the last word with a a crazy asshat youve already lost as far as i can tell so i avoid making any reply at all and if  absolutely have to i dont address their point just label my own situation
i think thats also okay to say something like i dont really have the bandwidth right now to support you in your dating journey can we change the subject or even and observation like it seems like were retracing the same ground and i dont have anything new to offer

at some point the impact of the behaviour on you is the same regardless of what she intends its okay to have some boundaries and to admit when youre not gonna be the best person to offer any support
i think all you can is let her know her boundaries and standards are a bit outside of the norm and she needs to speak up early on the first date if she wants verbal consent to any sort of touching at all she absolutely must communicate clearly before she chooses to drink 

if she refuses to do that then id said shes deliberately setting up a test even most decent men will fail because they have been trained to make the first move and that these are acceptable moves to take nonverbal cues on 

youre a better friend than me honestly my eyes would be rolling out of my head and id be telling her she clearly doesnt want to date men right now and to stop putting herself and others through it
honey to nearly every adult woman over 20 you just look like a kitten on their hind legs adorkable not sexy
i feel ya but i suspect most of the men engaging in this behaviour would find that kind of response very validating and a good start to a debate i dont choose to do this there is no reason to try reason youre just giving them a new line of attack
absolutely if you suspect they might be in an open marriage that is only more reason to reach out my partner and i are openish and one women he made out with at party reached out to me and i was delighted to chat with her and absolve her of any bad feels she might have had id rather he always be explicit with someone but spur of the moment stuff happens and he was still perfectly within our boundaries and had already told me about her
while its good to skeptical this even is a woman but how very sad for her

is she really gonna off herself at 40 decide there is literally nothing else she wants to do anymore doesnt want to see how her own kids turn out even or see the pyramids or eat a nice meal ever again nothing just nothing because you dont believe you have an immediate value to a man or infant
this i think in your shoes op id feel a moral obligation to tell her and provide any textscreenshots i had however id also very very much expect not to be believed and would not want to expose myself to harassment or risk

id block him completely before i did it
yes ive experienced this before mostly from men of asian decent simply because there are more of them where i live

there is no countermove and they know it that is why they do it there is nothing you could have done to defend yourself against this attack or handle it better any more than you could defend yourself if he started saying you were a reptlian invader in disguise you cannot disprove it anything you say in your own defence will just be ammunition because they dont want to understand you they want attention and attack

just keep walking head up eyes forward if i must speak in these cases ive found the best thing to do is look them square in the eye and say loudly loudly enough for others to hear that i dont know you this is not a conversation then withdraw your attention because its not a conversation its not an exchange between two people its a verbal attack from a stranger hes not having a sincere conversation about race and even if he was he doesnt get to decide that your walk home from work is the moment you must do that social justice work for and with him

and it feels like shit because it feels like youre playing right into their uptight selfrighteous white women narrative but ive never found another path to safety except to make myself into a less interesting plaything they know the attack is irrational and therefore impossible to defend against you have to prioritize your safety nothing else to do
it does exactly what its supposed to do

its just an expression of dominance over the public space it belongs to men women just move through it and a violation of womens dignity and freedom to exist they are not seeking a connection with another person they are performing for themselves and for other men at womens expense and they all know it any man who says its a compliment knows knows perfectly well he is lying to you  or hes never actually offered anyone a sincere compliment in his whole life 

they are feeling gratified by exercising their power over a public space and are getting off on the violation of a woman the rage and powerlessness you experienced were the whole of the point

so yes it totally works it does make them feel powerful it does reinforce a general sense of danger and unwelcomeness in public spaces for women and it does get a response they find gratifying

the only countermove ive found halfway effective is to live my life with headphones in but not on that way i can be prepared to be perfectly nonreactive to it they can get their jollies off of performing for others but they will never ever receive any feedback of any kind from me
wealthy men hoarding women as objects stretches back in history to the very concept of ownership of over objects 

what is delusional and that all these men assume that they would absolutely be in the extremely small minority of men born into sufficient wealth and status to horde said women like pokemon  like somehow they would deserve to be the 1 of the 1 who got a haram  if only women hadnt become human under the law
i would suspect shed get the best direction from a domestic abuse hotline or charity or shelter in the area or even any advocacy groups for stalking victims somewhere with a network of women who have had to pursue this locally
i have an interesting theory that if you actually did any of the stuff tom cruise does in the mi movies it would hurt a lot and not even look that cool and then youd die in the first 20 minutes of the film yeah real life is weird
i dont think historically or culturally there is much evidence of real concern for womens pregnancy risks being the core case for its approval but yes that is the actual reason it needs to be accessible to women their bodies their lives thier health choices
much like miss pearl i wish her all the luck in finding a conservative man to live up to her values and force her to end her lucrative career preaching to the choir and presenting herself as an authority before men 

also i really enjoy that shes basically ungoogleable because an extra n in her name doesnt adequately distinguish her from a scottish drag queen
its one of thier highervalue invidiaul possession which they connect to masculity and status

the more you thnk about it the worst it gets really
yes there are the baseline risks of having multiple partners but the risk of supporting human trafficking with money is pretty low for a straight woman on a bar chatting up a random guy
you need to try to let go of your rage 

your sister has made a very clear choice and i promise you that she realizes that someone might pass away without her knowledge 

its very possible shes not bitter or angry shes just made that clean break it feels very personal but it may not be 

dont waste this precious time chasing someone who doesnt want to be caught 

also i dont know why you think the police will tell her thats not a service they provide for people who died of cancer in the hospital
youre right about the risks when hiring sex workers but youre wrong and more than a bit disrespectful to imagine that those risks cannot be minimized and that no consenting women would be delighted to have your bf as a client

and hes right men in open relationship tend to struggle more than woman and add is a physical disability and the relationship becomes functionally only open for you totally valid for him not to want to open up under terms he reasonably believes will be that lopsided 

also please look up some basic terms because im not convinced that you and your bf are on the same page about what these causal relationships will look like and what emotionalfriendship sort of connections are permissible and thats not what polygamy means you might be getting your wires crossed with polyamory but youre also not really describing practicing  polyamory either
do you know the world is literally on fire old lady your jewels wont be worth shit in the future water wars
ok like all bodies are different and all but that seems extremely unlikely
thats the thing here ive never heard anyone argue that paternity tests arent allowed what they really seem to be bent out of shape about is that a they often have to pay for it themselves and b the mother of the child gets to have feelings about it

like who is actually stopping fathers especially custodial fathers from getting dna tests maybe there is something but i feel like
if a court ever denied one is a support case wed never stop hear about that it seems like what they really want is not to face any consequences interpersonally for accusing the mother of cheating and fraud they want to feel what they feel and get what they want without anyone else involved being entitled to any feelings on the subject

any woman who knows exactly who the father is and is asked for a dna test can go get a swab and then a separation order both people get what they need to feel secure and respected in the relationship i dont see the problem
thats not great but it seems clear your sibling understood that your mother was not telling the truth

there is a genetic component to anxiety  that doesnt excuse your mother but it does mean that you as her teenage child might not be able to do anything to make her behave better which is awful and stressful and sad at 17 your goal should be to get out of this living situation as quickly and safely as possible
i mean you know you didnt slap her 

im not sure why you think those are the only two options it would seem most likely to me that your mother is mentally unwell and seeking attention 

what do your other siblings say about this are they believing her or are they trying to keep you safe from her behaviour
it drives me nuts when swingers do this but its really a really common framing they use to distinguish themselves from enm or poly i agree its careless and sometimes disingenuous but within that community the common definition of monogamy does mean sex always includes my partner not sex never includes anyone besides my partner

i know you dont care but he probably wasnt lying about how he viewed monogamy and he didnt it make that up himself 

he was just shit for waiting so long to clarify his position and his interests
i just have zero desire to sleep with anyone im not in love with

look as a woman who has swappedplayed in the past please never do it

there is nothing that worries me more and makes me feel worse than knowing a lot of women feel like you do and are not genuinely excited for themselves to experience this or fool around and selfishly its really not fair to me im also a person and i dont want have sex with you or watch or anything unless you also really want to

it doesnt make you closeminded not to do it it would make you unkind to everyone to try and force yourself

and i agree with you it is the signing up for the site a site whose primary purpose is to chat with other real people about having sex with other real people that really crosses what he should have reasonably understood to be a boundary that was a violation of your trust and a big problem and not something he was free to do within the current relationship agreement
you should check out ops post history

man needs to be fully dismissed

and badgering someone for years about a sex act they clearly dont like isnt  a concern
please to god stop this

this isnt healthy please call a therapist immediately and sort whatever shit youve got going on or get a hobby but gtfo of here its absurd
even if any of that had validity its not the big brothers place to preparing his little sister by lowkey threatening her with his sexual discomfort and objectification of her

manners youre a fucking joke you clearly wouldnt know appropriate if it bit a chunk of you off
she was very dry with her responses but wasnt dismissing my comments she just thanked me for my words

yes she was that is exactly what a civil dismissal sounds like

anything that isnt hell yes is a fuck no this woman is saying fuck no to you and youll twisting yourself into knots trying to not accept that message

it is extremely unlikely she wants to reconcile the most likely explanation for her behaviour is she doesnt want to talk to you at all and definitely not in person and she knows this is less about the stuff and more about your trying to generate a conversation

if you really need the stuff ask her to get the stuff back to you in a neutral way by dropping it off with a friend or shipping it to you dont try to use the stuff to leverage further contact or any inperson conversation she knows that ploy she is actively avoiding that situation

or just forget about it because its been two months and you seem to be living without it fine its completely valid to just let it go because she doesnt want to talk to you
youre advocating telling a 14 year old girl she is in danger of being treated like a sex object inside her family home and by an older brother no less that isnt even about growing up that is just a fucking horrifying and toxic and dangerous message to get from an older brother are you really advocating op tell this child that he might do her harm if she doesnt cover herself more inside the home what the fuck is wrong with you
no a relationship isnt a hostage situation youre allowed to leave it for any reason 

you can be happy for him that he has made genuine changes but that doesnt mean you owe him a lifelong relationship what you owe him is honesty if you dont want to be with him admit it let you both be free 

its totally normal to feel badly when you disappoint someone only monsters truly dont care that their choices or actions make someone else sad you just have to admit to that both of you deserve better than a relationship that you want out of
lord i thought this guy was a troll but no this looks like its just who he is hes really the sort who think kids dont really cost much or take any time and he thinks that because hes not around much what a prize
remind him this is an absolute dealbreaker for you and if he has realized it is something he needs in his life then you are not the right partners for one another ask him to be honest with you now about the life he wants to live because it is not a fair or healthy cycle for either of you if he is gonna reconsider sexual monogamy every year or two

it was wrong of him to start engaging at that level without speaking to you first about renewed or recurring interest but it was naive to assume youd never have to speak about this subject again that isnt longterm relationships work things come back up

but it also doesnt mean your sex life isnt great just because i have great homemade pie at home doesnt mean i never ever want to order a piece of pie outside of the house what is important here is agreements if you and he have an agreement that he can look at the other pie swingers porn but not engage with eventsgroupscommunities about all the other pies he might want a bite of and certainly never eat or expect you to eat random other pies that is a valid boundary and he either needs to reconfirm his agreement to it or leave

i dont deal with adults who dont understand the difference between fantasyporn and actually engaging with others making profiles for the purpose of engaging with others or researching events these are very very very different activities and tis fine to be okay with the first one and not the rest
she wishes she wasnt discriminated against and bullied for no reason 

agree with her validate her that is a very sane and reasonable wish to not be exposed to harassmnet and even sexual harassment due to her race

you cannot fix the world you cant and should try to conntrol her relationship with her heritage but the best thing you can do is probably agree with her on the part of this you can relate with racism is bad
you just remind yourself that not everything is about sex and what exists in your brain doesnt define the bodies or lives of others

peoples bodies exist in space for themselves their visual impact on you is your job to manage 

shes not punching you this isnt an act against you shes not doing anything wilful or even inconsiderate towards you this is just someone who exists in space and has a human body you really need to let that body exist without drawing comparisons to it as a sex object not just because shes your sister but because shes a person wandering around her own home id say the exact thing to you if she was roommate 

if you need to step away because youre not comfortable with how your own mind behaves do that
really cannot answer that for you totally depends on the individuals in that family and your level of desperation id love if my mother lived a bit closer but if i lived closer to her that would mean all my cousins and aunties would be around as well and on balance nope glad to raise a child not enmeshed daily in that drama or going into a class of 20 kids where at least 3 of them are related its got its upsides but nope

if your family isnt close i think its important to connect with a few new parent groups locally or even online and just make sure you have a network of support  even if its not one that can babysit
his current job requires long shifts during the day and then in call during the night he does get more rest days because of this but he needs those days to recover

yeah if he wants to be a fully present parent and you dont want to be a sahm that isnt a great working situation he may make more money but it doesnt actually align with your other goals as a couple

no matter what happens its scary and its a big leap of trust from you both thats okay if he says hes prepared to be the one who moved id tell him frankly youre gonna trust him on that because yes you think youre wellpositioned where you are for the next steps in your life as a family together and you dont actually think where he is now is as aligned with how both of you would like your family to operate
in the context of these sorts of career choices and moves 3 years or so is quite soon

itll take almost a year for either of you to adjust and become stable after the move at least 3 years is not far away at all

if you dont want to be a stam then it doesnt matter if his current job would empower you to that have you spoken with him about how he views his role as a parent would he call out to sit at home with a sick kid or is that a mothers job or does he think it should be the job of the person who makes less

i dont have a dog in this fight but you both need to be looking at this from a total compensation pov including housingcar etc as well as a lifestyle and parenting time pov

as a prospective mother i wouldnt rate a place to live a car a good mat leave contract with the ability to wfh andor bring the kiddos is quite so lowly when put against his current paycheque all of those things add up to a hell of a lot in terms of total compensation and happiness outside of work i think thats a much much closer decision than you realize and while there is more to discuss there is a really good case for him coming to you if children are a goal in the next 35 years
your gf has been pretty damn clear about the choices she is gonna make for herself she doesnt have a problem with vaping and shes gonna keep doing it 

if you dont want to be in a relationship with someone who makes those choices that is totally and entirely on you at this point 

youre not her saviour or her keeper or her parent and the rest of the people arent demons in her lie tempting her to the evils of vaping shes gonna choose exactly what she wants

you need to leave this relationship and seriously recognize the dynamic youre looking for playing daddy isnt as satisfying as youd imagined
stop offering it as if its some sort of giftfavor to her and tell her isnt something youd value because you would be more comfortable and less stressed if the bathrooms and floors were cleaned thoroughly tell her you intend to hire someone for x and ask her how to best fit that into the weekly schedule 

of course shes defensive and hurt if youre treating her like a failure instead of just acknowledging your own preferences and capacity like the capacity to pay for what you want
dude invest in counselling now or you will invest in a lawyer later

i have said you may have some valid concerns but nothing about your behaviour here suggests you are operating from a place of partnership or mutual respect your current approach is shit your current expectations and how you are expressing them are shit if youve become so upset that you cannot behave better than this then you need outside support youre not being reasonable  maybe you were once but not anymore and not the way youre communicating here  unless a marital breakdown is your goal
youre either a troll or an asshole who is choosing to be on a oneway trip towards alimony child support and weekend dad duties while also paying a maid
yeah her ft job is supervising those children  and given your attitude i suspect that is a job she does more or less alone on the evenings and weekends as well  your standards arent reasonable

you need to fold the damn laundry and dump out the kitchen stoppers as if you were a competent adult person you are also responsible for the bare minimum in the home 

you can still seek counselling if you want but youre the asshole here if you think two children at that age are not already a fulltime job with very limited breaks and think your wife can easily be mopping or scrubbing toilets during the day with a threeyearold running around

you asked if you were being reasonable youre not you may have some valid frustrations and concerns but you are not overall being reasonable about how much time her primary job of supervising small children actually takes
its concerning that you do not mention the ages of the children in the home

there is a big difference between what one stap can achieve regularly with one or two 13yearolds in the house and what the same stap can achieve with 2 young ones under the age of 5

it is a struggle to have different standards than your partner when it comes to comfortableacceptable living situations if youre stuck having this conversation over and over again you may benefit from some counselling where you can talk about it in terms of solutions and needs instead of it being experienced  reasonably  as nitpicking

and you may need to reevaluate the agreement it may not still be working for either of you agreements in marriages do something need to change or evolve you cannot declare you are just the provider and shes just the maid forever marriage is an ongoing partnership not a prison sentence shes not stuck with you or with doing it your way because she picked you once years ago and the same goes for you you need to be ready to do some growing together
honestly im not quite seeing how it is so much better for you to move to him if your car and housing are currently covered where you are if hes able to move into a home where he pays nothing that takes a pretty significant chunk out of his pay decrease you really need to not just look at his takehome pay and tell yourself well he makes more so obviously that is the priority look at both of your full compensation that includes what youd have to pay for housing and a car if these were provided and any retirementinsurance pieces too 

youre also leaving out a major part of this puzzle which is children and parental leave who is entitled to how much for how long and who wants to take what if you want kids that is a huge part of your financial lives for the next few years

it sounds like the 75k job might not be the right job to move to but you really really need to bring pregnancy and paternal leavebenefits into the equation here if you intend to have children and that might put his current government job over the top  if you want to stah for a long while or it may put your job over the top if he wants greater flexibility to be home and your company is generous in their accommodations for new parents
its been three months you burned red hot and then exploded

i think youre old enough to recognize that isnt the foundation of a healthy connection

and youre both way too old to be having drunken andor 4 am fights

block her close that door and realize the things you liked about her did not in any way out weigh the things about her that were intolerable in any remotely healthy relationship
with my ex i just told him i was staying out of his relationship with food

i would do what he clearly asked of me for support buy certain things modify certain dishes but otherwise i stayed out of it and made it clear he was the expert on his diet honestly this often pissed him off as well because it put a huge amount of mental labour on him he hadnt been doing for a decade to actually feed himself it took him a long time to realize what me not being responsible for feeding him according to his diet unless he communicate it actually required of him but it wasnt worth the effort trying to figure out how to support him better only to get snapped at and met with character assassination if i didnt do it exactly right 

withdrawal sucks and i dont think brining the sandwich up twice was a good idea and i suspect your in for a bumpy ride no matter what you do but those texts would still cross a major line for me the point of taking a walk is to cool down and reconsider if youre blowing up my phone with that bs while youre doing it then youre doing it wrong for the both of us
he is asking for too much if he thinks he can treat people with indifference and contempt and theyll stick around hes not just playing by his own rules hes ripping down anything else that brings you happiness 

and yes its your choice if you choose not to focus on the parts of the relationship where hes isnt being contemptuous and emotional abusive and its a smart choice nothing else he can do excuses that
your partner has told you that its a vital central part of his character and his concept of self to hurt you that is who he is he cannot see himself as anything else 

this isnt about adjusting this is about someone who thinks deliberately lacking empathy and consideration even in his closest relationships is something to be proud of and that his internal world is the only things that counts 

he should be dating a cardboard cutout
mmm sexpositivity seems to have drifted into a hyperfocuss and centring of the right kind of sex 

im a very sexually active person and pursuing  new sexual experiences is a value for me  and my eyebrows still raised a bit reading your op because no sex is a biological drive many of experience it is not a universal need like food or water for all my crazy experiences with others i have no difficulty fathoming there might be a time in my life where i am fully satisfied with a steamy audio book and a bit of a pillow hump 

i think you might have a mismatch with your therapist at least on this subject
thats the bare minimum but that doesnt mean its has to be good enough for you 

its a risk to continue with him i dont think anyone else can make that call for you sometimes people need to really really fuck up before they can get back on track sometimes more often the issues will be ongoing

be honest with yourself if you want to take this risk on him its okay if you just dont went too or youd like too but simply cannot
hes your ex

its really tempting to psychoanalyze him but its probably not the best use of your own energy 

probably way more helpful to consider the current behaviours during the relationship with you that you should have noticed as red flags or concerns then to try to figure out too much about the relationships he had in his early 20s or teens
what are all the right thingshes saying 

is he acknowledging he threatened both your safety and possible also your basic rights has he stopped drinking to excess immediately does he understand he cannot use name calling no matter how upset even legitimately upset he is 

i wouldnt feel safe with a partner after that but for me all the right things would need to be very specific and followed up with clear actions like minimizing alcohol intake if hes just saying vague bullshit like hes sorry or ashamed or making excuses for himself and not changing anything else that would not help reestablish trust for me
i never talked about infidelity i havent seen his post i only know what youve said i talked about the risk of sexual violence 

theres not burn here you said you didnt want to break up and im not saying you have to consider his fears but i am saying if you dont youre probably going to break up if you need him to be happy about this youre probably gonna break up 

and maybe you should if your bfs big concern here is you cheating then hes trash and you should break up 

but you said you really didnt want to hear that
breaking up removes him for a situation he cannot tolerate and when he cant support you the way you need him too

and ir sucks but it actually does solve his problem just not any of yours 

and yes the reason hes upset is because hes male that is also the reason i am concerned for your safety again thats not insane

you got to make the safest choice for yourself not argument and not shame there but you cannot hold someone else hostage in a relationship they want to leave no matter how desperate your own situation is

if you want to maintain this relationship stop arguing with him and start agreeing with him and validating this is scary and awful you are making the least scary and awful choice for yourself and youre asking for his trust  not his happiness just his trust in your judgement  in a really objectively weird and awful situation
she asked how to not break up thats the advice she wanted being her cheerleader is nice but it doesnt help her much with keeping  
 the relationship 

and the answer is dont expect him to be feel okay about this hes not going too if you make that the fight  that he has to accept this and feel good about it an fully support you when you live with a total stranger you met on the street for next to nothing  youre gonna loose that fight and hes probably gonna break up with you

the way through to acknowledge this is fucking insane and not okay and of course he doesnt feel okay about it and of course reasonable people are telling him he should opt out and reasonable people are worried there is or will be an exchange of sex for rent 

those arent crazy that concerns deserve to be taken seriously 

people trust you more when youre honest and reasonable pretending he shouldnt be nervous about this isnt honest or reasonable and just will drive a deeper wedge she needs start agreeing with him this is bonkers this is a lot of trust to ask for from him in a really bad situation people who care for him will be skeptical of her shes asking for a big lift when it comes to trust and to him managing his own feelings about this he might not be able to do that but thats whats being asked for
youre not a bad person

but youre not being a kind or reasonable if your expectation from your bf is he feel okay about this 

hes gonna feel not okay about this he might even feel not okay enough to break up with you that sucks but its also not insane

as much as you have no other choice and are youre doing best that doesnt mean hes required to feel okay in this relationship he might not and you probably cant fix that when it comes to being in this relationship or not he actually isnt required to suck it up he could say no cant handle this thems the breaks
boyfriend aside any 30something year old man who is letting a homeless 19 year old stay with him for basically nothing is gonna raise some concerns in the rational persons mind that he has some expectations

its great you feel safe where you are but your bf gets to have his feels too and you need to realize that where you are is still a not great options among many bad options 

you have put in him a position to question your loyalty and your safety admit it acknowledge that this looks bad and feels bad for him too and that youre gonna do it anyways hes not gonna be a happy camper about it only a total moron who didnt care much about you would be 

you cannot really calm his nerves because this is a totally reasonable living situation to be really nervous about youre at a very real risk of coercive rape i really hope that doesnt happen but only an idiot could pretend there isnt a rather large risk here what you can do is admit the reality and not pretend this good or even okay its not but its whats gonna happen right now just is

its up to him if he wants to stay in the relationship with that reality the reality sucks its sucks more for you but it still sucks for him too both as your bf and just as someone who cares for you
nah no confrontation no telling him what to do

just be a neutral honeys observer yeah that sucks i wouldnt want to be treated that way that sounds like no fun 

there are plenty of ways to tell him the situation is shitty without telling him what to do
give up stop investing

you understood this correctly he wasnt brave enough or selfaware enough or selfless enough to just end the connection with you he probably does think youre a great person he probably didnt want it to be a one time thing but he wasnt able to step up and make it anything but that 

cut the leash
i want to call him a jerk and maybe he is also a jerk but sesh a whole lot of this sounds like the speech someone gives at a kindergarten graduation im with him this was pretty cringeworthy 

if you do this in the future keep it short and be specific  like 3 paragraphs maximum  and dont try to hype him up like you would a child on their first day of 3rd grade recognize his actual competencies and if you want to compliment him be very specific about things he has done or achieved or characteristics he displays that you admire because after reading this i dont know anything about him as a person  his actual strengths or passions  i just know you have a whole lot of vague warm feels and thats nice but totally about you and it belongs in a journal there is nothing here that reflects you actually seeing or understanding him as a unique individual appreciating and supporting him sure but knowing him no there is nothing that says that 

you need to reflect on the difference between journaling your feelings and really working to express something communicative to someone else 

and seeing and understanding him may mean not doing this against all
why why are you fixating on the word

you went to her your ex to stir up some more shit needlessly and she tossed out a weakass excuse and lie hurtful sure gaslighting not a good example no thats is not good evidence of the very serious act of abuse that is gaslighting but its great evidence for you being confident in your choice to break up with her not speaking with her any more and learning when confrontation only harms yourself
right now she is running the show because youre all up in you feelings and you were very easily baited if youre worried about her walking all over you you need to realize your current approach is laying out a welcome mat and signalling to her youll be a lot of fun to fuck with 

this was your first visit you have learned she runs her mouth and is inconsistent you cannot trust what she says about the future she could change mind entirely tomorrow and then again on tuesday you cant let yourself ride that roller coaster with her you have to stand back and look on and say to yourself oh big dip right now

i understand its easier said than done do it anyways cause if you dont i promise you itll hurt you more than it hurts her 

when dealing with the kind of person youve described  inconsistent quick to judge quick to change their judgement making big promises and then pulling them back when the wind changes and prone to gradeschoollevel pettiness  you are doomed until you learn to laugh

if she chooses to feel badly because you or your partner arent traditional you cannot control that and she probably will choose it sometimes
so the article in that first link is misrepresenting a lit review  it actually didnt even link the full article but i was able it find it  that is recommending against that kind of simplistic approach when researching predicting infidelity and argues for a temporal multivariate approach and includes the rather telling quote there are probably more scientifically worthless facts on extramarital relations than any other facet of human behavior 

id keep going because when you start with misrepresenting and failing to link to an article that isnt even original research and doesnt say what you want it too to support your point i do get curious just how intellectually dishonest that whole list is but its late and im tired and you dont car anyways
youre doomed if you dont learn to laugh at her and dont better manage your sensitivities about your own clothing choices 

your partner doesnt take her seriously she lives half a world away youre handing her a hell of a lot of power over your happiness when you could be laughing and frankly you sound like youre pretty eager to feel snubbed there is nothing shocking about a parent being hesitant to talk about marriage with the gf she just met

she doesnt need to like you sure it would be nice but some snide comments arent going to break you are they you buck a bunch of other traditions time to question that one as well you dont need her approval you need to learn to peaceable survive when she says silly things half of what you described here would have just made me laugh and say well that is one perspective
this was a toxic relationship and its good its over you shouldnt be reacting that way  not to her face  because you shouldnt be speaking with her at all 

when you break up with someone because you think they are cheating or planning to cheat why would you ever speak with them again youre not friends 

id really recommend you not let it fester any deeper is it possible she never thought of raya till after the breakup yeah its possible not likely at all but possible and it changes nothing

you dont need to round this up to gaslighting you dont need to confront her you just need to end contact
you hire a divorce lawyer be prepared to meet your obligation to her as your ex and coparent and you focus on building a respectful relationship as coparents

no one deserves to be married to someone who thinks of them the way you now think of her she shouldnt have lied not just because its wrong but lying is part of how she ended up married to someone who would call her a community giver ew new one to me 

mature and appropriate is recognizing your own limits ending the relationship you dont want to be in and figuring out to treat this person with dignity regardlessif only because you have a child together
i mean thats fine 

be honest about your intentions while dating we cool 

dont project dont make it a womans job to change your mind her goodness shouldnt be your primary motivation for a relationship youre not a challenge youre not a beast that needs taming youre just a dude who had some bad experiences by 30 most women could tell you about some real doozies too 

if you cant date without being dishonest or projecting your trauma on to others please dont date
its reasonable not to invest too much into meeting new people when youre not happy with where you live and are planning to move shortly but no in the longrun onlineonly relationships are not a full replacement for connections with the people who are actually around you

doesnt mean longdistance or online friendships dont have value  they do  but for all the health benefits from friendships and community you need to maintain some inperson connections too

youre 32 its way harder to get into nyc than it is to get out dont be stalling get out
thats exceptionally different than a 30 something woman objecting to a civil conversation of a few minutes over a conflict she had already decided wasnt worth her pursuing herself and had been adequately resolved by moving out and where she apparently felt unable to even shout from the door hey all packed and ready to go

im really sorry you went though that but i truly do not see any connection besides someone doing a thing we can all agree was wrong the severity and the impacts where 1000 different
a simple hey bf im ready to go or even hey sorry i really got to get going would have worked too from her to solve her own problem and advocate for her needs instead of sitting and pouting in the living room 

youre giving her way more credit than i am willing too she was looking for him to confront her because that is what she claims she would have done in his place that is what she actually believes would be correct in that moment it wasnt enough he agreed with her and was helping her she wanted to watch some bridges burn

there is absolutely something more going on here with keeping this relationship private
even in the places where they legally and ethically can purchase this service consent is required in advance and the cost of the women services is significantly higher than just her medical bills and lost wages 

this sounds like indentured surrogacy as punishment for consensual sex
no kidding i cannot imagine a much better way to codify and empower reproductive coercion not to mention the terrible health outcomes for women and babies

the guys who think buying a 20 dollar salad entitled them to a blow job are not gonna be paying for prenatal vitamins after being told their one night stand is obligated to provide them with progeny with pricing to be discussed after the obligation is already in place
no forcing unwilling women to be surrogates isnt acceptable either 

this doesnt fix anything they are just suggesting another legal framing for the denial of womans autonomy if that was required it would just means sleeping with a man would be considered legal consent to shortterm service contract to bare him a child 

no one else should be getting first right of refusal when it comes to the use of someone elses body

the persons whose body it is decides if another person gets to grow inside of them not complicated
your time would be better spent understanding the assholes since there is more accurate information on them

im going to borrow this if dont mind this is beautiful and applicable to many well i think they have undiagnosed x and that is why they regularly do the thing ive told them repeatedly hurts me
i genuinely believe he has autism or adhd and is truly time blind but the net effect on her and me is the same hes late or absent

preech

autism or adhd or any sort of mental illness are explanations for challenges not blankey excuses for choices that youve been told clearly are hurtful hes not experiencing a challenge hes making a choice
youre making it ops job to get him to do something he is declining to do she spoke up they had the fight that is where her power ends its not on her she cannot fix this

its not always a communication issue where if she just found the magic words hed do the right thing
there isnt anything op can do to change him into a competent parent with her words 

and can we stop pretending every person with one shitty parent is broken or hopelessly doomed 

yes it sucks realizing your parent is a shitty person or just a shitty parent is difficult and painful yes its something op will need to guide and support her daughter though for years most of her life probably sooner that starts in age appropriate ways the better that little girl will be at avoiding that pattern in her own life 

its not the end of the world in fact as childhood pain goes id put one shitty parent one solid one on lighter side of the spectrum
poor time management and mismatched priorities is exactly what i look for in a man s

seriously though poverty sucks and is hard on relationships but men married to women who work long hard hours outside of the home arent likely to be called strong if that woman falls asleep before the kids or leaves the dishes overnight

poverty and exhaustion are one thing choices to not prioritize anything except your role as provider and martyr is another
moving out was totally reasonable

getting your knickers in a twist over this is not 

he supported you appropriately and he probably kept acting normal in large part because your relationship is a secret expecting him to confront her at that time is absurd i had to doublecheck your ages  thats such an immature idea this was not his battle to fight and even if he wanted to speak to her about it this was not the time so he shot the shit with his friend for a bit 

you need to get a grip it was an uncomfortable 5 mins not some sort of betrayal
you said no

you were invited you said no thank you last minute didnt want to pull it together that quick 

this seems like a pretty reasonable misunderstanding to me 

its not your fault for saying no but its also not his fault for not triplechecking you hadnt changed your mind ya go to use your words he had a totally reasonable belief that you didnt want to go 

also make some plans to do something for yourself for the rest of the weekend dont sit and pout thatll make it worse for everyone
be wholly dependant on and subservient to me but also dont dare replace me if i die 

should she just be buried alongside you dude throw herself on the pyre
totally within normal 

i think the important thing to realize especially if you enter a longterm relationship is that having attraction resurface for others doesnt necessarily mean there is something wrong in your relationship you already know its not permission to cheat 

i used to be worried when i was with someone for a long time and my attraction to others reasserted itself but im not anymore its a fun stage where im crazy in love and choosing my partner actively not just being blind to everyone else who exists
i think youre right but in the shortterm i might just go with you will not make it on time and this plan requires two adults so i will be inviting other adult in your place to drive and make sure everything runs smoothly well see when we get home

sort out the birthday then the lawyer
he should respond in some way but this kind of reply is going to make op feel worse people who are behaving unkindly or ghosting dont need to be taken care of and provided with additional emotional support its not even kind to them to try better to respect and accept the silence as a message all its own id skip right the mute part

if hes confused or worried op is mad those are things he is capable of addressing with communication no reason for op to jump up and try to take care of him right now
i feel like i hit the sweet spot because i got my first cell phone at like 16 and my first smart phone at 20 meaning i was young enough to be stupid and hyper connected and full of drama but old enough to be a little self aware about how i used it  its way harder to talk to a 12 or 13 year old or even an 8 year old about how you use this and how it impacts you
who are you arguing with my first sentence is telling her to dump him if this a violation of her boundaries her personal boundaries for herself about what she wants in her life sesh

respecting that someone sincerely disagrees doesnt mean you are obligated to keep dating them

but we need to stop pretending that there is only acceptable way for an adult relationship to look and that anyone who sincerely disagrees and wants to go to strip clubs or grab coffee with an ex or follow some models on ig is some sort of monster
its really not a generational thing

lots of people in their 20 and 30s have lived their whole lives with location tracking but reject it as invasive and problematic in adult relationships my partner and i only turn it on sparingly like if were at a theme park or a mall and going separate ways for a bit we dont love our lives with it on i wouldnt date someone who expected me too id find that desire deeply concerning about their character and emotional fragility frankly

youre 23 you gonna find as you get towards 30 a lot of your peers will have very different and evolving boundaries on this
or and hear me out on this revenge porn is morally wrong no matter what tools you use

again fun thought not an okay action
instead shell learn that some people are idiots and adults fail in love sometimes and that mom is the one to emulate and turn to for mutual support and joy its not perfect but its okay shes gonna be okay chin up
if you do not want to date men who go to strip clubs then dont thats 100 valid and something you need to be accountable to yourself for by breaking up with him

your bf told you that he thinks this is an acceptable thing for him to do and that he believes he should be trusted to make responsible decisions even while at a strip club

he wasnt taking any steps to hide it from you or lie to you he behaved as if he felt this was a choice that he was free to make for himself he disagreed with you he probably still does disagree with you regardless of how sorry he is to have upset you

you can break up with him over this disagreement but check yourself its a valid disagreement he has a valid perspective on what is acceptable and permissible in a relationship it may mean youre incompatible but its still a disagreement between two people who are both rational and worthy of respect
absolutely you dont know what you dont know and it is often so much easier to show love and compassion for others than for ourselves definitely been there
its always very telling when im listening to my friends when there get to the place with someone where the narrative becomes ive accepted they treat me this way but im appalled theyd also do it to others

im sorry youre going through this i hope your kiddo has a magical day sounds like a great outing
more fun as a thought than as an actual activity more likely to hurt yourself than him

enjoy the petty thought experiments as they float through but use your actual energy someplace better
the first thing you do is mute him andor hide alerts from him so youre not worried each chimealert is him there is nothing to be gained by knowing the very second he responds your brain needs a break

then you take a walkrideswimdrive whatever without your phone leave it alone completely for an hour or two watch a movie bake a cake workout something that keeps your brain and body busy is best shove your phone in a drawer in another room take a few hours take the afternoon no one is going to die

the constant checking because a selfreinforcing habit and you just need to break the habit its a vicious circle but the more you check the more youll need to check the less you check the less youll feel the need keep him muted and hidden and check two times a day maximum id suggest once after you wake up and once after dinner beyond that live your life
they are legitimate enough reasons from a person who feels confident that when push to comes to shove the responsibility for these totally dependant little persons will not fall to him

my ex was similar and all his reasons broke down to it would feel good to me i would find it validating id feel id done somethingachieved something which okay fine thats a personal reason but also a totally shit deal for me and for those kids so im not doing that
solidarity

in my 30s i finally gave myself permission to admit i have some sensory issues and that a lot of clothing feels awful i do wear a lot more tight clothing to work now because i recognize close fitting stretch is often least bad for me ill wear leggings or very dark tights under things that are on the short side and it seems to be fine 

in terms of looking put together heres my bare minimum shaped eyebrows and tidy nails not even painted necessarily just cleaned and filed if i do those two things i can basically pass for put together 

if you really need pants go into some more expensive stores and try some on ive found i gotta spend a 100 on pants i wont hate wearing so i try not to have to wear them much 

finally if you dont figure out anything else about your clothing preferences figure out where you like your waist i like mine high just above my natural waist i started feeling better more days when i banished everything from my wardrobe that didnt hit me at my high waist fuck trends if it doesnt sithit me at my high waist i dont wear it

wow i have now rambled and your milage may vary but thats me and i wished id started honouring this shit about myself at 22 instead of deep into my 30s so solidarity and good luck
nearly all human interpersonal relationships have transactional components both healthy ones and unhealthy ones

but the healthy ones have to include the fact that both people in the transaction are people fully recognized as such basically empowered fundamentally respected this is a thing women still often struggle with when it comes to men especially when it comes to assumptions about labor and childcare

and this is a sub that is intentionally full of woman speaking to their experiences so yeah
its very sad that for men who are truly willing to do the work of being a parent the doors that are open to women are closed to them single men adopting is possible  i know one who did it in c
canada actually  but definitely more difficult and costly 

file under another actual mens rights issue that mra wont spend a hot second on
amen

legacy crazy ive been calling it legacy crazy its way more dangerous and toxic than baby crazy the women i know who hit their 30s and went baby crazy literally changed their lives their jobs and homes to accommodate being a parent they worked 510 years plans to adopt or work with a sperm bank and make sure they had a home and job that supported this next step they went hardcore baby sane 

the men ive seen go legacy crazy often in their 40s just try to find someone else to do all the work they dont want to be a parent they arent dreaming of taking their full pat leave or being the one who cancels work meetings to drive kiddo to the doctor they want a kid like a steam achievement a badge to show their buddies they dont want to be a parent

obviously not all men but these men are out there and they are dangerous and when ive  suggested to the few i know they look to the single moms we know for a path or advice they are appalled they dont want to do that kind of work to make it happen
tired isnt an attitude when our bodies need sleep especially if we dont get enough sleep or we stay awake for too our brain sends us signals to rest if we dont listen the brain makes them louder and more unpleasant

your bf was being ass

but you should try this anyways instead is saying youre so tried so no no thank you i dont want icecream i really need to go home and be early to bed or whatever else it is you need to say i have energy for a bit more then to bed

if youre constantly fatigued still tired even after lots of sleep and rest thats a different issue you want to talk to your doctor about

but in this case just sounds like you needed to sleep your bf was the one with the attitude
there is no magic trick to selfrespect and selfcontrol if you truly cannot manage this speak to a therapist

and smoke less weed 

this woman is not a romantic option for you any longer shes been very clear and very kind about that its on you now control yourself behave with respect behave in a way that doesnt make you miserable
when possible these people arent you friends

when not make them explain it huh what was that repeats joke oh i dont get it whys it funny because youre short  yes im shorter than her still dont get it
the fact you keep repeatedly posting this suggests you are not in any sort of healthy headspace to remain friends

not now means no always 

shes not interested move on
instead of asking them why you know they have valid reasons its not a debate id tell them straight up that youd like to include him at times and what upcoming events plans would make sense or could we plan some smallerchiller events that could include him stop making suggestions and ask to make specific plans 

and if they say no they arent interested in being friends with him that is something you need to respect its sad but they dont have to like him or include him 

and they also might not trust your judgement thats not necessarily completely unreasonable you may want to include an apology to them for being dramatic or involving them too deeply in negativity before  especially if you leaned on them when both of you were cheating  and acknowledging you maybe didnt always build the healthiest dynamic with them either in the past admit your wrongdoing and ask for a second chance for yourself and your chosen relationship

because when it comes to stupid drama they arent just taking a chance on him what youre really asking for is them to rely on your judgement even above their own experiences
well it totally wont do that he doesnt have that kind of power just a dumb boy

but if you dont think talking with him is enjoyable and enriching for you dont do it youre not his therapist or his rehab youre a person who gets to choose her own friends and maybe he doesnt get picked
dear god go find a therapist
of corse youre right to be cautious

the kindest thing you can think about this guy is maybe he doesnt realize that he is using you as a placeholder of female support postbreakup and actually believes his own bs the best case scenario is guy doesnt know himself what the fuck hes up too 

but just because hes willfully stupid doesnt mean you have to be

do what you want but i wouldnt advise you put much energy into this friendship youre not obligated to be anyones friend
all men are mindless disloyal predators incapable of sincere friendships

and remember its the feminists who hate all men
if you really want to connect with your oldest sister find another way visits arent the way

i understand why you felt unwelcome especially with the history of favouritism but they might believe in their own minds that they genuinely want you to not to take on what they would judge to be an irrational amount of effort and stress i wouldnt want my sister driving like that in the rain with a small screaming child and then camping like even if she was willing i would not want that for her id be appalled if that was her plan 

maybe it is time to stop trying but you seem really fixated on your selfidentity as the the one who shows up and that might not actually be the best way to build a meaningful connection with your sister at this stage in your lives
you sound like 18yearolds not 28yearolds

but the simple fact is this she asked for a boundary she valued if you want to ask for a similar boundary that you value you can do so if you havent its not fair to decide shes a bad person for not just automatically giving it to you

and it is absolutely not the same to remain in contact with people you have established friendships with as it is to entertain unknowns sliding into your dms those are different activities and boundaries you can discuss both or either but they are absolutely not the same

if youre uncomfortable with some of her choices you have to say so and take it from there
you need to sit back and seriously reflect on what answers youre looking for here

youve got plenty of reasonable advice you need to look inward and figure out what those answers are not satisfying to you and why you havent spoken to him about your concerns andor your boundaries yet

if you really dont want to talk to him about this then it is definitely time to end this fwb agreement you dont need to understand everything  you never will  but you can understand that much your discomfort and confusion means this should end
you need to get a damn grip youre nursing a grudge beyond all reason and the story you tell her makes you sound at least as insufferable as she could possibly be

you dont have to like her but if youre going to visit her home and family bring a bit of respect and positivity and stop looking for insults at every turn oh she gave you a dirty look about lemons shes intimated by the price of the chocolates come on are you successful a adult women or an insecure 12 year old looking for a cat fight let the lady have her own feels

putting your personal expectations and values onto her and into his brothers doesnt make you an authority it makes you an asshole

if youre compatible with the man and he agrees with your values and priorities then that works they dont need to this attitude youre stewing up in regards to his mother serves nothing except to make you miserable if you need boundaries on the amount of time you spend with her make those put the rest of this aside
no youre not

that would have triggered me too

totally different if hes asked during the next call or meetup hey saw the post what ya get up too but the 30 mins delay with a direct accusatory question thatd be a big old nope from me 

is the fight now that hes saying he deserves to know and you should want to tell him or is the fight that hes telling you that youre accusing himjudging him as a bad guy or something

because if its the first you have a very real problem and id run for the hills you just should want to do x for me is a manipulation technique i have a very hard time seeing past if its the second he needs to be told clearly that not every boundary or preference is a personal attack on his character and not to personalize what is a very very healthy standard youre setting about information sharing
this i think its a power and compliance thing in most cases 

ive never had a good experience with a man who demands even selfies there are lots of current full body photos in my profile i used to send one or two but now i just say no and move on
i agree the outcomes in parental behaviour wont change certainly not overnight 

but the outcome for children and the families that actually do exist will change drastically they would be much less likely to be born into situations where they cannot be adequately cared for more men who had no intention to pay would be honest about it and women would be more empowered to choose and plan and a health care guarantee is probably worth more to the average working single american parent than child support 

it wouldnt change the interpersonal issues there will always be a percentage of bad actors but it shifting the financial burden off of individuals especially low income parents  both custodial and noncustodial  is the right thing to do if you actually care about single parents and the kids of single parents
it telling how they dont seem to think its possible to not want the same thing someone else wants for you and still be kind and appreciative 
 
if this man was otherwise kind and respectful of me id find this really sweet even tho i do not want to get married and do not enjoy risotto
ditch the friend who said that hes either dangerous or just dangerously stupid thats just an opinion the way hilter has a few good ideas is just an opinion asshole

cheating is always an act of betrayal you didnt betray your agreements to someone to be exclusive 

if i agree not to get my shoes wet and then someone grabs me and throws me in the pool i didnt break my agreement i was assaulted and thrown in a pool
put the judgement of her and her parents agreements with her and just own your truth

your truth is that youre being crushed under these financial pressures and you cannot see the relationship as its currently operating surviving admit to her you are fantazing about escape and leaving her because youre that unhappy with the situation she may need help and support but you also have needs your needs cannot continue to go completely unmet and have everything be okay 

you are also overwhelmed you cannot stop being overwhelmed just because she is overwhelmed too thats like saying you should learn to fly because she cant walk that isnt how people work there are limits youve already pushed way past your limits youre not going to grow wings because she gets pissed with you

be honest that something has got to change you think a reasonable and plausible shortterm change would be her at least applying for disability so you both as a household can stop going into debt also get a new credit card and disconnect yours from any food delivery apps you need to stop that bleeding people who are in debt need to cook noodles and treat themselves only occasionally to take out if she cannot moderate herself on your dime you need to limit her access to your dime

if nothing at all changes this relationship is going to die it just will just as surely as you cannot fly this cannot continue like this
you tell him pointblank you do not intend to live your life this way and he can begin to behave like an adult partner who actually respects you as a partner too or he will end up behaving like a single separated dad

maybe not tomorrow but someday someday you will leave him over this anyone would that is what happens people leave when they are made responsible for all the household work in addition to their work outside of the home and then punished and manipulated with silence and insults people leave you will leave him eventually that is what will happen if he continues to behave this way

you can send him the basic reading list  you should have asked by emma and she divorced me because i left dishes by the sink by mathew fray  and ask him to read them and think about what youve been saying to him or you can skip all that and get a lawyer and a therapist for yourself because the odds of his recognizing and correcting his behaviour are low not zero but low
gaston being a veteran is pretty supported during his first appearance hes  wearing a military uniform and in the tavern during gaston you can see a portrait of him standing over fallen soldiers disney animators have spoken about a backstory for him that includes time as captain during the 7 years war

oerthwise is totally with you hes a great villain complex and believably motivated not an idiot by any stretch just someone driven to idiocy by toxic beliefs about himself and the world and how it should opperate i dont think its an insult to call him a veteran and that concern is probably why disney left it very subtextual veterans arent universally fantastic human beings any more than doctors or priests are most veterans i know will be the first to admit the service also attracts plenty of assholes including fucked up and powermad
hes a chad who they both somehow simultaneously resent and blame for thier suffering and also believe is the only rightful recipient of womans attention and that any nonchad receiving said attention is a betabux or simp that women use for resources and could never actually care for or be attracted to

its beautiful in its simplicity if you just remember that the incel is always the victim  mostly of women but also of any other men who dont agree with him  and that any man with access to a womens friendship affection or intimacy is either an asshole who will abuse her or a victim of her

there are no happy relationships of any kind between men and women except sometimes one where the woman is kept ignorantinexperienced and functionally in servitude by her male relatives and then by the male they have been assigned to which the incel naturally assumes he would be if only fathers were informed and empowered to place their daughters under the authority of the men they choose
thats why there isnt a very comparable wgtow movement they have book clubs or running clubs or volunteer gigs and regular brunches by and large they arent hating men for not giving them someone they feel they are entitled too they are not constantly yelling into the void thats it im going or im this close to giving up they have given up they are gone
id be really curious to find the article on communication a quick google didnt give me much

it takes a pretty unique human being to be excited to tie themselves onto a rocket and hurdle themselves into an environment as hostile to staying alive as space is there are lots of examples of male astronauts downplaying issues and minimizing risks or just communicating them in a way that didnt convey the situations urgency because so many of them are just made of different stuff when it comes to fear and risk assessment than us normies so youve got a selfselected group of people who perceive things rather differently than the average person and i could see women astronauts experiencing even more pressure to tough it out or take risks but having it called poor communication instead of bravery when they do it

but without the article who even knows
he just taught his son its impossible to have a friendship with women

he told him not to partner with them professionally and not to hire or promote them in the future

its totally possible to give young people advice against bullying or manipulation or onesided friendships without telling your son that women in particular inherently lazy grasping and untrustworthy

and the dude has no idea he didnt actually teach his son boundaries  and left him entirely at the mercy of bullies or users who arent attractive women which is actually the larger risk in a maledominated major  and only trained him up in very specific sort of bigotry that is gonna make it harder for him to date anyone or make productive connections with some classmates
women who can think are dangerous

they reject bigoted assholes who pick losing battles with magic castles and get their own community maimed and beaten by anthropomorphized household objects 

roddlyspecific
not necessarily equal doesnt always mean the same my partner and i have extremely different personal boundaries when it comes to contact with our respective families but there is nothing unfair about the fact that one family is far more involved in our daytoday life than the other those boundaries exist for good reason are actively chosen by the person whose family it is we are making choices about how to manage our other relationships and as partners we respect and abide by one another boundaries like id never call up his mom he wouldnt want his partner to have that sort of relationship with his mom its not a rule on how i behave its his boundary in his relationship and i also honour it as his partner

so no boundaries dont have to be the same and sometimes they shouldnt be rules almost always should be equally applied like banning himself from posting photos of him in a swimsuit or from surfing is obviously inequitably applied he doesnt want to do those things the rule has no real impact on his life but a major disruption to her hobby job and friendships by design
thats because they arent boundaries

they are rules hes making rules where his judgement applies universally and absolutely to her life its a common baitandswitch that isnt restricted to men or romantic relationships but you can certainly find lots of examples just like this one its so normalized a lot of people genuinely do not see the problem with it or recognize these arent boundaries just because you call em that 

if they were boundaries it would be his job to acknowledge they are not compatible as romantic partners he would say this isnt what i can accept and trust is damaged youre a great person but not my person no hard feelings instead hes issuing rules and saying if she will not obey its her job to end the relationship with a sideoffering of if you end the relationship it is because youre a badslutty woman without empathy and respect for my feelings
 dont do your hobby
 dont do your job
 when choosing and maintaining your friendships my standards and judgments apply not yours
 dont post photos of yourself wearing the appropriate clothing everyone wears while doing your hobby or your job
 dont post anything else that i might find uncomfortable or reserved for me definitions of this to vary at my whim
 dont spend too much time with women who will point out the absurdity of the above

the saddest part of this is that is so painfully standard a thousand men a day write out this sort of shit and call it boundaries when they are really just blameshifting and making it the womans job to dump them when they become controlling i hate that my first reaction to the texts was thats all thats not actually that bad it is bad its just commonplace bad 

im glad she called it out specifically as weaponizing therapyspeak because if these were actually personal boundaries he would have been acknowledging they are not the right romantic partners for one another and actually saying so without any of the transparently very hard feelings about it
sounds like you hit the wall in your 30s man

i swear that is what these guys are actually talking about when they discuss the wall its that women in their 30s are discouraged and sick of trying to gently offer the perspective that they are in fact rational human beings and men are also rational human beings who can manage basic household tasks and interpersonal relationships just fine if they tried and have run out of fucks to give with the people who dont know that
ive met very very few feminists who hold as negative demeaning and downright misandrist views of men as mens rights and incels often do

somehow those men think that they and other men are disloyal and animalistic and incapable of reason or discipline when it comes to sexual arousal and nearly any sort of rejection or disappointment in life but are also smarter and less ruled by emotions than women and naturally entitled to leadership and dominance over women

if you and men in general are as brutal simplistic and animalistic as you claim to be when it comes to anything much less when it comes to women you sure as shit do not get to be in charge of them
i mean it is true but its just as true for men men who are considered objectively good looking also get better service better loan terms more promotions etc beauty bias is 100 a thing but it impacts literally everyone 

as individuals we try to be fair and open minded but as a species we are helplessly shallow and we associate good looks with other good qualities like smarts and even honesty we try but we cannot perfectly correct for it
exactly this is a man who would never actually pay market rate for the service hes demanding he wants the illusion of being a big man whose caring for her and attracted her but hes actually just a cheap sake with a saviour complex
youre fixating on this part of this that is not a problem arm touching while standing near is a thing that happens at parties its a weird detail to get hung up on 

and men have told me i dont give off taken vibes when im literally showing them my wedding band so take what the fuckboi says with a grain of salt 

the issue here is her maturity and her ability to maintain boundaries while drunksocializing with others its a very real issue but for that you just need to make a choice about whether or not you believe her when she says she made an error she will not repeat it in her slight defence she does appear to have recognized pretty quickly that she made a mistake and exactly what that mistake was but continuing with her is certainly a gamble
so hes holding you hostage in the relationship by threatening to shift a massive financial burden onto you and run out on his obligations to the lease if you dont agree to date him still

thats abusive and possibly even coercive rape if he expects you to continue to have sex with him in this situation you dont want to be in this relationship but hes using external money and legal threats to keep you in it 

youre not safe with this person

you should call a domestic abuse hotline in your area and ask for help leaving a relationship where you are not safe
you say this isnt a competition and youre not a prize never ever speak to me again

and block him everywhere
im not saying i have the answers to the financial situation i really dont you may need local legal advice or even financial advice on how to access safe loans

but you need to realize that your plan right now is to be miserable and try to fake the relationship until the lease is up thats a really bad plan that doesnt keep you safe and it probably wont work even if you try
i get it i really do but you need to consider the idea of good debt and make a plan to escape it cost me a bit more than that to leave my ex  probably around 5k when all was said and done and i was lucky to have just enough saved at the time  but while it stung it and it was disappointing it was money properly spent on my safety and sanity 

maybe it isnt for you but trying to make yourself trust him isnt actually a solution at all 

and moving is probably cheaper in the long wrong than getting syphilis or herpes would be
i understand why that lease is a pressure on you but its a bad reason to stay in a relationship that is unsafe  and you cant just magically will yourself into trusting someone you shouldnt just because its really expensive not too

youre gonna have to have a bigger look at your options
its not a requirement if you stay

what youve actually taught him is the requirement is him listening to you whine about it

it is hard but you should be clear that you need some space and time and that you expect him to leave with his family when they go
why would you want to move past this 

why do you believe he wont do the same thing again and again he tried to hire a sexworker and each time hes caught hes tried to cover his tracks and lie to you about it

why do you think you should trust him has he magically transformed into a new person was he possessed by a demon or alien at the time did he experience a knock on the head that fundamentally changed his character 

why do you think he will behave differently in the future why do you think he wont just work harder at not getting caught trust issues do not get resolved if you dont have a realistic answer to that question
i got a friend who said once im not the prize but im a 10 bonus to all happiness stats with a 12 to happy pets and yummy food as long as you keep me in good repair
eh and most of them wouldnt actually anyways or not for long

theyd find out exactly what most women do unfilling sex with people you dont like much isnt all the interesting you can look honestly at gay guys and see this sure a lot of them go through a phase where they behave that way but for most it doesnt actually last all that long because work and friends and pissing away the time on smaller enjoyments is pretty solid
i think you dont realize you keep shifting and offering nitpicking definitions for what the words mean in order to justify your negative feelings and the thing you want to do

thats the trap that is why asking a question with the there is only one acceptable answer attitude is a trap that is gonna keep you miserable and i said it all hinges on him immediately and correctly understand what each of the words means to you in that particular moment and context i sincerely hope your bf realizes what game you are playing and passes your test but it is a game and its not the best way to make yourself feel secure or for you and your partner to actually understand one another

if you actually wanted to understand one another youd start by sharing where youre head is at and what errors you think youre making inside your own brain youd talk about what words mean and what you both think acceptable friendships look like before you issued a vocab quiz thats how you share what you are struggling with and build actual understanding 

finally no i accept that my partner may still be attracted to people hes friends with and still be able to be friends hes not gonna slip and fall into them dick first just cause he thinks they are cute and if he does need to draw boundaries with someone i trust he will its not nearly as hard as youre making out to be
no youre racing slow your roll

your next conversation with your therapist should be about discussing your diagnosis and treatment with your new partner if and when youre ready to disclose

and to simply ask your therapist if they are even open to speaking with you both as a pair  some therapists will not invite others into ongoing individual therapy

but youre not there yet and that is a huge ask slow the fuck down
it is a valid boundary i said explicitly above it was and that you shouldnt date if you dont get what you need boundaries can be valid while also being immature or unkind or unclear or even petty

but his words here still arent the core problem your brain is

i know you dont like that advice but there is no other reasonable advice here for you youre fixating on his words the same way youre fixating on her pictures that is not healthy and it means this probably doesnt get fixed

you can pick a fight with him over his word choice and maybe that even work out for you  he may realize what it is you need to hear to manage your irrationality  but you are choosing ongoing misery until you address the your brain problems
thats deeply immature attitude towards attraction id be sad for my partner if he never felt attracted to anyone else hes not with me because no one else on the planet is hot to him that is silly 

youre gonna have some rough going if your expectations are that absolute and you refuse to share what those expectations are until after you issue your test questions 

but youre right in the end if he wont immediately give you the answer youre looking for you two shouldnt be dating if he was my guy friend describing this situation the way you are id tell him to run because this woman isnt taking any accountability is testing you and is gonna make you both miserable
you just defined a trap youre setting him a traptest wheee if he doesnt understand your exact meaning and the answer youre looking for this gets worse inside your own head

hope it works out for you not what id do  bringing up a feeling youre having can and should be an entirely different than making it your partners job to fix that feeling
then why not just accept that he did mean that like that is a rational interpretation way more rational than the interpretation youre choosing the spin yourself up into a snit about also realize that other people can be attractive without being a threat if you dont know that you will always be miserable in most relationships

youre setting up a situation where if your partner misspeaks if he isnt perfect if he doesnt read your needsexpectations correctly immediately and doesnt give you exactly what you need youre probably gonna dive off the deep end

im not saying dont talk to him but do recognize this isnt on him to address and solve its on you if you do ask him for support you should be very very clear about what that support looks and sounds like dont set a test for him to fail ask for very clear assistance with your problem
yup i can have a peaceful and amazing time once i have sufficiently terrorized you into silent acquiescence hard pass
my bf is 5 inches taller than me and honestly thats already a stretch literally

just thinking of dating a 7 foot guy makes my neck hurt
i would strongly suggest you manage this shit yourself and stop comparing yourself to other women 

there is nothing he says to explain this that isnt going to further trigger you because youre not having a rational response to his words to begin with his words arent the core problem here you were gonna find something to put these anxieties on sooner or later and youll do it again if you dont stop yourself 

this overthinking is a personal issue you need to manage this woman is not any sort of threat to you shes barely present in his life right now if you try to make it your bfs job to manage these feelings for you youll probably just end up feeding the beast 

it doesnt mean you cannot share with him what youre going through but its not his job to fix this one is on you
that is what confuses me too

but then you just have to remember that op is the victim and everyone else who seems to be just living their own lives is actually out to get him and their supposedly personal choices are actually directed attacks against op
its an incel term for making moneycareer success and becoming a beta provider to a women who will certainly cheat with a genetically superior chad because women are incapable of either loyalty or of being genuinely sexually attracted to men under six feet in their narrative anyways

its strange how incelsredpilled both hate betas and woman for this but also think its terrible whenever this doesnt seem to be the case op appears to believe its wrong for the brothers wife to allow him to breed and pass on his inferior read slightly below average height genetics he cannot even imagine that their marriage might be the exception to his miserable rules
its a phrase they pull out when met with a woman with utterly reasonable standards and expectations

oh you expect me not to loose my ever loving shit like a toddler when you dont immediately submit to my authority what do you think you are some kind of prize
im sorry you had such a shitty date and a fake friend

there isnt much to learn here sometimes you just bump into a real piece of shit person

what you need to remember in the future is no is not a negotiation you said no to this date you were attracted but you knew on some level that is where this needed to stop you need to make sure youre standing up for those instincts youre feeling regret now for not standing up for yourself earlier and that is understandable but let it go forgive yourself and just let it go no one is perfect youre just a decent sane person who got caught out for a little while by someone who wasnt it happens

resist the urge to confront him hes not connected to reality so nothing you say will do anything but further frustrate you you wont get your power back that way you maintain your power by never ever speaking with him again his delusions about why the friendship is over are not a problem you can solve for him but on some level he likely knows what he did enough people have told him
a lot of words for how dare someone else be happy how can i make him miserable like me
youre describing abuse

not just immaturity or inexperience abuse 

he has no right to punish you and hes dangerously unhinged id be deeply concerned when he decides he needs a more effective punishment

this guy isnt just insecure he wields his own unhappiness like a weapon against you hes not gonna stop you need to get out of his line of fire

he needs help but more importantly you need to be safely away from him
he keeps on talking about confronting the other guy but says he has no issue with his wife that is idiotic that is toxic dramaseeking machismo bullshit 

i never said throw away his marriage i said dont be a fucking idiot and talk to your damn wife
thats just dating

youll never know it doesnt mean you did anything wrong it just means she knew and she didnt want to waste your time or hers 

be like her if youre not feeling it do exactly what she did
this sounds less like your flaws and more like him projecting his limitations and struggles 

be wary of men who jump to youre just being emotional when you have valid concerns or issues with their behaviour its a silencing tactic

you wont be able to change his perspective if he finds it convenient to think this of you and not have to listen
generally speaking human beings dont like change 

give yourself a break and let it play out youll get used to it and shes likely to keep evolving it anyways relax
its been a few months you can just opt out 

obnoxious isnt a word that should be coming to mind this isnt the guy for you just tell him it isnt working because its not 

wouldnt be the guy for me either although i can sympathize with the grief and anger of leaving your faith i couldnt be with someone who was still in the rage stage

hes probably right these feelings are not relatable for you and you cant understand them youre right its unpleasant behaviour and you cant tolerate it
id set my hair on fire before id let my partner take our dog someplace unsafe

if he struggles setting boundaries with his mom that means you need to be brutally clear about your boundaries with him
if once the grades are in you are just peers and have no reason to believe youll ever be anything but peers again academically then go for it

after the grades are inputted

its unlikely the school has any policies against this but you might want to check into how the exact policies are written and whether your role as an instructor means you follow different rules than in your role as a doctoral student
of course you can say no of course you should be clear about your comfort and how you will be choosing to interact with others 

he gets to be disappointed with your rejection of his preferred communication tool but its just that a tool saying its the only mandatory one you must use to have a conversation with another person isnt a boundary its a rule so disappointed is all he gets he doesnt get to review the paperwork he gets to decide what his comfort level is with you as a partner and your relationship agreement with him micromanaging your relationship agreements and even conversations with other partners is not healthy 

and that is a completely separate issue from your relationship together

dont get the two confused and intermingled when he is not present you will establish consent between you and another party in the way that works for you and that other party when he is involved he does get to make those sorts of boundaries for himself and you can choose to engage or not with him 

frankly though id have some serious concerns about opening up to any degree with someone with these requirements even inside a consensual relationship starting with their ability to handle the stress and risks associated with nonmonogamy 

you may get better help over at rnonmonogamy
and yet you keep dropping the dog off someplace where you know what to expect

the second time it happens its on you not them 

youre responsible for your pet dont leave it with people who dont provide adequate care not complicated
you need to pay for a dog sitter

this entire issue arose because you feel entitled to free dog sitting

its not that complicated and its not taking an l its the cost of having a dog and taking a vacation the inlaws are doing you a favour if you dont like how they do it then find someone else or pay someone else

if they cannot be trusted during visits keep the dog on a leash inside their home or pay for a sitter during your visits with them i had to do that for years because my dog has serious allergies and my wellmeaning grampa had dementia when grampa was awake the dog was on a leashbeing closely supervised because grampa would feed him whatever was in reach and couldnt understand why not to do that

the dogs health in your responsibility stop leaving the dog with people who harm them just because it saves you a few bucks
no rent control no dice

i dont understand how anyone can accept this risk in life i really dont
your constant attempts to prove yourself worthy are a pretty damn good deal for him

and are you saying he cheated on his previous partners

regardless a break is almost always a slowmotion breakup its not a tool or a threat its just a cowards last ditch effort to not have to break up 

youve already seen that hes not going to put the effort in why do you imagine a break would change anything

sweetie wake up this man isnt offering you a relationship you can feel secure in and its very unlikely anything you do will change that its not in your power
yes 

men are less likely to seek child support or alimony from women even when they are entitled to it  but when they do they get it oddly they often average much more in alimony because men so rarely seek it at all unless the woman is an extremely high earner 

anyways that appears to be a social pressure and selfperception thing among men not a deliberate outcome of the system the courts arent conspiring against men  quite the opposite just like with custody and child support many men are disinclined to pursue what they view as a feminine entitlement
your bf needs to contact a family lawyer thats all thats the first step and probably the next few steps they all have to do with a family lawyer

this mother isnt someone he should be engaging with in a personal level right now whatever is done it all needs to be done with legal advice he is studying for the bar he knows this
almost almost as if rich men didnt want to be taxed sufficiently to feed and educate the children that poor men didnt want to or couldnt afford to parent and somehow convinced those poor men it was all the womens fault that the children existed cost money and cost times that meant thier primary custodial parent couldnt make a living wage even when permitted to and that the legal system built up almost entirely by affluent men determined that individual men should pay personally to the parent who did do the work so the taxpayer aka said affluent men didnt have to pay
then youre an idiot 

if you dont like her boundaries say so trying to control him is gonna make everyone else invoked know that youre an idiot

if you trust your wife and are accepting of her ability to manage this friendship as you should be then butt out
its also really strange in the canon because snape is very fully and consciously accepting the consequences and more of his past mistakes actually one of the very very few adultscharacters who are held accountable for their choices 

ok im overthinking this
you know youre not at fault 

he made his own choices and then blamed you for his own choices 

he misled you and then he blamed you for believing his lies 

you understand that is what happened 

it wasnt your job to read his mind better it was his job to be honest with you and being honest with you should have included being honest about his need to budget he dug himself this hole dont let him throw you into it 

i understand why that was hurtful to read but the real question is what about now does he realize he was completely wrong does he recognize that of course youre hurt and scared by those terrible lies he put online is he committed to be honest with you and controlling his spending does he still think he has anyone to blame for his own choices besides himself can he apologize for the position he put you in when he was too much of a resentful coward to take responsibility for his own actions 

he is going to have to show you that his feelings have truly changed and that he understands what he did wrong he is going to have to understand that he deeply and profoundly damaged your trust in him  and that you are right and reasonable to doubt him and be hurt by him 

he doesnt get to blame you now for feeling badly or scared by something he did wrong in the past that would make anyone feel badly and scared youre a human being a human being would be frightened and hurt by what he did its valid and he is going to have to spend a long time showing you evidence that he has changed his mind and understands what actually happened here and how much he betrayed you by lying to you and blaming you for believing his lies
im not sure what advice youre looking for a reasonable person is going to read what you wrote and say this man is confused about respectful boundaries and maybe not a great fwb for you to have since he wants more commitment or illusion of commitment from you than he ever intends to offer anyone 

you seem unhappy with this response but its a perfectly rational one

beyond that we cant read his mind any better than you can

if you have concerns firstly youre going to have do is figure out what your concerns actually are and then ask him to address them
supporting your son here means validating his own concerns and empathizing with the difficult position he finds himself in

it doesnt mean inserting yourself in the situation with her or her family

advise your son he is no immediate legal danger he is having a tough relationship issue where hes gonna need to stand up for his own timelines and beliefs and comfort your job as a parent is to be patient and empowering while he does that work it might take him a while but hell hes got a while to figure it out no one is giving him a lease or marriage license for a while 

back off dont overreact and blow this out of proportion there is no immediate danger if your son actually wants this relationship to continue and be longterm hes gonna have to figure out how to speak up on this tell him your trust him that he will speak up for himself and his own needs and that youre here to support him

you may not like her parents but they were right this on the two of them to figure out your job is to guide and support him right now not pick a fight with a pushy 10thgrade girlfriend for him
a rational human being operating in the world has to make some assumptions

if you really dont know what yours are youre not gonna have an easy time having any further conversations with him about this

maybe dont keep such an open mind that your brain falls right out whatever his reasons him telling you he doesnt like to share and to not date were not appropriate or respectful or even internally consistent things for him to say 

thats not a stable or sensible adult expressing a wellthoughtout position on casual sex thats a guy who doesnt know what he actually wants projecting it onto his fwb
yes of course nofault divorces benefit both genders it prevents a lot of sucides as well and an early argument for nofault divorces actually came from men who wanted to remarry quickly after a previous wife walked away from them rather than having to wait several years to prove abandonment 

i know i say this over and over again but this whole narrative from the right about women initiate divorce cause they are ficklelazyout to get rich really just points out that a miserable marriage is still a good deal for a lot of men these men are receiving net benefits from remaining married even while unhappy they coast food probably shows up interpersonal needs get met kids or pets or homes are more likely to be cared for there is a lot less work for most men when they live with a woman the vast vast majority of women who divorce are choosing financial hardship over a partnership with that man because they are not receiving enough of those other benefits to make staying worth it the walkaway wife isnt fickle shes making a reasonable choice because shes not benefiting from the unhappy partnership in the way the man is involved frequently still is
its means youre sleeping with a 30yearold man who doesnt actually know what he wants and says kind of shitty and controlling things to you because he hasnt handled his own shit

it means hes not emotionally stable and hasnt really thought through what the fuck hes doing and you should reconsider if he is a good casual sexual partner

keep dating others be clear with this fwb that youre not exclusive with him sexually or otherwise dont offer any more information about your dating life to your fwb if he cannot handle in ways that are kind and respectful

i have a lot of experience with fwb and casual relationships and frankly i wouldnt have a fwb agreement with a guy who was being a little shit about the fact i dated others of course im dating others thats the explicit agreement we have as fwbs unless we had said we are exclusive in some ways were not

if he doesnt like it its his job to walk away from what doesnt work for him he doesnt get to just shit on you and tell you dont date  when hes having some icky feels about the situation hes agreed too and has chosen for himself

the one thing you dont do is assume this means he wants to build a deeper committed relationship with you he has pretty clearly said he is not offering that he almost certainly doesnt want to offer you more than he is he just wants to pressure you into giving him more than hed offer in return dont let him play you and dont play yourself
you talk to your wife

not to him never to him everything besides talking to your wife will only make you look like an asshole andor a fool 

dont have a lot of context here but if im honest with you the fact he is was inquiring about your anniversary trip would be a green flag in my book that this is a genuine friendship when people are up to shady shit they ignore anything even remotely positive in the persons relationship one of the ways i know a guy is actually my friend is if he acknowledges im in a relationship unprompted and says nice things about my male partner if tries to pretend my bf doesnt exist or is only interested in the negative thats the problem 

regardless hes not the problem here your wife is you need to speak with her about your discomfort and needed boundaries the person who ought to have mentioned this friendship to you was your wife not him she was the one who left this unbeknownst
no he doesnt value these things

double no hes got you to do them 

you can hold yourself responsible for how youve played into the dynamic but you didnt create it he and his parents likely created it you were temporarily entrapped by it its up to you if you stay trapped
its almost like there is a centuries old narrative of men being told they are charming and funny when they are incompetent and unkind and women being met with disgust demands to better or told they deserve what they got when they do something stupid

funny is largely recognizing patterns if you dont think any women are funny that tells me about the narrowness of your life not about women
the fact there is more money between the two legally responsible parents means the child is entitled to more 

youre making the mistake of framing this as mom was doing fine on less so shes wrong to ask for more when its child support isnt her entitlement but the childs id argue a custodial parent who doesnt advocate for their minor childs rights is probably doing that child a disservice

and seriously what do you think an acceptable standard is because raising a minor child out of poverty in 2023 costs at least 10k a year and you just represented the average noncustodial parent as paying a third of that
the things hes on is describing how hes trained the algorithm to hold his own attention and from that he can see men who also engage with social media that way 

is it many menwomen sure all menwomen no not by a long shot youre talking about individually curated online attention marketplaces for profit and calling it all the time and natural

it would be extremely easy to retrain his ig or fb to show him people cooking or parenting super easy so much content
there are no men on the bench or writing child support legislation at all s

the crazy part is a sensible person who thinks the burden is applied unfairly might argue for more daycare spots so single mothers can return to the workforce and better after school programs and free school lunches could argue that custodial parents should be compensated for the important labour of raising children instead of that cost being shifted onto a biological parent who doesnt wish to do that work thatd be a rational genderneutral argument that one might make if one actually cared about the family and mens rights to not pay for kids they dont wanna pay for 

but almost never hear that argument because that argument would also benefit women and children like they deserve to survive or something
direct result of women not being slaves or household appliances
especially when half the instructions are be purposefully unkind and demeaning
you walk away from someone who isnt offering you a relationship you can feel secure and appreciated in 

this is different then someone struggling with low sexual interest or a dip in libido or any other sort of situation that reduces sexual interest  generally  that you can work though  but hes already told you its personal so of course your trust and selfesteem is wounded itll start to heal when you stop accepting crumbs of affection from someone who told you straight up they dont want you
you dont like this person you dont feel respected and think its time to stop dating them so dont date them anymore 

is there some gaslighting or other abuse here maybe doesnt actually matter youre done you get to be done youre allowed to break up with someone even if they arent abusing you
its time to leave and to leave safely

even if this wasnt abusive  and it is  you should still end a relationship once youre frightened 

given there has been pretend choking here which is a major risk factor for seriously escalating violence i wouldnt even recommend you break up in person a phone call or even text is totally acceptable when you fear for your safety dont try to explain why  its not a debate or a discussion just say its not working and that you want to end contact 

this is not a person you should ever be alone in a room with again they are not safe
i suspect youre fixating on the dogs so you dont have to do the unpleasant work of actually dealing with a break up

regardless you know this is crazy get a grip and do what you need to do
there is nothing you can do you cannot debate with someone who has decided youre a liar to begin with 

this is entirely on your bf he needs to be prepared to tell his father what comments are unacceptable and to have clear boundaries if your bf still lives with his father that will be very difficult but there is nothing else

dont pick a fight youve already lost you cant change what his father thinks but your bf can make it clear what is not acceptable to say out loud
youre right that doesnt sound rational or mentally healthy 

pets can make it harder or sadder but they shouldnt make doing the right thing impossible there is probably more going on here than being an animal lover talk to a therapist if you cant sort it out on your own if animal services needs to be involved call them too
you move on you do what it takes to let go of any illusions about the future 

this guy wasnt offering you anything and told you straight up he probably never would

dont kid yourself its just a break up its sucks but let it be a break up
it doesnt matter what you believe honestly

if michelle needs to reevaluate or end her friendships with you or your wife because youve kept in contact with steve michelle can do that regardless of abuse that is valid that is a thing she gets to choose for herself 

michelle phrased this badly because the conversation you need to have is about boundaries if michelle truly needs a boundary of steve not being in her life at all  even as a friends of a friend  then she needs to tell you what that means for her friendship with the two of you that youve decided to maintain some level of friendship 

its perfectly fair for michelle to ask for what she feels she sincerely needs 

if youre not willing to end contact with steve be honest about it and find out if there is any space for different boundaries for example promising to never speak about her with steve  this is the boundary i accepted with some friends who kept contact with my ex but in the end if this is a dealbreaker for her shes entitled to break the deal
just tell him the truth he hurt your feelings he said he was going to make time to be with you and he didnt then he didnt even bring it up for days leaving you very reasonably feeling rejected and worse forgotten

adults who game have to moderate themselves and communicate honestly their gaming time and expectations its not sexy to have to be someones mommy and tell them its time to stop and its probably not sexy to feel you need to beg or demand his attention either 

so tell him he hurt you and dont let him bs you out of it being hurt is reasonable and its a problem tell him you expect better from him and that being really into it isnt a good excuse for being that hurtful and dismissive if he doesnt want to stop then the very least he needs to be self aware enough to say that you still sometimes have to acknowledge and consider your partner while gaming and its not that hard once you respect that fact of being in relationships
you dated someone for a few months and you two ran into a dealbreaker so the deal broke

you didnt do anything terrible here  you recognized your limits and left  but youre not describing abuse either youre describing someone you shouldnt date because they have requirements of you that you will not meet doesnt even really matter if this requirements were reasonable ones or not even if they were totally reasonable you could still say no 

it sucks it normal to feel like shit after a breakup but its just a breakup let it be a breakup and dont try to round it up needlessly to a trauma it probably doesnt need to be that

im general though you need to stop trying to exercise so much control over other people especially while youre drunk
i understand i really do the friend i did loose years ago over this i actually didnt loose because of the affair itself i drew my boundaries  like above when it came to discussing him and hoped for the best but she just kept on shitting on the other woman  his fianc is so controlling shes so mean i gotta send you this photo of what she was wearing that was actually what broke me and the boundary she refused to honour i know it wont be the general tone here but at the time could accept the fact she was cheating and it was gonna end poorly for everyone not sure id accept it now but at 22 i did it was the need to rip down the other woman that ended our friendship for good
i know its hard to cut off a friend  i had to end it with a very dear one over similar behaviour

i think if youre not ready to end it that first thing you say is im not your source of support on this dont speak to me about it im not into that drama and i cannot help you on this one i will not hold your hand through it if you bring it up again the only thing im going troll you is stop stop doing it stop talking to me about it

i had one friend mess up this way for a few weeks and that seemed to work best no debate just absolute if you do this you do it 100 alone no one is gonna debate you or validate you and if you keep on doing it you might meet with escalating boundaries in this friendship
im 100 with you but i take the opposite approach now

i tell them i dont think that question is appropriate or productive but that i will tell them then i tell them if it ever comes out of their mouth in the negative as an insult or a dig its an automatic dealbreaker i will walk i will walk out in the middle of their parents 40th anniversary dinner if they even joke about it 

and then i do walk did it at least twice to otherwise decentseeming guys and all that internalized bs in my own head started to melt away when i just decided i wouldnt allow them in my life anymore no matter how many other boxes they checked 

i like my sex life i had mostly lovely partners and fun experiences i would prefer to date a man who i can discuss that with at least a little bit if hes not that kind of man the quicker i smoke him out the better so i hand him a gun loaded with bullets that cannot hurt me any longer and i see if hes the sort to try to take aim 

you are absolutely a hero keep yourself safe and get rid of anyone who doesnt respect and appreciate the whole you however you do it just keep doing that im convinced its the only way to retrain your brain
no never again i would never again stand the room with someone who spoke to me that way for any reason 

youre not overeacting this is abuse it was not an accident it will not be an accident next time

this is not within normal or acceptable behavior hes meanspirited this is not the first or only time youve been concerned he has contempt for you it was just the first time you realized his contempt would become physical  

the other people who have had this problem with him arent around either get out and stay out the only person you should have an contact with in the future is his coparent if she needs help building a case to protect the minor child from him
first wave hey were human

second wave dudes we meant fully human

third wave all of us were all fucking human how is this still a a thing
hope she gets picked by someone who actually shares her values

so shell have to quit her attention seeking opinionated moneymaking ways and focus on her home and children sucks for her kids but net win for the world
dont date someone who thinks you are selling sex to a stranger for 50 bucks a month 

look i wouldnt feel comfortable accepting on an ongoing gift like this so i would sympathize with your bf if he was just saying its weird and seems wrong  but your bfs issue is clearly that he thinks you owe this guy something in exchange and that is dumb and insulting
no healthy parents recognize how central and important friendships are to teenagers and young adults and dont see their childrens personal lives as a competition or threat 

the way youre answering here im a bit surprised your daughter still speaks to you at all  if you dont do some serious reevaluation once her brother is out of the house i doubt youll hear much at all from her youre not describing yourself bringing anything to her life but obligation and disrespect
youre being a passive aggressive judgmental asshat 

i wouldnt want to talk to my dad either if he was resentful and whining about the fact i had a healthy friendship with my sibling in her shoes id also be establishing distance from your toxic behaviour and unspoken expectations 

the phone does work both ways so do invitations there is also this magical thing adults do in their relationships with other adults called scheduling we do it because we respect one anothers time and independence and understand that life gets busy and we need to make plans if we want to connect 

instead of modelling to your adult daughter transparent and respectful communication between fellow adult family members your passive aggressively issuing her tests for her fail and holding her to standards youre magically exempt from 

she may not be perfect but your the one who needs to grow up shes not your buddy and she doesnt exist to emotionally service you establishing some distance is an age appropriate behaviour and instead of celebrating that and asking for what you value and need form her your shoving her further away
i can only imagine it totally sucks but its also transparently not about you its about your cousin deciding this was easier than the truth and some people deciding to go along with her they are trying to make you a sacrificial lamb to her shitty marriage and familial harmony make them know there is a cost for abusing you this is not their easy way out of the mess this man made 

the cost is youre going to say no the cheater cheats and if youre gonna treat me like a homewreaker than im going to have nothing to do with you because i dont let people who hate me and excuse abusive creeps like him to have access to me
whats so tough about just accepting and respecting her preferences why does this need to be a thing much less a thing to take personally

shes not closeted shes not hiding you or rejecting you she just clearly ask for not that 

my partner doesnt like to be called babe in front of his family i didnt ask for insight into that i just stopped calling him babe in that context easy
thats how id word it it is tough to do and no one is born knowing how so give yourself a break no matter how perfectly you do it he may still choose to react badly you cant control that so dont try 

just remember its not a debate its not a negotiation its not a fight youre telling him the sky is blue after you do that wish him well and block him everywhere you owe him nothing more than a clear final no dont even owe him that really but its a way for you to remove further excuses for any bad behaviour from him
you werent overacting at all 

that was physical abuse and it was escalating physical abuse

im sorry you went through that good on you for getting out safely and ending all contact 

if she ever had keys change your locks ignore all contact from her document any bad behavior abusers often give you a bit of a bumpy ride postbreak up stick it out and stay staff
benefit of the doubt for 8 years of not knowing sure maybe it would be a carelessness that would concern me but i could get past that

but op would be a damn fool to remove the deadline if she has any desire for marriage andor children with this man in the future 

it was a legitimate dealbreaker for her with a perfectly reasonable timeline for him to take some sort of action including just the action of initiating the deeper conversation youre suggesting instead of making it constantly her job and her fault for bringing up what he has been told clearly is a dealbreaker level problem for op 

he has done nothing in six months those six months have murdered the benefit of the doubt argument op was honest about the dealbreaker and hes watching the clock tick down this deal is probably gonna break
you cant someone can choose not to be your friend when you dont want to date them and they usually will choose that its healthy

also you shouldnt this isnt a friendly person he has made it very clear repeatedly that he is refusing to be your friend 

youre not going to break him hes a bully and an asshole he knows you dont want to be mean because most people dont want to be mean and hes weaponizing that against you this person isnt a friend worth having 

be pissed with him that is the healthy and reasonable reaction to someone trying to bully you and not giving a shit about how you actually feel and who is very mean to you because they know youre a decent person who doesnt want to mean right back

tell him that you two clearly want very different things from one another and since that is only going to cause conflict and hurt feelings youre cutting off all contact with him
40 year olds dont date people in their 20s because they prioritize equity and mutual respect he didnt pick you because he thought hed really have to respect you as an equal not at 24

this isnt just a friend you know it he knows it he doesnt care youre both being played hes getting what he wants from both of you even if he truly doesnt want to fuck her hes enjoying her girlfriendlike level of service and support its been over a year hes not gonna stop

edit this guy recently told you hes not attracted you straight up that isnt how a 40yearold person should be dealing with a dip in sexual arousal at 40 he either knows better than to handle it that way or knows he doesnt have to do better with you and that he benefits from you feeling insecure and unwanted in the relationship these are bullshit games hes playing that woman his own age would be far far more likely to see through quickly and not waste time on
way to go doing this calmly without missing a beat is such an invaluable skill
ha telling on himself a bit eh

one my coworkers said the same thing about my zoom he assumed i must have a delay cause i wasnt letting him jump in i was presenting and the executive had just directed us to hold questions until the end but whatever you need to tell yourself kiddo
i wished theyd actually gtow already

the women i know when went their own way and decided against any further dating or relationship with men seem to have more interesting things to talk about
no clearly your deadline is going to be ignored 

that is just a reasonable assumption at this point 

you told your bf what you very reasonably required him to do to show you that he prioritized your shared future he hasnt done it 

and lets be honest if he refiles it a day before your deadline just to keep you on the hook that isnt really in the spirit of what youve asked of him thats not forward movement thats minimal compliance thats him saying if youre gonna force me to do this ill do it as badly and lazily as possible to just to keep getting what i want from you

tell him youre giving up hope that he will address your dealbreaker and are beginning to look at what breaking the deal will look like for you since you cannot continue to move forward with a man who is married to someone else
its impossible to make a flat map of the whole spherical world accurate 

most world maps you look at are still full of bias and hugely inaccurate mercators map is still the visual standard for laymans use and its warped as hell but it did its job in the past which was to allow ships to maintain a consistent heading 

maps are really just stories told from one perspective or one approach to representing a huge sphere on a flat plan in the way we think of accuracy in 2023 they just arent accurate so basically id say most old maps were about as accurate as a person who knew how to interpret that particular maps perspective and limitations was

a huge part of why global navigation satellite systems are more accurate is because they dont rely on representing the world as if it were flat
do nothing reach out to no one  except a family lawyer and a therapist

the relationship is over the only contact you should have right now is with someone who can support and advise you on how to ensure his legal obligations to the child are met and how to protect yourself from any ongoing abuse or manipulation

its tough i know but you need to exercise complete selfcontrol and even when he reaches back out and once you stop he will try to reengage because he cannot abuse you if you actually end contact firmly he can only effectively keep on abusing and manipulating you as long as youre in contact with him you need to stand your ground and refuse to speak to him except over email or text and only about the pregnancychild ignore any contact that is not specifically about absolutely necessary things like leases or legal issues do not pick up the phone do not open the door do not meet with him all conversations now happen on the record and you dont instigate any contact unless your lawyer advises you too
im sorry to say this but if your family is willing to blame the teenage cousin instead of holding the married father responsible there is nothing you can do to convince them they have made their choice and it has nothing to do with you really

people who want to blame the other woman when a man behaves like a creep and a cheater they just will  evidence be damned and those texts they are dead and gone you have nothing except basic reality on your side and some people dont like reality

your cousin has made up a vicious lie about your to protect herself from the consequences of her remaining with a man who treated her reprehensibly

there is little you can do except be clear with anyone who asks that you refuse to be blamed for something nasty that someone else did to you and remind them that it is well known that he cheats its absurd basically insane to blame you for the crimes everyone knows he regularly commits you know who you are hold your head high and be clear about what happened youre glad they are happy but youre not to blame for him having been a creep towards you or towards any of the other women hes tried or succeeded in cheating on her with 

decline to speak to your cousin or her husband block any contact they try to make they are dead to you if they are going to make up stories to avoid accountability
no she didnt owe it to him she wasnt required

but she brought it up  she opened up the topic of this person and then she misled him about the situation that wasnt okay
he sounds like a wellintentioned but immatureinexperienced boss

asking her to prioritize the retreat is totally normal as is her pushing back and saying no 

donuts are standard expressing support for an employee who is putting in extra time is an important thing for a new boss including understanding why their workload is requiring extra time 

i wouldnt be concerned your wife is a working adult this is probably not her first or last new boss experience you need to take a look inside and ask where these feelings in you are coming from because they arent rationally based on the information youve shared here
the relationship shouldnt be salvaged if he doesnt end it  she should

gfs made an understandable human mistake in not disclosing and outing herself when she first brought up the fact she didnt want to contact this person  a totally breakupworthy mistake if op chooses that and i am 100 in support of him ending this relationship  but that what her second mistake

her first mistake was dating a person who she couldnt trust with this reality about herself maybe she wasnt ready to trust anyone but nevertheless that first mistake is the one that is really costing her dearly right now
shes got the appointment on the books for next week that is the important thing

i think the best thing you can do in the meantime is just focus on managing you may also what shes hoping will be the shortterm outcome from her first appointment or even if she feels shes able to come back from that appointment with one or two next steps

dont try to come to any big conclusions right now shes in acute crisis and probably not in a good place for building a workable plan and youre not the authority let the doctor do what doctors are supposed to do and ask your wife to include you in any decisions or advice on the next step she gains there as long as shes able to function see yourself as an assistant a collaborator not a leader she needs to be leading when it comes to managing this trigger and with the advice of her care team

patience i know its hard but patience is probably your best tool for the next few weeks while your wife kicks her advanced support team into gear make sure youre also taking moments to care for yourself and decompress but recognize that youre not really in control or in charge of the next steps and its probably best you not try to exert any control or make any big asks until there is a basic treatment plan in place
a 21yearold feeling frightened to out themselves about a dramatic high school samesex situationship is pretty understandable even if its an error to withhold from your bf of a few months

gf made mistakes but that doesnt justify all of ops reactions here or how extreme they are hes trying to round this up to cheating on the basis of her being transparent that she doesnt want to have further contact with this woman

they should break up op lacks the skills to address this error in way that is respectful
its four months just walk away

call this an incompatibility and just end it shes telling you that just how she is is really really unpleasant and unkind i always consider it a dealbreaker when someone says this is just how i am when they are referring to behaving badly dont just keep working away at something when there is this level of hostility and lack of respect itll only be more anger and drama dont give yourself that baggage just optout

agree with her your expectations for how a relationship should look and sound like are completely different and incompatible wish her well break up 

this isnt something to fight for
no being imperfect isnt fault and its not a twist calling it cheating in any way was the massive twist involved here a lot of ops reaction here is accusatory and unwarranted and shows a lack of basic understanding and empathy things he should be expected to show others even if he wants to break up getting up in your own head instead of showing reasonable empathy is a human risk it doesnt make you an inherently terrible person being influenced by homophobia is a human risk it doesnt make you an inherently terrible person

i didnt call op a monster but he is making some serious errors as well your wilful refusal to recognize nuance and embrace empathy with the gfs errors doesnt make gf a monster either
while it was wrong of her to withhold this her reasons are not difficult to understand the situation was strained and probably a bit unclear to her how to describe it she was afraid of homophobia it was a reasonable fear biphobic men are emotionally unsafe and can even be physically dangerous to young bisexual women even women who may not identify as bisexual will recognize the risk of discussing samesex attraction or relationships with men

she handled that fear incorrectly but her fear is not confusing or even irrational and the fact she is framing your negative response as homophonic also isnt crazy even if you dont feel its fair shes not inside your head shes drawing reasonable conclusions about the world and how she expects to be treated in it based on how she sees others like her treated

you can break up with her if you want to and since you want to you probably should

but you are showing a real lack of understanding and empathy here towards an understandable error that she has taken steps to correct and the intensity of your reaction to this error probably does contain some homophobic attitudes and fears

what she did in high school with her female friend wasnt cheating on you by any reasonable definition of the word im not sure why that word even came here or what you mean by implicit understanding but that sure set off some alarm bells that you are framing this inaccurately and in an accusatory way that is not warranted a certain level of privacy about past relationships  especially strained early situtionships   during the first months of dating might be hurtful but rounding it up to this massive betrayal seems really immature and extreme to me

however if this is dealbreaking error for you and im not saying she didnt make an error then break the deal respectfully and cleanly
right they seem to forget their own mothers were probably not born into a nation where they could have a credit card or a mortgage

so yes when i pay my mortgage i think of my nana whose addict husband walked out on her and who paid his bills to keep her home but with the constant unnecessary risk to herself and her children just because she was female 

she was the warrior she shouldnt have had to be
still a big mark against her if her response to shit is frustrating sometimes is to blameshift and manipulate and expect her bf to spend money he doesnt have or drive a car he doesnt own

what op said was unkind and unproductive but it wasnt a misunderstanding

she didnt make plans for herself she expected to be taken care of by someone else she said so explicitly 

when the plans she didnt make ended poorly he accurately understood she was looking to make the situation someone elses fault and was being manipulative insisting someone should offer something they cannot afford just so you could feel good turning it down is grossly immature behaviour and a pretty obvious attempt to further excuse her own totally unjustified anger with him during that call
she was manipulative and she was blameshifting

it may have been unkind or unprotective to say but it was not inaccurate

she made no plans for her own basic needs but pressured her friends to take care of her she got pissed with you because when her further lack of planning made her life difficult you didnt immediately give in to the pressure to take care of her in ways that werent feasible for you being on the phone with her was feasible paying for her cab wasnt and coming and getting her wasnt

its understandable for her to be upset or even hurt it was an unlucky and unpleasant situation one she probably could have managed better but nevertheless bad things do just happen sometimes its a problem when an adult cannot roll with moderately bad things that just happening sometimes its the blameshifting and manipulation that are the problem core problem here and that fact she is still doubledown on her demands that you treat her like your irresponsible 13yearold who got themselves into a scrap and not your 33yearold adult partner who made a series of poor choices for herself 

this is gross behaviour from an adult your language may have been careless but everything about her lack of planning and blameshifting was just gross
two years is already far far too long to be waiting

its understandable while youre still in shock and grieving to hope hell come back but it was never likely its damn near impossible at this point

you need to let go of the delusion and the grief for the marriage that is now long over you seem to be stuck in the space of feeling dumb and hoping for reconciliation and you really should have been able to move past that by now speak to a therapist if youre still plagued by these fantasies and regrets
in any type of relationship there is a possibility of someone starting to treat you a bit like a therapist or pseudopartner instead of just a friend 

there are just people out there who make these sorts of mistakes and push boundaries like this especially straight men who are a bit less likely to be skilled at building these sorts of important friendships with people who arent also the women they are having sex with sadly a lot of our culture encourages men to view the women they are sleeping with as a default emotional support animal 

ive experienced this with a few fwbs and you just have tell them that isnt the kind of friendship youre looking to build with them just like you might have to tell a work friend that youre really happy to grab a drink with them sometimes but dont really want to text daily or all weekend 

if youre not comfortable with the friends part of this with benefits arrangement you can and should speak up and redraw the boundaries tell him you enjoy the connection you have for that for you a fwb doesnt include these sorts of deep soulsearching conversations if that is what he needs he needs to look elsewhere therapy is a good idea

you cannot control how he takes it he probably will be hurt he may end the fwb arrangement thats okay but you can only build relationships that work for the both of you if youre honest about what you want that relationship to look like
nope 

there are respectful transparent ways to try to reconnect but none of them apply here in this context it would be foolish and disrespectful 

shes not a toy to pick for a few weeks and then discard she declined that role last time no reason to believe shes changed her mind
does that mean abortion is ethical if i didnt orgasm 

if yes follow up my exes mother once said she had never orgasmed with his father can i kill him or would that still be murder
this happened to my aunt as well she turned around and paid off her young adults childrens student loans

thier estranged father reached out the older son expecting theyd be so grateful to him they must be willing to reconenct with him now was shocked to find that the money that a court had finally forced him to pay didnt buy his childrens love
the reasoning behind the 6month was that at the time she was a waitress judge said she probably made a lot more than bd on just tips alone 

so he was just randomly accusing her of and immediately acting as if she is guilty of tax fraud thats madness if a judge thinks someone is committing tax fraud how is the correct course of action to arbitrarily deny that persons minor child their entitlements
the system doesnt protect against one or both parents being lousy human beings only criminal ones

my bf has a similar history to yours but what strikes me about his story and the little bit i know about yours is that never missing a payment seems to be assumed to be sufficient for the father

my brother didnt let that be sufficient he decided that because his coparent was just sorta shitty at being a parent  and selfish and neglecting and treated their kid more like a buddy or therapist  that hed shift his entire life to do the important labour that needed doing even though it left him poorer as an individual took a new job that let him be more available after school fought for more custody then fought down his support payments only after he was already paying more for the kid in his own home it sucked and he did it cause being a parent meant more to him than making full payments on time

too often i think male parents dont realize that is a choice albeit a difficult one that may be available to them most mothers i know are very very well aware that they made that choice and put the work of parenting even parenting alone over their personal income potential im really proud of my brother for recognizing the best way for him to meet his kids needs was not merely by paying what the court said he owed but by totally changing his life to be a fully present parent
the problem is money is fungible and a custodial parents life is deeply vitally intermingled with their child youre not keeping separate grocery bills or calculating how much of the space in your apartment the child is the primary user of that would be absurd

there are far too many supportpayers and dodgers who think because they are contributing x amount to the childs care that means the custodial parent should never buy a new pair of shoes for themselves or have a night out  basically that they dont deserve anything but complete and abject poverty

my best friends coparent pulls this shit constantly the child support payments he actually makes only just barely cover the groceries the kid consumes in the month but he flips the hell out if she shows up with her nails done or even with a starbucks cup in her hand no idea what is actually costs to raise a kid but he knows he wants her to be suffering
absolutely guy is looking through tates followers and not realizing those women are a largely bots and b largely there be viewed by the target market they are selling too they arent there because they want to bang tate they are there because they correctly understand that men who follow tate will pay for sex online
about 40 of custodial parents with child support orders get some of that ordered support paid 

this doesnt account for the custodial parents who dont have an order or never seek one and there are lots of good reasons as well as plenty of bad ones to not seek it
its okay to not like sarah 

a person who bragged about not replying to friends would be someone i dont much like either a person who asks for pics and then doesnt post them would make me suspicious and irritable as well 

if my bf had this sort of friend id 100 tell him that i dont like em they might be nice and friendly to him but i dont find them generally nice and positive to others and they say and do some shit i find immature and attentionseeking 

id also tell him if i suspected theyd be willing to fuck him behind my back if they thought for a second hed go for it

i know he wont go for it so thats fine 

and if his opinion is different and he values his friendship with her thats okay by me its his call to make but shes not gonna be my buddy he gets to like her and i get to not like her i dont think highly of her and id hope hell take my judgment under advisement because im not a jealous person but im also not an idiot
right now she doesnt want to create the kind of relationship youd prefer to have you see her living with you but she appears to see herself as living at home and visiting you this doesnt sound like disrespect it sounds like one of you need to end the relationship that isnt working 

you need to face that honestly and ask yourself if this is a relationship you want to be in and end it if its not 

you cannot make someone respect you you cannot force them to live with you and you cannot make them want the same kind of relationship that you want
it was foolish of you both to move in together during such a highstress week for her

however if shes willing to pull the plug after only a week i would suggest you should let her

that isnt the behaviour or someone who was ready to do the hard work of actually living with another person and it is hard work maybe you should have put forth more of an effort as well but she just declared that her solution to the issues youve been having in these few days is she will not be doing that work at all anymore thats just kind of the end of that its difficult to move forward with someone who deals with disagreements or upsets even reasonable ones like that
you drew an appropriate boundary

your bf response started off as unfairly nitpicky and escalated to controlling and flat out aggressive 

he didnt treat you like an equal if he says he knows you are then his behaviour should reflect that it didnt here he failed him having some bad feels or concerns doesnt excuse him treating you that way hes not a toddler hes expected to handle big feelings without behaving like one 

how you bf expressed himself and his feelings was not acceptable he can feel insecure or threatened and even disappointed with your choice without being condescending accusatory or aggressive 

is this the really the first time hes treated you like a naughty foolish child for not obeying him precisely is this the first time hes decided your judgement in your own life is unworthy of any respect is this the first time hes made utterly baseless accusations about your character and intent

your boundary with r was completely appropriate response to rs action and your existing level of friendship the way your bf decided to respond to not getting his way 100 is deeply concerning
if it waits a year hell have nine years of payments instead of 10

hes done nothing wrong but because this is worrying him he should absolutely express that
you need to tell her asap

its not that complicated a conversation it shouldnt be embarrassing but you do need to tell her asap otherwise its a landmine defusing it is the kindest thing you can do for both of you and it makes future honest conversations possible 

she has expressed she thought it was better to wait a year and you can and should respect that

what you need to express is the stress and confusion that agreement has created for you waiting a year to share this piece of information with her is stressing you out

what you say now is simply im feeling really stressed not having this part of the money conversation i have a significant amount of student debt its under control at a very low interest rate and i am making regular payments but i will still have a significant amount of stupid debt in a year when we do have a more indepth conversation this is the kind of debt that i will be servicing for quite a few years more and im not comfortable with that being a complete surprise to you at the end of this lease do you have any questions or anything else youd like to know about that

given what she knows of you so far there is a fair chance shell say nope thats enough youre paying it and you got a plan good to go
but so very far from understanding that most human individuals depression doesnt manifest as lets update my tinder bio and go on some fun dates tehe and that many human individuals still struggle with depression and other mental illness while in a longterm relationship even a stable and healthy one
i sexually assaulted a stranger cause i was sad it made me feel good to make a total stranger frightened and distressed i intend to exercise this power to abuse in the future and expect it will continue to go well for me 

but please remind me again how men live in constant fear of accusations that might be embarrassing
this man is profoundly unfun in bed
she told you she truly wants to be alone she said it was over she said she is not discussing her reasons with you 

that is what she told you and that is all you get to know accept it 

youve been hung up on this woman for ages but shes never been your partner youre not a team and you never were you had a few months of intensity that were not a very good foundation for a serious longterm connection and she knew it you should have reasonably known it

its time to do what you should have done ages ago and end contact stop showing up at her house stop calling shes been clear this is just a break up  and in a break up you do not get to know everything going through the other persons mind whatever she needs to do for safety and sanity in her own life she has decided you are not part of that that is her call to make and you need to make peace with it without demanding she address your issues with her choice that is a break up
i dont think its weird but if your core intention is to apologize then you need to focus on that and just apologize it shouldnt take more than a few sentences to say youre sorry for how you treated her 

dont go on about what you learned or praise yourself for your growth of course youve learned and grown so has she duh an apology isnt an opportunity to give yourself a gold star or make yourself feel better just acknowledge past wrongdoing and wish her well
this is a hell of a lot of your emotional energy to give to someone who doesnt come to events they dont want to go to and has inconsistent patterns of sharing their opinion 

if you dont want to be his friend dont be if you dont want to share information take a page from his book and simply dont

but writing manifestos about your buddy who is simply different than you and maybe a bit inconsistent in his boundaries is really absurd behaviour and probably not a great use of your brain space 

the amount of clarity and correlation youre seeking is bizarre you can ask him but he can also choose not to tell you or he may honestly not know 

this whole question suggest you havent got your own shit figured out when it comes to what kind of boundaries you want to have and friendships you want to participate in 

be thoughtful about the amount of energy you put into a connection give advice where its asked for find some damn chill live and let live
and victims of their own shit head friends too
every logical person who cares for your safety and sanity in life is going to tell you to end this  romantic connection the fact her challenges in life are understandable doesnt mean you can save her or that you should try to save her on your terms

and for fucks sake use protection unless you want to be a father and bound to someone as a coparent for a two decades
youre single when you tell him youre single and thats its over or he tells you the same

but your friends are giving you good advice the reasonable response to this situation is ok this is clearly over were broken up im living my life as a single person now lets figure out why you get the rest of your stuff 

i dont think a reasonable person could look at this situation the lack of communication and partnership in it and not say that this coward of an adult man is just trying to make you do the hard work of actually dumping him hes just coasting alone enjoying the perks of your attention until it happens 

doing it in person would be respectful but its really not more complicated than that imagining you may get engaged this year to a man who is making these sorts of choices seems like a pure delusion to me
right i mean if i just look at them objectively and how they choose to present themselves you can see tate is deeply insecure and trying to perform machiscmo fraser looks relaxed friendly and just fun if you told me i absolutely had to go on a date with one of these men based on just a few photos alone itd be fraser hands down
i know youre making a rape joke and i wish we generally wouldnt do that but the guy will likely do just fine in prison they come down hard on cannibals and pedophiles but a huge percentage of the men there have bet their wivesgirlfriends at some point and living off of the proceeds of someones elses sex work is just bragging rights and tate should remember how to throw a punch hell be fine in prison which says a super sad thing about both him and prison
in prison
dude you do understand that even in this bullshit ruling that is not what was said right 

im genuinely concerned that some gas stations and corner stores might not realize they are not protected  not yet  by this ruling

but of course that is the real point of inventing the inquiry from a gay couple to a woman who doesnt make wedding websites to make the world more hostile and hateful for the people they loathe
the red flag isnt that he didnt like it or even that he didnt eat it the red flag is he didnt talk to you about it kindly acknowledge the effort and make an alternate suggestion for dinner 

any sane adult man knew what he was doing was hurtful and he did nothing to address that or repair it 

they are not as stupid as they like to pretend to be when it means they can avoid accountability stop protecting this man from the reasonable consequences of his actions of course youre upset any normal human being would be he knows that you know that youre both agreeing to pretend its not true to protect his feelings at the direct expense of yours
its likely that at this point in your life the best thing you can do is walk away from your father and refuse to engage 

my go to was often if you dont think men should treat women like people im not going to argue with you im just going to keep my distance from you because  that is hurtful and frightening also a big fan of wow you must really hate men to think they are all such mindless animals who cant possible do better

then disengage walk away never try to answer his questions or engage in an argument do not ask questions make dull statements like well that is an ugly world youre living in you cant have a productive conversation with someone who has decided you are subhuman they will just keep on treating you like youre a dog trying to convince them to eat cat poop 

you cant save your brother but you can show him that he wont have happy relationships with women if he treats them poorly
gaslighting requires malice and usually a pattern of it you can make mistakes and have misunderstandings but you cannot gaslight someone by accident 

but this was a bit careless and not kind even if you didnt intend to manipulate her you were careless with your words and your choices hurt her thats real that you did do and its reasonable for her to be upset with your actions

you had left her with a very clear idea that you were all in and on a shared path you ripped that away when you said in effect that you were never really in love with her yet

she may have overreacted or been unkind as well but her accusation held water you need to find ways to flirt and offer praise without implying more than you mean too or offering false promises before you are ready to make real ones you were totally unclear about what your vision of being serious with her actually looked like and you used words that she rather reasonably interpreted very differently than you apparently meant them you may not be a monster but you done messed up

also this kind of lovebomby and careless language is a damn good way to end up in a relationship with someone who has intense or unrealistic expectations like she did because youll attract them with that kind of shit and youll repel people who are more levelheaded and thoughtful about their partnerships yet another reason for you to not continue this behaviour
apparently now the kind of required information you want to include is that you graduated from a conservative christian liberal arts college with a nearly 90 acceptance rate 

so weird when cheaters fill out additional biographical details
its absolutely is unfair if your regularly as a matter of habit being more grace effort patience and benefit of the doubt to interactions with people who arent your partner 

it sounds like you both have an issue right now where you are assuming the worst of one another and are unable to bring in those positive qualities that make relationships between people actually function its a pretty normal thing to struggle with when youre under stress but this is going to keep getting worse until you both decide to focus on being kind instead of on facts and unfair and who started it youre both deep in the shit either you climb out together or everything keeps on stinking 

but of course its not unfair to choose where and when to be assertive about your own needs him nitpicking your other relationships in your life because he doesnt like that feedback hes receiving about this relationship is not unfair to him its annoying maybe but not unfair

couples counselling might help here if you are both focused on relearning to be kind to one another and stop assuming the worst
be worthy of wifingup but willing to be the side piece of this curmudgeon
her response was extremely poor but assuming you dont want the advice break up with the insensitive cow ill suggest you might making a rather common beginers error

asking for what you want doesnt mean you get it

asking is an important first step not a garuntunee its a pretty common for people in your position to think hey i learned and i asked nicely now give me what i want and thats not actually how it works there can be lots of reasons our partner might not be able or willing to meet our exact need in the way we want it met at the exact moment we want it met

your gfs responses mean one of two things shes a monster you should dump or shes burnt out on being a source of validation for you and she needs you to do more selfregulation and own your own shit she doesnt want to solve this problem for you she wants you to solve this damn problem and stop putting at her feet 

its not okay how she expressed it she also needs to ask for what she needs if she needs you to shove off and figure out how to cope without being constantly managed and pet by her she also needs to say that maybe nicer but that

youre not being petty shes not being nice you have been fixating and probably ignoring how heavy the emotional burden youve been asking your partner to meet is getting either that or shes a vicious harpy you should break up with take your pick
so you sulked for days and refused to communicate with him which became insufferable for him to be around without saying anything and then got mad when he keep his commitment to his friend

get a grip seriously the resolution here was good the root of the problem was the sulking and withholding

you needed to take a time out to manage your own feels and it was probably for the best you ended up with one just because you are having a big feel doesnt always mean you partner drops everything to address it sometimes you have to cry and out and manage your shit
i would just decline 


your relationship is with her not him there is nothing for you to gain from this hes asking you to serve his needs even though you have no foundation of friendship to base that on 

you can and should be friendly and civil ifwhen they decide to socialize together but youre allowed to be tense both of them need to understand that as a reasonable consequence of his behaviour and her choice to remain with him but you do not owe him any of this emotional labour for this sort of conversation the odds of you having any success at holding him accountable are slim to nil it is far more likely he will continue his pattern of making his feelings and his behaviours the fault of others in this case of you 


tell him you will welcome him in any social situation he joins as your friends chosen partner  that is that the extent of your relationship he is her choice and you respect and honour her choice  but you are not his friend and you are not interested in putting in the work to become his friend at this point you are not available to him that way

those would be my boundaries and id expect them both to respect them its not my job to hold some asshats hand through his sobriety after he abused my friends for years its his job to show up at events be less of an asshat and recognize no one else owes him a damn thing more than that
hes either not interested or lacking in really basic skills and consideration when it come sit planning dates 

either way waste of your time
they are actually totally cool with sex work they want this to be a transaction where they buy emotional support and sex 

they just arent cool with woman setting the price they need to go to a place where they imagine the woman are poor enough that they can purchase it at a pittance and shell be grateful for the job
you also wont find many vegans at a pig roast 

youve got a movement that on the gentler side thinks woman should stay at home and make babies and on the not so gentle side thinks women who dont stay at home should know what they are signing up for and deserve what they get
so 10 of 11 of these women are not drama seeking asshats 

and 0 outta of these 11 men have any integrity at all
is this really the first time hes been controlling and hypocritical or threatened to end the relationship because you didnt perform in ladylike ways 

because it appears he thinks there are one set of rules for him in life and a completely different set for you
its handle you told her no and to keep her opinions to herself if she tries to speak to you or your husband again you repeat it a hit more strongly weve heard your opinion we disagree this conversation is closed we expect you to behave with kindness and respect from here on out 

you can speak again when shes done pouting that she didnt get her way and get free reign to shame you

if she never gets over it thats also a win talk to your husband about the boundaries but this is a pretty clear case of if she cant say anything kind she is invited to say nothing if she cant even do that you wont be speaking
yes 

this is very much a case of you needing to put your own oxygen mask on first 

you are trapped and the goal post for what getting help looks like will probably keep moving keeping you trapped 

if its not safe to be legally bound to him then its not safe and you need to act on that reality now start taking steps towards safety
im not proud of it but its been validating over the years to find out how many my exes friends dumped him or ghosted him in the months after our break up i didnt realize at the time how much id been running interference and smoothing ruffled feathers without me around his ability to maintain other relationships seems to have suffered as well
this it was what dawned on me too  

realizing that if my ex treated anyone else the way he treated me hed be fired and friendless 100x over it wasnt that he couldnt do it he just wouldnt do it when it came to me
she didnt know what she meant

you did exactly what you needed to do asking her what the difference was and what would qualify under plus that wouldnt appear in a bfgf relationship

the fact she couldnt give you an answer and that you had to puzzle it out yourself was a red flag and i dont think the issue was about language proficiency 

the only thing to learn here is not to try to force an agreement where there isnt one
can you make agreements about office time during the summer specific fixed times when you will go to the office or be working and only working all the more better if you can reinforce this schedule by actually leaving the house during this time 

playing it by ear obviously isnt suiting either of you and it makes sense that she and kids are playing it by ear over the summer months you are still working you either have hours or tasks that need to be completed you need more structure and clear expectations
oh yeah and youll resell it easily enough easier even if you hold on to it for a year and sell it in june if you have a bedroom door that closes even a really small one will be fine just dont try to make a small one cool 4x the area its meant to
ha yeah no way to know

if it were just you id say roll the dice and find out but if you can swing a second hand or sale one for the doggo even if it only does one room thatd be my call
i wouldnt chance it with a dog 

were all but guaranteed a few 28 afternoons coming our way soon and you wont know what that is like in your place till you know i dont use my air conditioner very often  north facing and little direct light but for 1520 days of the year its necessary for me to function in the late afternoon and id say about half those days it gets me a better sleep as well add another week or two of me just not having to be concerned for the pupper
are misogynists made or revealed

she cheated she gets left and exposed during divorce proceedings she looses friends and ends up with a hostile coparenting relationship all totally fair to her although maybe not all fair to their children those are the consequences

if hes out in the world treating other women like shit or worse that is on him if his daughters are aware of him doing this and they will be if they arent already thats on him and it makes me suspect he was always looking for excuse to do so she just handed him the perfect story to justify himself with
you made a reasonable choice to address a problem that existed solely inside your own brain by limiting the amount of uselessyetanxietyprovoking information your brain received

dont see a problem here

managing input is a totally valid strategy

i live my entire life with read receipts off for this very reason needlessly anxiety provoking not sure why anyone would want to use them in a healthy interpersonal relationship to be brutally honest
be specific  touchy is vague and accusatory you gotta be specific and clear  and dont shift the blame on to your new girlfriend

y no handholding okay thats not a friendship thing for me 

dont say anything about your girlfriend tell y what you like and dont like in your friendship if hugs hello or goodbye are cool say so if often helpful to shift to what is welcome and not fixate on what isnt 

also consider this though if you drastically change how you treat friends when youre in a relationship youre kind of telling your friends that when youre single you see them as an option and youre making it easy for them to blame your partner for choices that are actually totally yours healthy boundaries with people you value as friends should stay pretty consistent whether youre single or not

you cant control how y is gonna respond but you also cant have a happy and healthy friendship with her if you cant tell her what your own feelings and boundaries are
dont try to parent your siblings i know it sucks but that bigsister fix it role is toxic and wont save anyone 

instead just sent them fucking memes im serious send them funny videos you think they might like make small talk about the damn weather or a new game release if youre on a trip or outta town send them a damn postcard share happy news with them if you got a new job or a raise let them know though your actions that there is a life out there and that you and they are connected in that adult life separate from your parents try have a point of contact once or twice a week where you let them now youre thinking of them if possible invite them to hop on a bus or something and visit you 

if they open up or vent dont scold validate that it is bad they think it sucks because it does suck when they make mistakes or act out remember and remind them they get to make mistakes and they get to be angry  but they also get to be happy and free of this shit soon too 

youre not their saviour you cant rescue them but you can help them them find their own bridge out

forget your parents you dont need to be on their side right now let that shit play out on its own connect with you sisters as people as young adults sometimes itll be shitty and thankless work but its way more likely to pay off in the future then fussing over the decades of poor choices your parents are making
lets not minimize it quite that much 

hunter pulled the same shit most rich white children from a political dynasty do he expensed personal expenses as if they were business one and they found one email and one text allegedly where he said the equivalent of dont you know who my daddy is

he got caught and hes getting a spanked a good bit harder than trumps kids did when they literally stole 10x that from a charity
what is the allegation exactly

that his son made a vague implication about him in two text messages that the statue of limitations ran out on tax fraud in 2014 so they only got him on 2017 and 2018 

if this is the result of the the doj and one of the most powerful men on the planet interfering they are completely fucking incompetent
instead of putting yourself in the middle recommend that your wife speaks to someone  a therapist  to help her find ways to navigate this relationship that will make her happiest and most secure 

dont see yourself your as the authority who knows what she needs to do cause you dont know actually know you have a decent idea but you dont really know tell her shes struggling and deserves help youre biased and shed probably get the best advice for herself for what she actually wants to achieve from someone who isnt she might not want to achieve in her relationship with her mother what you think she should 

its okay to also tell her youre really frustrated with this pattern but the focus should be on that this is a big problem and its one she can absolutely ask for more help and skilled advice on

and dont minimize the fact that your life and plans currently depend a great deal on free child care from the inlaws if they do thats not a footnote that is a key consideration
you are over thinking this 

shes rude taking it personally is not going to help the situation

shes not your bestie just keep your distance and learn to shrug it off odds are good the rest of the family has
id say youre shamelessly naive at best and disingenuous at worst if you genuinely believe that shameless was the only thing included above that was a gendered insult and or an thinly veiled attack and manipulation of his female partner 

i sincerely hope youre not a woman youd lack some really key skills needed to keep yourself safe and choose respectful relationships of the only problem above you can identify is that and ill assume youre not since you seem to be blissfully unaware that you might have a bias that blinds you or keeps valid information from you

good luck in life
seriously though i dont think so i mean i love mine but in zero gravity i think id go back to tampons i think now im curious really
yes

if you do not want to live with his mother andor you are not comfortable in a relationship with someone who is finically supporting their parent for the rest of their lives then this isnt the relationship for you 

your bf has not shown hes capable of saying no you need to protect your own sanity and future dont let this woman trap you into a life you dont want to live

you can give you bf a warning about this dealbreaker but you need to be ready to break this deal
he shouldnt propose no one has suggested he should

he should have the integrity and intellectual constancy to leave the relationship instead of just creating a relationship so hostile to her values and her gender that he can blame her when she does what she should and leaves 

he should stop talking shit about the evil women of the world who are out to get him and harm the children and end a relationship where their goals are incompatible instead of just pontificating about how terrible women are and then how terrible this one woman is for not sticking around and working through the small issue of his open contempt for her 

and dont give me this disingenuous shit that he was pulling that 80 stat out as some sort of neutral mathematical fact that is not the context and we both know it if you think the only problematic thing here is the shameless comment then your mind is so open im shocked it hasnt fallen out of skull 

men many have lots of things working against them in life but this one is acting like shit
youre responding to a post that is literally full of a man expressing to his gf of eight years how truly and deeply awful women are you see that right that is what he is doing he is all womaning his partner of eight years in the most demeaning possible way while connecting those demeaning attitudes towards her entire gender to why he is not willing to consider certain kinds of life commitments to her as an individual

what i did was point out why his behaviour as an individual was utter fucking bullshit and a loselose for the op thats not all men just him hes bad based on what we have here he is a bad person for a woman to continue in a serious relationship with
you can expect an adult man not to throw little temper tantrums every time he is mildly inconvenienced by daytoday life

hes not just expressing his feelings he is failing to manage his bad attitude and making everyone around him suffer for it he is weaponizing his grumpiness and his incompetence in order to bully you into leaving him alone its shitty when a teenager does it its utterly unacceptable in a damn adult

raise your expectations expect him to do it expect him take notice without being instructed like a lazy employee expect him to not act like a shit about it tell him these are now the expectations tell him a marriage will not survive not forever if he truly cannot meet them because it wont eventually you will get fed up almost all women in your position do 

you know he can do things he doesnt love without acting like a whiney toddler because if he couldnt hed constantly be getting fired he can do this he just doesnt think you deserve the effort
your parents are shit

even if they had anything like a point about you struggling with your boards or to find employment you and your bf are nearly 30 if youre dating seriously his family should get to know you warts and all 

the odds are good his parents wont be as shitty as yours
and well make sure to send 10 billion tampons
tell your gf exactly what youd like to do over those days and ask her which activities shed like to join you and which ones dont interest her suggest a romantic dinner in town invite her to take one of the trails then build your plan and it would probably be practical and kind for that plan to include an afternoon on the beach with her or a massage or any other number of relaxing periods together

its okay to have different needs and interests on vacation and your gf has told you that your proposal doesnt include enough together time over those three days thats not insane its just different so reconsider id especially advise you to make sure your last full day of the vacation is a positive one for you both together

its not rocket science both of you are digging in rather obnoxiously and assuming the worst of one another instead of actually talking about what matters to you both you have things you want to do she values relaxation and time together offer some plans and some reassurance and sort it out
you do nothing this is your bf to handle its on him to tell you what he plans to do and to tell his father what is going to happen that includes facing the consequences for making choices

if there was no explicit household rule against you two hooking up then dont apologize there is nothing to apologize for you existed as his gf in a space where you both reasonably believed you were welcome 

your bf needs to figure out how to navigate this for now youre not welcome in that home accept it with some grace and make alternative plans
the first thing you do is agree with him if she is sick she is unwelcome

if she feels unwelcome its because she has violated this boundary in the past and he has failed to communicate to her what is really expected of her which is to not come of she is ill thats not you putting ideas in anyones head that is literally the reality sick visitors are unwelcome including her if shes sick

then your husband needs to stop asking and start telling

you and he need to come to an agreement about the boundary and what will happen if she doesnt honour it and he needs to tell her what that boundary is and what your response will be if its violated for example if you are unhealthy do not come if you come and you develop a flu or cold were going to have you isolate from the rest of the family and change your flights

you cannot control what she does and neither can he but the problem you could solve is getting rid of this tiptoeing fauxpolite language and just say what you mean its not are you sick its if you have any symptoms youre not welcome in our home no one who is symptomatic is welcome in our home at this time this is what you need to expect if you become symptomatic while visiting us if you are not happy with these terms do not visit at this time
at some point it has to stop mattering if he can help it or not the outcome is the same 

he is manipulative and insulting and abusive that is what happened since the start and is happening now 

you can feel sorry for him if you think he genuinely cannot do any better but you cant date him and expect to be happy and healthy with him he is manipulative and insulting and abusive thats the reality 

and youre being naive this is intentional even if he knows its wrong the vast vast majority of this is intentional these are tactics hes learned and are practicing to make himself feel okay and get what he wants
there is no should

if you dont like it say so

personally when my partner is clearly fishing for validation i try to make sure im a generous source
i never actually met someone over the age of 14 who has expressed this but its one of those funny turns of phrase that can absolutely feel exclusionary in some contexts if youre talking to a room of 20 people and its a good mix guys is more obviously inclusive if youre talking to a room of 20 people and there are only one or two women it can hit differently 

the thing about arguing its neutral cause thats how we use it is youre arguing for a non literal meaning and relationship between the word and a concept and im here for it but if youre gonna argue for a nonliteral relationship between the word and a concept then you need to also know its fuzzy the conceptual framework is not necessarily always the same
you cant 

and thats not a boundary 

a boundary would be im not going to go out with you if youre wearing those
or  im not comfortable daring someone who makes this choice a boundary is about what you do when you decide you cannot accept or tolerate something another person chooses 

youve expressed your preference and hes said no that is where this ends its not a debate or a negotiation 

im sorry you gender flipping narrative isnt going to go the way you hoped here
but hes not a sex tourist

these dumb women cant tell the difference between him and an entitled western sex tourist who would act exactly like he is acting
i realize you probably dont mean to be sincere but yes that would be a comparable trap and a similar sort of emotional terrorism

especially if she paired with it occasional hollow  promises that she might agree to some of what the man wanted in the future relationship like kids or marriage or mortgage if he just stuck it out and tried to prove he wasnt like other men by suppressing his own wishes or needs in the relationship for some undefined length of time
changing his mind is not the trap

making up your mind that womenmen are to blame if you dont get what you want or shit doesnt work out for you and using that belief to attack the one individual womanman youve been with for nearly a decade is the trap 

hes told her if she leaves him for not wanting what she wants then shes just the rest of those evil women who dont stay loyal and if she stays because she puts faith in the little crumbs of a baby future he occasionally drops shell be one of those awful woman who wants to baby trap a good guy thats the trap that is laid for her to protect his ego at her expense leaving her the hard work of recognizing they are actually incompatible because he doesnt say we might not want the same thing he is saying give me what i want or youre a bad woman and the work ending this relationship and of being blamed for ending this relationship it has nothing to do with a person just changing their mind
i think you have some serious thinking to do about what his role in the business actually is 

are you a team or is this your business is he your unpaid helper with this new job of yours or your employee is he investing in this with his time or any risk or is he just your partner you make life plans and have obligations with 

if this your business and youll be using it to meet your financial agreements in the relationship on your own then sure tell him to shove it and be supportive

but if youd want to be a team and have his unpaid help for the new company or have him share in the risks of being an entrepreneur then you cannot tell him to just grin and bare it if you want him to share the risks then you cant always pull rank and silence him 

you have a dream he doesnt share and that can still work as long as you both understand his role and maintain boundaries you need to realize that if you want him to be your teammate and takes this risk with you then you need to listen to him and accept if he feels strongly or differently than you if hes just your partner and this is your job then you can tell him not to say anything if he has nothing nice to say
im far more concerned that youre only allowed to walk around the room for exercise

you do seem hypersensitive to anything food related they also seem rude both things can be true 

all of that pales in comparison to the fact you seem to have accepted your partner imprisoning you 

stick with the therapy you have way bigger issues than his sister not accurately observing how many tacos you ate
the first thing you do is give yourself permission to be upset not furious with him just hurt and upset you had a reasonable belief and a basis in trust and that got pulled away from you thats sad thats painful

the second thing you do is trust him to do the work he needs to do you cannot do it for him you can examine and address your response but you cant aid him in managing his own shit he needs to manage it you need to trust and expect that he will do so and he will communicate what assistance he needs 

running around trying to read his mind on how to help him is not going to improve the issue here thats just more of the same problem as before 

a relationship where you cant rely on your partner to be honest with isnt going to survive that actually isnt something you can fix for him thats something he needs to recognize he must fix if he wants a healthy relationship
how dare those females not want to talk to someone on a dating app that they didnt actually indicate they wanted to talk to on that  dating app s
yeah i can believe he did and all those women he thought were furious were actually quite uncomfortable and using the very wise stay perfectly still dont attract the crazy persons attention strategy for public transit
i cant believe i had to scroll this far

this was a deliberate planned act of abuse with a little bit of public shaming thrown in and bonus points for isolating gf from any immediate support network 

nothing she could have done justified that act

its fucking madness people are talking about couples privilege and boundaries instead of just praying that this woman runs for the damn hills before op feels entitled to further escalate his tactics to make his point
youre describing her being inconsiderate and you being abusive

that wasnt an asshole move that was abuse

if she was asking for advice id be telling her to pack her bags because shes currently living with a man who used gifts as weapons and used her flaws however real they are to justify his  deliberate malicious abuse
you really think its wise or productive to assigned your introverted partner who is working hard to engage with others a new task she must do at the same time or youll be upset with her do you really think this is going to result in anything except her withdrawing further from everyone 

dont let your pride turn into her burden 

the first thing you do is seriously reconsider if this needs to be discussed at all or if you just need to manage your own responses and stop stewing 

if you decide you need to talk about it start by actually recognizing the work shes already doing before you start giving notes give praise and validation for how she focuses on others and ask questions like if she notices or even agrees with what you think youve noticed then ask her for the favour do not accuse do not declare your experiences to be objective reality acknowledge you are probably being oversensitive and fixating do not assign her more work while she socializes manage your own shit trust that she doing the work ask for favoursawareness but dont make your shit her job
your ex has the emotional maturity of a toddler

it would be dangerous to rely on such an unstable and disloyal person for your financial security 

its really no more complicated than that trusting him is a stupid risk to take
its okay to admit this relationship doesnt serve your needs its okay to admit it doesnt serve your needs even if he cant help it 

you dont have to understand perfectly what his thoughts or experiences are 

you can look at your thoughts and experiences and make a decision based solely on that 

in fact that is always the way you should make this sort of decision when it comes to dating just dating someone not by trying to read someone elses mind or dreaming of the couldbes of the future but by asking if this relationship actually works for you today as it is 

does this relationship meet your needs do you feel happy secure and respected
the perfect trap

no matter what happens in this relationship as long as she stays itll be her fault when she leaves itll be her fault

hes a 30 year old man who is not responsible for any of his own choices because the evil womens are making him do shit or worse leaving him when he maybewouldhavereallysoon had done some shit how dare she judge him on his actual actions and not his vague promises
dude if the porn is making you uncomfortable you could just not watch it thats okay too

the porn made for men and consumed by men has very little to do with any individual woman youre at risk of meeting in real life
its exactly that

often when a heavy dose of she wanteddeserved it good on him for getting what he wanted from the hot young piece
i always say the same thing im not questioning her judgement im questioning his

talking about autonomy and selfdetermination is just moving the goalposts were actually talking about judgment and risk not consent there can be consent there is still a valid question of the older persons judgment and the youngers risk 

i am sure the 22yearold is quite mature and competent  probably above average for their age that is part of why an older person with ill intent would target them the outward appearance of maturity is a great mask for the behaviour they wish to actually engage in

im sure the 22yearold is making reasonable choices on the basis of the information they have and they have limited information 

what the fuck is wrong with the 40yearold who thinks this is a reasonable choice for an equitable and respectful relationship i  know whys a 22yearold might think that about dating a 40yearold but i do not know a sane and balanced 40yearold who would agree

we dont need to judge the 22yearold as anything except a person who objectively has only 22 years of life experience 22 years of bullshitdetecting or really about 4 or so useful years compared to the decades of experience of the older someone with poor judgment and likely will ill intent who has learned to mask their bullshit
its advice 

i imagine op comprehends just fine that one of the randos online whose opinion she sought out is not an omnipotent supreme master to whom she is by inexplicable force required to obey 

but hey maybe they were confused so good on you
youre assume he knows what there is to confess he may very well may not

what you know is that he kissed someone else that can be enough
straight people can cheat gay people can cheat bi people can cheat its all the same really they can all also choose to be monogamous 

there is nothing you could do to save yourself and really he may still honestly be straight you cant really know but that isnt actually the core problem here
ah yes the old i am incapable of building actual friendships with female persons and perceiving them as anything other than sex objects therefore all men as just as trash me 

always a nice and tidy 
its reasonable to give the younger person advice that this is risky and can be harmful

we dont have to keep such an open mind that our brains fall right out we can balance respect for individuals with basic reason and valid concerns

but if its legal there is not much besides giving advice that most other people can do to force the younger person to stop dating this adult

i understand your feelings but you need to remember the adults involved here are going to want to make sure the young person has safe places to turn when this goes badly and that they are not isolated from everyone else in their life who actually cares for them abusers like to isolate victims this can be especially easy for an abuser to achieve in this sort of agegap relationship if everyone takes an absolutist position

you can be right to judge the 22 year old person is doing a very bad thing and making a bad judgment that raises serious concerns about their intentions and motivations but attacking them directly may not be the best way to support the 15yearold person and keep the risks as low as possible for them there is a balance
block him

stop feeling badly for him and start getting mad at him for how badly hes treating everyone else especially you

he doesnt love you not as a person he doesnt give a shit about you

hes just cast you in a role in his personal little drama and hes trying to force you to play it whenever he gets bored with his real life this is his little script and he just playing it out its nonconsensual roleplay its gross its childish its mean hes actively manipulating you and hurting you for his own amusement whenever he cant think of anything more fun to do its not love its nothing like love 

block him everywhere that is the only way youll break free of being a side character in his story and start being able to really live your own
while its painful it doesnt really matter

the outcome of this situation is you have to end the relationship he cheated he broke the agreement he lied to you about it he doesnt appear to understand what he did was wrong it was wrong if he is straight and its wrong if he is not straight 

it doesnt matter what the truth is inside his own head about his own sexuality he may well be straight youll probably never know he might not even know and not be able to tell you the truth

dont debate him just say you made out with someone else youre not telling me he forced you youre not even seeming to say its a drunken mistake and youre sorry youre just telling me you played along and choose to make out with someone else if i cant trust you not to make out with someone else anyone else then we shouldnt be together its not right for either of us to continue in that case
youre wrong for staying in a marriage with someone you are trying to exert an absurd amount of control over and who simply does not agree with you and who is an adult human being and entitled to not agree with you

and frankly didnt agree with you before marriage either

you need to have some damn boundaries for yourself not try to make rules you imagine you can force your wife to follow boundaries are for you agreements are for the two of you together when you try to say things like you cant be friends with him youre trying to make a rule like you would for a toddler it doesnt work that 

marriage work on agreements not rules if you no longer have an agreement that works walk away from this before you further demean yourself thats the boundary the boundary is you walking away from something you have said you cannot tolerate
why misogyny

well that is clearly a coordinated attack against us for being exactly the cesspool anyone would have expected when it comes to a successful woman comic
forced to give birth and very likely die in the process

they are literally crowing for the death of women and children 
 and calling the rest of ghouls
the stoic provider is such a shit deal for men too ive seen so many men made miserable by it especially since its basically a myth for most families in 2023 i dont see why anyone would cling to it except that it codifies their dominance over women there is basically no other perk except that you get to tell yourself youre the boss and ignore a lot of the housework i guess for some guys thats a biggie
its not okay to make your partner the one who failed to get you there

its not okay when women do that to men its not okay that youre describing doing it to others

id never tell a partner they didnt get me to orgasm id tell them what i experienced did i orgasm how good was it how it could be better and what i like or dont like but would never ever make my orgasm their sole responsibility with that kind of terrible language there are lots of reasons i may not reach an orgasm that have nothing to do with them and i can ask for what i want without telling or even implying to them that they failed to get me there

if youre telling people they didnt get you there thats not a critique you may intend to follow up that comment with a critique but thats criticism and blame for something they were not in full control of its not okay when women do that to men its not okay that youre describing doing it to others especially not someone else who is making an effort to prioritize your pleasure as well or who reasonably did not have information you didnt give them

that is how you crush an inexperienced partner  by assigning blame for something they could not know without being told and implying ownership of something they do not own  and make an experienced one reconsider you
whereas men never ever lie about their age or weight only height and only height because women are shallow and unfair to everyone under 66 and not because they have unmanaged personal insecurities or a deeply warped sense of how to perform masculinity mostly from and for other men s
the perspective i have in my 30s is why i caution young people against this that isnt a projection that is a valid kind of information calling it projection is just a common way to dismiss women with shes just old and jealous that is hardearned information i didnt have available to me a decade ago

have all of the older individuals in large agegap relationships actively chosen that relationship due to the power imbalances inherent in it no of course not i dont know any reasonable human being who has made that argument we all know the exceptions weve all met them but the generalization exists because most of us have met fare more of those 

are a hell of a lot of those older partners with illintent andr bad behavior yes absolutely if the experience gap wasnt part of the attraction to this dynamic the agegap relationship would be much less likely to appear as a compatible match to the older person if someone comes online for advice from random strangers about their experiences in a relationship as a much younger partner you cant be giving very good advice if you ignore that dynamic

keeping an open mind doesnt mean letting your brain fall right out of your head

being respectful of individual choice doesnt mean never expressing an informed reasonable opinion about the risks associated with that choice

anyone in their 20s man or woman should be advised that a large age gap relationship carries a different set of risks and that they should be aware of those risks and keep their eyes wide open for them because 100 of us think we are the expectation to the rule and the vast majority of us are going to be wrong
not a dude but id expect this guy is talking about the distinction between a prostate orgasm and a penile orgasm but lacks the sexual education to describe it very accurately hell he might be appalled to realize the real orgasm hes describing is perfectly well understood by many gay men

while some men can experience both simultaneously for a lot of men a prostate orgasm is not associated with ejaculation itself whereas a penile one pretty much always is associated with ejaculation unless youre engaging in some pretty particular practices i wont get into here not everyone requires anal penetration in order to stimulate the prostate but most seems too in my direct experience its sometimes called the pspot analogous to gspot but obviously different anatomically speaking because its also full of nerve endings and the orgasm associated with it are described as a more fullbody experience more similar to what women describe from gspot orgasms

but again not a guy just answering because i feel like youre unlikely to get an answer from a man or amab person here and one willing to be open about anal play just a queer woman with some decent sex education and a strapon
that is pretty different i was a young adult with a job and an apartment i could consent and i did i was inexperienced but not powerless that is straightup criminal what youre describing even if you could legally consent to sex in the country where you live and you probably couldnt at 14 that would still be abuse and criminal it would still be abuse and criminal if youd be 20 years older when it happened

im sorry you went through that i hope youre doing well these days
thats it this whole argument about the younger person ie the woman is just classic blame women for mens bad behaviour

i absolutely consented to my relationships with men in thier 30s and 40s when i was 20

i was also gaslighted and manipulated very deliberately by most of those men because while i did sort of accidentally end up dating them  i didnt have any big thing for older men  they did not accidentally end up dating me they selected me for my inexperience and my appearance of maturity the first is why they got away with their shit and the second is why it was even somewhat socially acceptable for them to date me because well she so mature for her age

i never question the maturity or intelligence of the 20something with the 40something i know shes mature and intelligent probably more so than most that is why is part of why she is a desirable target for this behaviour a 20yearold who acts like a teenager isnt what these men want they want someone who passes and whose positive personal qualities can be used to excuse and justify their predation
hah i have so much firsthand experience with this delusion

men say oh youre catching feelings when i say shit like i like hooking up with you but you need to stop trying to sext with me during my workday and then pouting about it when i dont engage im busy or dude i like hooking up with you but im not paying 50 for an uber both ways every single time we can share the expense or you can come my way sometimes or even if you booty call me at 1045 for an 11 pm meet on a tuesday im probably already asleep and also no dont blow up my phone 

in almost every single case where i expressed boundaries or needs in a transparent casual sexfwb situation that the man didnt like or couldnt meet he declared that i had caught feelings and was trying to make it a relationship 

its so predictable now i just laugh and end contact she caught feels it the goto cope for men who dont want to treat casual sex partners with any respect
is he talking about prostate orgasms does he realize hes talking about the prostate

if you wanna get pegged dude you have to be able to say so like weve been encouraging women for a little while now to explore their own pleasure know what works for them and speak up about what gets them off

guys can and should do the same absolutely im here for it but that isnt about anyone else getting better at sex thats about you getting better at talking about sex 

and honestly ive never heard people rank other peoples orgasms before rank thier own sure but other peoples thats just fucking weird

i think you might need to buy a butt plug dude
cause her reasons are totally emotional and predictable flaws in her weak female character my reasons for breaking my agreements are just natural and rational

the mind boggles at this shit it really does
im glad other people piled on here cause i read through this and i just couldnt  i didnt have to bandwidth to deal with an adult man jumping in and telling this exhausted woman she wasnt entitled to her anger or to express it clearly that she had to hold her grown ass husbands hand through the basics of human decency and empathy 

that while dealing with a farm a small child and fucking cancer she had to further set herself aflame to make sure her poor little hubby didnt have to have to face the reasonable consequences for his bad behaviour her anger and a very serious fight being a perfectly reasonable and foreseeable consequence of his bad behavior

who doesnt understand that some fights are necessary and valid and that a fight doesnt mean cussing and insults a fight means saying youre wrong and you done fucked this up this is not a debate this me telling you that your behaviour is unacceptable thats a fight and a fight worth having a 42yearold marine doesnt need to be petted or begged to behave like his wife is a human being he needs to be told he is the wrong and he done fucked up he needs be told to shape up or ship out 

this guy just put a masterclass on why more and more women are forgoing marriage entirely
men are just dumb animals you have to respect and accept us as dumb animals incapable of leaving relationships that arent meeting our needs acting with integrity before impulse or communicating with our female partners as if they were full human beings

ive never met a feminist who thinks so little of men as these sorts of men think of other men

and he also probably thinks men are the dumb animals who cant behave ethically without regularly getting their rocks off with a hopefully consenting woman who should be basically in charge of everything
or whats really going on is hes turned off by the constant accusations the refusal to believe him when he speaks and lack of emotional regulation op displayed here 

lots of men also need to feel safe and respected to be aroused
he was right to break up with you 

you didnt believe him about his sexual interest there are lots of things you can in a healthy relationship when youre having doubts or concerns but accusing your partner over and over of lying to you is not one of them that was already a huge problem i dont know about the laughing but in your own report here you had already created a really toxic situation by repeating your accusations over and over again and refusing to accept any answer you should have left if you werent satisfied 

but you didnt leave feb you did have a violent outburst i wont tolerate people who throw things in anger either 

hes made up his mind and been clear its sad but its just a break up all you can do is be better in the future with someone else
you know thats not cute he knows its not cute cute is not what hes trying to achieve with that 

thats cringey and controlling and hes manipulating you
thats right everyone and everyones family dynamic is different shes told you what she sees the risks as for her family and her relationships and shes not willing to take them its not really fair to decide not to believe her just because it wouldnt work out the same way in your family 

it is discouraging and sad dale was an abusive piece of shit but anna isnt you and anna have a disagreement a serious and painful one but still just a disagreement its up to you what that means for the friendship some friendships can survive those sorts of painful disagreements and some dont
you said youre shocked and confused by annas response but her response is not shocking or confusing 

shes not prioritizing him over you shes prioritizing what she feels is the peace and security of her family dynamic for decades to come it may be hurtful or disappointing or wrong but her response is totally understandable

its okay to take distance from the friendship or even end it but shes not a monster shes a flawed human being who was pretty honest with your about her own fears and those fears where some of the real biggies
youre not overreacting to dale you and your husband need to block him everywhere and stop engaging document dont engage 

but you are being a bit naive when it comes to anna she was pretty transparent about her fears and its not shocking she feels unwilling or able to confront or police her father 

you certainly dont have to continue to be annas friend in light of her choice but dont pretend its so confusing its fucking terrifying for her confronting him could cost her a lot with her entire family for years if not the rest of her life shes scarred she doesnt want it take that risk she also likely feels rather powerless to stop him so why would she set her own life on fire trying to control something she cant 

we can call her wrong or cowardly you can choose to end contact with her but lets not pretend her choices are irrational or insane they might be wrong but they arent that
stop this and seek help
hes done plenty of shit wrong technically and otherwise

youre keeping a friend who youd literally need to warn other friends to keep a careful distance from itd be easier to make decent friends if you dont keep shitty ones around 

you know you have a pattern you know youre repeating it stop that
his prespective is selfish and unkind

youre dealing with cancer a small child and a farm

his job might be difficult and stressful but youre the one in a fucking war right now

youre not having trouble understanding his perspective it just sucked it actually sucked just as badly as you know it sucked youre not wrong youre not confused he really really fucking failed you the fact he was disappointed is understandable the fact he was angry and pouting like a toddler who didnt get his cookie was not understandable it was gross it was literally insane a sane person would have said something like im not mad but i was hoping to have sex last night and that didnt happen i get why it didnt but it was disappointing and left me feeling disconnected that was a conversation you could have actually had but that isnt what he said

so get mad with him have the fight tell him youre hurt and angry and exhausted and you dont appreciate being punished for being human and needing to sleep youre allowed to be mad with him when he doesnt meet the bare standard required of a sane person supporting their spouse he didnt clear the bar tell him so
you need to stop

this isnt healthy this isnt you needing any advice this is something else

take it up with a therapist
embrace the advice you find beneficial but i wouldnt advise you level up a relationship with a man who sees you as a project and doesnt believe youre worthy of that yet because he hasnt had enough time to work on your appearance thats a bit too shallow and condescending to be anything like a healthy foundation hes treating you like an accessory not a partner 

he may be a great fwb for a while but this behaviour isnt what id look for or accept in a serious partner if hes stuck in the role of coach or mentor with you then his support is conditional on you accepting his authority meeting his expectations for change and keeping up with the jones

while that might be beneficial enough and lovely in a friendship  where you can keep some boundaries and take some distance as needed  that is not what id want in a partner you are right to recognize that is probably not a good thing long term for your confidence to put too much stock in his judgment of you

this sounds like a person with some great advice and knowledge a person who can you can value and have fun with but maybe not a person you should put any personal fragility or vulnerability into the hands of
dating is hard work and its mostly disappointing that is what it is 

youre not doomed youve had slightly below average luck recently if you let that become a story where you tell yourself are doomed then you will be your chosen narrative will doom you 

you need to improve your screening and your resilience to disappointment and rejection the goal should be to get rejected or do the rejecting quickly 

a month is too long to be chatting online with someone without meeting when it lingers like that the risk of disappointment and crossed wires increases drastically 

if finding a healthy relationship is something you are ready for and looking for make it your parttime job use all your channels and apps and let your friends know youre open to being set up if youre talking to someone and they arent open to planning a date after a week or so of chatting then that means they arent interested or arent available and you move on 

you cannot control other peoples shit and they have a lot it you can only control yours there are no promises in life but there is more or less unhappiness dont choose more unhappiness for yourself will bullshit stories like everyone is hung up and  i will never find someone these are lies that are going to drag you down the truth is its really rough out there and i might not find what i want but im excited to try in a way that keeps me healthy and happy
exactly this 

there isnt a male brain and a female brain just a lot of human brains on a big old spectrum the brain is getting different inputs and genetic sex and gender are just one part of that and the more we look the more sex seems to be a pretty small part of it 

the neurotypical human brain is pretty adaptable organ which also means it tries to adapt to environmental and societal expectations the differences that have been sometimes noted which have often been overstated by a whole ton of motivated reasoning in the past really cannot be reliably attributed to genetic sex
welp shes incapable of treating you in a loving way 

as long as you stay this is how youll be treated 

this continues until you end it and learn not to mistake intense drama for love
if there is nothing wrong with it why do you have the take it on the chin 

the phrase as its actually used isnt neutral an offer of friendship is usually a good thing and something anyone could just accept or reject its not a zone its an offer of a kind of relationship you say yes or no to it 

the phrase friendzoned is only used by people trying to imply they have been treated unjustly or are being punished by not being offered something more than friendship 

lets not try to rehabilitate the word adults should just not use it at all because an offer of friendship isnt something you take on the chin rejection is youre talking about rejection lets call it what it is and expect people to learn to deal with it
im saying we agreed is not helpful or any sort of argument against the situation

im not saying it easy its the hardest thing in the world and the quicker you do it the better off youll be 

and im encouraging you to look at his behaviour today with a clear eye and not with the hopes and expectations you built up over 8 years those past hopes will cloud your judgement and all the fear and embarrassment you feel about the wedding are exactly the weapons hes trying to use to threaten you hes turned every deposit and invite to your marriage into a knife he can stick in you while he tried to renegotiate the relationship contract those arent fair terms and that isnt kind thats todays reality
its nurture not nature 

women are praised for multitasking but it usually just means continuing to work until all necessary lifesustaining tasks are completed 

most of what is called multitasking is just tasking if youre used to doing many tasks youre used to it if youre far doing too many tasks youre probably doing some poorly being used to it often means youre a better judge of which ones you can do poorly and still lifesustain 

there is nothing about human brains that magically make women better at it only that if its more expected of person a than b a will tend to get better at it and b may not even be recognized when they do it well
this problem persists until you send his packing  

thats the conversation now its done youre breaking up with him because he has shown you no respect or consideration for years 

of course his mommy says be nice to you she knows damn well shell have to bail him out once you stop she might not know just how bad it is but she knows

figure out the practicallegal matters like the lease and let him know when he is expected to be out by
if you dont want to have any more children he seems to be prepared to leave this relationship 

thats the reality admit it out loud to one another accept it start working towards it 

i dont like how hes behaved here but you need to acknowledge that he is serious and that this partnership has reached a dealbreaker it is something you do need to discuss and you need to stop saying we agreed because thats not an argument he changed his mind hes allowed to that a risk we take in partnerships deal with todays reality stop trying to enforce yesterdays its gone
then dont date her

this is not complicated she is not kind you have all the evidence of that you could possible need 

what is wrong with you that you keep in dating her
trust your instincts its nice to hope that hes not up to anything shady but that conversation a year ago was a pretty massive red flag that this is not a stable and mature guy looking for genuine adult friendship 

its totally okay to enjoy the past memories for what they are and close the door on the person  today
this man was considering cheating on his partner with you a year ago and is again 

derek isnt being kind that was inappropriate conversation for him to have with you while in a relationship you shot him down but hes ready to try again

proceed with extreme caution it is reasonable to be concerned his apology was selfserving this man has not signalled he values you as a friend but as an escapist fantasy and a possible affair partner the odds on this going well for you are pretty slim
it seems far more likely that she was trying to include you as her friend and as someone outside the department and not suspicious to her supervisor than that she knew of remembered or understood your sensory aversion 

come on man you know people who dont have experiences like this rarely remember that others do its really pretty unlikely she was trying to hurt you if she even knew which is already kinda unlikely
i enjoy pegging my bf

im going to tell him from now hes forbidden from eating at his favourite burrito place because he must always be freely available to me

will report back
if you dont want to be in a relationship with a bisexual man dont be

dont make it more complicated than that 

you want to break up thats fine do that 

if youre going to stay in this relationship i think you need to take a hard look at what youre so damn afraid of while i can agree that if he was out among his friends he ought to have shared  this  and i understand your sense of betrayal you trying to frame this in the language of consent is misleading and concerning way to look at your partners sexual orientation

after a year if you never asked him about his past partners his porn use or internal life then hes got a bit of a point learn to ask people about themselves
i mean he rather correctly judged that you wouldnt be okay with it 

given your response here one of you needs to end this clearly he knew you wouldnt take this well and now you really really havent 

your sense of betrayal is reasonable a hell of a lot of the rest of what youre saying here is not 

stop spinning just dont be in a relationship you dont want to be in
dont keep making the same mistake 

wish him well in his mental health journey and keep moving forward without him
this seems like a lot of work to maintain secrecy  not just privacy but some serious hardcore secrecy  in order to avoid having to set boundaries with one asshole cousin

how are you gonna silence your fiancs family at the wedding are you going to expect your children to lie to their grandparents about their experiences 

i have trouble believing a person who achieved this level of success would be this incapable of handled interpersonal conflict 

you obviously need to tell your family  in the sense that hiding your life from them is unsustainable if you intend to maintain any contact with any of them  some truths will nee to come out just in the course of normal human conversation 

so start having normal human conversations with the family members you value and see how it goes however you must realize that your harsh judgement of their character is a large part of what some of them are going to be legitimately angry about
i think you need to grow up and learn to handle rejection with some grace and maturity

this woman picked up on your interest and has given you a clear no shes not an object to do things too she a person who you must reasonably assume is not interested in you dont be a creep respect it
it wasnt weird to begin with at this point its absurd inviting her over for some brand name handmedowns was just absurd of course op got what she always got 

but its not at all weird that the daughter is asking for more of what she always gets why wouldnt she

this is clearly the price of admission to being jims wife op can accept that and minimize her own contact with haley or she can leave this marriage because the third option of either haley or jim changing their behaviour is exceedingly unlikely and totally out of her control
hey if youd just choose to be my sex toy thats totally the same as having agency
youre shit bag for every second you continue doing what is comfortable and easy for you instead of what is honest and respectful of her 

you cant undo your past shitbaggery but you could stop being a shit bag at any second in the future you choose
shes not required to like you 

it is weird you keep trying to force a relationship with her when it is clear she is not interested in your friendship 

you also cant force your husband to be a more skilled parent than he is he bought an apology from a 21 year old thats who ya married hes not a great father not as your describe it here hes a weak willed idiot who appear to have failed to build a real interpersonal relationship with her beyond his role as piggy bank and doesnt have healthy boundaries with her 

you need to politely decline to speak to haley take yourself out when she visits expect your adult husband to manage his own relationship and give him the time and space to do with minimal impact on you if she is she not willing or able to be civil and jim wont enforce boundaries or consequences for poor behaviour then dont expose yourself to her 

whether or she is a good person is sort of beside the point you two dont have to be buddies stop trying if she wants to cut off contact or if her father wants to pay her off thats between them opt out let jim handle his own shit and this is very much his shit
40 min walk little less than 20 min bike transit options are sorta indirect and poor so 2030 mins when i do use them 

70 mins is my personal cut off time for commute i know can tolerate a reliable 70 mins but an hour and half by ttc probably means two hours on most days if you work a standard day that would drive me insane
ugh yeah my eyes just about rolled out my head when i read that 

ya almost feel badly for them when they fall under the spell of some influencer with a get rich quick scheme to sell to depressed men  almost 

but it doesnt matter here what matters is to stop knowingly doing harm to this woman because it easier than dealing with your own shit alone
i cant believe these guys are whining about fable none of them were gonna play fable except to whine about bad and unplayable it is

besides shell have have demons horns and glowing red eyes by half way though because its fucking fable
its been two month hun this is who he is this is his character you just hadnt seen it yet this is the person he is and you didnt like it you shouldnt it was gross 

he failed the friend part of fwb and made it clear he is unsafe to continue with that is why you kicked him out  because he was unsafe to be with the pounding on your door with a mix of insults and begging should be a dealbreaker even if nothing else was that should be unacceptable in any relationship end it block him move on 

the person you thought you knew has been lost because they werent real two months in and the mask fell this is the real person you saw what this man looks like when hes not getting his way and it wasnt just ugly it was bordering on dangerous dont be an idiot get rid of him
its not that complicated at all

you need to speak to a family lawyer so you know what your obligations are if any to him as a coparent you need to pursuing a custody agreement so you know what you actually have to speak to him about thats how you protect  your rights and your childs 

besides those obligations everything else is harassment 

you tell him to stop contacting you about anything except necessary contact regarding your child and that if he doesnt do that the police can explain to him that he needs to stop harassing you 

you stop saying please and you start saying i am i documenting this to share with law enforcement then you do just that ignore every call and document the behaviour for law enforcement and the courts
its baffling to me that you can read what he says about the woman he claims to love but take exception to me accurately labelling the behaviour op exhibits right here and already knows is pretty shitty himself

op is being unkind and delusional he doesnt need to be kindly pet he needs to be honest with himself and her about his opinions the opinions he just plainly told us and claims to have held for a long while  and act accordingly
being at work together is absolutely not enough  thats not an unfair thing to say its a very true and important thing to acknowledge youre not 13 year olds you cannot just hang out at lunch and expect a healthy relationship to develop 

a serious adult relationship does require time and effort and planning  and yes some money on transit without any of that your relationship will die out thats not mean of her to say thats just her telling you water is wet 

ive never owned a car when im dating i know its a expense ubers meals tickets its part of my budget i dont make a hell of a lot and when you date someone seriously and exclusively you should talk about budgets and expenses and frequency of meetingdate night 

its unclear here if youre the one who is interpreting this to mean have a car but if you dont have a car you still have to put thought and effort and some money into how you spend time together outside of work
its been gentrifying for the last two decades like any downtown areas you need to practice some situational awareness and youll the one or two corners or parks to avoid but its really no more unsafe now that comparably dense downtown areas
you dont respect her at all you dont think shes loyal and your approach to dating and chatting with women generally sounds like that of a teenager not a grown ass man of almost 30

drop this connection behave like an adult who has some standards and self respect and date adults who you also respect
shes never going to thank you for this selfish selfabsorbed waffling bullshit 

if you dont want a lifetime monogamous relationship with her its high time to gtfo 

you have bad case of main character syndrome here but youre not the hero youre just a indecisive jerk chasing a dragon he is unlikely to ever catch you sound like dissatisfaction may be your drug of choice 

and thats fine lots of people live full and fascinating lives exactly that way its totally wonderful way to live and some of dearest friends live that way  just stop being dishonest with her about it shes a person not a discardable side character in your personal adventure who will text you in a few years to validate you dear god man
631 per cent of the vote thats what got her third place last time impressive hell yes but a win this time yeah thats a hell of a stretch
youre living in lala land if youre bringing this to events and just hope it works out 

you know most venues wont allow this and youre not doing due diligence and checking in advance 

if youre going to events with him you need to make a real effort to be informed and considerate 

if you only want to buy tickets to venues that dont check or dont prohibit it then you need to do that thats fine  i 100 get that and think its a totally valid personal choice  but your current approach of just buying tickets making the plan and then rolling dem dice is deeply rude to anyone out with you

if you were my female friend and did this more then once id be royally pissed off with you and would stop going to shows with you

he may also be an asshat who said some mean things but hes not wrong about leaving this at home when youre going to venues you can reasonably assume prohibit it
the entire pua marketing department would disagree they are literally selling men on the concept of fat ugly studs
a post mortem distress birth is a bad nonmedical term referring to the delivery of a baby who has already passed away either in utero or during labor

which should be painfully obvious to anyone who actually reads this with two brain cells firing the order of the words mean the birth is taking place after the death if it was what he said it was it would be something like postnatal stressinduced filicide a vaguely medical sounding phrase i also just made the fuck up 

its also the dangerous and traumatic thing that prolifers are trying to force on pregnant people and their families who overwhelmingly want to bring home a living infant
i know four women in my extended circle who hit 30 and were disappointed they didnt have kids

they did not make youtube channels they changed jobs moved to lower cost of living areas two choose sperm donors and two adopted 

when women want to be parents they seem more likely to do the work even alone i think a lot of the men whinging online dont really want to be a parent they want a child like a trophy like a steam achievement like a box they checked men say baby crazy but the women i know were all pretty baby sane the men i know who have turned 40 and gone legacy crazy are the toxic ones you gotta watch out for
they dont even seem to notice that the age which women are guaranteed to be miserable keeps getting later and later when i first started reading this bullshit it was 28 then 30 then 35 and now definitely sometime in our 40s

these guys look around every few years and begrudgingly admit that the women dont seem miserable yet but its coming they tell themselves we were promised they would become so much more unhappy then i have been all these years
figure it out for yourselves is where the benefit of the doubt would die for me and id be polishing off my cv

they may not be bad people but they are consciously doing a bad thing to the staff by rewarding this type of competition your vp and immediate director have already shown you how they are empowered too and willing too act 

you dont have the power to stop this you can advise the other woman against playing the game but you may be asking for a herculean feat from them you can keep pointing out to any leadership who will listen that this is counterproductive and that this sort of competition or resource allocation via canabalism doesnt improve outcomes it wastes time and resources and could loose them talent
you shouldnt do anything unless she asks you too

that doesnt mean you should do anything she asks but this is temporary if she just needs to vent in your direction but keep her head down and keep the peace at work thats not an unreasonable choice for her 

stop trying to run interference and manage all these people they are both conflict avoidant your girlfriend needs your sympathy and your support but dont charge in with sword drawn she may need to feel a lot of distress before she is willing to express her own boundaries with him support her when she does but dont try to hard to minimize her unhappiness  its trying to teach her something 

ask your girlfriend if she needs anything more than a safe space to vent ask her if she is confident her choice to keep the peace and placate him is the best one just agreeing out loud that yes shes thought about it and that is her decision may really help her to recognize she is making a choice here its not just a shitty thing happening to her shes considered the pros and cons and decided how to handle it 

personally i would recommend she adopt a strict i dont drive rule with him and enforce it mercilessly but thats just me

if you need too tell her you also might at times need a safe space from the venting and ask to figure out a signal you can give if you just dont have the emotional bandwidth to listen to her in that exact moment 

make sure the two of you are enjoying time outside of the house go a damn farmers market or a museum do an activity itll give you something else to talk about and share in beside your work and your roommate
has low iron levels
your expectations do seem to be very high given you are both employed adults and live separately you sound like you need to build a fuller life for yourself to be honest take a class join a book club make a friend if youre sitting on your butt alone the 34 night a week he isnt sleeping over and you dont like that then ya need to change it 


but that doesnt mean this relationship is a good one for you or something you should stick out you have very high expectations for together time and this guy doesnt even have a place you can visit let alone stay and you seem honestly confused about his living situation that is bizarre for seven months in
stick with the therapist and ditch the girlfriend

you know you are repeating your past patterns 

you know you shouldnt buy your gf of less than four months a damn car 

you know shes moving quickly to financially tie you to her because she has lifestyle goals and financial goals she cannot meet wifi if you 

you know shes with your primarily for the financial stability because shes told you as much she might also care for you on some level but if you lost your job tomorrow or got seriously ill shed be gone you know this 

what you lack right now is the courage to act on what you know to be true
oh im so glad you clarified you didnt mean it in a gay way s ffs
it seems he is currently or at least is setting himself up to be practicing polygamy again i think a reasonable person would say thats what he seems to be up to 

if you think he is not violent and is serious about holding you to this marriage unless you are not religious regular trips to the bar might be your best solution
your boyfriend is manipulative

tell him you dont issue gold medals for not being abusive and that your need for more consistent contact is valid

youre not victim and neither is he you have a clear reasonable request and hes just insulting you instead of working with you to maintain contact and connection in some way  even if that way isnt ft

seriously though the first time a man told me i was just playing the victim to try and shut me up would conveniently for him be last time ever spoke to him this guy has told you he doesnt take you seriously and that he feels entitled to punish you by withholding contact thats how shitty parents treat screaming toddlers these should be dealbreakers
yeah most westen people not knowing your legalreligious context would conclude he is in fact abusive im not trying to tell you how you have to label your own marriage but lets not keep such an open mind that our brain falls right out there is more meant by the word abusive than just someone who hits you someone who leaves you in danger because they dont fulfil legal or financial obligations to you may also be engaging in abusive behaviour

he is either your soontobe exhusband or he is a bigamist or hes cheating on you or you are in a plural marriage or he s abusive one of those things is true and if you dont want to be in a plural marriage then its also the last one

if there is nothing you can do to initiate a divorce you should be telling him that he absolutely owes you one
you told them your husband is abusive and that you are in a dangerous position that is what most reasonable people listening to these facts would conclude 

thats likely gonna be awkward because youve shared a bunch of information that suggests you are unsafe legally financially and maybe even physically bit more than awkward really 

realistically you need to realize its extremely likely your husband will hear about you going to a bar its good tea someones gonna spill you need to have a safety plan in place both when that happens and just generally speaking

you can choose to keep your life story to yourself in the future but you cannot make it not awkward that you told them you are at risk and that your husband is a real piece of shit that cat is out of the bag

stay safe
the median number of sex partners for women aged 2549 in the us is 43 

and thats the median so it doesnt include those who have never had sex

lets assume that most women a redpilld idiot is speaking to are below 25 years old 78 of those will have fewer than 10lifetime partners
the standart method of killing women to prevent nercophilia

this is a truly under appreciated historical fact

there is nothing biblical about burning witches the clearest instruction is to stone them and burn their books most american woman accused of witchcraft were hung the fact that burning is associated with witchesstraying wivessex workersfemale execution is pretty well documented in a few parts of the world as local authorities trying to prevent men from abusing female corpses

thats right you can be murdered for serving satan and the local boys will still have strong opinions about your bodys fuckability

being unclear is the surest way to be unkind 

people get hurt while dating you cant protect everyone but the best thing you can do to minimize it is have your own struggles well handled
absolutely but as women we are targeted by wellness gurus and mlms like doterra or arbonne whenever my female friends have down on their luck the mlm huns seem to start circling i think in many ways its the same basic behaviour were being sold community and selfesteem for women its more connected to personal achievement and independence whereas for men its more commonly connected to accessing sex and relationships with women 

add that to the fact that women were generally a bit better equipped to deal with the whole life just isnt fair and you wont get the job just because your dad did reality of the new millennium than men were with their lingering generational entitlement to a certain kind of life
its up to you and up to what boundaries you figure out with her during that time if youve seen someone a few times and youre still going to date other people as well its best to say so clearly

dating is even harder work when you dont know what the fuck you are willing to offer or what you need to ask for 

figuring your own shit out and then expressing it to another person you like is hard work

all of your responses here boil down to you havent figured your own shit out about boundaries and your needs about sex and what a relationship can look like at various stages and youre whinging that its hard to figure out your own shit and then say it out loud it is it just is you want to be happy do it anyways figure your shit out say it out loud and then see if it works for the individual person or people that you like to date
they are comfortable rather practical shoes which are somehow damaging her 

like does he think kitten heels and wedges are healthier for us
its not crazy but it can be confusing and you need to be more clear about what you mean 

the answer to that kind of argument is that you are in a kind of relationship it includes sexual exclusivity but maybe it doesnt include things like meeting parents yet or making plans more than a month in advance 

dont say its not a relationship because  dude it is  if you are sexually exclusive youre in some kind of relationship just be clear about what sort of relationship it is at that  stage
if you dont want to have sex without being exclusive just say so that is not an uncommon boundary at all you just want to avoid being on a 3rd date with someone who doesnt share it so you have to speak up
dating is stressful most human beings feel this way at least some of the time

your real problem here is your own lack of clarity 

you dont have be actively dating to find a wife but if you want to be married in your 30 you likely should be dating only people who make sense for that longterm goal 

my advice date who is fun to date for 34 months then decide if they have any longterm potential before that time period think of it as just who you want to spend time with next week
your girlfriend is trying to tell you she doesnt want to date you 

shes not doing it well or clearly but odds are very good shes trying to break up with you 

if shes not giving you concrete things you can do to make her feel appreciated as an individual and secure in the relationship its very likely that she cant tell you what those things are 

its been three months this is the youre cool but its not working time frame it doesnt mean there is anything wrong or unhealthy about you sometimes there is nothing broken to fix this just means youre both 19 and compatibility is weird and difficult thing
if youre absolutely no fun in bed and will only fuck in one position while she fakes porn noises for you you could just say that
nah hes complaining that other people are permitting her to feel good about her body which is not of sexual interest to him personally and therefore cant be the source of any happiness or pride
men dont have support groups like that

which is somehow the fault of this one woman  getting supporting from what im going to assume is predominantly other women because random men usually dont show up in quite the same numbers when its not sexy for them  who has a totally genderneutral and lifesaving medical treatment and had the audacity to put something shiny on her medical device got it
male answer syndrome mas describes a subjects exaggerated willingness to answer or inability to resist the impulse to answer factual questions regardless of the subjects lack of knowledge of the relevant phenomena or circumstances
it always makes me think of the great snl skit man park 

i do feel for the guys that they arent raised in a way that encourages the building of these interpersonal skills and connections but im deep into my 30s now and im done picking up the slack if im your only friend there is a problem here and its not mine to fix
the truth is only very naive or damaged women with low selfworth allow themselves to be manipulated with game  treated poorly for very long

lets amend this to for very long because i think we risking supporting the manospheres victimblaming narratives about toxic relationships when we dont acknowledge that a skilled scam artist is gonna scam even a smart secure person for at least a little while 

even an otherwise confident and mature people can find themselves temporarily vulnerable to a purposeful predator who his the right notes we shouldnt be shaming people for being normal healthy people who dont assume someone else is a narcissistic ass right outta the gate the goal has got to be dont get conned for long because never get conned isnt a fair standard
honestly i think its men without healthy friendships with other men even 

i live in a dense urban core and years ago before the mall banned them i used to run into these men and their coaches on the regular they were unpleasant or even a bit frightening to interact with as a young woman but they were fascinating to listen to if they were sitting down postgaming afterwards in a bar or coffee shop just talking to each other the coaches were basically paid friends it was like 20 terrible misogyny and horrible advice and 80 just being a buddy validating emotions and struggles and being a bit of a hype man like a good friend would strip away the pseudoscience and sexism and the fact they were being paid and really wasnt that different than a pair of girls hyping someone after a breakup or a shitty date

made me wonder if these guys just really really lacked the relationships and connections that made normal life disappointments like rejections breakups whatever actually bearable
damaged girls dont respond to game okay people who have experienced a number of other men like you using the tactics you use to access sex and service are less likely to respond positively to you that makes enough sense

damaged girls are great for fwb but how do you know they dont respond to game you just told us that a feature of your system is that the damaged girls wont respond to it

girls love assholes being an asshole works on all women except for damaged girls who have experienced assholes in the past you told us that upfront

the only logical conclusion here is that the damaged girls are in fact smarter than you that is actually the only defining characteristic youve provided for them being damaged that they dont respond in the desired way to your manipulation and cruely
this should be a breakup she doesnt want to be in relationship with you 

shes tried to tell you that in a few ways and youve argued with her and refused to take the message it seems youre not going to accept that is what is happening until she is backed into a corner and snaps and like screams blood murder at you or something 

what you do now is confirm that breakup and then respect that breakup 

you stop making it so difficult for her to dump you because that is turning you into a rather stubborn and condescending asshat

stop demanding good enough reasons dont make her argue with you dont confront dont keep pushing her until she behaves badly enough or crazy enough for you to feel like you dumped her if youre unclear with what happened confirm with her whether or not you have broken up express your sadness and then wish her well

if you make it this hard for someone to leave a relationship with you youll end up stuck in unfulfilling and toxic relationships when someone wants to break up they dont need your agreement just your respect
that is probably the next best step just remember that real fairness and equity accepts that people have different circumstances and needs it doesnt mean everyones needs are weighed exactly equally

fairness is a thing you two come to agree on together but i think you need to start by being really brutally honest with yourself and him about the weight of your current circumstances and needs youre not going to get to an equitable outcome if youre not totally transparent about how serious of a need this is for you
it sounds like you need to tell him plainly that moving is quickly becoming a requirement for your longterm health and happiness its not a need like i think need a new pair of boots this winter its a need like i need to breathe 

stop invalidating yourself by pretending the situation is any less than what it is you fear cannot survive as a healthy person or as a healthy partner and mother in this house that fact is going to assert itself in your life and in your relationship 

none of that means his reasons arent valid or sensible or that his feelings dont matter its that on balance your feelings are going to sink this damn boat if they dont get addressed they just are youve done the therapy youve done the work if you could address this in another way you would you cant this is the reality for you 

you may want to involve a couples counsellor in this conversation to help you both feel heard and to trust that other has felt heard and understood as well recognize that even if you two agree to move its a longterm project
the relationship is over neither of you was happy in it

your boundaries are fine it doesnt even have to be abuse for you to decide its not acceptable for you from a partner you know this youre 36 you know youre allowed to choose what kind of relationship youll consent to be in you know grief explains challenges it doesnt change what is acceptable to you 

what is concerning here is that youre still replaying and revisiting these events if youre just a few weeks or a month or two out of the breakup that might be within normal to still be examining these experiences  but you need to stop you need to break that habit of rumination and not keep all your attention focused on your distress or a game of whatifs with a therapist if you cant manage to stop this festering yourself

obsessive reminiscence is not part of growing from an experience its just toxic and i think youre in real danger of crossing that line here from integrating to obsessing
its really hard to work on your selfesteem when you have a partner who is constantly insulting you and putting you down

after my break up i found my selfesteem was actually pretty good once i wasnt coming home every day to someone who insulted me i was just fine 

go ahead and blame him hes the problem he may not be the only problem but he is the problem right now partners arent supposed to treat you like this
yeah pearl has been around for a while peddling the standard unhinged antifeminist nonsense like women shouldnt vote and child support is financial rape plus transphobia and bodyshaming all standard uninspiring shit that was really only notable as she slowly ages out of her own declared value as a breedable human and still remains unmarried  but her followers and clout increases significantly when she started supporting tate

ive said a lot of words about her now but really unlike tate shes not got that big of an influence and isnt actually relevant i dont think shes worth platforming even to criticize we ought to ignore her like we ignore the woman from high school who just started selling a new mlm its the same behaviour basically
youre supposed to stop dating an emotionally abusive lunatic and block him everywhere so you are no longer exposed to his cruelty or his stupidity 

im sorry really i am but youre 16 and you dont deserve this shit the longer you keep this person in your life the longer it will take to heal give yourself the gift of leaning to survive a break up youll be fine soon better than fine
well at least by know he knows a bit further
yeah its not about his need just challenge that headon its about what he deserves and being able to offer others in his own life what they actually need he deserves support and a place for thoughtful reflection about difficult choices and boundaries just bottling it up means hes not giving himself the care and compassion he is worthy of and not prepared to take steps in a conscious way and that he may someday burst under that pressure and not be able to offer someone else like you or his own child what they actually do need from him
if my relationship needed that sort of protection i would choose not to be in it
yes and for jason i think this really is a sign he needs some personal support through this its great that you support him but youre biased and you should be and youre not a pro id really hope hed consider therapy for himself especially as he transitions to fatherhood himself
you and jason are in agreement about your own child and theresa so between the two of you this is settled

so really this decision should sit with him when it comes to what he says in court about his biological mother that really belongs to him if hes unsure id suggest he speak to a family therapist and get a safe supportive place to think this through and get support for the fallout from whatever he chooses

however in your position i would strongly encourage him to put olives needs first and testify against theresa having access to the child and to stop pressuring anne to have any relationship with theresa he may not be ready to cut contact and that is his choice  for his relationship but he should respect annes if she is and he should assist in the protection of olive who cannot choose for herself no more suggestion of the three of us will discuss it instead his reply to his mother should be this is annes decision for her relationship with you i am sorry to hear her choice hurts you but whatever she chooses she has my support and respect
if you dont want to date him dont date him

if he doesnt want to be on socials thats fine hes not required to be if you only want to date someone who isnt dont date him

you really gonna get bent out of shape cause he wasnt confrontational and mean to the people you wanted him to be if you are dont date him

cant respect someone who is that nonconfrontational okay dont date him 

if you think hes lying to you and sweetie he is almost certainly lying to you about deleting his socials definitely dont date him
you need to stop watching

youre never going to really know what is going on in her life or her head you are only going to make yourself miserable by continuing to follow her little drama

the world isnt fair there are lots of assholes out there who get what they want outta life if you spend your time focusing on the unanswerable questions and unfairness of it all you will stay miserable forever
if she had any actual intellectual consistency she would refuse to marry a man who didnt require her to stop her attentionseeking and argumentative online behaviour i really dont know how you square that circle to be honest how would any man she deems masculine enough not require her to drastically change her online persona and activity

but shes just in it for the money and any man she marries would be sure to cash those cheques as readily as she does and theyd make up a reason for why it was okay or theyd just claim privacy on the subject and try to continue on without addressing it at all
little known fact when flushing pepper spray out of your eyes dont rub it or use soap just move to a wellventilated area and rinse your eyes with clean water over and over again soap is good for your hands but for your eyes apply a cloth soaked in milk with as much fat content as possible to dull the pain
i dont think any sort of labourexchange or powerexchange dynamic in your relationship is the issue here

the problem here is suggesting that women in particular are only happy and loved as a women via their submission i imagine op is inexperienced and expressing herself poorly but still 

the traditional kind of submission isnt something a woman can revoke and still buy food tomorrow i dont think its the same kind of submission if you leave the house for a job and the money is your own i like a partner who is decisive and takes on their share of the mental load as well but im not submissive to them i appreciate their work and in some contexts that includes their leadership or thier dominance over a certain subject or task or decision that doesnt make them inherently dominant over me and i could revoke my agreement to that leadership at any time on any subject without being unable to provide for myself
i know shell keep getting posted here but wed all be better off ignoring pearl 

shes a troll i doubt she believes half of what she says she found a niche as the token female who will validate these men and parrot their messages and her support for tate has gotten her more views and followers than anything else shes done 

she has a very real ceiling in the manosphere in terms of income potential and shell leave it as soon as she cant make a living there
because its still a valid strategy in many communities to access power wealth and security through a man and to believe you can access more power wealth and security through that man than you can alone as a woman and if that is the strategy you want to use you traditionally pay for that with submission and service and you become very very defensive of mens general power in society because your survival strategy depends on them maintaining their special role and privileges over unmarried women and to an extent unmarried men 

its totally reasonable its just a strategy most women have rejected as far too risky its got major dangers baked in its a transaction that can fall apart very easily because submission and service dont actually buy you anything except someone elses dominance and usually more work to do it doesnt guarantee you will be provided for all your life thats a hope not a reality 

we teach our daughters independence because when one of them often through no fault of their own places their bet on the wrong man as a partner as a provider we want the damage to be minimized to her and any dependant children who will most likely be her default responsibility 

the kernel of truth in here is that lots of people men and women can have difficulty accepting affection being vulnerable and feeling worthy of love
you should date someone else

you can talk about this you can ask her what he boundaries are when it comes to dancing or dancing with men at the club but shes likely going to tell you this is a choice she is comfortable with for herself and an activity she enjoys and that she is comfortable with her boundaries with other men in the club she is likely to feel your discomfort with her dancing  especially her simply being looked at while dancing  is an accusation of wrongdoing and she is not likely to agree she is doing anything wrong

you can ask for more information from her about her opinions and activities but if its a dealbreaker for you then its on you to break the deal

if you cant get over this and this is something she enjoys and believes is acceptable in a relationship then this is probably just not someone youre compatible with

its possible she would be willing to stop going to clubs to address your discomfort with men looking at her but its unlikely and as long as she goes youre going to reasonably believe she is being looked at by other men while she dances and men are still gonna look at her that is something you need to learn to handle 

dont set yourself up to be an insecure asshole if you cant hack it opt out now
the first thing you do is locate your important documents and give them to a reliable friend or family member to hold for you your safety first your safety includes access to all important personal or financial documents you should encourage your mother to do same with copies at the very least if she doesnt feel safe moving the originals 

you may want to consider a lockable file cabinet for your own room if you intend to stay in this home with him which ideally you shouldnt you should be looking for somewhere else safe to stay and telling your mother in no uncertain terms you do not feel safe in her home so long as he is in it 

im sorry youre going through this and i understand you want to help and support your mom but likely the best thing you can do is get yourself safe so that you arent an additional weapon of control he can use against her 

one of the hardest parts of being an adult is putting your own oxygen mask on first
youre overthinking

shes told you shes busy youre not teenagers adult people can get busy for a week

on the weekend suggest a date with a time and a place

if she doesnt say yes or suggest an alternative time and place then you move on form this connection because she either isnt that into you or she just doesnt have the time to act on it and you stop waiting for her
i only have 1

but im past the wall so im probably safe
so heres the thing i believe him but hes wrong about what is happening and why 

men who actually show up for their wives while shes in hospital are treated like princes most men dont drop by for a few minutes every few days whereas wives often visit everyday for extended periods 

so sure the nurses were probably cheering and smiling at him because they mistakenly thought he wasnt an a self absorbed asshole
we know exactly what this type of guy would call her if she had let two men into her apartment in exchange for some 2 fast food cone

she saw there was no gray zone for her that night between unwelcoming and asking for it so she went with unwelcoming like any sane person would 

and his buddy knows he lost a cool friend because he tried to coerce her into a situation she judged to be an unsafe one with his creepy buddy
notice how women disproportionately also need to do the difficult emotional and practical labour of ending a relationship that is not working and is not fixable
i think  i heard an angry man say so online and it felt better than imagining women may also be people and that dating is really hard work and will be disappointing most of the time
ive met toddlers who know better when to stop saying their lies out loud and just keep quiet
peoples beliefs and ideologies especially younger peoples are heavily influenced by those closest to them you dont say shocked i am shocked s

seriously all you guys are telling me is that a you frame it as an entirely different thing when your guy friends adapt to their gfs b you probably arent dating any women over 25 and c you cannot maintain a relationship for more than a few months with someone who has differing beliefs than you

this isnt a reflection on all women its a reflection on your selection  and the one guy almost manages that logical conclusion but still slips outta his fingers
please block me always makes me laugh

its a surefire way to make sure i just ignoremute you and never ever block you cause im an adult and its really not that hard to not message someone you dont want to let me show you how its done kiddo  while i also maintain a record of your bad behaviour should i ever need an authority to respond to your escalations 

like you need to take steps to take care of my needs  while im actively being total shit to you  because i cannot possibly be expected to exercise any selfcontrol or emotional regulation
even without all the evidence as if it will ever be enough for the cultists its not a difficult indictment to read they have seven alleged victims they have records of the misleading promises of marriage and what they claimed the womans lives would look like they have the location in ilfov and evidence of surveillance and financial coercion they probably have more wiretaps then the public have heard of yet they have the porn itself and they can probably get the financial records from selling that porn these activities left a trail

this is not a thin indictment
do we need to wonder really

all the defences will boil down to the woman wanted it they agreed to it they just regret it now and playing the victim card

if youre still a tate fanboy at this point youve already made peace with the wiretaps about his trafficking and coercion and admitted criminal behavior thats baked in you have to already not care that he said he i dont think many of them are gonna draw the line at an actual rape charge all of a sudden 

tate has told them to blame the woman they are going to blame the women
dont take it personally

could be a thousand reasons and many of them not really about you

the only advice id give is that unless you are opposed to a conversation with someones other partners i might keep the questions about what that looks like until youve established more rapport and personal connection  and are talking about the howwhen of meeting the person in your position i would have asked at what point do those conversations take place so i had a sense of the boundaries and timeline and then probably shifted back into the getting to know each other chatting
beyond that dont waste your feels on this interaction its still just online dating its a mess
i continue to find it strange the only lesson they can learn from that stat is woman bad and not that a bad marriage is still generally a better deal for a man the person who is more uncomfortable is the person doing the practical  work end it
the majority of woman who leave choose financial insecurity or outright poverty over the partnership  the stats show you that clearly  but these sorts of men scream gold digger even when women only pursue the rights of the children
1972 according to this bs it was 1972
always fun

the study linked is two wharton economists editorializing in 2008 based on data from 19722005 inside the article they also link to another article on their own site from two years earlier that cites the exact same paper

its almost like they just trot this out every two years for clicks

 perhaps if we returned to a more natural traditional way of thinking about womens roles in society we would see the happiness meter spike back up

perhaps in two years well trot out this exact same survey to continue to whine that women would be happier if they fucked us and cleaned the bathroom more
as a recent grad certainly there are plenty of women at the same life stage or very recent similar experiences
