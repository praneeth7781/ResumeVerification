has anything taken over that spot i used to work there and it was such a neat buildingspace overall its a shame it closed
roadside attraction is sort of near rontoms and has a cool laidback not too loud atmosphere that isnt super romantic or explicitly datey  ive loved hanging there alone with friends with my partner and weve taken his folks there on a weekday afternoon even lots of indoor seating options with a good variety of tunes  but not too loud  and arguably one of the best outdoor patios in portland plus youre close to a lot of other spots with a good variety of atmospheres if you want to move elsewhere the bar directly next door ive only been to once or twice but i remember it being quiet and chill and youre close to hawthorne belmont division etc the nest is semi close and another fun spot that isnt super romantic but is definitely a vibe close to what you describe
they did this for us last week at port orleans fq i believe this is standard at most of the on property hotels  if your room doesnt come with a microwave it is available upon request when available it was great to heat up our ohana leftovers without having to walk to the main building
is there a particular part of town youd like to go with this will help folks narrow it down quite a bit

x200b

im a big fan of roadside attraction in se  beautiful super cool reasonably quiet outdoor patio and its never insanely loud inside plenty of room to spread out in little alcoves cash only though  atm readily available however  so keep that in mind

the nest can be a fun spot too  lots of different rooms to spread out in and find some privacy decent outdoor seating and they have pool and some random games laying around if you want an activity theres some other bars within walking distance but i wouldnt call most of them quietas good for conversation
him wanting better communicating and better behaviors during arguments for the both of you isnt him punishing you and the fact that youre looking at it that way says everything about your emotional maturity  or lack thereof 

i also wouldnt want to travel with someone i am currently not seeing functional healthy mature communication and conflict resolution with most people wouldnt you dont want to shell out money arrange a trip be out of town and if a fight breaks out have to deal with the unpleasant unhealthy ways those unfold its not just about the walking away it seems like  he wants to get to a place where youre both communicating and resolving problems together better as a couple before being in a position where youre away from home together for extended periods   
traveling together makes it difficult to take space  be that a few minutes to a few hours of a break or be it a few days you are largely stuck together and being in a fight can ruin a lot of plans travel responsibilities etc travel is stressful enough as it is its perfectly mature and reasonable to want to get to a better place together before putting yourself repeatedly in that situation

the fact that youre looking at things as a how much good do i have to do before im rewarded with what i want instead of as the two of you working together to improve your relationship and communication  not just for your wantsdesire to travel but for the longevity of your relationship and bond as a couple  is incredibly selfcentered and immature   
the fact that youre even asking if you should discuss this further with him or just walk away entirely for someone who will go along with your desires makes it seem like you really dont value this relationshiphim much either
yeah growing up in hillsboro the shitty speakerfreezer vans you describe were decently consistent in the few summer months we get but that was about it definitely no nicer trucks  and i honestly havent even heard a single shitty one in all my years in inner se either
i hope it does too it wouldve been a great benefit for those of us who are childless and dont want to run to the lockers a bunchare hindered by disabilities too
it is

you definitely want to make sure and ship all your stuff at once because you will be charged a fee every time otherwise  it always caps at 3995 and if you forget one thingfind an impulse buy after its usually no more than 510 but to get the most out of the tiered shipping you definitely want to just wait and send it all together at once

x200b

for those who arent familiar with the offering another few points

the other thing to remember is that you need to have all your receipts at time of shipping  so if youre typically unorganized with those are prone to throwing them away etc youll want to prepare we bring a tiny baggy and neatly fold all receipts into it as we go so none get lostdamagedforgotten about they can look up receipts if youve misplaced one but it can take a while and if you paid cash its a lot harder

another note is that you can only ship disney items  so mitsukoshi in the japan pavilion the china gift shop and a few other epcotdisney springs locations cannot be shipped if they are not disney ownedconsidered disney merch you also cannot ship popcorn buckets or ogas cantina specialty glasses  like the rancor flight  and i believe trader samsother dining location specialty mugs cannot be shipped either   
but those are really the only exceptions and nearly everything on property is able to be shipped 

a final note  you always want to believe nothing will happen with your shipped items but in the rare case that something is damagedloststolen during transit if it is out of stock it will be refunded to you rather than replaced  so if its something extremely rarehard to get you may want to consider that if youd be devastated if something happened this also means that if you pay in cash you will receive that money back to a gift card  whereas debitcredit is back to your original payment method  so thats something to think about when planning merch purchases also
agreed  i went once in 2013 for one ridiculously stressful busy day and twice as a decently young kid so i never experienced some of those nowgone amenities but hey  its still awesome and there are still a lot of great benefits to enjoy

we love the shiptohome merch service and use it every time it would be amazing if they did the parkstoresorts delivery again  and maybe they will one day my understanding is its still a staffing issue  but not having it doesnt really bother us much since we never experienced it prior   
we just plan our merch shopping around runs to the locker and then its a quick ride back to the onproperty resort with our hauls we load it all up on the last day of the trip and take it to the resort gift shop and they ship everything all at once for 3995  and its insured so if it shows up damaged or gets loststolen in transit they will refundreplace depending on stock cant imagine trying to pack everything up in a suitcase and worrying about more fragile items it rocks
definitely not has never been free its based on total value of items and caps at a 3995 shipping charge  which is why youd be best off waiting to ship all trip merch at once but it is an option for any number of items at most shops on property
parks to room is simply not an option now
your first point is not accurate as this is no longer available at disney world as far as im aware  still has not been brought back or given a timeline for returning only ship to home is available
if his mutt and current job come first thats his choice and well within his rights to prioritize what matters to him but that leaves you down the list and if it were me i wouldnt be jumping through hoops and moving to accommodate someone who cant even make me a priority over a fucking dog and scheduling conflicts 
your family will be there when you break up would you rather be close to them or have to try to move a third time when this doesnt work out 
if his job is a priority perhaps yours should be too  meaning dont quit to run back and accommodate him
i guess for me as a diagnosed narcoleptic i dont really see the point in what youre suggesting

i suppose if you dont have narcolepsy and the testing there rules it out you can stop pushing for a sleep study in the usdirect your energy elsewhere  so in that regard it may be useful

but if you do have narcolepsy  or ih  and the test results will be useless back home for treatmentmedicationa legitimate diagnosis then youve just wasted timemoneyenergy and will no doubt be more frustrated having to continue to push for proper coverage in the us

if it were me i would continue to push for a proper sleep study in the us  
its not impossible to get covered if your doctors genuinely feel it is appropriate and you are genuinely showing symptoms   
yes you will have to rule a lot of other things out first but thats a good thing  and frankly we all had to go through it you are not special in that regard theres no cheat code to jump through the steps  
a proper diagnosis in the us will be needed to get proper treatment  and to have those medications covered some of us were able to begin certain medications  like lower doses of stimulants  before a completed study and while the process can be long and unpleasant to get the study approvedscheduledcompletedget the results back it is worth it when you consider that it means you will be able to receive lifelong care for these issues   


it sounds like theres a chance that this sudden onset of symptoms came from something elsemay not be narcolepsy  unless im misunderstanding what youre saying i apologize   
i would continue to explore everything else it could possibly be you dont want to have narcolepsy there are many other things that cause similar symptoms and i would pray that you find the answer in one of them because its truly a crippling life sentence to have this disease

if you dont feel your doctor is listening to you fully or you feel they are creating unnecessary barriers to getting a sleep study scheduled and covered i suggest getting a second  and third  opinion you dont have to stay with a doctor you feel isnt best serving your needs  and there are doctors out there who will be more than happy to help you get a study scheduled if you truly seem to be showing the signs
i would think that theres definitely a difference when you were a resident of a place and receiving consistent care and monitoring vs somewhere you decided to seek out specifically to motivate a diagnosis as a tourist and there is a huge difference between a short term disability claim and a full valid diagnosis for which you will receive medication and continued insurance coverage i would not assume these situations to be similar whatsoever

you definitely need to speak with your insurance first at minimum i would also speak with any doctorsspecialists you plan on seeing for thismedication management i would not be the least bit surprised if they tell you that no testing you receive as a tourist of a foreign country with different regulations testing standards and practices is not valid for american insurance and medication
you more than likely will find a lot of resistance from your insurance and any american doctors you see if you try to bring those test resultsa perceived diagnosis to them form mexico i can all but guarantee most doctors will require you to test again in a facility they approvework with before giving you controlled substance medications and your insurance may require this as well 

im happy to be wrong about this but given some of my own experiences with trying to get care outside of the usual options this was the biggest barrier any care outside of the country was rendered useless and testing needed to be redone to be considered valid
i would speak with your american insurance and care team to see what they would think of this first unless youre going to attempt to get 100 of your care in mexico 100 of the time  and somehow manage to get all your medication from there consistently too  this may not be the hack you think it is
this is it for me  if it was in a desirable location and the taxes and such werent crazy possibly but any money is too much money for me to live in ga
oh believe me im guilty of trying to cram way too much in every time but ive been getting better at it
i get this panic like what if we never come back what if  is gone and ive had to learn to set my expectations more realistically and prioritize a couple of musts and leave the rest to chance so i can relax and actually enjoy 
i knew there was a good chance wed miss grogu entirely given the randomness of his appearances so promised myself it wouldnt ruin my trip if we missed him but i was pretty bummed after two days in the heat wave with no sightings in the end disney magic works out sometimes and im glad we saw him but wish disney set up his meet a bit better 
haha thank you  
it was definitely a bit of an ordeal but worth it to me no shame
shulas was great but pricey 
sanaa is a must do steak every trip plus the bread service and beauty of akl 
for steaksimilar the kona braised short ribs at kona cafe are always a mustdo for us too 

people are ignoring outside the parks with le cellier but i wanted to comment on that anyway and say we were massively disappointed in le cellier and would never go back wildly overpriced terrible atmosphere awful service and mediocre food the steak wasnt bad  and we loved the poutine  but for the overall price it wasnt worth it even remotely and weve had better elsewhere on property for half the cost  wasnt worth eating up park time
we have both attempted to reach out to each other but it never went very far its clear that too much time has passed  about 3 years or so  and the hurt was too big on both sides to have just let it pass 
ive tried to initiate talking about things but it was never followed through on he did as well  first in fact  but then fell out of contact again for months and clearly wasnt interested in making time when i followed up 
he wished me well at christmas which i wasnt expecting but it was very brief and felt odd some things just cant be fixed
i always mean to try the chicken but pass on it because the steak is so dang good sanaa is fantastic i regret not making a trip over there on my visit last week
that bums me out to hear we ate there december 2022 and again last week and it was worth every penny absolutely fantastic

kona is a good choice too  the short rib is one of my favorite dishes on earth  but i miss the endless noodles over there
i agree with all of this  set the boundary and offer her an opportunity to chat if you feel you miss the friendship and want to hear her out 
this will give you the final ultimate closure  she either cant agree with the boundary and you know its truly over and for the best or you both talk and work through some things and either end up in each others lives again or decide to part ways having hashed it out 
i wouldnt put a big apology in a letter myself and would prefer to say it to the person  she may be feeling the same way but only sheyou can know that as you move forward guessingassuming does nothing productive here 


my situation was very different but ill add anyway
during the pandemic i had a falling out with a dear friend of mine who i had known since i was 8 over 20 years who i went to for everything  and them me  and who was like family we knew each others parents etc 
as a result we no longer speak and the friendship has largely ended 
we messaged a couple times a year ago and both acknowledged we missed each other wish things wouldve gone differently wanted to catch up sometime and it just faded out and never came to be 
i think we both realize our wrongs during that time but also still feel hurt by the other person and cant just put it aside and ask to go back to the friendship 
that said i would give anything to repair that relationship if they sent me a letter like you describe i would absolutely give them a chance and if it didnt work out at least id know we both gave it a shot 
a friendship of that length means something and its clear you do miss it at least a bit in my opinion its worth the risk of chatting  and setting your boundaries  and giving repair a chance if only to know that there was no real opportunity in the first place
they were there this last monday 

but let me tell you it was a pain trying to see them last week

i am obsessed with grogu this entire trip was about meeting him we had 2 hollywood studios days booked and ended up having to squeeze a third in on our flight home day because we failed to meet him the first two 


he has no set times as a rule of thumb if its raining at all or a storm is brewing he isnt coming out 
originally i was told he doesnt come out after 5 but from my three days last week i would say he doesnt come out after 4 

he comes out about once an hour maybe if all conditions are right and he comes out for maybe 1015 minutes at a time no line no photopass he has a handler and mando picks who he wants to interact withget a photo with you cant touchhold grogu but hes amazing and makes faces and noises and is perfect 

mando always will come out from the alcove in between rise of the resistance and the market thats where he exits to go backstage as well 

he sometimes goes into the market but when i saw him monday he came out the alcove walked to the umbrellasseating across from the market near the bushes  on the other side of the shipsrise area  and interacted with guests for just shy of 10 minutes then went back in didnt go towards the market at all 

i sat in the heat for 4 hours last tuesday in the same spot right by where he comes out from the back waiting for him only for him to never show  and ruined the rest of my night because i overheated and got very sick 

thursday i missed him by literally 5 minutes at 330 and he never came out again

monday i saw him at 129 he went back in at 138 and he never came out again  it started lightly sprinkling at 230 i sat there after he left until it became actual rain at 245 and rained the rest of the day so there was no point in trying for another encounter 

cast members all said they have no idea what times he comes out and it is entirely random  its never always 30 after for example but they all echoed that you need to get there early  starting at 11 or 12 at least and for your best shots they said  and you need to sit planted by that alcove because the second you leave and do something else for a second you are likely to just miss him 

its a hassle and i hate that they dont schedule such an amazing character that so many of us want to meet if they were smart hed be in the launch bay where hes protected from the elements kids cant rush the animatronic and cause problems and everyone gets a chance

that said it was worth it to me i felt like a little kid i was literally squealing with joy i had my 11 inch grogu plush in a little bag with some vacation flair on and mando said grogu approves and took photos with us while grogu smiled and made happy sounds 
literally a moment ill never forget im still riding the high of that encounter
im sorry to hear you had to have an encounter like that but im so glad they were able to get you the care you needed and you had a good experience with them

that was my thought too  in my city youre lucky if anyone shows up at all during an emergency and if they do its an hour or more at least disney is on top of emergencies instantly you have great odds and great care available to you there
people with narcolepsy also have severe painful insomnia as a symptom of this horrible disease and the sleep we do get isnt really sleep  im medically incapable of ever getting restful restorative sleep im severely severely disabled by this liferuining debilitating prison sentence of a disease its pretty insensitive to act like there are any benefits to this and no i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy
ha i didnt even notice thank you 
aww thank you  i try my best when i can
im so glad it helped and that youre feeling better today its amazing what a good night of rest can do
i hope you have a fantastic day and that youre able to quickly replace such a scary experience with some happy memories and feelings today 
take care 
not at all the taun taun has buzz button foam which causes a tingling the bespin fizz wasnt so much something youd feel in your mouth as a dry ice effect
im sorry you had to witness that seeing someone in that state can be very scary and traumatic especially if youve never been in a situation like that before 
if theres someone you can talk to  family support system therapist  please do when you can everyone processes these things differently and it can sit with you for a while in some very dark and upsetting ways 



the truth of life is that there are no guarantees  everything can end at any moment with no warning 


this is something that used to really scare me and i spent many years depressed over that lack of control and the fragility of everything


these days it is something i keep in mind and is why i choose to cherish each moment 


i dont wait to do things that i feel are important  like traveling to disney with my partner for example 


there is no guarantee of tomorrow and i want to live my life to the fullest and leave my loved ones with good memories to reflect on when i am gone 



im not going to try to put a happy spin on someone having an emergency like this at disney but at the very least there are worse places to have an emergencygo 



if it were me i would choose to imagine that he pulled through 


disney is very on top of emergencies in the parks and theres no doubt in my mind he received the fastest best care available and that those with him were cared for and given every courtesy possible to make it through the scary event 



while you could possibly reach out to guest services  especially if youre still on propertywill be tomorrow  and explain what happened and ask for some comfort or information i highly doubt they would tell you  or be allowed to tell you  if he had indeed passedwhat the actual outcome was however knowing disney they will do everything they can to comfort you and try to put you in a better mindset about the event its worth reaching out for that peace of mind even if theyre limited in what info theyre allowed to share 



please be kind to yourself and try not to dwell on what you saw 

the worst thing you can do for yourself in a situation like this is ruminate on these thoughts or try to replay the scene in your head instead take deep breaths try to distract yourself with positive memories from the day get some rest and try to shift this negative energy into positive by focusing on your loved ones and the wonderful place you are in and make more happy memories together tomorrow 


best wishes to you 
ah yes just spend the crazy amount it costs to move out of state and come to portland a place youre completely unfamiliar with where the cost of living sucks housing inventory is a mess and the city seriously sucks perfect solution when youre already broke
if you dont think massive corporations who make money off each guest having the best experience possible want to be able to fit as many guests of as many sizes as possible on their rides i dont know what to tell you
theyre doing the best they can with what is physically possible and safe do we not recall recent news of a very large individual dying on a ride he never shouldve been on due to safety standards just because it doesnt agree with your views doesnt mean safety standards arent real this is ridiculous 

disney as a business is motivated to give the best experience to as many guests as possible so they keep spending money  not being able to fit on rides doesnt achieve this if it was possible theyd do it in fact there are very very few rides at disney again for example that large people cant fit on a local carnival doesnt have the funding nor resources that a company like disney does and will have more limitations as a result this again is a no brainer 
your lack of logic doesnt trump facts sorry safety standards arent inclusive enough for your liking but that doesnt mean there isnt a reason for them or companies just arent trying hard enough and to think otherwise is childish and delusional
disney is an example someone else mentioned them as an example as well if disney  one of the largest companies on earth with amusement park rides  has limitations for weight and size due to ride safety despite wanting to serve the most guests as possible you better believe small carnivals like this one have the same if not more limitations given scale and budget 

think of how much better the world could be if people accepted that not everything is judgmental or not inclusive enough and that in reality there are limitations and safety regulations  and just because you dont like them doesnt mean they arent real and necessary
as if places like disney wouldnt want to be able to fit the most paying guests possible given the limitations of engineering for their rides to operate safely its not about judging peoples bodies you people are delusional
ahh yes safety regulation how dare they inclusivity is waaaay more important 
100 agree 

all the mentalemotional baggage i feel i need to now carry  good grief op seriously seek therapy 
youd think he just told you something criminal the way youre acting you have some serious insecurities you need to address and none of them are on him or about his actions its all internal with you

the man has had sex before oh no but wait so have you 
it doesnt matter how many partners anyone has had their value as a partner hasnt changed and it doesnt mean they cant value a current relationship just as strong as someone with less experience this is such a judgmental close minded childish mindset to have 
if hes been a great partner for 8 months up to this point what difference does things in the past make to that 
he hasnt cheated on you hes still the same person he was before you knew 
if he still wanted to be out there having those same types of encounters i promise you he would  he determined it wasnt for him and he values you and your dynamic which is why hes in a relationship with you now 

if your sexual boundaries are that you will only pursue a relationship with someone who has remained sexually sheltered and pure enough by your standards thats fine  its your right to set whatever standards you want for a partner however based in insecurity they may be  and if thats the case for you then yes you need to break up and pursue someone who has kept to themselves enough to meet your ideals but dont make it about him or what hes done  its 100 about you and your close minded views on past sexual encounters 
if that makes you incompatible it is what it is but he didnt do anything wrong 

the older you get youre going to find that men youre dating have gasp had sex with other women probably a good number of them and explored a bit along the way its part of life and youre going to be hard pressed to find men as you approach your 30s who have hardly been with anyone  unless you seek out very religious partners but they probably wouldnt accept your sexual explorations so 

just because someone has a lot of sex doesnt mean they dont value it or seek connection through it or any of that it doesnt mean they cant be monogamous either your own insecurities are blowing this out of proportion and assigning meaning to something where it isnt  hes had a lot of sex all that means is hes had a lot of sex
if hes a good man and respects you and loves you thats whats important 

i highly suggest you seek therapy most people dont jump from my partner of 8 months has revealed their normal sexually active past to me to this is heavy baggage and im breaking down and feeling sick and this means he cant value sex at all and is incapable of monogamy
their email address usually is quick to respond i would write in with your reference number and other info and ask for the tracking number which they can give you alongside an estimated arrival date mychoice is easy and free to set up as well if youre worried about it  my area is a package theft hub so i always have to be on top of it
sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt it worked for me searching via reference number in july 2020 it hasnt worked since and ive shipped from the parks maybe 8 times since ive had to either callemail or use ups mychoice every time
if you go to tracking on upscom it should have a track by reference number in blue and underlined below the tracking box if it doesnt work youll need to reach out to them or sign up for mychoice  easy and free and then youll get an email and itll show on your account dashboard when it ships and is scheduled for delivery
you said it isnt disney  so did it ship from a ds shop or mitsukoshi 
or did you ship it via disney did they give you one of those forms with a reference number and disney merchandising contact info in the upper left or was it something else

if you shipped it with mitsukoshi there should be a tracking number somewhere on the receipt or form they gave you if not reach out to them via email and ask for tracking
if it was disney you dont get a tracking number unless you call them or email them and ask  but if you have ups mychoice or sign up for it with the addressnameemail you gave them ups will automatically email you when the package ships and let you know when its coming
if it was on disney property its with disney even if they arent directly running the merchandising  they surely arent allowing a store to run in disney springs or epcot that is ripping off customers this is a no brainer


im assuming youre talking about mitsukoshi which again is a legitimate business that disney ensures isnt scamming customers out of their parks pavilion and which has a legitimate customer service websiteemailcontact 
ive had countless things shipped by them with no issues and they replaced our swords at no cost in rapid time when something was damaged by ups
then literally why would you purchase in the first place if youre just going to assume its a scam and wont ship

and i doubt youve had this experience with disney because they definitely always ship and their merchandising department is beyond on top of things and helpful
and what has given you any indication that that couldve possibly happened
why on earth would buying an item from the park and paying to ship it home  something people do daily if not hourly there  make you think youve been ripped off this is such an unnecessarily accusatory post for a simple legitimate business transaction and you have zero reason to believe anything suspicious has happened
man must be nice

mushrooms make me abundantly more aware of just how terrible my health is nothing breaks through the severity of my narcolepsy
it 100 is so many options and all of them knock dlr out of the park
yeah its very much a luck thing ive never once gotten sick at disney even visiting during the more pandemicy times  and cant think of a time ive gotten sick from travel anywhere for that matter 


my immune system is terrible i generally get sick frequently throughout the year to varying degrees  but always at home when im doing littlenothing  and i have severe disabilities including one that compromises my immune system


was on a direct flight from the west coast two rows away from a child with the most disgusting sounding cough of all time over a week ago still fine now  its impossible to predict who will get sick or why and frankly i dont worry about it when you spend your entire life disabled and exhausted 247 its easier to accept that you cant control things and just take it as it comes instead of wasting what little enjoyable time you have worrying
which isnt to say that i dont wash my hands or anything i do maintain regular hygiene habits but im long done with masking i dont sanitize constantly and im not trying to create a bubble around me in public  or panicking when others seem unclean in my vicinity

the whole everything is filthy111 clean constantly111 is just not how i choose to live you cant eradicate 100 of the germs around you and many people still get sick even with all the over the top prevention measures  im on vacation to relax and get away not glove up and spend a week in a neurotic episode over a potential germ
if youre not into role play it seems like it wouldnt be that much of a value for you i havent gone but from everything ive watched and read


part of why we decided not to go when we originally had booked for december was the fact that we are not big role play people  improv isnt our thing and we cringe at a lot of that stuff in the moment and cant just dive into it  and the itinerary really relies on you being engaged in the story fully 247 we do get into costuming for ge but the level of interactive improv on the starcruiser seemed a bit much for our comfort levels 

coupled with the exhausting schedule  i have narcolepsy i cant get up at 8am and be gogogogo  it wasnt justifiable for us even though were a 10000 on the fan scale 

i regret canceling a bit now that its closing because it does look amazing and there may never be another thing like it  and we love ge  but for the cost it seems you need to be very into role play to get your moneys worth of the experience
people acting like it made things complicated or confusing or like it was forcing them to overplan boggle my mind
it takes 5 seconds to make a park pass reservation its easy straightforward and they explain it  and tell you you need it  in countless places 
dining and fast pass reservations have been a thing for ages  you werent just able to waltz in and do everything without putting a single thought to it before nor is it realistic to think thats how a vacation like this would ever work adding a quick i want to visit this park first reservation to it doesnt somehow make it a huge hassle
i dont mean this to taunt you rather im hoping that putting things very bluntly will motivate some self reflection on your part 


how little self respect must you have to not only stay with someone who cant even accomplish the most basic human upkeep and maintenance but consider staying with them if they lie to you about it on top of that 

showering and not smelling like shit is the bare minimum its not a wild boundary or expectation to have or set 99 of people do this without needing to think about it  its just a given a core part of their routine
how you can even stand to be around someone like this is beyond me its disgusting rewarding this filthgoblin with sex and affection is truly mindboggling  99 of people would run from this man the second he refused to showeruse deodorant the first time not reward him with sex and a relationship 

the fact that youre even asking what if he lies says a lot here you need to do some soul searching and figure out why youre okay with these behaviors and are willingly choosing a relationship with someone most people wouldnt want to share an enclosed space with you even say it doesnt seem mental health related  thats even more of a reason you shouldve laid down a firm ultimatum about cleanliness standards long ago and left if it didnt improve 
therapy sounds like a good path for you
uh yeah it absolutely is

i am fucking disabled im at a major disadvantage vs those who are not disabled im weaker physically mentally and can do far less my life is substantially harder and i am substantially more miserable if thats not a weakness i dont know what is
im sick of people trying to reframe disabilities as a positive or not that bad or something that makes you you or any of that 
its a horrible constantly draining curse its a lifelong prison sentence there is no positive here and its not offensive to me when people see it that way  because thats the way it is
this is not the case for tron as i said 

they may be flexible in some circumstances  they were for me but i had a das related reason for being late  but dont bet on it it is being strictly enforced in most cases watched them turn people away numerous times and it has been posted many times here that this is the case
this is blatantly false 

you have a one hour window after your group is called and for tron it is absolutely being enforced in manymost cases they are more flexible with early group numbers as long as you head to tron the second you get into the park but even then some people have been turned away
if it was a value resort youd never stay there would be booked up forever  or the theming would be lackluster and not as appealing like aoaall stars
stimulant medications used for narcolepsy treatment are also a problem with this wide variance in side effects and effectiveness  some generics im fine others i will have 30 debilitating migraine days in a row and fall asleep in the showerdrivingwalkingdoing anything
it makes dlr feel so tiny and lackluster to me honestly i had leaving disneyland and being in a pretty unappealing stretch of anaheim part of the appeal and magic of wdw is being immersed in the experience and having beautifully maintained wonderful resortsfoodplaces to relax all around you vs walking out to all the gross chaos
100 its such an abusive ride  
i always do it because oh its space mountain i have to and i always regret it the disneyland sm isnt even the best ride on earth but in comparison to wdw 
feels like im trying to hoist myself up and crawl out of the crypt on the exit always glad theres stuff to see in the edit hall because i spend a solid 510 collecting my sanity there 
everest is definitely something to work your way up to if youre coaster resistant 

the commenter you responded to is probably good to give it a go but op it wouldnt be my first or second choice for overcoming a fear of coasters
i ride it every trip and every trip i hoist myself out of the ride car stumble to the exit and say i think that took 20 years off my life
its a beautiful ride but the backwards sensation is intense  for mesome at least  and the yeti soundsoverall pace makes me very tense 
that said its very fun and i never skip it but its definitely a lot to handle 


also on a side note space mountain  wdw version anyway  while not as intense feels like it takes 50 years off my life and leaves me feeling shaken and abused 
oh 100 i am pretty antikids in general so im usually very good at weaving in and out and dodging them but man wish it wasnt like an obstacle course  where children are the obstacles  99 of the time thats why lateclosing time is the best
this comment was a wild ride 

ahem

thats a pretty hilarious story though i love mr toads and loved it as a kid but im also a weirdo and my parents had no concept of age appropriate so that may be why im pretty surprised it has survived with the hellscene but im glad its still there
no lies detected i am with you 
agreeing with the person you asked  the empty beautifully lit peaceful park on the way out after close is so special you can really take in the lights and the music and slow down  and not have people running into you or ramming you with strollers  and its just really comforting and relaxing 
plus you can get some great photos without the crowds in the background
there are too many things to factor in to call lower cost of living in itself a net positive 

you have to factor in things like having family nearby established support circle nearby general absurd cost of moving to a new state losing benefits moving to a new state  such as expanded medicaid in some states or food stamps  not being able to establish a healthcare team of comparable accessibility or quality in a new place etc etc etc 

i rely on medicaid to survive and live in a high cost of living area im barely making it and its only getting worse all the time but i cant move somewhere without expanded medicaid nor can i move somewhere id lose my food stamps access to my specialists  it can take years to get in and established with new care teamsmedical groups for all kinds of things  and thats just the tip of it 
the rent may be lower but ill drown either way so yeah thats why a lot of us stay put this whole move to lower cost of living areas is the illusion of choice for many of us poor folks  its not ever truly on the table
all the time 

sometimes it hits me harder or longer than others but it never fails to throw a blanket of sadness over me no matter what im doing

i lost my stepdad very unexpectedly last january and it has been hard to come to terms with the finality of this loss and all the missed opportunities i shouldve taken when he was alive to do more and spend more time together 


this week a few times it was i wouldve loved to have gifted him  

last week i was driving to the store and heard a song from a musician he really liked that i was excited to show him 

i had a really bad one a few weeks back when i was daydreaming about how cool it would be to get to go on a trip with him and my mom some day but that day wont come and my mom will never get to have those experiences with him again and how must she feel every day if this is how im feeling now

it happens all the time it never feels good i try to treasure that they are still on my mind and imagine how they wouldve felt about the thing i wanted to share but it hardly makes it any easier

im so sorry for your loss
insomnia is 100 possible with narcolepsy dont let anyone tell you otherwise or act like you may not really have it because you cant fall asleep at 8pm 

a huge part of this shitty illness is not being able to sleep when you want to but being exhaustedneeding sleep at inappropriateunwanted times
in some places theres fee caps or like here in portland for as horrible as this shithole city is they at least have a first come first serve ordinance for applications
100 doing better is knowing that you are not in a place to provide a stable financially secure better life to a child whatsoever

im not saying children raised in poverty cant have a good life but as someone who lived through it as a kid the bad moments were far more frequent than any good i can truly say i wouldve rather not known life given the choice than deal with the instability food insecurity financial worries etc 
growing up poor often means starting life as an adult poor too  i was set up for a lifetime of pain and suffering especially ending up disabled my mom is still struggling and impoverished 

the way to do better here is to know that its not the time to do at all
i absolutely would it has been a dream of mine since i was a kid

i know that the outsider perspective is a lot different than what it is actually like to work there but ive worked plenty of majorly shitty publicfacing jobs and i understand the downsides of working at a place like disney with so many guests shitty entitlement etc

when i was a kid i dreamed of being an imagineer i wouldve loved to work with animatronics ride development attraction decor type stuff but i also grew up poor and im disabled so it was never really going to be on the table for me 

i would still love to work in the parks but i am heavily tattooed and have a severe disability so the opportunity wont ever arise for me

that said in imagination land i would move to floridacalifornia in a heartbeat to work at disney assuming i could find a reasonable place to live close enough to commute from  
florida would be tough for me with the extreme climate  ive lived in the pacific northwest for over a decade hot aint a thing like there over here  but i have really good friends there that i wish werent on the opposite side of the country from me  
i lived in san diego as a kid and would love to move back so disneyland would probably be the better hypothetical choice for me but the cost of living is nuts and i much prefer world to land no competition

sure the pay isnt great and cast members definitely deserve so much more but its not impossible to make work  especially if you work up to or land a higher paying role

i obviously cant say from experience but my thought would be that it doesnt ruin the magic it just changes what the magic means  you become the magic and providing that to guests is im sure what makes some of the shittier aspects easier to deal with even if only a little  
ive had some really great talks about it with some cast members  usually photopass or ogas staff when theyre not busy and can chat for longer periods  and there are those who definitely dont visit the parks as much because of aspects of the job but there are just as many ive talked to who genuinely seem to love everything about working there visit often etc  
funny enough i ran into a photopass guy we had at hollywood studios a couple days later when we were walking around pop century he was there with his lady they were grabbing lunch at disney springs i believe mightve been popping into the parks for a ride or something they seemed just as cheery and thrilled to be on property as he did joyfully making our photo experience special everything in life is what you make it truly
i have had luck asking a cast member for alternatives when the ll is too long and will defeat the purpose of das for me and they will often allow me to go in the wheelchair entrance  there still may be a small wait but its much more manageable and im not crammed in with hundreds of ll folks 

not always but it doesnt hurt to ask
sometimes theyve offered to allow my partner to wait in the line while i wait out front and then the cast member bring me through the queue when hes a few guests away from boarding but this hasnt worked for my needs so we havent tried it
it still wouldnt be instant access you waited on the app already das people have to wait twice and potentially twice as long if not more
the purpose of das in part is to allow people who cant wait in a traditional line to still access attractions 
having them wait in a physical line that can be horrendous because its the damn lightning lane line defeats this purpose entirely especially when weve already had to wait in the virtual line when we book the attraction
for those of us who cant wait in a longer traditional line its a nightmare  having waited a long time already on the app just to turn up and still have it be inaccessible for you because of your disabilities sucks
yep exactly 

i take a controlled substance medication it is necessary for my survival  and honestly the safety of others if im out and about potentially  and is the only way i can function at all my illness is cripplingly severe a horrible disability i wouldnt inflict on my worst enemy and is still barely manageable with medication but without the meds i would have no life at all and likely wouldve died years ago 

i 100 need the medication i have a legitimate diagnosed illness with more than enough medical records to prove or validate the severity of my symptoms and disability and have used it for many years 100 responsibly 


but even though theres no question my need for the medication is legitimate and consistent because its a controlled substance i have to be extremely careful at all times when visiting a doctorurgent carehospital for anything
there is such a stigma against these medications and some medical professionals have such a shitty view towards them and the patients who take them that you have to be constantly aware that a worker may take anything you say and spin it against you at any time in a way that seriously fucks up your treatment plan may keep you from getting the meds you need and that youll be very limited in ways to fight back against
not just obvious things like mentions of drug use or mental health woes  anything 
the laws around these meds in many ways create serious terrible barriers for people who genuinely need them in an attempt to keep people who dont from having them either im not saying there shouldnt be regulations to keep them from misuse but the general attitude towards these medspeople using them sucks 
those of us who need them are in constant worry of doing anything wrong that could cause a doctor to ruin my life over stigmaprejudices
and for those people a cartoony card is going to make a difference 
how would that play out i know youre being rude and denying i have a disability but here read this
this 100

i dont care how great the owner is or how much time and effort gets put into training

it isnt worth the risk

there are how many other dog breeds available no one needs one of these

when something happens and it maulskills another person pet child etc  its too late

and it happens constantly

its always the pit that was trained well or never hurt a fly or is lovely sweet kind gentle and a giant baby

your want to take a chance on this breed is not ever somehow more important than the lives and safety of the people and pets around you  because unforeseen events do happen all the time and theres no taking that back

you as an owner are never going to out love out train out discipline out socialize out whatever else genetics and breed traits

breed traits exist gameness exists the general lack of selfpreservation and oh time to stop in these animals exists

if you live in the middle of nowhere with a fence that cant be crawledjumped overunder without any living humanspets around you then sure feel free to take a chance like this whatever

but the amount of people who see no problem with this level of selfish entitlement deciding to take a risk like this at the potential expense of everyone around them ugh

x200b

edit before it happens let me just state  i am not going to argue with anyone about this im not here to debate your feelings on how great the breed is or who is really at fault for whatever dont care save your breath pit bull literally mauled people thats the facts in this post  and in endless posts every day because its happening constantly and its always brutal and if youre thinking about arguing with me to defend these things given all that ooooof
im not sure if links are allowed here  if it gets removed before you see it let me know and i will dm it to you but this is the group i personally use i have used them 15 times with a handful of different owners and have never had any issues  if you have any questionswould like some recommendations for ownersproperties let me know

x200b

you are correct due to the nature of these types of reservations davids does not allow cancellationsrefunds you will be very hard pressed to find a dvc rental service offering cancellations  and id be cautious if i did see one as it would make me question the legitimacy

the workaround for this would be to get travel insurance  davids suggests you do this i believe on the page outlining their cancelation policy

alternatively if you have any credit cards that offer extra purchase protections or travel protections you may be able to feel more safe in your booking by using one of those cards to pay for the reservation many cards offer some type of purchase and possibly even travel protection its a good idea to research this just to see what is available to you

i personally have never had to deal with this because i havent had to cancel a trip partially why i prefer to wait to book until closer to i will usually book flights much earlier park passes dining etc but wait on the nonrefundables until i know for sure it will all come togetherlike you said things do happen though  travel insurance is never a bad idea perhaps you would feel more comfortable booking something that can be canceled until your kiddo is a bit olderyou arent as concerned but again there are many things you just cant plan for so its definitely a risk to take

some dvc owners may allow you to cancel the reservation so long as you leave enough time for them to resell and book someone else but i havent seen that super often some may be accommodating in case of legitimate emergency but dont advertise that leniency to avoid cancelations all depends on who you deal with
i used davids to stay at the polynesian in december of 2020 and they were great completely legitimate no hidden fees or hassle everything just as it says on the website great customer service  at least in my experience  and the process though it asks a lot of questions is very easy being able to put in for multiple resorts and know the price estimate before hand is really nice and they have killer deals on confirmed reservations sometimes

we had an amazing stay with zero mishaps and got an absolutely unreal price for our visit i highly recommend them and would absolutely use them again

i personally go direct through dvc owners now using a very active facebook group but thats not in any way because of anything davids vacation rental did or didnt do  ive just found better availability and sometimes better prices when booking more last minute  say 35 months out  through renting direct  and sometimes not even davids usually has better prices on the resorts that we prefer but they are not always as available and you should probably book 6ish months in advance whereas sometimes i prefer to wait on dropping that much cash until ive planned everything else out 100 

  
i always check davids before committing to any direct rentals and will absolutely opt to book with them next time if they have the priceavailability i need

  
with direct booking you also run the risk of dealing with someone unsavory or who causes a problem  intentionally or otherwise even though you can read their reviewsvouches things can always happen whereas its a lot less likely for a company who has been around for a  long time like davids to pull something unpleasant 

there are plenty of other rental sites out there but personally i have always found davids to have the best prices best policies and least hassle
100 


life for any of us can end in an instant  you cant take the money with you and i promise you will regret experiences not had and enjoyed more than youll regret not saving the money 


dont look at it as not the best financial decision  youve earned it and you deserve the break take it while you can  there is no guarantee of tomorrow so the perfect and responsible time to take it is when you have the extra money and you and your family are in good health and able to travel 


during the pandemic the unemployment payments were the first time i experienced consistent livable income in my life 
should i have done a better job of saving during that time probably from a purely finance perspective 
but as someone who has lived their entire live in abject poverty and who has always been severely disabled i took the opportunity to go on a couple trips with my partner knowing i may never have the extra money to do it again
i have zero regrets i look back on those memories so fondly and they make it easier to get through this awful life my extra savings would have lasted longer had i not but that few months of delaying the inevitable wouldve done little for me
mouse dining is one of many services that does this its a small fee and works wonderfully couldnt be easier to set up
no one wants to be subjected to your overtired pint sized terror during their already uncomfortable and stressful travel day youre not the only one on the plane have some courtesy please
are you really pretending not to know how inflation and rising prices  not a concept exclusive to disney  work 
 

and no it didnt cost her 99 in 2006 and yes prices on everything have raised since 2006 in case youve forgotten
exactly

the total price may seem large at first glance but when you break down how many daymultiday passes youd buy before breaking even it isnt bad at all if you go even remotely often  or even if youre just taking a couple trips a year or one long trip 
plus the parking discounts park hopper etc  its only a bad deal if youre not going to visit more than say 510 days in that year sure youre paying up front but hey  thats the trade
i absolutely hate kids cant stand them dont enjoy interacting with them whatsoever and have zero patience for it 


i enjoy the parks just fine and feel no guilt or shame about it however i also dont interact with kids while there and keep my disdain to myself so its not a problem 

as long as you arent actively acting out towardsaround them no one needs to know your personal views and its no ones business  there isnt a rule that you have to adore those little shits to be admitted into the park just that youre respectful of everyone around you which isnt hard 

theres nothing wrong with a preference or a feeling on something like this as long as you arent mistreating others as a result anyone who says otherwise frankly matters not enjoy your trips to the park you belong there just as much as every other paid guest
the stigma against adderallstimulant medication is insane 
so many shitty judgmental and blatantly incorrect comments ive seen on posts about the shortages and articles and posts are always focused on fucking adhd patients never people with narcolepsy  
my partner and i both have prescriptions for it and the tones people take when he calls around to check pharmacy stock is insane 
everyone with a legitimate prescription just trying to get the medication they need to survive must be tweaker drug seekers right infuriating 
its your job to provide medications not to decide if you think someones treatment plan is viable if you dont agree with stimulant medications existing youre a piece of shit especially if you let that show in your interactions  on the job 
as someone who has spent the last year watching my mom grieve her husband my stepdad who died by suicide there is no normal when a person close to you dies the kinds of comments and mourning behaviors expressed in the op are perfectly common reactions for some when someone close to them dies even if they may be uncomfortable or cringeworthy to others 

its also not weird or uncommon to grieve the loss of a pet i hate dogs but im also not a sociopath so i understand that death hurts and losing a pet you were very attached to regardless of how flawed that relationship was can be painful and traumatic to someone 

the real problem here is that the mom obviously treated her human child as second to the dog isnt getting proper therapy to process this loss if its as hard for her to process as she is claiming and that she is still a controlling mess to her adult son from a distance
im starting to wonder which is right after this post i personally keep a ton of cash around because i dont trust banks to have my back and quickly resolve fraudproblems nor do i want to be relying on them in an emergency  or having to explain to my landlord why rent is on hold because of a banking errorlocked accountetc

but im probably also way too paranoid and im willing to admit that
dont leave anything in your car youd be upset about having stolen just as a smart rule of thumb at least not in most areas these days id think but im in a city with a huge car theftproperty crime problem

id be more upset having 100 stolen out of my car so im willing to risk the potential of being at a drive thru or gas station without my wallet  which has happened a total of once in my entire life and i can always use a cardless atm as well  
if my carcity was more secure and i cared less about 100 it wouldnt be unwise to have some emergency cash around maybe 20 makes more sense 100 and my ass would be chapped 20 id just be miffed
to each their own not everywhere is for everyone 

ive paid money to go there and quite enjoyed it again comparing it to where i live it was a welcome break and i enjoyed everything i did  again as a tourist 
theres a lot to do there and a lot of it is very enjoyable
yeah theyre getting one in grapevine that is set to open in a couple months actually   
texas will actually be getting a second one as well though it will be in houston  i believe next year 

ive only been to the vegas one but i loved it and looking forward to checking out the santa fe and denver locations someday  as well as the texas locations when they open
its not bad at all theres areas that arent great but that goes for everywhere i like it a hell of a lot better than where i live  portland  thats for sure 
theres some really cool venuespockets with lots to do theyre getting a meow wolf soon  well grapevine but close enough  which is a neat thing 
its hardly a bad place to visit
and here in the pnw it isnt legally permitted for dogs to be in restaurants bars or grocery stores 
its insane everywhere i go theres a damn mutt inside where it legally doesnt belong and nothing is done about it 
people constantly asking what are some dog friendly barsrestaurants i can bring my dog into
well technically fucking none but these entitled selfabsorbed idiots dont believe any rules apply to them
and he was 

he explained that you get added room food and drink but that comparatively to the baseline offerings it isnt much of an increase because alaska is already comfortable
he mentions that the quality of food and drink isnt high enough to justify the cost in most situations but that it isnt bad 

no shit its going to be in his opinion  just like everyone elses comments are
if op just wants to know what the offerings are zero opinion on quality he can read the alaska website
and yet somehow thats a perfectly reasonable thing to mention in a review of first classwhat to expect if the expected experience doesnt feel worth the upgradecost its worth noting and setting expectations accordingly 
because it truly doesnt matter at higher reforges im over 30 reforges on chain blades and i roll through 1050 escalations crazy quick  solo or with a random team  and i prefer to bring my shock blades because the teleport saves me some running and the distance between matches gets old 
i havent died in an escalation in a long time though and pull my weight  and then some a lot of the time  so im not the kind of player youre asking about it seems 

youd have to ask each individual player why 
they could be trying something new couldve gotten bad advice for their level dont have another weapon want to use the special specifically are trying to complete a challenge etc etc 
theres always skip matchmaking if its annoying enough to you 
truly doesnt matter for me my symptoms are at the absolute worst end of severe regardless of the whether

if its miserable dark gloomy cold and shitty  how oregon is 98 of the time  the seasonal depression lack of vitamin dsunlight and overall darkness make things worse

if its hot the heat is exhausting the seasonal allergies suck the dryness and dehydration are tiring and it fucks with my sleep schedule and gives me migraines  which make me that much more tired exertion of any kind in the heat is made that much harder and more draining 

basically theres no winning
when the hell will this start being enforced 
im so sick of dogs in restaurants bars grocery stores etc 
my local city subreddit has people seeking out places thatll allow their shitty mutts inside and youre downvoted into oblivion for reminding them  in perfectly plain language with no hints of dogfree mentality i should mention  that its literally not legal and they are violating health codes 
a dog friendly barrestaurantstore shouldnt exist because its not allowed to exist but these people are so fucking entitled and the rules never apply to them
so is ogas by a landslide
why would they not just do fingerprints like wdw does solves this problem very easily
i lived in dallas and midlandodessa for a while i feel you 

dallas was a lot better than living in portland but midland that small town texas community coupled with the heat and humidity nightmarish i still have bad dreams about walking through 115 degree heat with pocket change i scraped together to fill containers with water at the outside stations with the air stinking of oil was a weird place to live
not to hijack this post but im curious

whats the cost of living like there these days

i was born in laguna hills and grew up in oceansideorange countysan diego but sadly my parents made the mistake of moving to portland oregon in my early teens and i am once again stuck here now well into adulthood

i have such fond memories of san diego and have visited as an adult and loved it but it just seems way out of my ability financially  even with as bad as portland has gotten too
if youre on medicaid your options will likely be limited by the medicaid policiesoptions in any given state

i live in oregon and i fucking hate this pitiful slice of hell but i dont foresee myself ever being able to move because i rely on oregon health plan  our medicaid  and food stamps etc

when moving out of state your eligibility will change the coverage of the program will change and youre going to have to find all new doctors  and hope they have availability provide a good quality of care will prescribe the same medications so you dont have to go through a hellish adjustment period etc   
in a lot of places i wouldnt bank on that being an easy transition if even possible at all

then you factor in new cost of living transportation issues  a lot of places in the south for example are not so easy to get aroundnavigate

anywhere that doesnt get very cold in the winter is going to cost you that much more  and hopefully you like 110 degrees all summer

community doesnt just exist for you because you show up somewhere and place the responsibility on them to come together and take care of your needs   
a religious organization or tight community group existing somewhere prior to you moving does not mean they will accept you with open arms and take care of you in the ways you are seeking  
in order to find these types of community groups you often need to be very active in them have a lot to providebring to the table yourself and fit in swimmingly with the types of personalities in the group  not be overly needy or negative etc  
this isnt easy and its why a lot of people dont have that community feeling around them   
it can take years in one place to find a group anything remotely close to what youre describing and again you need to bring a lot to the table from the start to really integrate into a close community and establish yourself to where they are rushing to your aid 

there are religious organizations and community groups in denver that operate the way youre describing why you arent finding yourself included in those groups is anyones guess  but its not denvers fault so to speak and will likely happen to your everywhere until all the right variables come together at the right time for you to find that spot you fit with a group you enjoy

this isnt to get you down or be negative  just some perspective in portlandseattle the pacific northwest freezeseattle freeze is a big thing  people arent very friendly theyre passive aggressive its really hard to find friendsa community group and yet many have that close community here because they did the work found a spot they fit in and it just all fell into place on the flipside many dont and its very isolating for a lot of us  
i have lived in over 15 cities across the us there are some more enjoyable than others some where people are friendlier on the surface  people are more bubbly in the south than they are in the pacific northwest but that doesnt mean theyre genuinely nicefriendly people or people you want to be in a group with  but the only factor you can control in any given place is yourself  
if you want a solid support group its going to take time   


no one wants a deadweight or a negativenancy  not saying you are one please dont take this the wrong way  so people are generally attracted to positive upbeat selfsufficient folks who seem like they will bring good energy to a gathering and who will contribute instead of constantly needing  
i know how hard that is when youre disabled  im a 247 rain cloud i cant help it  but doing your best to develop those qualities to the best of your ability and bringing that to groups of similar people who will understand where youre at better  a support group for people with disabilities for example vs a church group with people of all agesdemographics who may not take to youunderstand where youre coming from  is a good place to start
amazing im so glad thats an option i know a ton of people are coming out with negative reviews of tron but im a lifelong tron fan and will just be happy to get to ride it even if it isnt the long immersive experience people would prefer from the ride so excited thank you

thank you so much 
ill be eligible for the extra hours at epcot and magic kingdom next month so wanted to know if it was wise to plan for the morning queue and potentially riding it a second time in the evening since im only doing one day at both thats great to hear
does the extended evening hours queue work the same as the 7am and 1pm ive not encountered it yet  ive done the evening hours but not in a park with a virtual queue so far  and dont see much posted about it

im guessing if you get the normal queue in the morning and have already had your group called you cant then enter the evening hours queue or does it provide the opportunity to ride twice that day potentially
yep op sounds fucking awful 

stereotypical have you tried to dietexercisework hardereat betterstop being depressed bullshit from someone who doesnt really want their partner to improve their symptoms and difficult health woes but just wants the person to getbe better in ways that are more convenient and appealing to them  


wow op you mean your constant insistence that she exercise and motivate to your liking buying her a gym membershipequipment when shes trying to battle depression and a new and scary health diagnosis and having zero understanding of mental health issues isnt causing her to jump enthusiastically onto your dick
color me surprised
if you feel compelled to do so you could reach out more directly via email or perhaps a message on social media to see where to direct a more personalized indepth cast compliment

i kind of dislike the inapp cast compliments and was disappointed with the feature when they rolled it out  theres no way to personalize them or go into any detail and maybe thats because thats what disney wants but i feel like leaving a general they did good thats the same for all cast doesnt give them the full recognition they deserve when they go above and beyond to levels like in your post 

im so sorry to hear about your father in law and i hope you and your family are able to grieve and heal together peacefully this will no doubt be a wonderful memory your kids carry with them for the rest of their lives both because of you and because of the amazing magic of the cast members
id add to this that things usually dont work out when you move backwards  from living together to starting over dating  and it can be difficulttoimpossible to reframe the phase of the relationship both in the short term and long term
setting new boundaries and adjusting when you take a step back can be difficult and something that causes a lot of fighting 
when youre already fighting this much things are unlikely to survive
agreed this could easily be the case for ops partner  only way to figure it out is to sit down and have a specific discussion about it and how it makes him feel and what her thoughts are
i will often be scrolling my phone aimlessly or cleaning or doing something with my hands when my partner is talking to me im listening actively i respond when it warrants it and i engage actively and my partner doesnt take offense because im an active participant even if im not sitting there still staring at him doing nothing else
i have adhd and narcolepsy i will fall asleep or completely zone out if im just sitting and looking at someone while trying to listen i have to multitask to stay focused on them
ups will charge you to change the delivery location  even to a neighbors house or a different location than your damn porch sometimes  and to change the delivery date but they wont do this unprompted wont reach out to you and ask you to pay for it and you have to go in and request to make those changes yourself on their website via your tracking
 people dont want to be fired especially when cost of living and inflation are so bad right now  and getting worse all the time  that people are living in a lot more desperate situations than ever before the employees that want to tell these nutters to leave know that their boss will not stand up for them when karen and her stinky mutt go to management claim it was a service dog etc  
the customers are always right mentality is still very present in a lot of workplaces and its not worth the risk   
dog owners are the worst kind of entitled and you know they arent just going to go okay fine and leave when a minimum wage employee tells them to leave
 people dont want to be accosted by customers or their stinky ass dogs   
9 times out of 10 when i see a dog in public its a fucking piece of shit pit bull and quite frankly i wouldnt approach the owner either no one gets paid enough to have one of these nutjobs go off on them  and potentially have their dog follow trend  
theres so few consequences when a dog attacks that these owners arent that concerned with the outcome if pissfingers were to pop off at the kroger
 a large amount of employees are dog nutters themselves and dont want the dogs to leave despite it being illegal or they know their coworkers are and will gang up on them or their boss is a nutter  or has said dont confront the nutters for one reason or another 

the real problem is that there is no enforcement of these laws by a more powerful entity than a minimum wage employee or their boss 

nutterrunowned businesses get away with it because there are no consequences some of these places even encourage dogs even though they legally arent permitted to be in the business   
nutters get away with it because theyre the loudest most entitled most unhinged group so while the right thing to do is say get out its the law its often not worth the fallout
in many places it isnt legal in many places dogs are not allowed in grocery stores or places where food is served

the ownersemployees disregard these things because theyre either dog nutters themselves or they dont want to deal with the entitled mob that is dogpeople
if only it worked that way the problem would almost certainly follow 
stimulant medications  also used for narcolepsy  are very different from street meth 
dont compare the two
something that is universally true for disabilities of all kinds visible and invisible across all ages groups is that people are fucking rude and absolutely awful 
it doesnt make it feel any better but know youre not alone and weve all dealt with it and deal with it in some way all the time 


i am not a wheelchair user right now but regardless one thing that has helped me to better process the lookscomments is to just really call it what it is
in my head i will go wow this ableist judgmental piece of trash has so little going on in their empty pathetic head that theyre taking time out of their day to stare at me and size me up they think its okay to openly judge a person with a disability thats disgusting what a pitiful empty life they must have how sad
because thats how it is  people staring at you being closeminded and judging you for having a disability arent good people theyre scumbags and the lowest of the low  as if you dont have enough to deal with having to dodge their shitty attitude too 
people like that arent worth your time attention or energy 
it takes a while to get past it but eventually you just stop caring you dont even notice them anymore most of the time 

shitty people are everywhere and will never go away its part of life for everyone dont let them win by staying home and hiding out  these people arent thinking about you after they leave wherever they encountered you and go about their day so dont hold yourself hostage to worrying about encountering them
this 100

your mother is a grown ass adult op if she cant be polite and respectful thats her wrong not your wifes for being sensitive when someone is being cruel and shitty

you didnt marry your fucking mother you married your wife
she is your partner and your other half 

if you dont have enough respect for her to treat her as a priority just say that  stop playing like she had equal hands in something that was 100 caused by your shitty immature mom acting like a petulant child 

my mom has caused issues in my relationship in the past as such shes not invited to our home its that simple i had no qualms about saying because you cant behave this is off the table for my sanity and the sake of my partner
grow a damn pair and be an adult op its this simple
skating around the issue is disrespectful to your wife and looking for ways to lie about why they cant stay is only pushing the issue into the future  where it will be a much much bigger issue when you run out of lies
right 

and its always an attitude of well she is my mother

like hello this is your fucking wife if she doesnt take priority oof
thank you so much that does help a lot i really appreciate it i know theres tons of guides out there to look up and explore  and i really should do that heh  but this makes it easy to get started playing around you rock 

best of luck with your room im sure itll look great no matter what you decide on
this reminds me i seriously need to learn how to use procreate  i have no idea what im doing and cant fathom how to make anything like this using it

amazing congratulations 
i love that bathroom the tub by the window just really speaks to me

did i miss where this is located its okay if you dont want to share just curious i havent seen many places this style its lovely
absolutely not go to the narcolepsy subreddit for half a second and youll find a good majority of us take these medications
modafinil and similar medications are useless horseshit for a lot of us with severe narcolepsy 
just because these medications have been around for a long time doesnt mean theyre older and no longer used  theyre still extremely common and some of the only treatment options we have 
youve been called out for being blatantly wrong and misinformed multiple times here i dont know what youre trying to do here or what you think youre trying to prove but i promise you you dont know better than an actual narcoleptic who is taking these medications 
ive been on adderall for 15 years for narcolepsy and it was an option before that and still is nothing has changed
they still prescribe dexedrine for narcolepsy what are you talking about 
adderall and ritalin commonly as well vyvanse too
magical moments of all kinds happen constantly  its what makes disney such a special place 

my partner and i  both adults no kids  have had a couple moments similar to this believe it or not 
we get really into visiting galaxys edge  star wars was a huge part of both of our childhoods and we are huge fans as adults  and put a lot of effort into our swthemed outfits to visit that part of the park since they have much looser costume rules there than the rest of the parks 
one visit a photopass cast member cleared the entire area in front of the ship where kylo ren and his troopers come out and took photos of us when the characters came out keeping other guests from walking in the shot and allowing us some oneonone interaction with them 
another chewbacca came out with a handler and they came straight for us to say hello to my plush grogu i was carrying give us hugs and take photos  cast let other guests meet him after of course but we were so shocked that they held other guests offaway until our interaction was done

in those types of magical moments you completely forget that youre an adult at a theme park  its just pure worryfree simple joy it takes me back to being a kid visiting disneyland with my family  some of the only really great memories of my childhood that i have

she will remember this for the rest of her life im sure thank you for sharing  these stories remind me why i love disney parks and cast so much 
i hope you left them cast compliments too
hes 19 unqualified and asking reddit how to manage hed going to bullshit his employees who i feel bad for because this is a terrible management situation to be working under
youre not going to get your symptoms treated without a diagnosis thats how it works  they have to figure out what your symptoms are caused by and diagnose it to proceed with proper treatment
you may be able to get some form of medication beforehand if you explain your symptoms to them and how theyre disrupting your life but not all doctors will do this and you run the risk of being taken off those meds if you arent given a diagnosis that lines up with those meds  and depending on what they are youd have to stop taking them for 2 weeks for the sleep study anyway

you are not special in this regard  everyone had to wait some amount of time everyone had to have testing done everyone had to receive a diagnosis of the actual disorder before being treated for it in many cases people wait a year or more for this process to conclude thats just how it goes 
yes its frustrating but its protocol
your diagnosis determines your treatment options its not academic  its literally what they use to proceed with treatment
it seems you dont really have much of an understanding of what narcolepsy is and what the symptoms actually are

constant naps is hardly what narcolepsy is a quick search will tell you that excessive daytime sleepinessexcessive sleepiness fragmented sleeppoor quality of overnight sleep and sleep attacks are some of the main symptoms constant naps isnt really a symptom its a product of the condition for some sufferers and a way some may deal with the exhaustion

if youre tired all the time and arent sleeping well at night you would be wise to seek treatment for those things doing so is all part of treating narcolepsy which goes hand in hand with treating cataplexy  assuming you have either of those things and receive a proper diagnosis 

unfortunately yes you will need a sleep study to further pursue a diagnosis and more than likely yes you will have to jump through hoops to get treatment narcolepsycataplexy are both decently uncommon problems and there arent a ton of treatment options available what is available doesnt work for everyone  and sadly for some of us doesnt work much at all  
finding a doctorspecialist that knows what theyre doingtalking about when it comes to n1n2 is decently difficult and it can be hard to achieve proper productive medication management that provides true relief from symptoms  
it is a lifelong struggle for which there is no cure and finding a balance  and battling tolerance for relevant medications  is a constant uphill battle

the road to diagnosis can be on its own an insanely long and difficult one but in the end its worth it to know whats truly going on and have a chance to treat it  even if only a little

no one is supposed to feel tired all the time and have awful fragmented sleep its not a small symptom even if it seems your cataplexy is the more unmanageable side it is worth it to get to the bottom of 100 of the symptoms and try to treat all of them if you can tired all the time is a severe symptom even if it may not seem like it because youre used to it or have dealt with it for so long

best of luck in your journey ahead
right 

it would take zero time for me to breakup if the person i was seeing ended up having a secret child they hid for 6 months
unless youre having a one night stand this is something you absolutely disclose no matter how hard or complicated  especially once its getting into dating and feelings territory and not just hooking up
no breakup needed hes already done the work for her  not responding ignoring her and moving on with his life hes already made it clear hes done now that shes questioning his real relationship and family and isnt just the easy side piece
you literally used the term emotionally cheated in your post title  clearly you recognize that emotional cheating exists and that she did it so i dont know why you keep asking as if it somehow makes it better if she just sexted and emotionally connected with her ex instead of physically fucking 
if you genuinely believe she hasnt physically cheated youre either being willfully ignorant or youre incredibly naive shes trickletruthing you by claiming she sexted met her ex went on hookup sites and set up potentially fuck meets on craigslist but never did anything physical  youd have to be a fool to believe all that occurred but she stopped short of physical cheating 

the fact that she was on seeking arrangements really adds to what youve said in this comment  you paid off her debts bought her a house and funded her every want you have played the roll of a sugar daddy for her which clearly she was looking for  by using sa  and it sounds like you were possibly not the only one or you just won out over other candidates 

she absolutely used you for money and she absolutely cheated on you multiple times in multiple ways even if it was just emotional cheating  youre going to accept that that she cares more for her ex than you sexts with him meets up with him behind your back  thats all okay with you 

this relationship shouldve been over when you found out about the ex  all this other stuff is just reinforcing that you need to cut your losses before she milks any more support out of you
by expressing frustration i meant that i literally just said oh no thats a bummer that no one has turned it in i was buying some emergency clothes after our flight for tomorrow got canceled should i check back tomorrow do you think or fill out the lost and found form to be contacted 
there was no frustration in my voice whatsoever so no i doubt it was only because i expressed frustration  someone stole my bag off a counter seems like something theyd try to help anyone with if within their power to do so
is the playlist actually in ogas now or just released on streaming all ive seen is that its out for streaming which is pretty underwhelming if theres no indication of when itll be in ogas i love ogas but a fresh playlist is desperately needed after multiple visits
didnt pay attention to the ages on first read  seeing this youre 100 right 
this isnt a relationship shes a fuckpiece constant sneaking away for quickies in publicwhen hanging with friends constant public sexual displays yep
someone snatched a bag with a spirit jersey and two shirts i had just bought off the bathroom counter when i turned away to get a paper towel on my last disneyland visit in may 2022 reported to lost and found and nothing had been turned in and i expressed my frustration since our flight had been canceled and we had bought them to have clean clothes for the next unexpected resort day 

they offered me a voucher to purchase the shirts with again and said that they couldnt replace the spirit jersey  policy regarding the jerseys specifically due to social media nonsense trying to get free jerseys were still ironing that out  but came back out with two brand new sweaters with tags and said if you take these to the world of disney store theyll exchange them without a receipt and you can use that value to buy another jerseyanything else you need

went above and beyond i was so impressed by how hard they worked to make things right
agreed  op is taking this as a personal attack and looking down on her partner because of it instead of realizing she isnt the only person who was shaken by this assault and having some understanding for the person who has had to shoulder 100 of her trauma processing and grief for the last two weeks 

when your loved one is assaulted it can be very traumatic for you as well its normal for people to feel scared confused erratic guilty out of control overwhelmed selfloathing etc after a situation like this  especially if it occurred while they were there with you 

it doesnt sound like the partner tried to guilt op or leave her because of the incident  it sounds like he was expressing fear and guilt over not protecting her and stopping the event that shes so torn up about now and was coming from a place of feeling he needed to punish himself for his inability to prevent this or needing to push away and disconnect to protect both her from his shortcomings and himself from the pain of seeing a loved one harmed like this again 

did he do that in the most productive healthy way no not at all 
but most people dont just suddenly experience a rare unexpected traumatic situation and manage to handle it 100 perfectly right off the bat no one is perfect and unless you already have years of therapy behind you youre probably going to have an outburst or two when youre deeply shaken and frightened 

he let his fears and anxieties and guilt build up for two weeks while tending to op and like most at some point do he reached his boiling point and some of it spilled out in an unhealthy way he realized this pretty quickly and apologized to op and explained and took it back  what more does she want from this 
is she the only one allowed to feel any fearemotions and be upset over this
ohana space 220 and id say ogas as well depending on what time of day  if you want to do a late reservation for example where you get to stay in the park after closing and get to walk out with no one around for some awesome photos youll have a harder time getting that time slot vs a late morningweird lunch hour slot though theres always the walk up list and its not as crazy to get as it once was it can still fill up fast
agreed 

i get the appeal for some kids but i also feel like the movie is very dated for todays kids  im not ripping on the movie but it doesnt seem like one that has remained a must play for a lot of familiesit isnt reflected as much in merchandising on property so its probably not as relevant to a lot of younger kids these days either 

im shocked it was ever in that spot in the first place frankly but by now its crazy there hasnt been an update 
for such a beautiful detailrich park that seeks to teach about animals and cultures the park icon not reflecting that is such a shame
because shanghai has a ton of other attractions is a different park and is a whole new disney experience in a foreign country 
why even ride pirates at disneyland and world i doubt many people book entire trips and travel to a distant park for one attraction
yeah bugs life has never made sense to me the beautiful park icon being used for a dated show thats unappealing to many and doesnt really reflect the vibe of the treepark is so odd
cars doesnt fit into tomorrowland whatsoever though
im sorry youre dealing with the same hell but thank you  it does help to know it isnt just me as much as i hate to hear others are suffering similarly
my question has been do you need to get the vq to buy an ill for tron or does the ill bypass the need for vq 

ive seen people say both and im not sure which it is ive never needed ill and have gotten a vq for rotr and cosmic rewind every time ive visited with zero issues but were only doing one mk day and tron is a must for me and part of why were visiting so i dont want to screw up 

if we have to get a vq group either way theres no reason for us to buy ill but i just wanted to be 100 sure 
would you rather wait another month or more for a potentially much more accurate test or risk an inaccurate test that leads to no diagnosis or that you have to retake  and wait that much longer for 
sleep studies are miserable dont put yourself through it more than once if you can help it if youre concerned that this will impact it severely reschedule
i saw the markus thing in the inbox message too so i wasnt sure if they just wrote it wrong or if mine was with ozz because i had already completed the titlecrown thing in past years seems it was an error on their part heh

glad you figured it out
have you completed slayer path node 2 like it mentions in the springtide overview

have you completed the quests honest ozz has available i got the quest to complete the pufflehop rescue mission from him after a quest to break behemoth parts but ive also gotten the crowntitleall cosmetics from past years so perhaps thats why
it depends on your luggage situation 
if youre flying southwest for example and have the extra free checked bags go for it if youre like me and fly an airline where you have to pay to check bags unless youre a very light packer with your other items its a better plan to just buy them there

i always order walmart amazon or instacart grocery delivery before i even depart for my trip  and schedule it to get there the day i do
no delivery fee no worrying about things getting smashed during flight  bread would definitely not survive well the way tsa treats my bags lol  and it shows up before i do on my travel day so theres no waiting around for it plus i can get drinks for the roomto bring into the park which is a huge bonus
the op is wondering if women and men who are straight can live together and not be with each other in some capacity 


the comment youre responding to is stating that bisexual people who are attracted to both males and females are capable of having roommates and not fucking them  since theyre attracted to both genders theyre comparing their situation to the ops question
ooooof i wish i could say it was good heh

x200b

 wake up anywhere between 2pm and 430pm no amount of alarmsanything else will change this sometimes 5 if im especially dead every once and a while ill get lucky and get a 1130 wake up 
 regardless of when i wake up im not going to be functional for at least the first 34 hours minimum of my day so i might be awake but just rolling around in bed trying to look at my phone or i might move to the couch but still just be in a haze   
sleep inertia lasts 24 hours on average lately i am having vision issues upon waking  cant see shit for the first few hours of the day eyes completely blurry   
usually ill have a headache sometimes a migraine  so either excedrine or imatrex  
basically just in a halfsleep state staring off and on at my phonethe wall
 34 hours after i wake ill shower
 45 hours after i wake i may eat a light meal
 6 or so hours after i wake up i will attempt to check my email on my desktop look at my todo list try to pick 3 or 4 things to attempt to get done that day
 from around 93010pm to maybe 121am i will feel semifunctional  which is the best i can hope for these days and the highest level of functioning i will reach  during which time i will maybe answer some emails catch up on messages from friendsfamily possibly clean my bathroomdo some laundrypick up around the houseschedule appointmentsetc
 from 1130ish to around 2303am i will not be wound down enough to sleep but not functional enough to accomplish anything of value ill keep trying to truck along through todo list tasks but its mostly automatic behaviors and i end up complicating simple tasks because my brain is too foggyheavy to do anything properly
 3amish ill go to bed ill either take 4560 minutes to fall asleep or ill crash instantly  no way to predict which itll be no rhyme or reason as to why i will get up a few times throughout the night to use the bathroom
 next day this hellcycle begins again every day of my life

this is not living and its hardly surviving severe narcolepsy is a prison sentence and i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy
very much agree with your comment super levelheaded take

to add

 everyone grieves differently and some people  especially those who dont have a lot of experience with loss or who process loss by wanting to distractescape rather than grieve  may lean more into trying to take theiryour mind of things or trying to provide an up to pull you out of the down  
was this wildly inappropriate   
yes and no   
given that she didnt know  and hadnt established through past experiences with you  that you would appreciate thisfind it appropriate this wasnt a good move on her part and was more than a little tone deaf  
the level she took it to  she didnt just initiateoffer simple sex she made a whole eventshow out of things  was in very poor taste and would definitely upset a lot of people were they in your shoes   
if she cant see that  your upsetting reaction aside  i would question her perspective and if we were on the same page on a lot of things   
that said if she doesnt have much experience with lossgrief or had reason to think this would be a good way to distracthelp you feel better its understandable that she made a bad judgement call but her intentions were goodcoming from a good place and you guys just need to have a chat about boundariesgriefprocessing so similar doesnt happen in the future
 from personal experience with my partner while something like she did would not have been cool we have processed griefloss by engaging sexuallyintimately in the past when our cat was tragically killed when his grandma passed when i had to clean up my stepdads suicide we didnt make a showy display of seduction out of it but we did have sex the evening of the loss and throughout the first handful of days after more as a way to reconnect with speaking burn some stressfrantic energy and feel a bit of endorphingoodchemicals release in light of the horrible circumstances at hand   
though her approach again was awful this may have been where she was coming from and what she was hoping to assist with  giving you a release 
 no one can blame you for your reaction op no one can blame you for being upset with her feeling it was tone deaf  it was  and not knowing how to process that on top of what you already have on your plate to mourn and deal with   
that said if you were namecalling yelling and being harshcruel thats still not okay despite what she may have done you yelling doesnt cancel out her wrong but her wrong doesnt cancel out yours either both sides need an apology and to apologize
im not saying i will be returning at night once its dark   
considering sometimes i am unable to get into the park by 1pm either the 7am virtual queue is my best and only opportunity to grab a boarding group as the 1pm has to be done inside the park and may not be an option

again i understand why theyre being strict on it but its pretty upsetting if theyre going to be so strict on it that someone with a legitimate reason for not arriving in the parks earlier but who is obviously not trying to skate around the rules just to ride at night is never going to be able to ride   
i can also understand the complaints of those who are locals but cannot arrive at the parks until say 5pmafter their work shift but who are allowed to enter the virtual queue at 7  it would be an unfair policy for them as well and im curious to see how they handle those folks longer term it would seem that having a virtual queue that can be entered from anywhere at 7am makes less sense with this now
i so deeply hope theyll be accommodating for people in specific circumstances i understand the reasoning here but sometimes you cant just teleport into the park at the time your group is called 
i have das for a reason  and there have been times on past visits when i couldnt get into the park until midlate afternoon no matter what i did as my disability gets in the way constantly 
89am is impossible period and im going to be beyond crushed if i manage to get a boarding group but it gets called right away in the first few opening hours and im turned away when i do finally make it in 
were visiting in midmay for likely the last time due to my illness and tron is most of the reason 

on my last visit my guardians boarding group was called before the park technically opened but i was accommodated at 5pm when we finally made it in and rushed straight to the ride 
because it isnt legal here 

maybe stop looking for a bar where you can break the rules and abide by them like everyone else is supposed to
you have my support loved everything i saw on your profile and will be excited to see what you do in the future major talent and skill for sure i could watch this for hours
this is incredible i expected to tap your profile and see that you were employed with meow wolf or something this is superior to many of their exhibitions well done
im assuming my questions are not appropriate for an individual thread and instead belong here but please point me in the right direction if this is not it

x200b

i am looking for some help with a dress i own as i dont want to style it poorly or look like a mess wearing it   
dress and sandals which are mentioned later are located here

x200b

first off i could really use some help choosing what type and color of slip or undergarment to wear with this  
i have never wornowned a seethrough dress before  the product page describes this as slightly seethrough elastic tulle but as you can see from the photos theres nothing slightly about it its seethrough  and dont want to pick the wrong color of slip dress for the patterncolor scheme i am very pale and tan colored items tend to look odd on me but im unsure if white or black would look equally strange especially with bright sunlight shining on the outfit or if im overthinking it too much  
in the photos provided youll see the model is wearing white panties and presumably a matching bra  this is not an option for where ill be wearing this dress it needs to be appropriate and more modest than having my underwearbra visible a cleavagecut so to speak would be fine especially as its under the dress it doesnt need to be a turtleneck but needs slightly more coverage than the photos  


secondly i have no idea what type of shoes to match with this color schemepattern  
ive never been great at that  black shoes with everything is my unfortunate goto  and i dont have much of an eye for what stands out too much  
i was going to be lazy and just toss on the black sandals with gold accents pictured in my imgur album but im afraid the goldblack clashes with the light colors of the dress   
what would be a good fit here   
im open to just about anything with the caveat that they need to be somewhat reasonable for a long day of wear  no thin heel no heel over 2 inches platforms are fine but lets keep it 23 inches as well tops ideally something that will allow tights to be worn underneath so no splittoe sandals

x200b

third what color tights would be appropriate under this  
i have a lot of distracting leg tattoos including a colorful full leg sleeve so for both appearance and personal comfort  i never wear dresses without nylons under and dont wish to start here  i want to find something that doesnt clash  
im assuming anything with a pattern is a no  would i want something white or black or just a sheer nylon something twotone i get the feeling black will be too harsh

x200b

and lastly what color of accessories would you stick with  
gold jewelry or silver what general range of colors would you stick with for a purse

x200b

thank you in advance i know this was a lot and i probably sound super silly but i really adore this dress and want to enjoy it and not look back on photos later and go i look like a toddler oops
and 30 for a 12 pizza is still outrageous regardless of any of those factors as has been continuously mentioned on this post
agreed we did the lounge and it was still insanely overpriced for the overall atmosphere 100 one and done
the entire restaurantlounge is tiny which makes it underwhelming even with the space windows  which again are sadly very underwhelming though neat 
the ride updown is cool as is the entry hallway but beyond that 
the bartender we had was fast attentive and very friendly but kept trying to upsell us on drinks and things in a very nondisney way  i know space 220 isnt technically disney run so thats probably why 
the drinks were fine but overpriced  we enjoyed the moon rocks shots they were fun but again insanely overpriced  and the lounge food was fast and tasted fine but nothing to write home about
a cat isnt going to eat a toddler a cat wont maul a human to death 
you can feel strongly about people keeping cats inside  i agree  and acknowledge that theyre dangerous to native animals but they are nowhere near the threat a pit bull is to absolutely everything 
they arent comparable on any level
she cant possibly know its sleep apnea without a test which is all i said the way the op is worded it sounds like the doctor after doing zero testing simply said it isnt narcolepsy its sleep apnea  something she cant possibly know or conclude without further testing that she probably isnt even capable of doing herself and would need to further refer op out for
anytime you feel outright dismissed by a doctor and as though they havent listened at all it is perfectly reasonable  and your best plan of action  to seek a second opinion elsewhere

theres a different kind of feeling to the whole arrangement given that its a medical scenario but a doctor is no different than a mechanic hairdresser etc in that you are hiring them so to speak to address your concerns and needs  
you wouldnt keep going to a mechanic who blatantly ignores that your headlight is out and tells you its not a big deal just like you wouldnt keep going back to a hairdresser who dyes your hair green when you asked for a trim  
you have valid legitimate woes that you want to seek help for  be that testing a diagnosis treatment a referral to a specialist etc  and if this doctor wont take them seriously and help you pursue them move on get a second  andor third  opinion and go from there

ultimately in the end it could be nothing im not saying that it is or that you should feel like it might be dont take this the wrong way  
but the only way for you and your medical care team to know that is through exploring all the possibilities  testing a sleep study possible referral to a specialists possible medicationtreatment plans etc  
a doctor who hears your legitimate concerns about problems that are legitimately causing you discomfort and distress and goes lol its nothing or its  even though we have done zero testing or exploration to determine a cause is not a good doctor period

im assuming you havent had any testing done for sleep apnea correct me if im wrong thats just the assumption im making based on the wording of your post  
how exactly did this doctor come to that conclusion without running any tests if she believes that to be true why would she not be pursuing treatment for that  
any doctor that refers to my legitimate distressing symptoms as scary bumps in the night is not only a piece of shit i would never see again but is a doctor i would be complaining about to the right departmentsentities 

like you said no one here can know if what youre experiencing might be narcolepsy or not but you deserve to pursue answersa diagnosis for your woes definitely seek a second opinion and find yourself a doctor you feel comfortable with who listens to you hears you acknowledges you and takes you seriously

rule 1 please if you dont have anything respectfulcivil to contribute best not to comment at all
uprestigiousflow465

enough rule 1 should go without saying but here is your reminder and first and final warning  if you cant behave yourself and remain respectful and civil in your commenting here you will receive a ban
if youre prone to watery eyes at all dont bother with thrive 

i loved it at first and it looked great but the second you yawn too much  causing your eyes to water  or are outside in the wind  again watery eyes  its coming right off in gross messy little black tubes all over your face 
i dont wear foundation but if i did it wouldve been completely ruined by the tube shedding still annoying to have to wipe it all off with a makeup wipe when im in the middle of doing things and then either have no mascara or reapply it
exactly not only have i never done this i cant even imagine doing it theres just no circumstances under which i wouldnt care if my partner was satisfied fulfilled and got his during a sexual interaction it takes a very selfish careless kind of personmindset to do that to someone nonetheless do it every time come up with justifications for it and manipulate to keep it going every time
as someone who has witnessed two suicides and cleaned up the brutal aftermath of another i hope they leave it 

things are going to trigger you in this world period if we cater to every single potential trigger there would be little left because there will always be someone taking issue or choosing to be triggered by something 

you know what really needs to be done about potential triggers 
therapy it isnt the responsibility of the world and everyone around you to save you from a potential trigger its yours and yours alone 
it is up to the individual to avoid a trigger  dont look up on the hm problem solved done people do it every day  or work through the trigger so it is no longer a crippling issue  therapy breathing coping skills theres thousands of books out there to work you through this if therapy isnt an option

getting real tired of anything remotely bothersome being erased to cater to the types that cant be bothered to help themselves yet expect the world around them to do 100 of the work 100 of the time
then she isnt a sub she isnt asking you to dom you arent having good sex and shes selfish at bestselfish and manipulative at worst end of story 

it would be one thing if youd never brought this up before but given that you have and theres always excuses its obvious shes aware of the problem and simply doesnt care 
youre not her sexual partner shes treating you like a glorified sex toy youre her dildo that follows instructions 

shes not a sub when everything is under her control her demand and her instruction theres boundaries and likes and then theres this  theres submission going on but it sure isnt from her 


i engage in extremely rough dominant sex with my partner  im the sub in this dynamic 
it works because we both love it and are both getting off equally from it 
theres certain things he does that are things i am particularly fond of but he also enjoys them and gets off from them there are things i do for him that are more for his pleasure but i get off equally from that its a 5050 but no one is displeased or left unfulfilled by any of the acts 
he finishes every time  if not multiple times for longer sessions  and i make sure of this i want him to come i cant even imagine being so selfish and terrible that id let my partner do everything for me and not even care enough to make sure he got his 
that shows how little your partner cares about you  you arent her equal in this partnership shes treating you like her pet
agreed which is how i  and you id say  know that were monogamous 


it sounds like op probably isnt or at least isnt enough to be the type who should be in a fully monogamous partnership with a fully monogamous person  nonetheless ever marry one someday 


ive had partners before my current  as in this isnt my first sexual partner  and the thought of my current being my last always and forever doesnt bother me at all no negative thoughts or feelings about that at all no but id miss out on   nothing 


it excites me to think about how much great sex well continue to have for many years to come how much more well explore together and how much well grow and gain even more comfort with each other


the sex were having now vs 7 years ago is a lot more wild and its awesome  not that it was ever bad at the beginning it has always been amazing to me but weve become so much more comfortable with each other in that way and explore so much more than we used to 


the thought of the future as exclusive sexual partners excites me and i look forward to seeing how much more we explore and the new things well try together 


thinking about sleeping with other people doesnt interest me at all i dont miss the new partner phase where its awkward and youre not in tune with each other yet or comfortable enough to try much out 
i dont miss the unpartnered phase where im single dont have anyone to share intimacy or sex with  or am trying to find a partner and dealing with the woes of that life stage  and i dont have any interest in finding another sexual partner im fully satisfied with my partner theres nothing i am missing or think i could find better in someone else 

but im also monogamous it sounds like the problem for op is monogamy
heh i actually love the gold one on the left in the first photo and the one in the second photo and would wear them as normal everyday clothes if they werent swim material but your comment made me chuckle because ive been realizing my wardrobe is very star warsstar trek leaning these days 
yep its nuts

im not paying 15 for half of an already tiny quesadilla that will leave me still hungry with the option to sit outside  if im lucky ill more likely have to stand or go back to my car  in shit weather with some homeless nut taking a shit and then hassling me for my foodmoney 

i miss when food trucks were cheap i miss when everything was cheaper for that matter
100 agree

i mean its a cool bar regardless of the 21 hours and the drinks are fun but that sweet sweet no kids window is amazing literally a godsend especially for those of us happily childfree 

the fact that more bars on property arent 21 is really a problem and a shame 
abracadabar should absolutely be 21 the resort lounges after 8pm should absolutely be 21 period maybe the compromise for ops example would be ogas being 21 for reservations after say 6307pm even i 100 agree it should be 21 at least a portion of the time 

nothing like paying 18 pretaxandtip for a cocktail to sit at the bar top in a nice lounge at a deluxe resort just to have some loud sticky whiny little kid in a bathrobe and wet swimsuit smelling like chlorine burnt popcorn and stale peanut butter come in and start screaming about wanting thisneeding thatdid you see thisgive me that 


adults only spaces are desperately lacking on property 
im not saying invest in a new pleasure island  but please do  but capping minors at 8pm across the property in loungesbars and maybe having some adults only hours at a few poolsjacuzzis in the evening would be amazing 
trader sams is clearly thriving with these restrictions lets expand shall we 
you cant effectively capitalize on and advertise to adult guests while still treating them like the outlier by making every space obnoxiously kidfilledkidsallowed know what your audience wants please lord 
not even remotely they dont wake me up at all or give me any energy or noticeable relief from exhaustion
they do make me feel like absolute shit though and will likely trigger a headache  if not a migraine  and completely ruin my day 
coffee is a big no also most i can do is a soda

the only time ill drink any form of an energy drink is the very rare occasion im at a bar with friends  the only alcoholic drink i can have is a vodkaredbull have to have caffeine immediately combating the alcohol or ill fall asleep mid sentence at the bar the comedown and hangover the next day  even if i only have one  is hell on earth i dont get to have nights out really anymore
i wasnt aware there have been multiple gun related incidents at sandy hut and the vern thats really unfortunate 

i was pretty surprised by the gold dust shooting  not somewhere i wouldve expected that to happen at saw some of the security video from a friend who is closely connected to the owner and it was pretty nuts


i feel for all the staff across those locations  i believe they own lay low and double barrel as well but havent heard anything newsworthy from there  and hope they can stay safe and see a reduction in these happenings they deserve to be safe at work as does every customer coming in and they deserve good wellpaid security 


alibi  and all those spots  get wild on the weekend it shouldnt take gun violence to get solid security and its a damn shame it hasnt happened for the other locations either 
i wonder if these have all been random incidents or gangdrug related
sure she cant go back in time but she already got all the advice possible on this before she had the damn kid she already knows what this guy is about and that her attempts arent working 
how much more validation does she need 

either do something about it  which if your nagging isnt working means leaving if its something you cant tolerate  or stop complaining about it since it isnt important enough to make major changes over thats it those are the options
so many places around town i wouldve never imagined this kind of thing happening at that i now cant say that about its pretty wild 
hoping everyone is fine and those who witnessed the event are able to process it okay  as someone who has witnessed similar it does weird things to your psyche
do not pick up the bags yourself


i certainly wasnt tempted but thank you
and youre still alive and well you werent mauled to death or fucking eaten 
a small dogchihuahua doesnt have the capacity to eat your arm down to the bone rip through your neck and kill you without anyone being able to get it off or pull apart a child and rip it in half
i usually go and i like to take medication that is best for my health situation not what the rest of your patients are subjected to based on your preconceived notions if you dont want to work with me ill take my business elsewhere
to put it simply like absolute fucking shit every single time and without fail

to add a little detail i have never not once in my life felt rested ever even in my earliest memories

9 times out of 10 i will have a headache  various levels from lowgrade to migraine always brain fog so bad that it somehow feels physically painful can hardly form a thought nonetheless do much of anything extremely irritable sorein random pain often nauseas anxious beyond all reason and constantly fighting the indescribably powerful pull to go back to sleep  or sleep inertia i suppose ive started having intermittent vision issues now too which are most prominent when waking up so sometimes i cant even see the first 13 hours of the day just blurriness 

whether these feelings settle a little bit after an hour or two and become a tiny bit more manageable or whether they stay at their worst through the entire day is always a 5050 toss up and determines if ill waste yet another day of my life in agony or if ill have 24 working hours where i can shower accomplish anything and then repeat

this disease is a lifelong prison sentence i wouldnt wish it on anyone
there is no cure for narcolepsy 

i have tried microdosing mushrooms in the past in an attempt to promote wakefulnessalertnesscombat the attention issues of narcolepsy and stretch out my stimulant medication more by ideally gaining more energy

it did absolutely none of these things and if anything made me more tired made me feel shittier when it wore off and did anything but improve my memory issues and attention span 

taking psychedelics at higher doses  where youd have a full trip experience so to speak  only proved to suck out what little energy i had left and leave me depleted for days at a time they also had terrible effects on my memory but thats probably not a common side effect for everyone just my anecdotal experience

when you read about potential mental health benefits to mushrooms it is almost always regarding ptsd depression anxiety etc

i see no evidence of benefits for narcolepsy whatsoever  i question their efficacy for depression and anxiety frankly as well  and quite honestly i dont have time and energy to waste on something that isnt intended for this disease i surely dont have any energy to spare thats for sure
the mods on rportland are some of the worst across reddit im not surprised
thats portland for ya  more choosing beggars here than ive seen anywhere else across all walks of life too

disgusting i hope they sink and fail real fast and join the countless other bland bars that close down faster than they opened
replace a few terms such as juggling with something that invokes less mental images of clowns

this absolutely killed me well done
agreed 

i use das and sometimes theres just no way im getting to the park early or by a certain time or rushing to a specific ride at the drop of a hat 
i need ample time to get somewhere especially if im doing something else and mornings can be difficult when trying to get going out of the resortmake it into the park

with rise and cosmic rewind we had no issues showing up late  even 5 hours later from time the group was called once since we were group 5 and called right around the park opening  and they were always really understanding especially if we checked in first but had to come back later due to a dining reservation and not wanting to be charged 

im hoping this is just for the unexpected soft open and not a permanent strict no for all riders going forward its one thing if a guest is purposefully pushing it to ride at night but if you have a dining reservation or got stuck on a ride or are coming from a good length of distance or have a dasrelated reason it really should still be honored
your doctor will make that decision with you based on your medical history and concerns  make sure to be 100 honest about all medicationsself medicating youre doing as well as concerns you have about stopping and how disruptive it may be to your mental health and life
you may not have to stop everything or for very long or you might  if your doctor feels it will impact the results none of us can know but your doctor should listen to your concerns and consider your existing conditions ahead of your study  if you feel they arent in general second opinionnew doctor may be in order but most of us had to go off critical medication before our appointments and spend 24 weeks in misery so that seems to be par for the course with these dumb tests
i wish you the best of luck and im sorry to hear youre having to do this again
what is your doctorthe lab instructing for your mslt

what everyone else had to do is irrelevant to your study  your doctorsleep team will specify what your exact instructions are for the study and will expect you to follow them 100 or notify them if that will be a problem and see if there are any adjustments that can be made there may not be

you should ask your doctorsleep team about self medication with marijuana before your study and whether or not marijuana usage is allowed  and if not how long you will need to abstain for before your test make sure to inform them of anyall medications you are taking and get individual guidance for each

from what i gather the majority of people seem to be instructed to cease the majority of medications 24 weeks prior to the test  this includes ssris stimulants etc sometimes the timeframe varies  especially with ssris that you have to gradually come off ofgradually go back on  and sometimes certain medications are okay while others are not   
they will almost certainly be giving you a ua meaning you will not sneak self medicating or failure to follow instructions past the sleep lab 

it is important to follow 100 of the instructions you are given in order to achieve the best study results  and not have the results invalidated inconclusive unusable etc

i was told no medications 2 weeks prior absolutely no marijuana which wasnt a concern for me as i dont use it  for the record i am in a legal state  and was even told no caffeineexcedrinlight sleeping meds the few days before
aww thank you that means a lot  im glad it resonated with you in some way 
no days are good and certainly none are better  its merely how many hours i have that i can do anything vs the rest of the time where i am essentially a walking zombie

i will say that my narcolepsysymptoms are extremely severe and that medication  while better than nothing  hardly does anything for me there are people who have it a lot better than i do with n or who have more success with medication  this disease is very complicated and difficult and impacts everyone very differently and at very different levels

but for me much like you said i have always had a baseline tiredness that never goes away  this is a constant and has been there since my earliest childhood memories i have never felt good or normal or rested in my life  
no matter how much sleep i get or how quality that sleep is i always feel like shit i never wake up rested im never not exhausted and i feel like im constantly walking uphill through molasses just trying to process a simple thought nonetheless complete a task  
sleep hygiene diet exercise  none of that shit matters not even remotely

some days i will have 23 maybe even 4 hours where im half functional  in those hours i try to squeeze in as much as i can to try to stay afloat from making callsscheduling appointments to keeping the house clean answering emails etc  
some days i get less than that and move from the bed to the couch to the couch to the shower the shower to the bed maybe to my desk chair  where i get nothing done and stare blankly at my screen later wondering how 3 hours melted away  and then suddenly the day is over and it felt like 5 minutes

narcolepsy is horrifically portrayed in hollywood and in stereotypes   
most of us are not randomly passing out in full slumber mid sentence  sleep attacks are a thing and yes i get them but they dont look like the movie interpretation of narcolepsy any media portrayal of the disease i have seen has made me want to punch through a wall and has been horribly insulting narcolepsy is a very misunderstood and badly stereotyped illness and its a damn shame

could you have it sure cant know till you go through the sleep study process and meet with the right doctors but it is a fairly rare disease and there are a lot of things that cause the chronic fatigue exhaustion and need for naps that youre describing  and for your sake i hope its not narcolepsy because i wouldnt wish this lifelong curse on anyone  


regardless of what it is its obviously not normal and is something you should continue to speak with doctors about and seek answers to  there are a lot of different things that cause chronic fatigue or being extra sleepy and its worth investigation and seeing if you can remedy it

unfortunately narcolepsy is not curable and for a lot of us the treatment options suck and hardly help there is no normal for us nor any hope to return to it not being capable of getting restful restorative sleep is the core of narcolepsy and its miserable it felt like i was being cursed when i was diagnosed but then comes acceptance and then comes understanding  it may not change how bad it sucks but it sure does feel good to know theres a damn reason for it and im not just lazysleepy for no reason 

best of luck to you
not necessarily he worked up from low level cashier to a higher position 
it is not uncommon for retailgrocery chains and such to cut higher paidhigher level positions  and either replace with lower paideasier to manipulate workers or expect existing workers to cover the slack of an eliminated position to boost profitscut payroll spending  despite still needing low level employees to fill shit jobs with constant turnover
i wouldnt say that building was thriving in terms of bathroom and kitchen cleanliness it wasnt bad like it was in the articlebecame after management issues but i stayed there for a few weeks during summer 2017 on a couch of a friend who lived there and the shared public bathrooms were gross  and that was just toiletsink i cant imagine a shared shower space like this article describes hell nah 
not abandoned level gross but they werent what id call thriving level of clean nor something id feel good about having to pay to live arounddeal with constantly 
the kitchens were a lot better than the bathrooms but still pretty grimy and the consensus was dont leave dishesanything in here you dont want to say goodbye to and it was always an ordeal trying to make a meal in any level of peacecomfort 

maybe these types of setups work for someone who isnt home often or super young folks in their first living situation outside of parents homewhile in college but to think this will work on a large scale for anyone else is delusional levels of optimistic 

the rent would have to be comparable if not lower than renting a room in a very cheap houseshare  since in that setup youd be sharing a kitchen and bathroom with less people than you would in this proposal so youd have to incentivize the extra inconveniences  and theyd need a cleaning crew in twice a day at least 

the buildings would also need a dedicated security crew to keep nonresidentstheir visitors out and the rentals would need to be decently sound proof and very comfortableupdated to make this at all appealing to renters 
i dont see any of that happening but i guess we shall see
yeah its the extra drivingtravel to seattle that kills it for me anytime its cheaper its a 335 hour drive from where im at in portland and then you have to factor in parking for the duration of your trip or the cost of a trainbusflight each way and youre adding an extra 3 hours of travel time to each travel day  with plenty that can go wrong  so its never really viable
it would have to be a solid 1000 of savings to be worth the additional craziness
thank you so much im guessing youd order from them again no complaints

there isnt a ton of info out there on them still but they seem to have great deals so if theyre legit theyre definitely a hidden gem i really appreciate you responding youre amazing thank you
i know this comment is 5 months old and i apologize for bothering you but have you ever purchased from baltini yourself

im on the fence about ordering from them because there isnt much out there about them  except for a ton of bad reviewspeople questioning if theyre a real company  but theres a few items i cant seem to find anywhere else so im tempted to give them a chance

thank you
i did i ended up emailing them a big pdf but i still have the scans if youre looking for them
its one of the very few treatment routes for narcoleptics and is indeed a medication prescribed for narcolepsy so clearly it does indeed benefit some of us to some extent 

there is no perfect medication that will work for 100 of narcoleptics 100 of the time  but that can be said of a lot of different medicationsdiseases   
medication management is often a long difficult road and requires a lot of trial and error before the right or best option is found

i have been on stimulants for over a decade and they are the only option for me as far as wakefulness medications go anything less than a stimulant might as well be a sugar pill  
even then i need an extremely high dose to combat how severe my symptoms are and to give me any semblance of a functioning life day to day  
of all the wakefulness medications ive tried the only ones that work even remotely are adderall dexedrine and vyvanse   
you will see plenty of posts if you search this subreddit agreeing that these medications work  and you will also see plenty of posts of people who did not have luck with these specific prescriptions and found something else to be more helpful or who are still searching

you have no way of knowing what will or wont work for you until you try it   
you may get lucky and find that modafinil andor adderall work for you right away   
you might find that they dont work at all and you need to try something else entirely or that the side effects arent agreeable for you  
you may also find that they dont work enough but that you are noticing some improvement  so you might need to adjust your dose try a different type of stimulant try a combination of multiple medications switch from ir to xr or xr to ir etc  
medication management is usually not an easy road and it definitely takes some patience  but i promise you that it is well worth it once you find something that works for you and gives you some relief from this horrible curse of a disease  
medication management is also for many of us a lifelong battle  with stimulants and some other medications a lot of people tend to build up a tolerance meaning the medication may become less effective over time or you may need to adjust your dosage to a higher amount to receive the same benefits this isnt a bad thing  its just how medications work and its part of having to deal with narcolepsy and medication management for the disease your doctor is there to help you find the right combinations for you and keep the dosage effective and doing the best it can for you over time

if it werent for stimulants i would have no life at all i would be sleeping 24 hours a day every single day when i dont take my medication i might as well be in a coma   
stimulants are absolutely a life saving medication for narcolepsy
then what exactly are you confused about here 

if she had rejected you because she wasnt into you and made that clear then i could see where youd be feeling concerned shes only asking you out because you saved her father 

but clearly thats not what happened she didnt want a relationship with anyone at the time and her dad not finding you to be a savory character would only further complicate things going forward so it simply wasnt on the table  with you or with anyone for that matter 

i wouldnt go into this with shes only asking me out because of what i did on your mind theres no reason to be paranoid about that at all with the information youve provided and those kinds of insecurities and worries will only serve to complicate things and cloud your judgement and enjoyment of what could be a great daterelationship with someone you really like  dont cloud a good thing with negativity before it has even started
anesthesia is horrible for me i cant wake up to save my life  it takes an abnormal amount of time for them to be able to pull me out and get me to where its safe for me to be discharged and even then i feel worse than anything   
can take days for me to be able to do anything but sleep  will have to quite literally crawl to the bathroom usually cant keep my eyes open to eat etc

i mean its not a greedy request but it isnt a realistic request for many of us unfortunately which is probably why those were the majority of responses you received

many of consider ourselves disabled because of this awful disease or at least consider it to be very debilitating i personally cannot work anymore at all because of the severity narcolepsy which has very much become a degenerative issue and crippled me in nearly all aspects of my life  
highpaying  which usually means demanding or significantly skilled  jobs just arent realistic or doable for a lot of us because of n

it shouldnt be a big ask for us to be able to support ourselves and be comfortable but the system isnt really made for people with illnesses like ours and so a lot of us are stuck in poverty barely able to stay afloat until there is significant reform of the disability system or a serious shift in the job market  living wages for entry levelless demanding positions for example  its going to be a lifelong uphill battle for most of us sadly
the way some of the people on this sub act i think youre onto something with that sentiment

it seems like some of these people are not only so willfully ignorantblind to the realities around us but have convinced themselves that stepping on needles and shit and being attacked by unhinged homeless zombies is awesome and something that the rest of us are wrong for being upset about

absolutely insane
my sleep doctor has offered it to me and sees it as the same medication as adderall essentially i am free to switch between the two at any time for any reason just have to ask

its absolutely prescribed still by all kinds of doctors  psych sleep doctor neurologist primary care etc

she can absolutely send a prescription in for it reach out to your sleep doctor dont let this nonsense keep you from the medication you need

but be prepared for there to be shortages of it too
right because the only logical explanation for me not wanting the same homeless pantsless lunatic to try to attack me twice in one night and not have my personal property burglarized is that i belong in texas  good job big brains on this guy
have fun being an ignorant brainless enabler
it isnt lazy to want work life balance it isnt lazy to want to be able to actually live your fucking life instead of wasting away in a miserable work environment  have you ever been to a typical cvs grim as hell  for shit pay
yeah i was it was summertime on a weekend so more busy than usual but this is exactly how it went and i really dont give a remote fuck if you choose to believe me or not it changes nothing 
if you think its outlandish that something like this would occur youre really ignorant to the daily happenings in portland
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

i know very clearly where the nines is i used to work a block away that area isnt a staycation paradise by any stretch of the imagination just because it isnt old town
youre joking right 

where exactly are we supposed to go out of the us
its next to impossible to immigrate to another country  especially if you arent in a highly desirable field are poor are disabled etc  and thats before you factor in the costs to even get there and move possibility of not being able to speak the language get medical care enter the job market etc

this has to be a joke
i have no problem trying to help small businesses i just feel like this is tasteless and gimmicky and will not have that effect 
my opinion is just that and doesnt really matter one way or another but my experiences in downtown in the last few years were not welcoming and did not leave me feeling positive or wanting to come back anytime soon a gimmicky scratchit contest wouldnt have changed that at all and if anything wouldve felt humorously insulting  ah yes please bait me back with a staycation amongst the very problems i choose not to go downtown to not have to deal with on a night out

a lot needs to change and clean up downtown before its going to be appealing to repeat guests again imo and this is a premature promotion that will only continue to highlight why no matter how nice the business may be people arent frequenting them due to where theyre located 

i dont see how converting to residential would suddenly solve the core issues downtown personally and its wildly impractical but im not saying i have the answers either
you knows its bad when they have to come up with silly gimmicks like this to try to bait people to go downtown 

no i dont want a staycation at the nines  even for free  because that means having to stay downtown and deal with that general environment
nothing is getting me to cross the river to hang out in old town right now either 

hell last time i went downtown  to see a show at the roseland which i wouldnt have done had it not been the bands final tour  i was nearly assaulted by a woman with no pants on in broad daylight fucking twice had my car broken into in a garage and was chased by some methy zombie on my way back to my vehicle after the show 

no thanks this kind of thing is premature  until there have been massive changes and things have cleaned up a lot so to speak trying to bait people to go downtown only to be met with more of the same tired nonsense is not going to be a welcoming enjoyable experience

oh absolutely 100 not even just every year it feels like it gets worse all the time

i absolutely consider my narcolepsy to be quite literally a degenerative issue in many ways  especially where both long and short term memory are concerned and with mental ability overall

i absolutely get worse at an increasingly fast rate where many things are concerned memory attention span mental ability focus absentmindedness brain fog overall fatigue all of it  and more yay

i would say that as a result of narcolepsy essentially rendering me incapable of ever achieving restful restorative sleep it doesnt matter what phase of sleep im primarily getting none of it does anything good anyway none of it counts or helps  
i used to have great short and long term memory and now i might as well have neither  so i dont think any of my narcoleptic sleep is doing either any favors sadly

i wish i could tell you what you can do to fight it but for many of us theres nothing you can do there is no cure for narcolepsy and there is no slowdown for a lot of this   
through medication management you may find reliefmore relief but there is no real return to normal for a lot of us  not to say thats the case for you but its something to be prepared for i wish i wouldve prepared for the harsh realities of this a lot earlier  
   
you can try your best to develop coping skills and routines that help you manage and stay afloat as these things change but its really really hard especially as it worsens   
you just have to take it as it comes and hope that at the end of the day you havent overlooked something too important   
i make a lot of lists but i cant remember to look at them half the time anyway and if i do i dont have the mental ability focus or energy to complete them anyway so its not really helpful i guess  
just be patient and kind to yourself as much as you can  this disease puts a lot of us 1000000000 steps behind everyone else as a baseline and thats extremely crippling we cant expect to operate on the same levels as someone who is privileged enough not to be suffering from this disease   
so you might have to take it slower and sometimes you might forget things or lose focus or have wasted daysweeksmonths  and that sucks but thats just how this disease is   
adhd and narcolepsy are comorbid problems and share many of the same symptoms  researching good coping skills and behavioral strategies to tackle these symptoms will help you a lot but the thing ive found that has helped the most is to slow down  
no one wants to have to slow down or adjust to these awful realities but youre going to have to do it one way or another  willingly or not at a certain point your brain and body will say look we cant do this chill so its a lot better to be accepting of that and work with it willingly than to have everything shut down on you unexpectedly because youre trying to push push push when thats just not possible with narcolepsy most of the time  


for example  i will forget what im doing while im doing it all the time  this is humiliating it makes me want to curl up in a ball and sob uncontrollably and catastrophize to the extreme and it makes it insanely hard to do anything  
but i have come to accept that i cant change this  this is a part of narcolepsy and i cant get rid of that and i cant go back so i try my best to take certain tasks and parts of my day slowly one thing at a time keep reminding myself of what absolutely has to get done and tackling that one at a time first and then moving forward  
i feel like a dementia patient sometimes but at least i can showered eat keep my place somewhat organized and occasionally get some other things done each day i might forget what i picked up my phone for or why i walked into a room but at least i have my priorities lined out  
and once you get into that routine its easier to at least keep running through the key activities you need to tackle  automatic behaviors arent fun but at least you can steer them in a productive direction sometimes

im sorry that youre going through this i wouldnt wish this curse of a disease on anyone i was diagnosed a lot younger than you but it became really isolating and i felt like my entire world fell apart right around your age when i was able to really digest the full reality of the diagnosis and symptoms  and how they had already worsened so much despite being so young  and how that was going to impact me as a real adult on my own  
i would recommend seeking out a therapist if that is an affordable and practical option for you  it can really help to have someone to talk through these things with and to process the really difficult heavy emotions that come with having such a debilitating difficult lifelong illness especially with all the bad stigma lack of understanding and negativity people will give narcoleptics over their diseasesymptoms

it really helped me when i finally was able to say this is a disability i have a disability a lifelong severe disability  
it felt like a prison sentence yet also an intense rush of relief and freedom at the same time i hate that i have it i hate what it does to me i hate that i cant get rid of it but it is real it is hard and i am struggling with a legitimate disability  i can be patient with myself others can be patient with me and its okay if i cant operate on the same level as everyone else my age because i am not them and cant be no matter how hard i work at it

i wish you the best in your journey it may seem bleak now but i would say that you are fortunate to have found out your diagnosis by age 20  there are many posts here of people much older just getting diagnosedstill seeking testing who wasted many many formative years flopping around like a fish out of water just trying to survive with no idea what was going on you have a lot brighter road ahead of you as a result of knowing the why behind your woes
very much agree

unfortunately unless you can literally relocate to a bubble a reactive animal like this just doesnt have a place in society at a certain point

while some reactive animals can be trained enough to be safe just as many cant and no one deserves to have their or their petsloved ones safety  and potentially lives  put at risk by a dangerous biteprone animal in the meantime   
while you can muzzle a dog while its in public extremely reactive dogs are very escapeprone  i could link you 100 stories of pitbulls escaping chewing their way out of houses etc to attack  so taking precautions solely while in public settings just isnt enough if the behavior remains  
and is a dog that would need to be muzzled 100 of the time to be safe going to be a very happy dog one that has to be on a tight leash constantly watched and redirected and reprimanded no i dont think so

dont let the assholes dissuade you from what you know you need to do op   
your safety life and financial stability come first period  if you cant keep those in order you wont be able to provide for a pet either and you have to put yourself first regardless what comes second to that is the safety of those around you  keeping an aggressive dangerous animal is an extreme hazard to everyone else and they dont deserve to have their pets wellness jeopardized as a result

you are not required to keep a dangerous dog just to prove to a bunch of judgmental strangers that youre a good pet owner  if theyre so concerned maybe they should come pick up the dog and take it on along with all the consequences that come with it

it sounds like you genuinely tried your best despite being lied to  which is enough to warrant taking the dog back to the shelter in the first place guilt free  and there is nothing good that will come of being guilted into continuing down this road that you know ends in more disaster 

no one wants an animal to be put down keep returning to a shelter or to deal with these behavioral issues  its sad and it sucks to see animals suffer or lose an opportunity to have a long healthy life  
but its part of life and when a dog reaches a certain point of reactivity and aggression  its perfectly normal acceptable and the right thing to do in cases like this where it harms another persontheir pet  
that dog didnt deserve to be bit  and couldve ended up much worse  nor did another person deserve to see their pet suffer and incur costs and trauma as a result why people feel the need to jump on threads like this and go that dog youre trying to rehome deserves better is fucking beyond me  no it doesnt it isnt the victim here the animal it injured and that pets owner is

best of luck to you op
they quite literally mention a pitbull rescue in their post which would indicate that the dog is a pitbull

why is that pit people need to jump in to save them from stereotypes when even a slight mention of the breed occurs almost like the behaviors speak for themselves
yep this is the only answer that matters call the people who deal with this professionally instead of asking for anecdotes on reddit 

i know this post isnt about stimulants but japans strictness on those medications means ill never be able to fulfill a lifelong dream of visiting  such a shame some countries have such strict medication bans but so it goes
right 

no i absolutely cannot live a normal life with this curse no amount of medication is fixing that  and believe me ive tried 
its not easy never has been and absolutely never will be  and it gets worse all the time and almost certainly will for the rest of my life 


i am also not privileged beyond reason like op here with his multiple 7 figure businesses which makes surviving that much more of a constant horrible battle 

but sure thats nice op im glad its possible for you but thats not the norm  especially if your symptoms are anywhere near severe  and the wording of this post really invalidates those of us desperately trying to stay afloat and make it through this miserable life and trust me we dont need any more invalidating we get plenty
finally getting a diagnosis is both relieving and crushing for a lot of us i can relate

its nice to know what the cause is and to be validated in how youre feeling  you arent just lazy or weak or depressed or not getting enough sleep etc its a legitimate and serious illness  but it can be very hard to come to terms with the fact that this is the rest of your life now and youre at a disadvantage as a result of something you didnt ask for 

some people have great outcomes with treatment and that may be you too
my n is extremely severe and treatment is bleak for me  stimulant medication can only do so much and its not much at all with fast building tolerance  but thats not to say it wont be better for you 
one thing i wish i had known and accepted much earlier on though was that there is no cure and for some treatment just wont ever do much  there will be no rested or normal again for some of us yes its depressing and sucks but accepting that it could be like that lets you prepare process and expect the worst  but hope for the best youll do a lot better taking things as they come and managing the ups and downs  the process of finding medication that works for youyou can tolerate can be very long and difficult  if you look at things honestly at the start and set your expectations accordingly

i wish you the best going forward and hope your outcomes are better than mine it can be a very stressful isolating road but youre not alone
many of us with n who are being treated still do not ever feel finally rested unfortunately it is a complicated illness with not that many treatment options  many of which arent great  and it can get more severe with time be prepared for a lot of trial and error and the potential to never truly be rested again there is no cure for narcolepsy
i kept waiting for this post to get to where she was asking you to be the bad boy and it just never did

unless im missing something  or youre leaving some key pieces out  it doesnt sound like that at all 

what it reads like is that shes just asking you to initiate ideally more spontaneously with more general passion and for you to show her that you are attracted to her and want her in a more physical obvious way

shes not asking you for anything that wild it doesnt seem like   
none of this says degrade me tie me up slap me around  not that theres anything wrong with that i enjoy rougher domination type stuff myself and have a perfectly respectful reliable partner who is happy to step into that role sexually i just dont see that in your post anywhere  it more seems that shes saying i want to feel deeply wanted arousing sexy and sexually desired by my partner ideally with some level of spontaneity

if you cant see yourself initiating rather tame spontaneous sex with your partner that makes her feel like youre wild about her because you picture her as someone you want to have kids withmarry theres a lot to that and that road probably leads to some form of therapy for you

the person you settle down and have kids with isnt your mother or a sibling   
theres no rule that says that role has to be set aside for some clean and virtuous entity that doesnt have a dirty side and that you cant get dirty with or it wont work or be right somehow  
not being able to see someone youre sexually crazy about as a viable long term partner is  as youve acknowledged  not a good complex to have and likely a hangup that will take a bit of work  be it with a therapist or in a more selfguided therapy routine  because i would hazard a guess that it will come out and cause turbulence in the relationship more than just now and in more ways than just this

you are entitled to your own sexual boundaries and desires and if being in a more dominant role isnt for you anymore or isnt something youre seeking in this relationship thats totally fine and its okay to express that kudos to you for making an attempt at giving her something she has expressed wanting but at the same time it sounds like youre forcing yourself into a role you arent thrilled about and dont feel very connected with already psyching yourself out that you probably wont be that fulfilled by it just to check a box off for her  
in the long run thats not going to play out the way you seem to think it is  shell almost certainly not be enjoying it if you arent truly into it and honestly it sounds like youre misreading what she was asking of you and are going into detached sexfiend doesnt give a fuck mode when from what youve written here shes just asking for you to express your sexual attraction and lust for her in a bit more vocal commanding way  
again all i have to go off is your post but it really seems like by dominating shes just asking you to be a bit more in the lead or in control and more expressive of your attraction and sexual desire for her seeing her doing something  that youve agreed upon prior like in the conversation you mention  and thinking god shes gorgeous im so lucky to be with such a beautiful sexy woman can transition quite easily into vocalizing those thoughts and walking up to her and groping her and starting to initiate some foreplaysex nothing about that screams bad boy or sex you dont have with long term valuable partners  if anything youre lifting her up boosting her confidence and sexual confidence and strengthening your sex life by having more frequent fun sexual encounters together

x200b

and it feels a little demanding on her end when we have such a wonderful relationship outside of sex to also say the bedroom needs to be perfect too although of course she should ask for what she wants and i appreciate her honesty

ugh this killed me   
in case no one else has reminded you yet let me make it clear  she doesnt have to settle  
just because you have such a wonderful relationship she doesnt have to put aside her sexual needs and desires and settle for meh because everything else is great   
dont think for one second that its demanding for someone to expect a compatible fulfilling sexual relationship that meets their needs and sexual appetites just because everything else is going smoothly that attitude is going to get you nowhere good and very fast
just because a lot of us have had to do it doesnt mean its okay or should be acceptable closing and then opening is fucking horrible and shouldnt be permitted check what sub youre on jesus

theres also a ritalin shortage in some areas from what ive read doesnt seem as bad as the adderall shortage but not a guarantee either 


its a toss up too theyre honestly not really comparable in effect for some people ritalin does nothing for me energy wise  just makes me feel heavy and terrible
its definitely worth checking out for those who havent

they occasionally do a late night hours event  for those of us who dont get going earlier in the day  where they stay open until 10 or 11 which gives you even more time to check it out  and youll definitely need to set aside a good chunk of time to see it all this place is huge

theres some parking out frontright across from the entrance too which if not full really takes the hassle out of visiting they have a really great selection of all kinds of stuff  some typical to vintage malls some you dont see very often  and everything was really well arranged put together and it felt very clean and cared for it was a really enjoyable environment to browse around in and ill definitely be back took us a solid 23 hours to get through every booth at a leisurely pace but we like to really browse
i would say its pretty on par with a lot of vintage malls and thrift stores in portland honestly not to say that some of the prices arent ridiculous  because i definitely rolled my eyes at a fair amount of tags there  but i wouldnt say its any worse than anywhere else here  portland has its own special brand of silly pricing for vintage and thrifts honestly

that said its still a really cool place to check out tons of booths with some really neat stuff and some prices will surprise you in a good way too
very cool enjoy ive always been intrigued by the craft but it seems costlya bit intense to get into but i love seeing the amazing stained glass things people create i hope you have a good time and enjoy the learning experience
yep sounds about right just watched her little tantrum  you can tell she really thinks she did something there but she looks like a pathetic petulant child having an outburst ahhhh portland gotta love it
youll have to do what everyone else has to do right now  call around

stock changes constantly a place that had it for one commenter will likely now be out as other people filled there 

im fortunate to get mine through kaiser so handle everything with them and dont have to branch out but my partner is also prescribed it and its the same thing every month he gets up early and starts calling the pharmacies he used to regularly go to first asking what mg they have only to be told none and then moves through the list calling all the costcos  from portland to vancouver to hillsboro and tigardbeaverton  then fred meyer  starting closest to us and branching out  then safeway etc 

theres a national shortage no one has a mystery in right now stock fluctuates constantly  hell sometimes theyll have run out by the time my partner makes a mad dash over with his paper prescription  

you can try to have your doctor change the dosage breakdown  same daily dose different mg pills to achieve that  but youre still up against a shortage impacting all mgs
ive heard name brand  if you can afford it or get an authorization with your insurance  isnt as impacted but have also heard it is so who knows
i get mine for narcolepsy via mail through kaiser no problems ymmv outside of kaiser but its certainly legal
exactly  

youre not more entitled to sitting because you chose to have kids your kids arent more entitled to sitting because theyre kids  hell if anything theyre probably better equipped to stand than some of the rest of us 
if sitting is importantnecessary to you and you dont get there in time to be seated on the bus that comes you can wait for another bus 

first come first served

im a lady but as a heavily tattooed youngerlooking person i am so endlessly tired of the dirty looks from entitled moms and their bratty kids 
i have an invisibledisability and i absolutely need to sit but i have straight up heard garbage moms trash talking me because that disrespectful expletive wont move why even come to disney if you look like that this place is for kids my kids need to sit on numerous occasions
so neither your bff or his brother is a neurologist or sleep specialist hmm yeah not sure why theyre surprised theyre not someones goto for narcolepsy
leave it to ufeetpicsaddict to drop a super unpopular unfun take

this is such a good point and i somehow didnt even think of it as a solution either 

this is the perfect balance  doesnt invalidate the starcruiser in its current formstoryline when cruisers are visiting and allows for a fair distribution of character interactions most fans want the rest of the time 

i want to meet grogu more than words can describe but im simply not going to disneyland again at this point
you said it

have also had a doctor say well it must not be that bad if you arent willing to take  as if miserable side effects arent a reasonable deterrent 
like wo im miserable already maybe i cant risk a milelong list of additional misery either 
totally feel ya
its crazy how little many doctors seem to care about the sexual side effects of those types of medications 

literally have experienced multiple doctors say well yes the sexual side effects are a real and not uncommon risk but that hardly seems as important as managing depressionanxiety and well yes but if youre genuinely experiencing anxietydepression it seems like that should be a far higher priority than anything to do with sex 

its not that doctors dont know about these side effects  or at least a lot of them seem to  its that they dont really caredont see it as importantfeel like you should be fine with it if the medication works otherwise 

as if losing sexual desire pleasure arousal etc  and for some people losing those things seemingly permanently or for a very long time  isnt a serious problem in and of itself that can cause depression anxiety serious relationship problems etc  

i mean yeah when youre going through a mental health crisisdealing with prolonged mental health issues those things do tend to need to take priority but the general attitude around it is really unhelpful and alienating

so your argument against higher wages is that if it costs you more its not okay 

so you think you should be able to go enjoy wdw have cast members working for your enjoyment and being on top of their game but those people dont deserve a living wage if it impacts you

gross
wait what they switched your adderall

are you normally prescribed armodafinil they cant just make a switch to a different medication on their own
ah yes im a transplant and where im from i perceive to be worse so therefore yall have nothing to complain about and it cant possibly be bad for you here my favorite
it is pretty depressing out there i dont disagree 

there are a few pockets that have been more recently cleaned up or developed  theyve tried to make downtown hillsboro literally a 3 block stretch more inviting and happening and while its cute and nicer than it was its still pretty sad smalltown stuff 
a lot of payday loan strip mall dirty building wasteland strips as well as a mix of dingy older neighborhoods and cookie cutter newer suburban hoa developments 
its pretty safe  theres some pockets of tomfoolery but not more than anywhere else  but very boring and depressing
interesting i rented in gresham once many years ago and was almost shot  like a matter of seconds and it wouldve been me  in my doorway twice no hyperbole shit was like the wild west up there long before portland got to the level of bad it is now im semi surprised ne was worse for you 

i prefer seattle to portland but know they share many of the same issues so wouldnt want to make that relocation mistake 
i will say seattle is remarkably nicer in comparison regardless 

i grew up in hillsboro and have been in various sections of portland proper for over a decade its absolutely a wasteland of filth and insanity now and i cant wait to leave someday 
ive been fucked with and put in direct danger more times here than any other major city ive been in and ive traveled a lot  and have lived in other major metros as well 
this list is definitely beyond wrong

unfortunately hillsboro and happy valley arent exactly the peak of safety and cleanliness either these days but theyre remarkably tame  and better  comparably 
gresham on the other hand thats never been a safe suburb
which suburbs even sadly i live in portland now this list made me chuckle
exactly

if you want something it is up to you  as a fucking grown adult  to ask for it no one is going to read your mind and no one should be expected to either

if your needs werent met communicate that if you need something specific communicate that otherwise the only person you have to blame for not getting what you want is you and acting like a petulant child by being sour over it when you couldnt communicate like an adult or because now that i had to ask i dont want it anymore is pitiful

now if youve talked to a partner about this multiple times and have expressed that you need  during  and need them to make a point of doing so in the future and they continue to ignore those requests thats another story   
but assuming that every single man is going to read your mind assume what your exact needs are at the exact time without being told and will live up to your expectations without any communication well theres a reason youre continuously disappointed  and its because it just doesnt work that way
same some of the nightmare neighbors ive had i cant imagine buying a unit that shares a buildingwall 

sure you can get stuck with awful neighbors in a standalone home but youre not literally connected to them its a different beast but still a bit more privacyoptions 

ive lived in duplexes and unless the insulation is literally the best on the planet fuck no would i buy and sign up to live indefinitely with whoever ends up abovebelowbeside me 

im living in a townhouse right now and i love it  great insulation so the neighbors i share a wall with never hear me nor i them and the neighbor across the shared patio space is generally quiet and very kind so it all works out 
however before the neighbors across the patio moved in we had a 3 month battle trying to get our landlord to get rid of the tenants that moved in  and decided they were entitled to making all the noise in the world and having a constant stream of 20something partyassholes over
theyd set up a fucking dinner table in the patio space  which our landlord explained to them should be treated as if an incredible fence was in the middle it was not 100 shared between us our side was ours and theirs theirs  basically right in front of our kitchen window and blocking our patio doors host loud parties with woo shots every 2 minutes etc
one of the pair was a professional dj so anytime they played music  on their pro equipment of course  it would vibrate my entire house i could hear that shit in my upstairs shower when bathing windows closed on both houses and i wanted to kill them it was nonstop i could somehow hear her talking in my upstairs bedroom with my tv on  all windows closed  and her partner joked he had measured the decibels of her voice shes so loud lol when i confronted them 

fortunately they were evicted  they had crossed the landlord too many times and this was the last phase of last straws  but god i cant imagine what it wouldve been like had i owned this townhouse and they were staying put 
not that moving when leasing is easy as pie but its a lot less of a mess than when you own
i want to preface this by saying that my intention here is not to be a negative nelly or try to shut down your hopes and goals before they even start 

like you said no one knows what the outcome of your sleep appointments will be if you will even receive a related diagnosis or what a treatment plan may look like for you 

  
given that all i can do is speak to some of the variables and possibilities and try to give you the perspective of someone who does have narcolepsy and what that journey has looked like for me  
even if you do receive a narcolepsy  or ih  diagnosis your symptoms journey and treatment may  and probably will  look very or even completely different from mine

  
im not here trying to spread a message of doom and gloom and hope that you dont digest my comment and take it as that  rather i want to share my perspective from my experience which may or may not ever be relevant to you purely because i wish someone had told me these things when i was first figuring it out

  
i got a whole lot of stay positive and theres treatment out there youll be fine if you just do xyz and sometimes you just have to roll with the punches and do it even if youre miserable  none of which helped   
no one prepared me for the real realities of this awful disease  i am diagnosed with narcolepsy specifically  and how debilitating and crippling it truly can be for those of us with severe symptoms   
it took many years and many appointments before someone was finally honest with me about the true realities for many of us with n i was made to think that there would be a return to normal and that i wouldnt always be behind everyone else struggling to keep up and balance my life for many of us there is no normal and there is no back on top  


now again every narcoleptic is different some people dont have that severe of symptoms some people respond well to medications  especially when their symptoms werent ever that bad to begin with  and the impact to their day to day life is minimal

for a lot of us however that couldnt be further from reality

there is no cure for narcolepsyih 

it does not just go away and you dont just return to normal  which is to say successful treatment may not mean elimination of symptoms or return to presymptomatic state of being and instead means decentslight managementminimizing of some symptoms

you mention once im sleeping and able to live like a normal person  something that you may have to accept down the road is that this will never happen   
nih means you do not sleep like a normal person  though it can be minimized through medication for some people this is not something that just goes away or stops for most sufferers 

the road to diagnosis can be years long requiring stressful uncomfortable and sometimes inconclusive testing  that may need to be done multiple times and can be very disruptive to your life not to mention ungodly expensive in some cases  
these diseases are still fairly rare and the researchtreatment plans available are not as plentiful as we would like as such the treatment options available can be cumbersome unpleasant and extremely time consuming to get right  and even then many of us find that no matter what medication were on nothing really breaks through the symptoms and at best provides very very slight help but never relief   
these medications come with their own list of other problemsside effects can be very expensive difficult to get and hard to balance and like all medication management it can be a long road of trial and error trying to find the right combination  and a painful road of trying to fight the build up of tolerance once you do find something that works

my sleep doctor once put it to me in a way i really did not want to hear but in hindsight wished i wouldve heard much sooner  
i expressed to him my frustration with n and how behind i felt all the time that i was sick of trying to balance work college and all the other responsibilities i had to try to keep my life in order and stay afloat that i was sick of starting 100 steps behind everyone else so exhausted fatigued and brain fogged that i could barely function  
i expected some sort of well eventually this will improve we just need to  or something to that effect but instead he said essentially   
well i hate to break it to you but you have narcolepsy theres nothing you can do to erase that we can keep working on medication management but youre never going to not be narcoleptic as much as that might suck to accept acceptance is necessary  and acceptance means accepting that you simply cannot do the same things as everyone else like everyone else you have to manage your expectations of your life and realize that you have a disease that will in some ways hold you back whether that means you have to do things slower or whether that means you have to manage your schedule differently maybe that means you cant go to school full time and work full time simultaneously no one wants to limit themselves but if you dont you will crash and burn because like it or not you are dealing with a lifelong health problem that is going to be there actively working against you regardless so you can either accept that and make adjustments so you can manage it or you can pretend that its not a factor and continue to wonder why youre feeling exhausted sick and terrible all the time while everything falls apart  


of course i was not happy with that conversation at first and instinctually wanted to go youre wrong i can do whatever i want just like everyone else but the more i thought about it the more i realized how right he was  
its unfortunate and no one wants to face that reality but when youre diagnosed with a disease  like nih  that impacts your ability to get restful restorative sleep and leaves you with extreme fatigue brain fog memory problems hallucinations and all kinds of other comorbid problems and disorders like it or not you are not operating on the same normal level as a person without nih and it will only harm you to try to pretend and live as though you are

before this gets too too long  this is all to say that

a diagnosis  and treatment plan  does not likely mean a return to normal expecting that it does is setting yourself up for major heartache and disappointment in the future  
though you may well find that medication and treatment help a great deal and you are only dealing with some slight symptoms here and there you should also be prepared for a long difficult stressful road of trying to figure all this out  and a future where medication doesnt really help that much potentially

being prepared for the worst case scenario like that is the best thing you can do for yourself strive to find the best treatment possible hope that it works out that way but if it doesnt  
start thinking now about what that future looks like how will you manage that what will you have to do to adjust and stay afloat and progress in your life if that is the hand youre dealt what support would you need to be able to adapt and make it through if thats the case what can you do now to make things easier on yourself in the short medium and long term if your symptoms persist as they are now  


these are all things i wish i wouldve spent my time focusing on and preparing for  and getting started on immediately  instead of waiting for some potential treatment or diagnosis down the road and going over hypotheticals in my head about a potential time in the future where id get my life going again  because that future never really came the way i had hoped for

if you cant express your viewpoints in a constructive civil manner they will continue to be removed for violating rule 1  constructive discussion is one thing berating other users and responding with disrespectful antagonistic comments is another and the latter will not be tolerated here

consider this a warning before a temp ban in the future

if you cant be civil you will receive a temp ban  this is a warning if you dont have anything nice to say move along
this was my answer as well 

lets start by giving some love to and adding to the existing pavilions that mt fuji ride would be amazing so sad it never came to be
not everyone can afford to move some people have jobs doctors sickaging family close by with needs etc
some people live in poverty and can barely afford to keep a roof over their head nonetheless the thousands it costs to uproot and start over elsewhere  or move further and spend out the ass to commute 

the answer to violent criminal homeless people turning the city into an open air drug market and asylum isnt well just leave then
its a problem that needs solving
ive noticed that too i love visiting different parts of florida  people seem much friendlier much healthier and happier mentally and physically and the overall vibe is a lot less angry and depressed and dirty 

the politics side does suck but its not how everyone there feels or lives
i have gay friends and trans friends there who love it and have solid communities around them a few portland friends have moved there and said theyd never look back
but its a major move wont be cheap and is a major climate adjustment so its a lot to consider
im so sorry for your loss

what a sweet set up he had  its so obvious how much you loved him and how close you both were im sure he cherished being able to be so close to you all the time  i love seeing when folks create little spaces to be closer to their pets through their daily routine instead of just setting their bed in a corner and calling it good

when i lost my little dude last summer it was so rough coming home and seeing little pieces of him everywhere the house felt so empty and cold and he was missing every direction i looked   
for me at least it helped to keep some of those little spaces or pieces still around as a tribute it will sting for a while whether you leave anything up or not to look at those spaces where your friend should still be but eventually it will be a cherished memory to look back on hang in there 3
im curious what literally nothing really is like versus how it works at the beginning 

im not saying this is whats going on for you merely posing it as a possibility because it seems to happen to a lot of people

when you first start a stimulant medication though it doesnt have the same adjustment period and build up in your system phase as say antidepressants there is still an adjustment period where your bodybrain are getting used to the medication and the effects are settling in so to speak

so at the beginning you might feel great and then about a week later it doesnt feel as great and then a few weeks later you arent really noticing it at all because it doesnt feel like it did in week one   
that doesnt mean it isnt doing anything it just means you arent feeling the medication in the same stimulating noticeable way which is the point  you arent going to feel that buzzy lifted feeling past the first week or so of taking a stimulant  at the right dose as directed for a legitimate illness anyway

people tend to confuse this with tolerance and with the medication not working at all and ceasing to be effective when its more that the medication has settled in and you are getting passive benefits but not in the same jolt as when it is fresh in your system

now that doesnt mean that youre at the right dose or that there isnt a better medication combo out there or something you should add in addition to it just that its important to adjust our expectations of what these medications are for and what theyre really supposed to do in our systems  
stimulants arent ever going to make you feel truly rested or awake or alert theyre supposed to help take the edge off a bit definitely and make it easier to stay focusedalertfight through that excessive sleepiness and brain fog a bit   
but theyre also not miracle drugs  for the majority of us with nih theyre not going to break through all of our symptoms or even most of them and theyre not going to magically erase the tiredness and heaviness when were on them were still going to have to deal with all the awful shit that comes with these diseases just maybe a little less so or with a little bit more power to push through it

were still going to be exhausted were still going to really struggle its just an aid not a pause button  
likewise its very important to still be practicing good sleep hygiene eatinghydrating super well and generally taking good care of ourselves because if we arent stimulants will do less than nothing

are you truly feeling zero improvementeffect after those few weeks or is it just not as noticeableas much of a boost when you take it theres a big difference between nothing at all and something but not strongly detectable and its an important difference to recognize 

if none of that rings true for you i apologize just wanted to offer a different perspective as i see a lot of people having unrealistic expectations of what stimulants and medication can really do and feeling that because they cant feel anything when they take it their meds must just not be working at all 

x200b

if its not the above i would definitely recommend continuing to try different medication combinations and keeping a journal of your time on them to recognize patterns

it would likely be very helpful for both you and your doctors to be able to see the timeline when youre taking these medications things like

 how it feels at the start
 how long it is effective each dayyou notice benefits
 the schedule youre taking them on and what youre eatingdrinkingdoing around those times
 when youre eatinghydrating in relation to your medication schedule 
 sleepexercisework schedules
 when you start noticing it becoming less effective and exactly what that looks like each day

having a timeline to look at might help youthem to draw conclusions about what is going on is it your diet other medications youre taking sleep hygiene what else is happening in your life when the effects start to dwindle is there any correlation or none at all

it might just be that you metabolize these medications faster than average or maybe fooddrink you consume is playing a part in that or your sleep hygiene is very poor and thus stimulants arent going to stay consistently effective no matter how many you take  theres a lot of things that can play into this

it sounds weird but believe it or not in some cases taking higher doses can make you more tiredbe less effective especially if within the period of a month youre rushing straight to 60mg  that might be counterproductive and whats causing the problem 

you cant possibly decide in the course of a month or less that multiple different doses of a medication is wrong or right  you need to give it time to settle and to develop a routine for even just a short time to have a conclusive accurate answer one way or another

you might be someone that benefits from er and ir combos  er to keep a level all day but ir boosters periodically during times you are prone to crash or use up more energy or you may prefer exclusively ir so you can tailor the release of your meds to the times you need the boost the most but either way it takes time to figure out the  best combo and you have to be willing to be patient

it sucks but the fact of the matter is those of us with nih are always going to be struggling and suffering from the exhaustionsleepiness brain fogmental symptoms etc  the cycle never ends this is a lifelong diagnosis with lifelong challenges  
the sooner you accept that this is a long trek and not a short race the better  yeah it fucking sucks to have to deal with for any length of time and no one wants to be exhaustedgoing through the hassle and rollercoaster that is finding the right medication thatll work long term   
but its absolutely worth the hassle energy struggle and exhaustion that it takes to be patient and do it right instead of jumping around just trying to make something stick this might take a while for you to figure out and its probably going to suck a lot in the interim we can all relate i promise  
just be kind to yourself be patient and remember that in the grand scheme of things this phase is very short compared to the rest of your life   
it sucks to have to accept but the fact is  it doesnt matter how much of a rush you are in this shit takes time theres no way around that   
none of us have wanted to put our lives on hold to deal with this disease but i can confidently say most of us have had to  or will have to  at one point or another thats just how it works  its not fair we didnt ask for this but thats what life with a disease like this is like its largely not on your terms  you have to roll with the punches  


if you havent already reaching out to your academic advisor andor disability services center at your college would likely be a good idea since you mention worrying about dropping out letting them know that you are diagnosed dealing with the long and harsh struggle of medication managementtreatment and would like to make them aware in case you need accommodations  and thinking of what accommodations might help you in case you need them going forward  would be a great start especially as they may have some suggestions for yoube willing to work with you on certain things  
nih are very much a disability for many of us

best of luck to you
thank you so much for such a kind caring response youre amazing

so its funny you should mention the high heat  after another comment recommended going in and asking to purchase some of the sauce my partner made the trek for me and picked up a small container of it i tried to use it with some chicken i tend to toss in the slow cooker and i found that it didnt taste anything like the sauce i was used to  so i immediately figured they either changed suppliersrecipes or it was a me problem because i am a horribly inexperienced cook

i would love to be able to recreate the porkyakisoba noodle wok that ns had and it sounds like the key to doing that will be cooking it the same way to get the sauce hot enough if you have any tips to try to recreate this i would be so so grateful  
i dont know what it is but i feel like we all have that one thing that we crave constantly and always go back to  i hate that mine is the porkyakisoba ns wok but i have eaten those for a solid decade and i think going to get them after various doctors appointmentssurgeries kind of trained my body to crave it as comforthealing food so to speak

im guessing i will need to figure out buying some kind of wok dish to cook this in to start as well but any tips for this complete novice would be amazing thank you again you come off so warm and kind in your comment and it really touched me
if the shoe fits 
because some irrational entitled guest calling and demanding they call the authorities because they smell something they dont like isnt how they enforce any of their policies
if the hotel was full there is nothing they can do about moving you obviously
im certain they investigated the issue  whether you were made aware of it or not they dont owe you a personal view of their every move because you called to whine  and when they determined there was no problemnothing that could be done due to lack of evidence or issue they moved along to the next responsibility 

implying that disney is full of druggies and disney is actively aware of their presence and willfully enabling it is so hilariously delusional you clearly live a life of great privilege if disney seems full of druggies to you
all of this you said it

the sleep is the simplest of the issues honestly and seemingly the only one that 90 of websites about narcolepsy want to mention  and that most doctors want to focus on and that anyone learning about the disease care to retain

yeah the sleep side of things fucking sucks dont get me wrong

but the memory loss i have no short termworking memory i might as well have a degenerative brain disorder or early onset alzheimers im losing my past and i cant form a present 

the physical and mental pain it fucking hurts to have narcolepsy my head always feels heavy exhausted foggy and actually in physical pain my body is always achy it takes me longer to recover from sleeping wrongbecoming sore sometimes the process of chewing is so painfully exhausting i cant even fathom eating standing up long enough to shower can be a burning sensation when im at my most tired

the attention and focus issues the automatic behaviors the microsleeps the mood problems 

im a fucking useless zombie 95 of the day  if im lucky

im so sick of seeing narcolepsy information only mention 35 fucking symptoms every piece of literature out there paints us like sluggish sleepy oafs that have weird dreams and sleep paralysis but beyond being tired should function fine during the day

ridiculous

and god the stigma with medication you said it if i read one more fucking complaint from posts across reddit regarding the stimulant shortage ripping on stimulant users  and acting like adhd people are the only ones who get this medication  my head is going to explode
god this one really hurts

money issues aside  since im so cripplingly disabled by narcolepsy i will be living in abject poverty for the rest of my life  when i have been able to vacationget away the stress and exhaustion makes it hard to get anywhere near my moneys worth out of the experience

i end up feeling more depressed than anything when i try to get away because its harder and harder all the time to get up and have any semblance of a day  whether at home or anywhere else 

i had so many dreams of travel and accepting that none of them will ever happen  both due to this fucked up country damning disabled people to a life of poverty and due to all the terrors of narcolepsy  has been absolutely crushing

i have wanted to visit japan ever since i was a young child i knew deep down id never be able to afford it but i at least kept the dream alive as a but what if  
but when i learned that you cant bring stimulant medication into the country i had an actual sobbing breakdown  
it was written in stone at that moment that i will never achieve that dream someone could hand me 50000 tomorrow and it will still never happen  
this is just one of many dreams ive had that moment about and it fucking sucks

narcolepsy has stolen every dream every desire and every goal ive ever had from me 

i would love to vacation again some day but i know its just a waste ill sleep through most of it and even if i dont i wont remember most of it anyway
they really should expand this  and do it at om as well the hours are super short and its super infrequent
not everyone wants the experience of going to a childrens machine or a zoo when visiting meow wolf 
unfortunately no  i would be laughed out of the pharmacy or my doctors office if i even attempted to ask for extras of a controlled substance not only is it not legally permitted youre more than likely going to be marked as a drug seeker  which is something that can impact your ability to get your lifesaving medications for the rest of your life  for even asking no matter how reasonable the explanation might be such as relating to something like this

i have fortunately been able to obtain a few months extra of things like my migraine medications and such but where the important stuff is concerned sadly our laws around controlled substances are really frankly stupid

as i am painfully impoverished  always have been and always will be yay america  collecting a surplus of anything isnt really realistically feasible food stamps barely supplies enough to survive the month youre receiving benefits for stockpiling is out of the question and with inflation itll only become less and less doable for folks like myself who arent welloff having the space to store things like water or extra food or supplies would also be a major problem  comfortable spacious housing isnt exactly abundant here

i do appreciate your seemingly optimistic and wellinformed outlook on things youre right  people need to prepare and there needs to be a plan in place to help those who couldnt stockpile and dont have the resources should an event like this happen
unfortunately for those of us who are poor and disabled  and who have difficult medical needs  it wont really matter what the plan is we will be forgotten because there will be too much else to manage and it will be too hard to cover our needs
definitely thought it said criddler  which is a term used here in portland perhaps elsewhere too to describe our special flavor of awful methzombie homeless folks  and was very confused 

looks great though seriously nicely done
chuckled at the windows 95 manual mention 

ive seen one in a neighborhood lfl when walking to the store once or twice  as well as some very random textbooks  and wondered if theyd get any takers
who knows  that manual could be the book for someone who has truly read everything 
ah yes because white people cant be impoverished struggle with access to things or have need for free books exchanges 

totally awesome point
thank you 
thank you so much 

i am by no means a good cook so perhaps that is why but ive made teriyaki sauce at home with a similar recipe and while decent it just wasnt it  i dont know what it is exactly but the ns sauce just tasted very different to other teriyaki ive had and i could never figure out why but lets just say i probably couldve singlehandedly kept the wok bar open with how often id eat it 

i will give it another shot with this list on hand though i appreciate it so much 
im completely useless in the kitchen so id guess that plays a part in why i cant quite identify what it is about the ns teriyaki that makes it different but guess quality of ingredients and exact amounts does okay a big part in the final flavor  ill try to play around a bit 
thank you again
thank you so much for your response

i dont know that ive ever seen teriyaki chicken in the self serve hot bar but then again i cant say ive looked that hard  do you know if thats something they may still offer or if that was an older thing the couple times i asked about it since the wok closed i was told they had no ideadidnt sell the same stuff they used back there 

funnily enough i worked at the cedar hills new seasons a bit under a decade ago and wish i wouldve thought to investigate then but i just assumed it would be around forever
thank you so much for responding

im essentially just trying to find the teriyaki sauce that was used in the woks 
i dont know if yall used a certain brand or how it was made if it was something specific to new seasons but im desperate to find it
i dont know why but there was something different about it that i havent found in other teriyaki sauces and i crave it constantly
ah thank you so much  ill give that a shot

the aftermath of my stepdads suicide was pretty fucked up i guess 

he shot himself in front of my mom last january couldnt have been more unexpected  not that you ever expect these things but there were zero signs this was not someone exhibiting depression or going through a rough patch at all 

i had to clean up the aftermath on my own maybe an hour after they took him to the er  he didnt make it but he was kept alive on machines for a week so they could harvest him for organ donation which quite frankly was almost more awful of an experience overall than cleaning up the unreasonably awful aftermath 

i still think about it all the time never on purpose it just flashes by sometimes 
its weird  you see suicides in movies bloody scenes on screen it isnt really like that its different its somehow both less shocking and gory and more gruesome all at the same time 



i guess second to that would be six months later holding my cat who i loved more than anything while he bled to death from a needlessly cruel and gruesome mauling by our deplorable neighbors pit bull 
think what you want about pets cats dont have to be your thing but it absolutely ripped my heart out haunts me all the time
this cracked me up what a wild way to say i cant afford to purchase a parking pass 
it does look good but i much prefer the tower at night without projections it just looks right when its lit up normally projection free and is really beautiful
some of the holiday projections while well done are way too busychaotic 
the 50th look as in ops photo feels like the best of all of them  not too over the top and very crisp  but i feel like it really takes away from the tower and looks a bit odd in the area that said theyre fun once and a while
at this point on the rare occasion i attempt to explain what narcolepsy is likehow some of the symptoms are i will use degenerative alongside a lot of the brainmental symptoms  such as memory loss loss of executive functioning automatic behaviors brain fog etc 

i have absolutely lost most of my short termworking memory executive functioning attention span organization skills recollection etc   
the brain fog and memory loss absolutely feels degenerative  gets worse all the time has gotten progressively and measurably worse over the years and has notwill notis not coming back or ever getting better 

just know  youre not alone a lot of us are experiencing these symptoms and with extreme severity   
its terrifying can be embarrassing and no one really gets it  unless they have narcolepsy theyll never know what its like even remotely just on the exhaustion alone

i absolutely relate to everything you mentioned and im so sorry youre going through all this too

its mortifying to forget simple things that you should absolutely know  and knew for years its so scary to realize how much your memory has deteriorated  and to know itll never come back i wish there was a way out or back from this awful disease
they still come in daily anyway unfortunately whether youre getting cleaning services or not but i agree  i prefer not to have people maneuvering around my stuff every day i worry about things getting losttakentossed by mistake
i mean considering i need a controlled substance medication to survive each day  and not collapse at random or be essentially catatonic  i will be at the mercy of however much medication i have left when a disaster hits if the stress and trauma of the event doesnt render it useless anyway so im not working myself up too much about it im not one of the folks meant to survive something like this 


its close to impossible for anyone suffering through life in poverty to be reasonably prepared anyway 
where are people supposed to store all these supplies nonetheless afford them 
our government is happy to leave the poor out to suffer and die on a normal day  and through the pandemic  so i can say with certainty the same will be true in an event such as this 

it sucks to think about but at the same time theres only so much a lot of us can do to prepare 
knowing i cant really do anything i try not to think about it 
i agree with you

while ops boyfriend may have been lying and doesnt sound very committed here op doesnt exactly sound like mature relationship material either 

shes 29 for gods sake this is some teenage drama bullshit 
id be pretty upset too if someone was posting my photo and information on a dating forum to get opinions and takes from strangers thats a pretty big violation of my privacy and id be pretty upset that my supposed partner wouldnt address their concerns with me or talk to me about whats bothering them  but would happily go to strangers and blast my picture and problems online 

op has some growing up to do
i got precheck specifically because regular tsa times at pdx were so godawful i couldnt take it anymore

has never taken more than 10 minutes in precheck even when getting those emails even the days after thanksgiving when the normal line was clogging back to the carrier desk areas and wrapped several rows of dividers deep 
 
it doesnt hurt to be 15 hours early regardless but ive never needed 23 with precheck pdx also has an estimator on their website you can check 
i think in general it really depends on when youre traveling specifically  i think they send that as a blanket warning rather than it being triggered by your specific flight time
this is my fearassumption  my hope was they sell itits purchasable somewhere or something i could obtain a recipe for but im guessing this is probably the case
i have this as well and i love it the tower is my absolute favorite  im not a huge funko person but i think this one is super well done they have one with mickey in black instead of gold as well
yep  its probably near impossible to switch in such little time and if you do id question how preparedrested youd be for the studyif it would have a negative impact still 

i would call your doctorwhomever is doing your study and ask what they recommend if you can op let them know youre really concerned
ive done this three times in the last year actually and was told no idea no one back here worked that and uh why would i have taken note of that 

i was hoping perhaps this post would reach an exwok worker or someone whos had more success in asking but ill attempt to ask again in the future  i just dont get to ns often especially these days
right 

as if nearly every bar ive ever been in in portland doesnt actively overserve constantly 
bottle service exists in other states and manages just fine
thats pretty silly
even dives are getting to be that bad these days 

i could rarely ever afford to go out before but now its getting insane
im so glad i mean not glad youre going through it equally because that sucks and im so sorry but im so glad my comment resonated with you and helped im so sorry youre feeling it too friend always here if you need to chat i wish you the absolute best in your journey
do you seriously think that their only job requirements involve aimlessly hunting for stolen cars are you kidding me
i didnt say that i knew for a fact she did as we clearly dont 

i said if she did just because there isnt a lease doesnt mean she isnt a tenant eviction doesnt require a lease as you so confidently incorrectly stated 

there are other laws surrounding occupancy and establishing tenancy that dont involve paying any rent as well 
under no circumstances do you get to kick someone out with one day or less notice unless youre an idiot that wants to deal with a hell of a legal ordeal with the court system 
i dont need to source anything these are facts in the real world  sounds like you could use to start living in it
this is stupid plain ignorant advice  it varies by location but in most a lease is not required establishing tenancy occurs through a few different avenues and no doubt if shes lived there over a few months paid any rent etc she is legally a tenant and must be given proper legal notice to vacate  for legally permitted reasons  or be evicted through the court system 
in some states even just occupying a space for a certain period of time gives you these types of rights 

you dont just get to kick someone out without even a day to pack no matter how much you dont like themhow shitty it was that they brought dogs into your house

hopefully no one listens to this absolutely dumb completely inaccurate take
likely because there are a lot of landlords on this subreddit whereas the people you are talking to are probably largely not in that category

the most vocal are always the most noticeable on reddit as a general rule there is plenty of pushback from rentersthose who arent super prolandlords making big profits around these parts too but you will definitely see landlords chime in more vocally when something is impacting them directly because while not all renters may be bothered by some of these billschanges it will apply to all landlords
did you not read disabled there us folks with disabilities work harder just to survive each day than you likely ever will in your fucking lifetime

there is no work more work better for disabled folks quite frankly  if we can work at all which many of us cant hence disabled the jobs are almost never paying a living wage nor are enough hours availablecan we work enough hours to get by

hard work more work  these dont equal more money in the us you can work yourself to death and still be paycheck to paycheck because the system isnt built to raise you up its built to keep you down theres nothing the majority can do to escape that  especially when theyre already living life in hard mode by having a disability which they also cant fucking do anything about didnt ask for and didnt deserve

youre a privileged piece of shit clearly by your tone and ideals here maybe spoiled entitled consider yourself lucky you arent in the same position as those of us who are disabled and impoverished and who are barely surviving despite all our best efforts

this is your first and final warning before a ban the way youre engaging on this subreddit is absolutely not okay if you cant be respectful and civil with other users you wont be here at all
for a good majority of people it wont have much if any impact more than likely because for a good majority of people it isnt a problem and isnt interfering with their livessexual relationships  so what exactly would there be for it to improveeffect

those friends of yours who noted it had some kind of effect on them likely were using it differently than you experiencing different negative effects from their routines than you or potentially also reduced the amount they were masturbating in addition to ceasing to view porn  honestly theres quite a lot of things that could factor into why they noticed a difference in their lives and you did not unless you are doing a 11 comparison between two people living exactly the same livesroutines with the same masturbationporn habits and such its really hard to sayto expect the same effects

a lot of people who quit watching pornography also stop masturbating dailyas much this decrease in masturbation on top of quitting porn would likely cause an increase in general horniness potentially sexual performance and would mean theyre allocating time they normally would be using to jerk off to do other things which could be perceived as discipline or work ethic since theyre potentially spending more time on other things

these friends also couldve had more obscure porngeneral masturbation habits that was impacting their sex livessexual motivation maybe they were jerking off more than you and reduced the frequency or maybe they were spending a great deal of time per session watching porn and no longer doing so freed up a good deal of free time for them

theres a lot to be said for the placebo effect if the person quitting is doing so because they feel its problematiccausing issuesa negative behavior or they go into it expecting and truly believing they will experience a great deal of positive benefits they may perceive the outcome of the change to go along with that belief it may not actually be positive benefits relating to ceasing porn use but theyre attributing it to thatclaiming that is  either because thats what they want other people to believe due to their own motivesmentality or because they dont realize that the change is more in themselves than it is a result of quitting porn
a lot of times when were going to make a sizable change in our lives under the assumption it will benefit us positively and improve things like mood motivation drive productivity etc we tend to start working a bit harder at things in general staying more upbeatoptimistic trying to balance our priorities more etc
those things can improve without changing anything around pornmasturbation but because theyve committed to this quit that they believe will improve their lives suddenly quitting porn is solely responsible for this change when thats not it at all

point being  the only person whos habits and results matter in your life is yours
if you dont feel porn is causing any problems in your life  sexually motivation wise etc  and you are satisfied with your work ethic sexual interactions motivation etc then theres no reason to deprive yourself of it or consider it a bad habit
when you start neglecting other tasksresponsibilities to watch porn thats when it starts becoming an actual problem  it doesnt sound like you hadhave issues with porn addiction or dependency so theres no reason to quit unless you personally dont find it enjoyable and want to spend your time differently

youre already masturbating every day  what difference does it make if its with or without porn unless youre specifically spending worrisome amounts of time doing it when you do use porn or if the porn use is impacting your sexual relationships with real partners as long as thats not the case  and youre not causing yourself death grip or related issues  again its not a negative thing

there is a very obnoxiously vocal minority that are very antiporn  either nojerk bros religious types very insecure folks etc  who will tell you quit at all costs its bad negative you dont need it its pathetic especially in a relationship 
these types are to be ignored
theres nothing wrong with watching it nothing wrong with not  make the best choices for you based on you alone
hmm i would say that this really depends for me on what exactly im telling them in terms of how im doing

i have completely given up on explaining my strugglessymptoms relating to narcolepsy to other people or answering how i am doing in relation to this fucking terrible disease

people who do not have narcolepsy will never truly understand what it is like period though id say people who live withare very close to someone with it will have at least a better idea they still will never really get what its like to be essentially running as though youre 72 hours sleep deprived as a baseline 

trying to explain to people im so fucking tired because i am incapable of getting restful restorative sleep ever again in my life is exhausting in and of itself  because people immediately try to relatecompare and go to things like oh im really tired too because ive been really busysickwhatever and its never going to compare on the same level and gets so old honestly 

when it comes to other issues again it depends i no longer explain that i cant do  because of narcolepsy and how it is impacting my mental healthhow my life is falling apart as a result because people always come back with well just sleep more or lol i wish i could sleep all the time that doesnt sound so bad 

nonnarcolepsy related things like emotional woes depression life struggles if its someone i trust i have no qualms telling them how im really doing if they are genuinely asking and want to listen no need to overshare when someone is just giving a smalltalk howve you been type thing

yes it can be really hard to put yourself back together but the bottling up of your emotions is only going to make things that much worse  
no one likes to fall apart and feel that energy drain that comes with sharing the tough deep emotions and struggles theyre facing but its healthy to share to vent and to process  and though it may take some time you build yourself back up and can move forward

if therapy is an option for you i highly recommend seeking it out it sounds like you need someone to share with and vent to that is there specifically for that purpose and who can help you reframe these exhausting upsetting emotions in a healthy way so you can take a load off and not be carrying the weight of so much pentup frustration and pain
yes it would 

with likely nowhere to really start sending police on a wild goose chase for a bike  that likely looks like every fucking bike until closely inspected so not exactly an easy findquick to spot item  across the city through hundreds of shitty homeless camps chop shops trap houses squats rvs etc is so obviously a complete waste of time and resources 
especially when if caught the da is going to do anything substantial so theyll be right back at it in hours 
and thats assuming theres enough evidence to be able to chargearrest as the oh someone gave me thisbought it on craigslistfrom a pawn shop chain of excuses while easy to see through still has to be trumped with actual evidence and following our legal processes 

cars and bikes are everyones transportation it sucks when theyre stolen its wrong it seriously hurts the victims and there should be more that can be done
but cant argue devoting what few cops we have to pointless chases like this is not a waste of resources because it is
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

its better than zero justice i disagree 

no one related to this grouparticle was say shooting people point blank in the street for a car they perceived to be stolen they were locating vehicles and reuniting owners with their much needed stolen property that otherwise almost certainly wouldnt have been taken back 

thats exactly the justice i want
how is someone recovering their stolen car not a good outcome
went in there because i actually wanted to watch the show  big animatronics nerd wanted to see all the presidents  but as a person with narcolepsy oof just about put me out for the entire day one minute i was excited next minute my partner is shaking me awake  it was like magic
this is definitely a big part of it

the kind of partner that strictly wants a one night standfwb situation and knows they themselves will not get attached not deviate from that nsa plan and be cool to walk away at any time with no turmoil is the kind of partner that wont care if op is married  and is the kind of sexual partner op should be looking to find instead of lying to other women to manipulate them into sex  
some may still not go for it because they dont care for the married variable or dont trust it or whatever else but i think a big part of it is that for a lot of people there is always a chance of getting attached developing feelings really bonding and wanting to take it a step further  even if that step is just casual dating  
with a married man as in ops situation your options are strictly fucking youre never going to develop a relationship outside of fwb and its perfectly reasonable that a lot of people want to leave that door at least open in case something were to develop even if thats not really want they want going in  


some may also assume that an extra layer of dramacomplication comes with their potential sex partner having a wife that may not be true for op but its a fair concern and people are entitled to avoiding that dynamic if they arent comfortable with it

sure it might take longer and be more difficult to find those strictlyunattached types but such is life 

lying  or omitting  that information is extremely scummy and wrong

if the person youre lying to wouldnt sleep with you if they knew that information you shouldnt be sleeping with them period this shouldnt even be a question

no problem 

narcolepsy symptoms vary so much person to person that itll probably be hard to get a conclusive answer one way or another but its definitely interesting to see how the symptoms present in different peoplehow they are connected

for me i experience severe sleep inertia every single day it has been probably a decade at least since that wasnt the case and even then it was extremely frequent  probably one or two days a week where it wasnt as present but has been such a constant in my life that its hard to really remember

i dont always experience hh despite always experiencing sleep inertia but i would say that i experience hh a good 8590 of the time when waking  be that in the morning from an overnight sleep or from a nap or when i wake up periodically throughout the night to use the bathroomwake up briefly at random   
i also experience a great deal of hypnogogic hallucinations as well though  not sure if that is why i experience hh so much when waking or if theyre related but figured it worth mentioning
email sent to the address in the op 
gotcha

your wording kind of left it a bit open hence why i wanted to clarify i know a lot of us here take adderall and have been impacted by the shortages and are definitely feeling it 

i definitely havent seen the narcolepsy side of it being covered at all  its all adhdtelehealth related which is a bummer because it seems we have been forgotten about in many ways  something those with narcolepsy are very used to in medicine   
im sorry to hear youre being impacted by the shortages on top of covering them  
id be happy to chat with you if you need an adderalltakingnarcoleptic with an adderalltakingadhd partner man these shortages suck all around
yep one of the worst parts of this curse of a disease in my opinion

i have next to no short termworking memory anymore i will forget what im doing while im doing it forget facts about myself that should require no thought  phone number clothing size etc  forget what i did 5 minutes ago all of it

itll come on like a flash sometimes  ill be doing something and then my mind is gone nothing empty just confusion

its getting to the point where im starting to plan my life the way someone with early onset dementiaalzheimers would seeing as this problem gets worse all the time  on top of my energy levelssleepiness which is getting worse all the time as well  i can only assume that in a few years i will be beyond the point of being able to maintain any quality of life for myself

shit fucking sucks wish i could tell you it gets better or what to do about it but i cant seem to figure out any relief

wish you the best youre not alone
i suffer from extreme sleep inertia and also get hypnopompic hallucinations

dont know if i get more or less than people who arent as impacted by sleep inertia as i have nothing to compare to i would say 90 of the time i have both while waking
to clarify youre only seeking people who have been impacted by the concertaritalinetc shortage not narcoleptics impacted by the stimulant shortage as it relates to adderall   
by your post title i would assume thats the case but your line but some people who have narcolepsy are also affected and i want to tell their stories so here i am would indicate maybe youre just seeking impacted narcoleptics in general so i wanted to clarify just in case

in any event id argue people with narcolepsy are a hell of a lot more impacted than adhd folks but thats just a personal take 

best of luck with your writing thank you for reaching out to tell more expanded stories
agreed

having sex in a common area is insanely disrespectful unless youve both agreed that you dont care and dont have boundaries about it  which is clearly not the case here 
the fact that it isnt even your couch op is so much worse you clearly have some maturing to do and need to learn a few lessons in respect 

she has every right to feel comfortable in the common areas and not worry about someone else fucking on her furniture
she shouldnt have to come home to potentially walk in on you fucking in a common area 
thats part of living with roommates  keep that shit in your room or get your own place 

she has no right to dictate what you do in your room unless youre disturbing her peaceful enjoyment of her home  meaning after a reasonable hour she shouldnt have to hear you engaging in sexloud musicetc 

the cameras in a common area is a bit much but unless illegal is her right for securityother purposes 
it wont be a problem for you if you arent fucking on her couch in a common area

ive noticed the best view and my personal favorite of portland is on your way out by plane
this one definitely screamed some kind of bully breed in there to me too
i highly doubt nearly any cocaine people are doing on the illegal market is anywhere near the type that this study wouldve been looking at 

that shit is so stepped oncut with all kinds of garbage that youre lucky to be getting any actual cocaine in it as such pretty hard to say what out of the substance they used would be responsible for benefitting someone who has done it in the past or if the perceived benefits outweighed whatever other chaos was going on in the bodyactively working against it

thats a very interesting study though
ha gotcha totally misread what you meant in your post  in a haze of tiredness at like 3am
as much as im happy for anyone who gains awareness of something that may be impacting them and is motivated to speak with a doctor as a result of these types of posts it should also be noted that narcolepsy is relatively rare takes a generally long and stressful  and possibly expensive process  to be diagnosed and there are many other things that cause fatigue sleepiness needing extra naps etc that should be  and will have to be  ruled out first

narcolepsy is not just taking random naps or sleeping at random  far from it actually  so hopefully posts like the one youre referencing lead people to do some research and better understand what narcolepsy really is outside of the general stereotype 

x200b

im glad you found the sub op if it sounds like something that may be true for you and i hope youre able to have the conversations you need with a doctor  
its a process to figure out but so worth it in the end
i so wish there was a better more accurate more consistent type of test to conclusively diagnose these disorders

its bad enough that the sleep study bed is shitty and uncomfortable the room is foreignsterileuncomfortabledifficult to relax in  and potentially loud bright too hotcold etc  but then you mix in

 the medical equipment all around youuncomfortably on you
 the anxiety of knowing youre being watched
 the anxiety of knowing this test is your best shot at answers and if you fail youre back to nothing  or paying for another one and going through the hell again and possibly losing your medicationhaving to take more weeks off out of your life while you wait for the study again 
 the absolute nonsense that is the naps portion of the test  truly a form of torture
 still adjusting to being off your normal medications and thus unable to livefunctionsleep as youre used to which definitely impacts your sleep behaviors often negatively
 just general anxiety yay

if youre at all finicky about the conditions of a bedroom when you sleep  or as i do have related traumas which makes it impossible to sleep properly your first few nights in a new place  youre pretty much fucked once you sprinkle that on top of all the above nonsense

oops endrant heh

all this to say  yep the anxiety sure made me pretty alert too i think we can all relate on that one

glad you were still able to get an ih diagnosis and treatment hope its working okay for you
bring as many things as you canneed to feel like youre sleeping as you normally would  blanket pillow eye covermask earplugs etc

within reason most things should be fineallowed and its such a fucking awful environment thats nearly impossible to sleep comfortablynormally in that anything helps  especially if youre at all like me and you take a lot to get comfortable  
call ahead if youre worried about what is allowed but youre definitely in the right mindset trying to replicate your usual sleep while there the best you kind
my partner takes stimulant medication  so do i but im not a dude  and i can confidently say it doesnt have that effect on him at all 


which is just to say  meds will hit everyone different never assume its black and white one way or another
yep exactly 

no race has more of a right to intrude on other peoples quiet enjoyment of their fucking homes with ridiculous behavior no one needs nor has a right to blast music so loud it is disrupting other peoples lives inside their homes this is a standard that everyone should be held to equally  its not discrimination to say turn your shit down and keep the noise levels reasonable so the people around you can exist

if it impacts certain groups more than others oh well shouldnt be causing the problem in the first place this is an issue that can be that simple
quite frankly what made me change my mind about organ donation was witnessing the process as a family member of an organ donor

my stepdad committed suicide last january but was the ideal and rare candidate they look for for organ donors in that he was completely brain dead but stable and alive on machines indefinitely

the organ donor team left a lot to be desired they came in right away and were almost excited to explain the grim details of the process to us with little bedside mannerthey kept him alive on machines for an entire fucking week leaving my mom unable to say goodbye and afraid to leave the hospital because he could be pulled at any time and she didnt want to miss the send off

despite the hellish week  other details of which ill save its a long one  when it was all over she left with nothing but medical bills im of the opinion that if theyre going to keep your shell of a loved one alive to be fucking harvested for a goddamn week the least they could do is pay for the cremation or anything i get that this defeats the purpose of donation but my godthey had his body for weeks before they finally called her to arrange to have it transported to a funeral home  with no warning basically saying if she didnt figure it out in 48 hours theyd start charging in the hundreds per day she was literally calling every cremation place in town trying to find one she could fucking afford because everything was outrageously expensive and yknow her life was just destroyed

annnnnyway i digress

i am not marked down for organ donation no thank you im not doing that to my loved ones

ive read about the body donation problems as well and definitely wont be supporting that such a shame that things are that way
i mean narcolepsy also has concomitant depression anxiety addiction etc amongst countless other serious illnesses  and adhd too  so 

i get what youre saying and im not saying adhd cant be severe but youre not going to fall asleep while driving or drop to the floor and crack your head open
he clearly cares because hes asking not everyone enjoys being peed on or having someone piss in their bedroometc  which is reasonable and perfectly acceptable to care about
right like if anything falling asleep uncontrollablymost narcolepsy symptoms have more severe dangers and consequences than adhd in a lot of ways  
but again its approved for both so 
its not looked at as a dive bar it is a dive bar 
owners market it that way and the upkeep sure matches as does the crowd
you sound like a lovely person 
and yet you also came from another city to visit there hmm 


las vegas is no more a cesspool than anywhere else you couldve gotten covid anywhere couldve been positive before you even got into town and just didnt quite know it yet 
its a tourist hotspot with things to do there will no doubt be a higher amount of people thus increasing risks of illness of any kind  just like any other meow wolf location not specific to vegas
dont rip on an entire city just because your immune system took a dump there 
op only ever wants him seeinghearing her like that  and thinks this has something to do with modesty
so id guess that youre right  not quite mature enough nor ready enough for adult relationships in the real world 

op youre 18 the guy youre with now will almost certainly not be the only person seeinghearing you like that as youre statistically very likely to break uppart ways eventually due to your ages 
sex doesnt usually get to occur in a soundproof chamber and most humans engage in sex  no one thinks its more modest or virtuous to make it a hush hush complicated activity just to feel like youre hiding it as if that somehow makes you look better or more wholesome
 do not move to the pacific nw 

wages are still garbage out here cost of living is stupid high outside of tiny areas and those high cost of living areas are largely filthy hellscapes 

no no no
honestly your guess is as good as mine  it boggles my mind whyhow places have things like dog menus when they very much are not supposed to have dogs inside their establishment nonetheless eating at them at all 

its definitely something that should be enforced and its definitely confusing but id guess lack of enforcement  and it not being high on the priorities list to put resources into handling strictly  is probably why it has become so widespreadcommon 

everyones doing it is a good enough excuse for a lot of people  in most things in life not just this i suppose

and on the smaller scale its hard to expect individual employees to enforce something  especially when patrons often turn sourescalate a situation  if they dont have anyoneanything backing them up so to speak  or if the owner of the business refuses to follow the laws
it would appear that the code  both oregon specific and seemingly in the rest of the country as well  reads that at no point in time should any dog be inside any portion of any food establishment or grocery store at any time

x200b

as it relates to restaurantsgrocery storesbarsplaces that serve any food oregon specific code reads

e pet dogs may be allowed in outside seating areas of a food establishment under the following conditions

1 the food establishment prepares written procedures that include

a a diagram of the outdoor area to be designated as available to consumers with pet dogs

b the establishments procedure for assuring that employees do not touch pet or otherwise handle pet dogs and for immediately cleaning accidents involving dog waste

the procedure must also describe the location of materials and equipment necessary to clean up accidents involving dog waste

and

c the establishments procedure for notifying employees and consumers of the requirements of this paragraph

2 pet dogs may not come into contact with serving dishes utensils and tableware pet dogs are also not allowed on chairs tables and other furnishings

3 employees and consumers may not provide food to pet dogs

4 pet dogs must be on a leash and under control of the consumer at all times

5 at no time may pet dogs be permitted to travel through the indoor or nondesignated outdoor portions of the food establishment

the entire code and other related regulations can be found here

x200b

it sounds like youre courteous and doing your best to follow the rules the best you can which is awesome 

i know a lot of places dont enforce any of this which im sure probably makes it that much harder to know whats actually okay and whats being allowed
yep

and fortunately it doesnt need to be made into an argument of you hate dogs or whats wrong with dogs because it is not legally permitted 

dogs are not allowed inside restaurants bars etc 

period

dogfriendly patios are allowed with certain restrictions  which many dont follow unfortunately  but at no point in time should a dog be in a bar like pictured in the op

its not a matter of hating dogs  they simply dont belong there and the law agrees
yeah there absolutely is and for good reason

dogs are not allowed in restaurants  or any other establishment with food being soldservedhandled

dogfriendly outdoor only patios are allowed to exist with the rule that employees must at absolutely no point pettouch or come into any contact with the dog and the rule that dogs are not allowed on any tables chairs any other furnishings and may not come into contact with dishesutensilsetc

a lot of these dogfriendly establishments dont follow these rules at all unfortunately but they are very clearly laid out in law

if any portland restaurant is advertising as dogfriendly in that they allow dogs inside the establishment thats a huge no and is definitely not permissible in oregon  or the rest of the country as far as im aware
you dont have to be a dog hater to point out that animals are not allowed and dont belong in food establishments
please also tell that to seemingly half the bars restaurants grocery stores etc in portland where people inexplicably have dogs  no not service dogs  inside without a care in the world
yes even if its the first time

this was out of the ordinary  and is not typically something that happens when both partners are enjoying a sexual encounter this is a clear signal that something was off 

she may be wondering why you didnt check up on her or ask if something was wrong and have just left it to pass 

or it may have been as little as her being irritable and tired and not as in the mood as she had hoped  and you had thought  in which case she can say that and you both can move on 

adults in adult relationships communicate this isnt a big deal and doesnt need to be made to be one
the other night was everything okay anything you want to talk about  just wanted to check in is all  easy done
i mean my partner and i are huge sw fans and we absolutely love galaxys edge 

yeah wed love if it wasnt tied to the sequel trilogy as much  though ge west is doing a good job of bringing in characters that arent which is great  but we still love it there
i would love this 

im pretty indifferent towards the films but i love pandora in the park such a beautiful and peaceful area  even when crowded  and i really adore both rides
thank you for reminding me about their fries i totally forgot about them 

theyre pretty simple but theyre super easy to inhale and the dipping sauce i remember being great their pork belly bahn mi is excellent too
and their ketchup something about it when mixed with the truffle oil is so good 
300 is what i paid for my 3 year old 14 pound cats cremation  this included a clay pay print fur clippings ink paw print and basic bamboo urn box that is free with their cremations it was about a month from drop off to getting him home and it was a private cremation 

different places will charge different prices always 
if you felt respected and treated with dignity and received what you paid for it was worth the price imo
uhawtpackage

if you cant be respectful you wont be participating here at all this is a warning  thats enough
im not sorry to assert that no im not going to administer narcan to a stranger who may attack mecause me harmmay in someone attempt to hold me liable to the outcome of the event

not even a little bit

i dont want people to die and my attitude isnt you chose to die sucks to suck but i need to watch out for me first in this kind of a situation because i am not going to die or become seriously injured at the hand of someone else  who in fairness did make the choice to get into the situation in the first place  
thats just called selfpreservation
thank you and thank you for the tip his birthday is early february so ive been on the extra active hunt for a copy really appreciate it 
cooking stinky food can and does disturb other tenants depending on the building

imagine thinking youre entitled to doing whatever the hell you want in your unit without anyone saying anything about it or disturbing you but not understanding that other people also want that same right and should be able to enjoy it 

its a fine line and its hard to find a balance but if your activities are making another persons home smell consistently horrible thats also not okay
if no one picked up the blade runner vhs please please consider me ive been looking for one for over a year now my partner treasured his and it somehow stopped working and he was super bummed and ive been looking everywhere but havent been able to find him a replacement 
thank you 
whats your point

disney isnt exclusively for kids its for everyone 
and it surely isnt for entitled parents who leave their shit everywhere like its their house 

get outta here 
yeah im wondering this as well 

i never understand how people come here complaining about their sexlesspassionless marriagesrelationships when they state in their op how it was almost always this way to some extent 
if they werent sexual with you at the start what made you think it would be fulfilling for your future you signed up for this  well not the cheating with the stripper thats another story but the dead bedroom red flags were waving obviously from day one 

it clearly hasnt changed even with years of marriage and therapy
it wont change now that she has cheated in front of you
there is nothing to save walk away or you lose the right to complain
why the hell would the response to ops spouse cheating in front of him leaving him feeling angry hurt confused and resentful be to let her go on some dates with someone else and consider opening the relationship 

op has been mistreated long enough before this happened 
she doesnt get a pass because it was with a woman and she may have a repressed sexual preference

op needs to be done here if he decides he wants to repair it instead that happens through counseling not letting her run off to keep getting her way while he sits waiting for her to be a real partner
i typically dont keep more than a months rent or two in there at a time  though these days thats a few grand   as im too paranoid ive never been super well off and cant afford to lose when things go wrong or numbers get stolen but i dont keep it sitting at 0 or overdrafted either so im not exactly a high value customer but i suppose not a problem client either

thats good to know and be aware of though thank you
heh yep i totally worded that weird not sure how i did that definitely dont eat during surgery
it sounds like what ive been told in the past regarding chargebacks is not the case and thank you for correcting me

i was always told that more than a very rare chargeback here and there made you an unattractive customer to your bank and eventually may lead to them no longer wanting to do business with you not meaning an outrageous amount of fraudulent chargebacks of course thats a different story

i have only done a few in my lifetime and havent really needed to much  fortunately  but ive always been really nervous about ending up in situations where id need to because of what id been told

not that i want to do business with companies i expect to have to do chargebacks with  common sense would say hey dont do that  but there have been times where ive had to spend extra or go through a lot of hassle to buy something from a company with a better policy because i was worried about being screwed if a package was lostmarked delivered but not received or something of that nature because i didnt want to end up filing a chargeback and looking negative to my bank
ive been told by family who work at banks in relevant departments as well as by agents at my bank that though its not a this goes on your permanent record situation it is a negative mark towards you as a customer  chargebacks not fraud disputes  and more than a rare chargeback here or there makes you an unattractive customer to your bank which may eventually lead to them no longer wanting to do business with you

i dont know that to be an absolute fact  and thats awesome if its not the case because sometimes a chargeback is necessary and when ive had to do it im always worried that banks look at it negativelydont like when customers do it or that i might lose  because again i only do it when necessary and i really dont know enough about it to know what the whole process is   
ill have to look into it more i suppose i didnt mean to state that as an absolute fact or anything just what ive been told

x200b

also  regardless i shouldnt have to file a chargeback with my bank and wait up to 90 fucking days after a driver steals my food or brings me a completely wrong order the company should be better about those problems
ive been told by family who work at banks in relevant departments as well as by agents at my bank that though its not a this goes on your permanent record situation it is a negative mark towards you as a customer  chargebacks not fraud disputes  and more than a rare chargeback here or there makes you an unattractive customer to your bank which may eventually lead to them no longer wanting to do business with you 

regardless i shouldnt have to file a fucking chargeback with my bank and wait up to 90 fucking days after a driver steals my food or brings me a completely wrong order the company should be better about those problems
yeah sounds like op is either 1 trollingcreative writing exercise stealing the plot of an actual law and order svu  and no doubt some other csi type show im sure but ive seen the svu one   episode plot or 2 its his girlfriend setting this insanity up and blaming the ex
where exactly are these 30k livable houses they couldve bought because nope not on this earth
for whatever stupid as fuck reason here in oregon medicaid covers an eye exam every 24 months but doesnt cover any glassesprescriptions from that appointment

why the fuck would you cover the damn appointment only to have the solution not be an option
was so fucking pissed hearing the 150 bare minimum it would cost for me to get started remedying what they found but if i was pregnant it would be covered 
this country is a joke
you are
yeah was going to say the same thing 

ive had ubereatspostmates and doordashgrubhub orders marked delivered  but never arrive with zero communication and no photo  or be the completely wrong order even be half eaten or soaking wet and was burned by the company refusing to refund despite very clear and very documented proof that the driver screwed me over 

i refuse to use any of these services anymore i only used them in emergencies  super sick after surgery etc  or when traveling and in an unfamiliar area without a car or other options but its just not worth paying the insane markup and fees just to be completely fucked over by a company who doesnt give half a shit about their customers and have to go through the hassle of a chargeback 
i imagine banks dont look kindly on chargebacks either so its putting a negative mark on my account on top of it so to speak

noooooope
the instagram page the video came from is trash the woman clearly thinks very highly of herself and thinks shes doing real reporting despite posting a lot of false informationposting speculation as fact before details are confirmed
she tried to push the korean church fire as a homeless camp fire that spread and argued with people in the comments informing her that the person responsible had come forward and it had been all over the news for hours
she has a lot of really stupid takes and while i agree that portland is a dumpster fire and a lot of our government nonsense is getting ridiculous she just aint it
agreed i dont think it would have the same feelingas much impact if i was staying off property  ive done a night at the hotel in mco and one in celebration when flights were delayed and both daysnights felt very bland and like i was missing something  
as fun as disneyland can be its just not the same for me as well  anaheim is in every direction you dont have that same separation from the outside world

as someone who is disabled and severely chronically ill  that also struggles with depressionptsd anxiety and ocd  i can agree with those whove said that youll never really know until you get there but as long as you go in with an open mind and set your expectations realistically youre bound to have at least some fun

for me it feels like disney is the only place where i can really ever shed the weight of my illnesses get out of the depression funk and truly live a little this does making coming home all the more difficult and its really hard to process that posttrip depression but in the end its worth it to me to get a break from the absolutely godawful city i live in and all the day to day nonsense of being disabled and having no quality of life

this last trip my energy levels were the worst theyve ever been and we were getting to the parks each day later than ever before  
at first i was getting really upset over this  what a waste of tripmoney the trip is going to fly by and ill have slept through it etc  
but i reframed this as you know what sleeping half the day in the polynesian resort sitting on that beautiful balcony looking out at the most gorgeous resort and then getting to spend half the day in the parks beats anything else i could possibly be doing

just be kind to yourself and allow yourself to rest as needed stop when needed and feel whatever emotions come on as they happen   
ive cried many times on disney vacations as an adult for many different reasons the important thing is to let yourself feel how you need but also dont linger in it wipe the tears away pick yourself back up and let there still be magic left in the day  one bad moment doesnt have to set the tone for the next hour evening day or rest of the trip 

sometimes when im in a funk i find that watching my partner enjoy things really distracts me too   
i might not be in the immediate mood to pick an activity and engage in it with full excitement but if i say why dont you pick im fine with whatever i will no doubt perk up when i see my partner getting really excited over a rideactivity and see the joy wash over him

i hope youre able to enjoy the trip and you and your spouse have a wonderful time may it lift you from the pain and heaviness if only for a moment
theres literally human feces on every corner and trash piles the size of houses everywhere here so i dont think the environmentally conscious compostable bags really matter at this point this place is filthy and disgusting
and half the dog nuts dont pick up after their dogs at least anymore anyway
theyve gone back and forth with having their china town flavor wings sadly but when theyve had them theyre so damn good  i think about that flavor all the time

their loaded fries are great too and slushees go dots
down here in portland it is sadly the same 

dogs absolutely everywhere and for whatever reason portlanders are a special kind of stupid so theyre also all pit bull nuts specifically 

i swear to god i see a pit bull in a store every damn time i go out for groceries today it was fred meyer huge beast standing in the deli section slobbering on the glass case 

a new barrestaurant opened recently nearby and they have a photo of their huge shitbull in the restaurant on their instagram confirming theyre dog friendly  great dogs inside in an eatery and the worst breed no less 

its unreal how dog friendly oregon and washington are and its awful 
im so tired of these things being absolutely everywhere 
last i checked i didnt choose to get a dog  so why is there a barking shitting dog everywhere i turn 
i wouldnt care if people chose to have them if they werent constantly being made my problem  loud as hell everywhere i go jumping on me running at me etc 

get me out of here 
narcolepsy type 2  i take ir adderall during the day and hydroxyzine hydrochloride at night

x200b

without any medication i will sleep until something prevents me and then go right back to sleeping i might wake up to use the bathroom or get up to eatshower if pestered enoughthe environment is loudbrightuncomfortable enough but i will immediately go back to sleep after and will be in a zombielike state the entire time feeling immense mental and physical pain  
i will turn off alarms in my sleep without ever knowing it and wont wake up to any if they do go off anyway 

without adderall but with the hydroxyzine i will be much the same as zero medication but will sleep harder feel worse upon waking and may not be able to be woken up no matter how hard someone tries

with adderall but not hydroxyzine i experience a lot more of the insomnia side of narcolepsy 

 it will take me longer to fall asleep at nighttime  when i get into bed with the intention of sleeping for the night  but i will still be exhausted throughout the day and easily able to nap and drift off at inappropriate times so it helps me fall asleep quicker than without though only if i shut down and let myself fall asleep the second i feel the drowsiness if i stay awake too long after taking it it will lose that effect
 i get really bad anxiety in the evenings when i lay down for rest which is what this medication is meant to target it makes me a bit drowsy but doesnt knock me out and i find i stay asleep for longerget up less throughout the night with it without it i will get up 10 times throughout the night easily use the bathroom and take anywhere between 1020 minutes to fall back asleep i tend to feel more restless at night without it
 i will sleep for an average of 1012 hours with adderall only no hydroxyzine with it i will sleep an average of 1014 hours a night sometimes it makes my sleep inertia worse and often it is much harder for me to get out of bed in the morning i dont usually feel more or less rested either way so its more that it helps me fall asleep fasterstay asleep without getting up as often

adderall doesnt really impact how long i sleep at night its been a looooong time since i felt it really had much effect on how exhausted i am throughout the day  without it im useless and my brain is complete soup 100 of the day whereas with it i can at least function on automatic behaviors and maybe be functional 13 hours a day

i have maybe 13 working hours  meaning hours where my brain works and i can do anything not hours at a job  a day if im lucky   
when i first wake up my brain is soup im in physical and mental pain im exhausted everything is a fuzzy fatigued mess and that damned sleep inertia is painful sometimes i make it out of bed and to the couchinto the shower but i am a zombie for the first 24 hours of the day no matter what im doing  i can do little more than stare at my phoneeatshowersit around

i then maybe get 1 to 3  4 if im really lucky  hours where i can do anything of value i still feel exhausted physically heavy in pain and fatigued but at least i can make some phone calls go to the store answer an email etc   
i wouldnt say im alert awake or very attentive during but im not brainsoupuseless either

then after that im back to zombie i can feel my brain start to slow down the fatigue and brain fog gets thicker and heavier everything feels worse and takes longer to do i become more scatterbrained and its harder to focus or prioritize or do tasks i lose all motivation

then when its time for bed i either take the hydroxyzine lay in bed and wait for it to kick in enough to drift off sleep 1012  sadly sometimes 14  hours and repeat or i lay in bed and take hours to fall asleep despite being painfully aware of how tired i am and how much more tired im becoming

im grateful for my adderall because without it i get 0 working hours but damn does it feel hopeless most of the time 

this disease is a curse there are no positives here fuck narcolepsy
thank you 3 

im sorry for your loss as well  time may pass but it always stings  orange kitties are always so special  
thank you for sharing they sound like such a special pair 

its hard to imagine losing one of a bonded pair  you cant explain to them what happened like you can a human not that that makes it any better but at least theres hope for understanding   
if only we could find a way for them to live forever
sorry for the late reply  first off thank you so much for taking the time to comment i really appreciate it 

x200b

its funny  our cat tree is right next to the kitchen  we rent a townhouse with what they called an open concept floorplan downstairs so essentially just a long single rectangular room from kitchen to front door for the downstairs level  because its the only real place to put it and they spend 99 of their day sleeping on it climbing it etc   
our lady kitten doesnt care about climbing the cabinets at all but kitten in my post is a bit more of a goober and wants to climb everything

i think part of it is that i made a huge mistake and unintentionally trained him that going up there is a good way to get attentionpossibly treats because i used to try to coax him down with them when id catch him oops

do you have any recommendations for rubber spikes by chance unfortunately the kitchen is pretty large and theres a ton of countercabinet space so it might be a bit of an undertaking to cover them but that seems like a good bet

the gate would be great but given the open floorplan theres just nowhere to do it without building a literal great wall sadly 

my thought was maybe storing boxes of some kind that fill the entire upper cabinet space so theres no gapsroom for him to jump uphang out but i wonder if that would be effective on its own
oh totally  i didnt mean to imply sex was only vaginal penetrationcontact

i was more coming from a place of if youre going to be stupid and say nope no birth control or abortions ever hell no its probably best at their age to just straight up avoid any sexual contact because its a slippery slope and like op said they tend to be very impulsive and then theres the risk of semenvaginal contact through various other activities which again too impulsivedumb to use condoms possibly too dumbimpulsive to not let that happen

totally agree with your message to op as well
of course if my response helped at all im glad

i appreciate your respectful responses to my comments  youre not trying to be argumentative and youre receptive to what people have to say and that alone tells me youre probably a pretty good kid with a good road ahead of you

youre young  mistakes happen weve all been young and impulsive once  hell some folks take a loooooong time to grow out of it  but theres a reason that sex and birth control can get pretty serious  its not just a oops when a mistake happens it could be an entire human life   
i promise you you do not want nor are you in any way prepared for or should you be having a child at 14  or anytime in the near future maybe even the next decade or more   
i wont judge your religious beliefs and choices but lets just say if youre going to break the rules and have premarital sexual activity youll really thank yourself later for breaking them a little more with contraception  and besides condoms help with stds too 

anyway ill leave you alone heh  you get it i wish you the best going forward and applaud you for coming here and asking and chatting with folks instead of just throwing caution to the wind and saying fuck it  pun intended
we can agree to disagree i dont care for either of those rides and universal is still extremely lackluster to me
theyre not beating disney at their own game  theyre not even in the same realm to me 
they dont create the same experiences nor to the same level to me 
im more excited for tron than a single thing universal has on the table right now or hagridsvelocicoaster 
i dont care how long disney is taking to bring these things to the table their parks offer me a better overall value and atmosphere
its not a competition of who releases the most things
unfortunately it only takes one time for her to end up pregnant 
youre young but that doesnt mean you have to be impulsive and stupid  the fact that youre asking here and are concerned about it shows that youre smart enough to know youre playing with fire and that this is dangerous listen to that instinct and stop making lifealteringly bad choices 
she can ask 1000 times  the answer is absolutely not unless there is at least one form of birth control being properly used otherwise you should go into it expecting that at the end shell be pregnant and the next thing you know youll have a baby on the way that you are financially and legally responsible for 

sex is fun and it doesnt have to be a scary ordeal but unless youre using contraception and being safe about it it can ruin your life her life and the life of a potential unplanned unwanted child 
please do better for yourself  and any lady youre with  and use condoms at minimum every time
they dont just protect against pregnancy  you dont want an std either
if you dont believe in birth control or abortions you either need to abstain 100 from any sex 100 of the time or you best believe youre going to be having unplanned children 

its not a matter of politics or faith 
if you dont want to become pregnant  or get someone pregnant unsure if youre male or female  your only options are to not have any sex period or to be smart and safe and use contraception

if youre so catholic that abortion and birth control are out of the question premarital sex should also be off the table you dont get to pick and choose what you feel applies to you for your own enjoyment and then claim religion as your reasoning for not practicing safe sex 
there are no other real trusted alternatives  condoms at minimum ideally combined with other birth control methods are the only way to truly practice safe sex 

by all means please refrain from having any sex whatsoever if youre unwilling to believe in birth control  or abortion should it fail
some people love it its worth trying it just to say youve done it but personally i think its awful 

im really big about the story of a ride i dont care how thrilling it is  if the story is bad its not a good ride 
and boy is the story dumb as hell and seems very lazily thrown together on dca guardians 

the collectors archive area is fine but its honestly the only area of the entire queue that seems to have had any level of work put into it and after youve seen it once it looks cheaper and lamer every time 

the outside queue area is bad and frankly i feel like the tower facade is hideous and looks like a bunch of garbage glued to a computer tower its a mess and looks terrible from so many angles 
the area replacing the boiler room is honestly hilariously bad so lazy and literally looks like a toddler did it awful 

the drop sequences are more thrilling ill give it that but the random screens are boring and lazy the doors open to random shots of the guardians doing things  always looking extremely bored and theres no real cohesive story movement to whatever theyve got going on
theres no real sense of urgency for a ride called mission breakout and its painfully lackluster despite the attempts at making it more fastpaced with the drop changes 

then you exit to a very uninspired gift shop and again to the equally uninviting concrete hellscape that is avengers campus 


i dont hate marvel by any means but man are there so many misses in dca starting with the tower 
i sincerely hope they leave it alone in wdw it frames the area so well and that old hollywood vibe is timeless and classy  marvel may be popular and im not saying they dont have any place in any of the parks but cosmic rewind is more than enough imo giving a similar treatment to studious would be an insane mistake
its honestly awful at dca 

 i specifically went out to dca to say goodbye in late 2016 and it hurt my heart skips a beat in fear anytime i see wdws tower in an article  please leave it alone nothing good will come of any changes


its super cramped and the crowd managementflow is pretty awful its also just not as big of a draw for me in general not a comparison  but thats just for me the atmosphere just isnt there like it could be
i dont believe youre supposed to be parking strollers there but try telling entitled disney parents to move their strollers  the worst
yeah cool i guess

its still universal 

i just really dont care for or about universal at all
its not even a competition to me  they arent on the same level as disney dont interest me and have no major draws for me in the way disney does and the value simply isnt there for me

i love area 15  where the lv experience will go  but this isnt a draw for me there im indifferent to haunted houses and frankly area 15vegas are expensive enough as is so this will be a definite pass as omega martother offerings will certainly still be more attractive 

the texas park is for young kids that announcement left my brain as fast as i read it 

personally i find it kind of tiring to read the same look at all that universal is doing1111 new park rides111 disney has only opened a couple in that time111 comments 
its not a one to one competition  universal can open 50 things to every 5 disney opens that doesnt mean theyre better quality beat disney somehow or take value away from disney parks 

i think theres a good chunk of us that universal just doesnt connect withdo enough for and that doesnt seem like its going to change

for those that like universal im glad you are getting new offerings though please check out the rest of area 15  especially omega mart and wink world  instead of just skipping over to the haunted section
what do you mean by theyre doing omega mart 

no universal is not doing omega mart 

nothing is changing with om

this universal experience wont be open anytime this year
yep thank you 

while i feel for anyone who had to deal with pole i dont get the feeling that karine is some innocent stable woman who wouldve been a good example of parenting had he not caused 100 of the problems 

sure being an of creator or makeup influencer doesnt make you a bad parent automatically but you get the picture of the type of person she is here  and you cant pretend he was forcing her to do of content when shes spending her time trying to be a content creatorinfluencer herself on her own 

shacking up with some bachelor weirdo  who frankly had more than enough info about his ways out there she doesnt get to play naive  on top of this doesnt exactly paint the stable mom doing anything she can to get her kids back which is her main priority picture people keep trying to sell 
if shes that worried about custody  so worried we need to sympathize and give her our money through donations to help out  youd expect her to be taking real steps to achieve that instead of whatever wannabe influencer mess shes got going on now
the thing is if disney would hypothetically be removing aerosmith due to lets say issues with membershistorymusic content  in attempt to be more safe  kiss and acdc certainly wouldnt be on the table either
yep this is my only hard dont touch it right now after they ruined californias tower i will lose my mind if they touch wdws  especially as it was always the superior version to me
its such well done theming from the walk up the street to the queue its such a timeless classy theme overall that really ties the entire area together and it will not benefit from some modern retheme or overhaul  especially marvel leave it alone
people dont want to accept this but its absolutely a fact 

a lot of these people would absolutely destroy whatever housing you give them much like they do everything else they come in contact with 
theyd be doing all kinds of illegal shit from this hypothetical housing and it would become a filthy druglittered biohazard full of stolen goods 

im not saying we dont need to help with housing for anyone but continuing to parrot housing first1111 if ignoring the very real core problems were facing that have everything to do with mental health problems and drug abuse
haha no worries just wanted to make sure you knew  and clarify if you were planning pre or post houston opening in case anyone chimes in with ideas


personally i feel like that would be a bit intense of a road trip but would also be a ton of fun to attempt


i would want to spend 2 days at each location  to be able to really take it all in participate in the stories and not feel rushed  at least personally so that would make for a long trek if trying to do it all across one vacation
if youre waiting for houston to open in this hypothetical there will be five not four locations to consider
couldnt tell if you meant prehouston opening or not
i wonder what she considers to be the real problems 


like hmm did she forget about that time where she put a random postmates driver on blast by posting their photo and accusing them of theft of fucking food  whod have guessed    causing them to receive death threats and endless harassment when nothing even close to theft occurred 


right lizzo the real problems mkay
ha i saw him at the rainbow once back in late 2016 



was in a booth grabbing a drink and he was in the middle of the room at a table being interviewed by some younger looking dude who was holding a dildo camera people were walking around the room and recording everyone sitting around which was uncomfortable because i was just trying to snack and grab a few rounds and didnt want to end up in some recording somewhere
ive tried to find the video but never was able to
1 i hate kids genuinely cannot stand to be around them at all for any length of time dont enjoy it dont want to do it and hearing kids be loud in a public place sets me off so quickly i dont see it changing 
frankly kids dont seem to love me either  its like i dont talk to them in the right tone or lap up their dumb shit enough i dont know 


2 i simply cant afford it kids in this economy absolutely not 


3 even if i could afford it id never waste my time and money like that id like to enjoy what of my life i can kids would suck any chance of that up real fast freedom to travel live on my own schedule do things the way i need to not giving that up 


4 this world sucks i barely survive each day at this point i wouldnt bring another life into this willingly 


5 i have severe health problems i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy i wouldnt want to risk passing those on and i wouldnt want to make them insanely worse by having a kid and having to use what tiny bits of energy i dont have often to care for it im maybe functional 13 hours a day at this point it wouldnt work out 



6 my partner doesnt hate kids but he doesnt like them or want them either
i have extremely severe narcolepsy it simply isnt possible 

not only do i simply not have the energy  or any energy ever for that matter  the fact that i am incapable of ever actually having restorative sleep means that the pain and stress it would put on my body is that much more excruciating and i simply dont recover 
its actively harmful for me to even attempt 

fortunately i have always been on the thinner side i guess but between other chronic illnesses and the awful life stealer that narcolepsy is i just cant be any kind of active
ooooof 


luckily my pair are only 8 months old right now but this is just not something i have the capacity to think about and i dont know how ill ever manage it 


theyre so insanely bonded and i just cant imagine what thatll be like for one of them nonetheless for us having to process the loss at the same time 


nothing has hurt quite the way tragically losing my fuzzy orange best friend summer of 2022 has and without these two id still be a very lost cold lonely mess of a person this is my first time with two cats at the same time and i just never even thought about that eventual scenario where one outlives the other 
nope nope not fun
never said anyone was reading comprehension may be a solid goal for 2023 for you
i believe in a lot of places legally they cant require a sick note for 2 days or less  this is dependent upon statecity of course

i 100 agree though  why would you want your employees to risk coming in sick thus risking other employees falling ill as the disease spreads through the business and why would you want an employee who doesnt feel wellup to the task of working representing your business to customers handling tasks in the workplace etc

ive never understood the way some workplaces treat employees  like theyre kids in middle school that cant behave and wont do anything unless forced

were fucking adults

if i say im sick and cant work im sick and i cant fucking work  doesnt matter what im sick with im not going to perform today and you shouldnt want to try to force me when i have already assessed it isnt going to happen in a satisfactory way let me get some fucking rest

and yep  why burden a doctor a doctors note is something you give a principal or teacher in grade school fuck outta here
the way it reads to me is that if you dont bring a sick note  explaining the days you called in sick prior to returning  with you when you return from your days home you will be sent back home

x200b

which like yeah is pretty ridiculous

but hey  i always want to be at home and never at a job so by all means send me back home

chances are if i was home sick i still feel like shit when im coming back anyway
im telling you for a goddamn fact no it has never cost me 7k or anywhere near it in a year

uncomfortably poor people tend to know their exact finances down to a penny 100 of the time we dont get the luxury of a choice 

i sure as fuck know how much my car costs me  it costs me exactly as much as i think budget for and knowingly spend thanks

im not saying 100 car dependence should be built into society and forced upon everyone never said that

but its ignorant and all kinds of plain wrong to assume that some people dont need to be able to drive places and cars are not some great evil that we can all just eliminate and be better for

theres absolutely no way i will ever be able to take public transit again in my lifetime no matter how much better the access is to housingdoctorsworkplacesetc

life is not that black and white and there are many legitimate reasons  even with a more transitfriendly infrastructure  that many will need to drive

im not arguing against better transit and better infrastructure for those who cant or choose not to drive i think those are greats things  we agree there

but this cars are evil people who drive are badignorantdumb attitude on this subreddit is ridiculous delusional and needs to stop
they both look  and are  godawful but damn darcey looks a lot worse than stacey these days somehow those under eyes my god

i forgot they had a spinoff what a shame these narcissists dont deserve screen time and maybe if we stopped giving it to them theyd eventually look at themselves and get some real therapy
wait you say you live in america in california have you ever heard of a money order i think im in love i know this is crazy but would you marry me
right 

i mean i get people need the hours  well the pay  but the whole  gets you sent home boggles my mind anytime ive seen it 

id much rather be at home especially if im sickhave been sick  make my day 

and if corners have been cut and things have been tough due to shortage of staff why are you sending staff home for every single little thing
not for everyone it doesnt its never cost me even close to 7k a year to have a car and ive been poor and disabled my entire life thanks 
some cant afford to live close to their jobs and doctors  and arent privileged enough to have those be located on functional public transport routes either  and have no choice but to drive a shitty beater to get where theyre forced to go 
but sure fuck cars theyre never useful or necessary  yeah evil
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

seriously 
im so sick of all the car hate on this subreddit people here are delusional selfabsorbed antipoor and ableist  especially when it comes to carsthe need to drive 
it shouldnt come as such a shock or insult that some people have to drive or have different needs that cant exclude driving 
and frankly with all of the max attackshappenings no one should catch any grief for saying they dont feel comfortable subjecting themselves to the unhinged wild card that is the trimet transportation experience

the whole lol fuck cars people are so attached to driving theyd drive to take a shit nonsense is really pathetic grow up
careless square is a good way to refer to downtown already
a carless square isnt exactly going to do this for most people though it certainly doesnt suddenly make downtown more appealing
im so sorry for your loss op please be kind to yourself i wish you the best in your grieving journey and the safest of travels out of town may 2023 improve despite this loss and may you come out of it stronger and feeling at peace with yourself
not who you were responding to but wanted to chime in anyway

i would not tell them openly that it was you who complained unless you are faced with a situation where you legally have to identify yourself

they may seem relatively normal and like the keep to themselves types but you never really know someone especially when their lifestyle is being threatened or the possibility of legal trouble  court letter from the city continued visits from law enforcement fines etc  is on the table

people that let their pets get this intrusive on the lives of those around them dont give a fuck about anyone but themselves

these types of people feel that they are more entitled to having an unruly pet than anyone around them is entitled to having any quiet enjoyment of their homes 

that alone should tell you that these arent polite reasonable decent people  if they turn out to be and it only takes 1 or 2 minor complaints to see a change count yourself lucky and be glad but dont expect this or assume its the norm

 chances are there will be pushback  either straight up ignoring the requestscomplaints or worse  and theres zero reason to label yourself as the bad guy when you dont have to

i would stay as anonymous as possible in every way shape and form for as long as you can you dont want some pissed off neighbor causing problems for you  having their mutt fuck up your yard retaliation of any kind false cop calls on you verbal confrontations etc
yep this is a big one for me 

im so so sick of the disabled isnt a bad thing toxic positivity attitude 

thats great if for you youve found a way to cope with your disability that includes a positive outlook and have found a way to manage it to where it isnt a serious detriment to your life im stoked for you if youre privileged enough to be able to look at the positives and find things that your disability doescausesimpacts you that you find to be good or something you appreciate  im having a hard time wording this in a way that makes sense but essentially when people go i love  about my disability it makes me more quirkycreativeetc or if i wasnt disabled i wouldnt be  and i love that quality

or like you said  the being disabled isnt a big deal if you have the right outlookhandle it the right way crowd

im not trying to rip on people who are able to have that positive outlook and maintain that kind of positivity for themselves   
thats awesome  
i wish it were honestly possible for it to be like that for me truly

but man this shit fucking sucks 

i would give anything not to be disabled 

i have no quality of life i never will i know this to be fact theres no fun positive way to spice it up and change it into a motivating inspiring story it is what it is and it fucking sucks

give me the benefit of understanding i know my situation better than anyone else have assessed it perfectly and have earned the right to be bitter upset negative in pain and thoroughly sick of being disabled

i dont find having a disability cute positive something that makes me me  its an uphill battle i rapidly lose every day that causes me endless problems and makes me absolutely miserable theres no adding sugar and sprinkles to that its not an outlook thing
this made me cackle  who knows maybe they love a high chair
this 

please supervise the children op 

its easy for kids to get caught up in these types of environments and behave in ways that make it really unpleasant for everyone else who also paid quite a bit to be there  many of whom may have flown from out of state 

please do not leave them unattended i dont care how well behaved you may think they are the worst part of my omega mart visit was loud rude entitled 1214 year olds literally running around the exhibits seeing what they could get away with etc
udarkenfolk 

thats enough if you cant behave maturely and respectfully you wont be participating here at all consider this a warning before a ban this level of disrespect and aggression towards other users is unacceptable
frankly bringing a dog to any park  that isnt specifically a dog park  is a dick move 

kids and adults alike who are afraid of dogs have been traumatized by them or frankly just dont like them shouldnt have to put up with them at nondog specific parks
theyre obnoxious at best and hazardous at worst
super interested chronic illness means i can rarely leave the house anymore and simply am not safe walking the neighborhood for exercise but desperately need a way to get my blood pumping and get active again doing so from home would be a godsend 
thank you for offering regardless  love seeing the buy nothing group thrive for everyone
this surprises me i was there a few weeks back and it was being over policed person was literally walking up to the car with their bags vehicle had just pulled up being screamed at and threatened with a ticket already instantaneously they were getting way too aggressive with literally every car there none of which were doing what you described

that sucks they definitely should be keeping more on top of it if that kind of thing is happening again tough to balance im sure sorry youve been experiencing that
done best of luck
i mean in a way it is

if youre a criminal asshole who is stealing from innocent people and are out endangering the lives of countless innocent people using said stolen vehicle with zero care for yourself and others karma is having your ability to continue to do so taken from you when youre being reckless

play stupid games win stupid prizes im glad it was him that died and not the countless innocent folks he chose so selfishly to put in danger with these actions id rather it be him than an innocent bystander who was killed while he recklessly sped down the road
i dont know i personally dont value some asshole who steals from other innocent people recklessly endangers countless innocent lives etc on the same level as most human lives  but thats just me 
its truly just going to keep getting too expensive to be alive isnt it 


this increase might not seem like a lot for some but any increase is crippling for others 


when you dont have any other option and cant just find cheaper elsewhere  and will automatically lose any home you rent by not actively affording the utility  eventually youre just stuck at well cant afford to be alive anymore really can i 

love it
did they used to have more flavors i remember this spot as a kid and in my mind they had a few more flavors than this a melon one comes to mind specifically
it doesnt make you a sociopath to not like dogs


poisoning animals is fucked up and wrong  no matter the species thats the takeaway here
uafishnamedfreddie

if you dont have anything nice to say dont comment this isnt constructive criticism nor is it respectful and it wont be tolerated here
same 

i get that the rain is good 

its still disgusting out the majority of the year here  especially now that summers are less and less mild and come with fires and heat waves  and the wet cold windy darkness is depressing and awful

you can be happy for the benefits of the rain and still absolutely hate it jfc
my one fear is that a retheme of rock n rollercoaster will bring a greater retheme to the area and be the end of days for the tower of terror 
the coaster area is already a bit of a mess imo and it will be hard to do a major rebrand that feels cohesive with the tower area and also pushes some ip  which is all disney seems to care about these days ips everywhere 
i have absolutely nothing to base this on  aside from past experiences with disney and their bad retheming decisions  but i greatly fear they will tie the two together eventually and a major change for one will mark the final timeline for tower before they absolutely ruin that beautiful timeless attraction

i do agree the coaster could use a faceless at least retheme at best
agreed i have the brother lb5000s and started out on it and though it has a limited hoop size its great for making patches and getting the techniques down as a beginner
this right here came here to say similar

i dont give a flying fuck which people use say whatever you want i have much much more important things to worry about than nitpick over language what a tiny unimportant thing to waste energy on  as if i have any to spare 

all i remotely care about is that the person addressing or referring to me is being respectful and frankly if they arent i dont have the energy to give a shit then either
ubigreplacement9202

consider this a warning  rsmite is not the place for politicsthese types of topics or debates getting into a bicker session with other users about terfs has nothing to do with smite  and will be removed as such  and telling a user to argue with you via dm doesnt qualify as respectful polite conversation either

if you dont have anything nice to say just dont engage thank you
ubiwrecksual thats enough

keep the arguing and general nastiness to yourself this isnt the place for it

likewise this is not the place for arguing about conservatives or steering any conversations to any topic unrelated to smite  terfs politics etc are not considered smite related topics and steering conversations to these offtopic directions will be removed

i suggest in the future you refrain from commenting on how happy you will be that other users will die alone  this isnt considered civil respectful behavior and in the future will lead to a temp ban if you have a problem with another user report it to the mod team and disengage 

thank you
does your landlord live in the same unit as you or something this sounds over the top and beyond what a lease can enforce oof 
hopefully one day youll have a place with more freedoms good luck with the kitty proofing  its so hard sometimes all the things cats hate sometimes become their favorite things
youre joking right tell me youre joking
i had to make an allowance for this as well the main omad site everyone links goes into why diet soda is big bad but i cant drink coffee or tea for caffeine  all kinds make me feel sick and jittery  and need the small doses to survive  im narcoleptic this is a nonnegotiable part of my day i need something to survive 

id say as long as you arent downing 10 a day youre good we all have different needs and dislikes and as long as youre noticing the results youre happy with youre good
op threw a tantrum  ran outside to the beach at 11 at night expecting him to follow her like a child they didnt talk for 2 days etc  and has now thrown away a bunch of her clothes over an offhand notthatbig of a comment about her attire after a long travel day 
sure husband might not have been kind and tactful but op is acting like a petulant child over it and i wouldnt exactly be rushing to try to make it up to someone who has this big of an overreaction to something most adults wouldve maturely addressed together long ago
 couldnt agree more 

op sounds not all right herself with this massive overreaction google isnt anyones best source for this kind of thing and it shows that there was major lack of care and empathy from her towards her husband to take some online results and decide to turn on him 
 immediately jumping to hes a monster and im no longer viewing him as the father of my precious babies i need to protect  says shes either got serious issues herself was already looking for an out and has found an easy scapegoat or a mix of the two
attention too many employees are calling out during a period of particularly hazardous weather which also happens to be falling during a time of year where illnesses tend to run rampant 
to deal with this we are going to make it outrageously difficult to keep your jobavoid being deemed fireable for insubordination  which would only make us short more employees but thats not our fault 
we are also going to put everyone at an increased risk of falling ill by making it near impossible for sick workers to stay home hope a widespread outbreak doesnt completely destroy our ability to operate merry christmas
at the time op had no concrete evidence that he was on fake phone calls for one

second off humiliating your partner like that is pretty childish and petty a confrontation about his behavior can occur between the two of them on their own time  mature adults dont make a huge display out of it in front of everyone else shifting the attention off the holiday party to their own drama 

anyone agreeing with that type of nonsense is outing themselves as a bratty child this isnt a sitcom  handle your personal relationship business elsewhere and ideally with more grace than this bs
for what its worth an emotionally mature person doesnt snoop through a partners phone and then commit to being dishonest about it op isnt checking a lot of the emotionally mature adult boxes here either
ship is the best all year round 
doubt it she still cant and wont admit she was a serious abuser and i doubt shes done the therapy and work needed since she stills seems selfobsessed and unwilling to own just how wrong she was 

i dont care how much of a physical glow up she went through or what degree she earned  doesnt make her any less of a toxic abuser and that doesnt just go away because you act nice and look pretty on instagram 
when i see people who endlessly support her says a lot about the person honestly
alternatively ive never gotten a fedex package on time and those assholes ignore signature requirements and leave packages wherever the hell they feel like it  and with absurdly incorrect tracking  and then claim theyre not responsible for whatever happens to your shit despite never once making sure it gets to you in a timely secure fashion  and youll be lucky if it isnt broken ive watched them throw my boxes like footballs on my doorbell camera
fuck fedex not worth the gamble
i was shocked that my mail  and ups as well  came today i was pretty sure when it started getting icy last night i could guarantee it wouldnt be happening today i think most will have expected this as well 

im super grateful my mailman made the trek i get my prescriptions by mail if it hadnt come today id be absolutely fucked until after christmas  tuesday is when delivery starts up right  and it wouldve destroyed me this weekend with no way to go get them from the pharmacy
so your solution is being a manipulative child and trying to trick her into finally breaking up with you  or doing 100 of what you want sexually and staying in a miserably incompatible relationship 

you need to grow up seriously 



youre banking on her not wanting another guy and are leaving everything up to her to keep a breakup from happening


im guessing your assumption  or at least hope  is that she will decide to put all her wants and needs aside for you subscribing to 100 sexually incompatible vanilla sex to keep from having to deal with the unpleasant and difficult path of breaking up 



if its a dealbreaker for her she gets to look like the bad guy to you  she dumped me because i wouldnt be rough with her in bed poor me  and you get to feel sorry for yourself as the dumpee




a mature rational adult in a healthy adult relationship realizes that this is a fundamental incompatibility that cannot be resolved and agrees that splitting up to find partners who are compatible in the future is the best thing both partners can do you should want to find a partner who is sexually compatible with you not try to force the other persons hand and make them do the hard workinitiate the breakup or be stuck with unfulfilling unpleasant sex in a relationship they arent satisfied with 



you shouldnt want to force a partner to give up their own sexual needs and desires for your benefit or force them to walk away it should be a mature mutual decision  or a decision you make when you realize this cant be fixed allowing you both to move on and find a real healthy relationship elsewhere 




its pretty disgusting that youre willing to ask her to put 100 of her sexual needs aside for you to engage in sex with her you know she doesnt enjoyget satisfaction from or make her end things for you because youre too big of a coward to do it yourself if she doesnt bend to your needs 

i hope she does breakup with you and find a rational adult partner that is excited about fulfilling her sexually
portlanders seem incapable of admitting there are any problems or downsides here and its ridiculous

look i grew up here and im stuck here again now theres a lot that sucks about this place just because other cities deal with the same shit or have it worse doesnt make it not a problem here
a lot of portlanders need to pull their heads out of their asses
ah yeah because most of us poors have the kind of free outdoor space needed to raise chickens easy
i agree with this wholeheartedly find out what happened first to gauge if it would be appreciated or appropriate and if its nothing too terrible send it anyway 
what she chooses to do with it is her choice regardless but the sentiment is still there and its a beautiful gift
multnomah county is basically catch and release at this point no wonder everything is so fucked up  and getting less and less safe all the time  here portland is a joke
this is definitely not a guarantee an ex was vegan and one vegetarian and their cum was some of the worst most foul and vile taste ive ever encountered in my life like literally repulsive bitter absolutely disgusting tastes 

my current partner of many years is far from the picture of perfect dietary and nutritional health but is super easy to take  almost flavorless even
yep couldnt agree more 

the dialogue between the brothers had serious rfellowkids energy and was absolutely cringeworthy and just plain dumb 


took was obnoxious and lazily written and kiri  with her old woman voice  was too poorly fleshed out for anyone to care about yet somehow allpowerful no thank you 


the adults are much more interesting and still not that exciting but we spend the entire moving following these bratty poorly written children causing problems noooope

visually the movie was nice to look at but the plot eh
i hope you enjoy it if you do go back and see it

im not a diehard avatar fan here to endlessly defend the film or anything  and hope i didnt seem that way heh 
but i feel like falling asleep 10 minutes in was a bit harsh especially with you having not finished it 
but hey  we all like different things and thats okay 
i thought the plot was a bit dicey and too similar to the first film but the visuals were well done and i enjoyed the atmosphere and effects quite a bit will i be rushing out to see it a second time nah but i did enjoy it enough to feel i didnt waste my night sitting through it nevertheless 

it was loud as hell though agreed dolby atmos was a bit overpowering for me
yep agree with 100 of your comment

this is not professional attire  regardless of if it is sold at the store you work at that is completely irrelevant you cant expect all things to be appropriate in a workplace  for most workplaces and i would never expect this to be allowed at work  aside from maybe a bar job or something 


that said youre not on the clock and its a day off so unless otherwise stated  and then paid for the time  it would stand to reason that youre going to wear day off attire if you happen to do them a favor by stopping in 


at the same time as rude as the comment is its just that  a comment not sure why the post was needed aside from unnecessary validation  let it roll off and move on
all these lol call a lawyer comments are delusional this one off isnt a harassment case people make snide remarks in the workplace and they arent all sexual harassment or lawsuit worthy time for a reality check
dont insult those who genuinely need the medication with this horseshit people who dont need it will abuse it and thats on them its not government meth
portland has always looked like shit not sure when youre referring to 

roadside attraction however is and has been a wonderful place amongst the shit for a long time
you claim to have left the theater less than an hour in youre clearly not the targeted audience for the movie and quite frankly no one wants to listen to you whine about a film you didnt even stay to finish i personally have zero respect for someone who pays for a movie leaves before its over and then complains about it you didnt even watch the whole thing and you wasted the cost of a ticket just to walk out before being able to form a full opinion

you dont have to like it personally i dont feel like the avatar films have that solid of a plot  im watching for the visuals and effects and environments but theyre definitely not fall asleep 10 minutes in worthy nor are they bad enough to warrant a walk out under an hour in 

if they arent for you they arent for you  and you largely knew that already before visiting the theater  no need to come here being hyperbolic and dramatic
everyone in the theater fell asleep a mere ten minutes into the film 

sure dude



and if he does hopefully its with a partner that actually respects him and the rules they set beforehand
last time i checked youth arent legally permitted to purchase cigarettes flavored tobacco products or vape products in the first place 
if you think for one second that this will stop youth who are already obtaining these items through illegal avenues from continuing to do so i have a bridge to sell you 

as far as data on smoking cessation frankly who gives a shit
there are countless adults who say that vaping was a valuable and successful aid to them quitting smoking there is some data claiming vaping is healthier than outright smoking both for the user and those around them 
and all that aside i dont care about that data frankly adults should be allowed to legally buy these things and make the choices for themselves as to whether it is detrimental to their health and lifestyle or not
were doing a painfully bad job here with the choice to decriminalize drugs and hand out zero consequences for hard drug use and all the bullshittery that comes with it yet flavored tobacco and vapes is suddenly where we start taking a moral high ground and drawing some lines 
ridiculous 

im not a smoker or a vape user and never have been but this is getting ridiculous 
this isnt for the children and is just one of many stupid overstepping choices in a land of many shitty over the top restrictions
right not wanting to and choosing not to are two different things
id say a great deal of us dont want to pay our taxes but still have to the people that comment is referencing just straight up dont pay them  or pay very little of their share big difference 

i never want to pay taxes especially where i live taxes are raisednew taxes passed all the time for ridiculous bullshit while quality of life plummets more and more and the city gets filthier local government absolutely pissing it away
im well below the poverty line and disabled none of this shit benefits me and i can barely get by as it is i dont want to pay taxes but damn right theyll come for me if i dont
ir or xr 

he usually gets 20s but was having trouble finding 5s and 10s as well  his doctor was willing to rewrite the rx for the same dosage with those mg breakdowns but he called all over town and into beavertonhillsboro and still wasnt consistently able to find enough to fill his full script not sure if 15s are having the same issue or not it would be more complicated to achieve his dosage with 15s but if it keeps being a problem he might have to ask anyway lol

glad you havent had to deal with it yet  and hopefully you never do fortunately costco was able to fill his this month but its been an issue for him every month for the last 4 months i fortunately havent had to go outside of kaiser but have had to change my mg breakdown a few times which was annoying
im not actually sure why theres an ir shortage vs xr to be honest 
id guess that has something to do with it perhaps different regulations around ir vs xr  i was reading that the shortage comes from a problem with regulations only allowing so many to be made at a time or something to that effect perhaps its slightly different for xr since they have less potential for abuseare less viable on the illegal market but i havent really read anything indicating that so its just a wild guess 

the shortage definitely sucks i take it for narcolepsy and the n groups im in are suffering its a much more severe and potentially dangerous situation for narcoleptics not getting their meds but there isnt a priority list during shortages so its just luck of the draw who gets what and for what 
theyre estimating the shortage will continue well into 2023 which is pretty scary 
hopefully it doesnt impact you at all but id imagine people will have to supplement with xr at some point if this keeps dragging out so definitely be prepared
oh you take xrs yeah youll probably be fine irs are experiencing the shortage  though keep knocking on wood because its predicted to potentially hit xrs too just to a smaller extent
its definitely happening in portland

kaiser mail order has been a lot better than what my partner who isnt with kaiser has dealt with  he usually fills at fred meyer but has had to call all over town to multiple different chains only to eventually fill at costco  but even with them ive had to have my script rewritten to accommodate what mg tablets they have available  taking handfuls of 5s per day instead of multiple 20s for example  but its definitely ever present here id be shocked if you never encounter it in some form
check out r1200isplenty 

its not easy to eat super low calorie especially in the beginning 1200 does not feel like plenty especially when youre used to eating high calorie meals 
you can gain a few extra calories into your allotment with exercise but not everyone can do this  my narcolepsy is too severe its not even an option  and frankly exercise doesnt pay off calorie wise in any substantial way when you have to eat that low cal to lose 
low calorie foods that are high in protein playing around with things like intermittent fastingomad using teas and hydration and other things to get you past the hunger  these will all help but its still tough until you can get into a routine and retrain your stomach and brain 
there are tons of calorie counting meal plans out there fortunately  id recommend looking into those takes the planning work out of it and gets you into a routine right off the bat
amen all the people who claim that being constantly active and having a lot to do keeps sleep attacks away are the lucky ones  this is not how my narcolepsy works and id be much better off if it was
doing things is exhausting i have no energy as it is how am i supposed to work out have a highly active job etc 
if i could manage those things without extreme pain and sleep attacks i wouldnt be severely disabled  as a result of having narcolepsy
would love to be thrown in the hat for this 
my check in bag was destroyed last time i traveled with it  soft fabric suitcases arent the best for checking ive learned  and we cant afford a replacement right now but will have to travel soon to help transition my grandma into a care facility 
thank you for considering
i have my adderall mailed every month and havent seen my prescribing provider in person  or even done a telehealth appointment with them for that matter  in almost 3 years they have been contacted on my behalf once but this was because of the shortage and needing to change the mg breakdown in order to be able to fill it without delay 
this is via kaiser which i get covered through medicaid 


granted i take the medication for narcolepsy so much more serious different ballgame  but i would assume the same general controlled substance rules apply 


i have not heard of any changes or new worrisome controlled substance laws and i would not get too worked up over it until official news is available social media is not official news unless legitimate sources are linked 
you can ask your provider and ask them to keep you in the loop if youre genuinely concerned
i lived in that building theres no amount of fixing up that will redeem or genuinely improve that place
yep this is all i can think too


he speaks highly of her and clearly loves the person she is but theyve barely been together one year 
i know plenty of people have married that quickly and plenty have had it work out but i would still never advise such a commitment and life choice after such a tiny amount of time
that first year is very much honeymoon phase in a lot of ways and i doubt they were living together for the majority of that time  they have a lot to learn about each other still and the fact that theres this much uncertainty around sex and intimacy proves they are not ready
but given that op values sex and is a highly sexual person it wouldnt be surprising that rushing into it faster than maybe he otherwise would in order to unlock sex privileges plays a huge part here 



less than two years ago she was having frequent casual sex with someone and one year and 8 months ago  give or take  she completely changed her values and boundaries sexuallyin relationships and made a huge 180 as a person into church life abstinence etc 
she may not even truly know where shes at with sex or what thatll look like for them once married 
she may have no real interest in jumping right back into those activities or may feel deep shame about it still  seeing as to how thats what brought her to the epiphany and church commitment you dont usually decide you want to be abstinent and look poorly on your sex phase because you love sex and are a highly sexual person that will quickly return to those behaviors once the vows are exchanged its usually because you dont plan to revisit that side of yourselfdont feel good about it 

look im a highly sexual person i love sex and sexual compatibility is crucial to me in a relationship i would never marry someone without be damn sure we are compatible sexually share the same values around intimacy and are equally excited about sex
i also wouldnt be able to just switch off that side of myself for a year with someone i love and am dating show no interest or excitement in it and then switch it back on when i finally get the person to marry me  it just doesnt work like that 
im not judging people who choose to remain abstinent i have no interest in that kind of risk and sex is important to me in a relationship so id be shooting myself in the foot taking a gamble like that  but i am absolutely dumbfounded by people who claim to be very sexual and value sex in a relationship that wind up with a partner who is waiting until marriage theres just no reason to end up in this kind of a situation  you might wind up just fine but more likely than not youre going to deal with mismatched libidos sexual incompatibility etc 
id never enter a marriage with those possibilities on the table right off the bat
can you live a fulfilling life with narcolepsy 

this depends on how privileged you are and how severe your symptoms are 

many people answering yes while also not truly struggling financially being able to stay afloat and employed at a job acting like only minor changes  like dietexercisesleep hygiene  will make a world of difference to improve symptoms these are not the people with the more severe end of symptoms or with the more extreme hurdles to overcome 

for me the answer is absolutely fucking not
this life is hell too disabled to work forever cursed to extreme poverty and struggle always in a constant fear of how the hell im going to survive and stay housed or fed or afloat 


always feel sick exhausted fatigued and can never achieve restful restorative sleep  despite needing 1214 hours a night to even remotely function in a day and even then its not really functioning


memory long gone feels like i have alzheimers most of the time  workingshort term memory completely obliterated to the point of legitimate fear of losing myself entirely old memories fading more and more all the time 

i get maybe 23 hours in a day where i can do anything  the rest of the time im too heavy and pained and fatigued and brain fogged to even answer a basic email or fold my laundry cant really have much in the way of fulfillment when the most you can muster most of the time is staring blankly at a wall or phone screen dazed and half asleep

no one takes narcolepsy seriously and no one who doesnt suffer from it themselves understands it can even remotely relate or truly gets the weight and realness of all the symptoms so add in never being taken seriously or believed fully and not being able to truly relate to hardly anyone in your life to the roster of bullshit nothing i love more than having to constantly defend or explain myself or justify the hell that is living with narcolepsy 

and it gets worse all the time im substantially worse than i was two years ago much worse than one year ago definitely worse than 6 months ago too 
things i used to be able to manage or at least enjoy a little bit despite being more exhausted by them are now tougher and tougher and i see myself quickly approaching the point of no return for many things quite quickly where i wont be able to enjoy or do many things i once loved ever again 

sleep is hellish  and i spend over half my time wasting my time on this earth doing it such vivid dreams that when coupled with the memory lossissues make it hard to know whats real and what was a dream 
did i do  thing yeah of course i did i remember doing that  oh wait nope it was a dream 
an exhausting dream from which i woke up even more tired than before having no real rest and now i have to try to do it again in real life 
its like being trapped in some kind of sick torture cycle forced to be constantly living the worst  and painfully mundane  versions of existence with no idea which are the real actions thatll have real consequences or impacts later 
sleep inertia is physically painful in ways i cant even verbalize well enough to get basic understanding from others  so instead im lazy or choosing to sleep in
the hallucinations are so frustratingly vivid and bad that i feel like an insane person sleep is my biggest enemy for so many reasons

sleep medicine is a joke at this point for people with truly severe symptoms
treatment options are limited and not wildly effective for many 
my meds dont work a good deal of the time  and when they do its barely an improvement  and ill only continue to build more and more tolerance until there are no longer any options on the table at all 


so given these factors what exactly is my hope for a fulfilling life 
the us government hates disabled  and poor  people i will be trapped in poverty pain and suffering until i die 
i lose more and more memory and function and feel worse and worse every day it seems like 
cant financially afford a comfortable manageable or fulfilling life  or to do anything i still enjoy before i cant any longer  and there is no job on earth that can accommodate the severity of my symptoms 

at least if im lucky ill stop remembering any of it at all at a certain point and just black out to the rest of this life

this isnt to say you  or others  cant i envy those who can and im happy for them but they arent the only reality and its okay to feel disappointed or like your life isnt fulfilling and this disease is robbing you of a good life it definitely can
couldnt agree more 100 


this disease is a curse and comes with the added sting of no one taking it a seriously as it deserves
this is the difference  

i love sw in all forms but this is the first show that hasnt been aimed at children the movies are all trying to appeal to kidsfamilies and the camp is heavy which makes the atrocities fall flathard to take seriously sometimes 
having a grittier darker sw that appeals to adults is obviously going to hit harder and be able to do more with the concepts anyone pretending this isnt the case is frankly silly  it doesnt mean the ot isnt amazing or that the empire didnt do horrible things but when its covered with 100 layers of camp and child friendly filters it just doesnt have the same impact
was was this seriously necessary its very clear what he meant plenty women with refer to it that way because its an easier general term to use instead of being pedantic and getting unnecessarily specific when we all know whats being referenced
when youre cripplingly poor the price tag at checkout is the only cost you can afford to focus on 

amazon sucks and major corporations need to stop fucking over workers  and everything else they negatively impact  but for poordisabled people sometimes these companies are the only options we have
agreed

i love sw but i also grew up watching it and didnt have a bunch of newer content to compare it to 

i still love the older films but i can imagine someone coming into the franchise and not finding it as interesting or exciting in comparison  especially if its someone who cant overlook the fact that its an older movie and the effects and stuff arent on the same level as the more current movies and shows 

i feel like i wouldve still loved it and gotten into the franchise had i been shown sw for the first time in this order today but i also have a pretty eclectic movie taste and enjoy the charm of older stuff if she is not like this it will likely be harder for her to enjoy after the newer content
this feels like a troll post 100 


if it isnt the guy doesnt know you the other redditors dont know you this isnt a funny but questionable joke with a friend who i have that kind of rapport with and make nonpc jokes with situation
given that yes those comments could come off as racist offensive and like youre teasing or insulting the guy over his raceracial stereotypes

whether you meant it that way or not and who you are as a personif youre racist or not isnt going to translate into a comment youre making to a stranger online so its best to avoid making jokes that can be read that way if you dont want people to assume the worst
this is only true for progestinonly pills  and the majority of people take combination pills which this is not true for if youre taking a combination pill one pill a day taken at any time is perfect and varying times daily is fine 

good idea to know which youre on and what the specific instructions are op
im not bitter just because im agreeing that i dont get it  youre the one choosing to pick an argument with someone who wasnt talking to you in the first place frankly 
nowhere did i invalidate someones ocd experience by stating that some of us dont get whatever metaphor is being presented here 
good for you that you think you get it my comment wasnt directed at you move along
i know what a metaphor is this isnt a very clear one obviously because most of us have no idea what the hell it is
yeah i know zero idea 

life with ocd is life sitting with your feet replaced by ocd and flowers growing out of your head thats always a clock what
it has gotten so bad  and gets worse all the time  that i have chosen to essentially look at my life and live it much in the same way i would if i was diagnosed with a terminal illness or told i had early onset dementia or something 
i know that my ability to enjoy any aspects of this life is very limited not and will only get progressively worse each day i know that i am becoming less and less functional all the time as a result of my narcolepsy and memory loss 
so ive basically erased my priority list and replaced it with a few basic things  try to survive try to stay afloat and focus solely on enjoying any moment i can whenever i can because itll all be gone before i know it 

this disease is hell i truly feel like my brain is rapidly deteriorating i can barely remember what im doing while im doing it anymore  whats the point of anything if you arent forming any memories
lmfao holy shit this cracked me up ive never gotten a relevant username comment in my entire 8 year span of having this specific account 
well done 
happy thanksgiving
is is there a reason behind this post do you not remember last night 
is there something special about this area 
do we win a prize if we guess 
did something happen 
why op
personally



ive had migraines since some of my earliest childhood memories


i also have no recollection of any time in my entire life where i wasnt exhausted constantly sleepy having disordered sleep etc 



my parents have also confirmed that ive had horrible headaches since i was essentially able to speak and communicate their presence and that i was always exhausted as a young young kid and never able to be woken up on time for anythinghave energy for life



so i would say both have probably been there equal lengths of time since my youngest childhood years
yep couldnt agree more extremely stupid dangerous selfish reckless all of it 

put the babies at extreme risk put the siblings at risk of being motherless put her husband at risk of losing his partnercoparent puts them at risk of additional health issues  and herself at risk of further complicationshealth problems literally nothing about it was at all smart 

no one needs to produce a small fleet of children frankly but especially not this close together
it is an insane and dangerous thing to put your body through  and she did it 100 by choice

they were complicated dangerous pregnancies for her and were not without extreme risk to her and the babies and were advised against

she needs to close up shop  ideally permanently if not for a long time
i see nothing wrong with this at all at least at this point in time

you have a stressful job that is very demanding and takes a lot if not most of your attention and energy during the week   
instead of halfassing sexual encounters and being halfengaged because youre still trying to decompress from work and thinking about having to start back up again and maintain focus and commitment the very next day youre saving those encounters for the weekend when you can truly dive all in  and this is giving you something to look forward to as a reward for getting through the hard parts of the week

this is absolutely no different than when a couple who both work demanding jobs and are too busy during the week to really connect and have date nights set the weekend aside for a nice dinner a movie etc  
just because its sexsex related doesnt mean it isnt a date night or an opportunity for the two of you to connect connect emotionally and be intimate a healthy fulfilling sex life is pretty crucial to a healthy happy relationship that lasts  and it sounds like you have that

exploring your sexualityexploring sexually and exploring sexually with your partner are also incredibly healthy important things it can teach you a lot about yourself your partner your relationship the two of you together etc  
things like bdsm require an intense amount of trust and healthy communication skills  youre not just fucking youre growing these qualities and strengthening your relationship

yes it is important to have a social life to some extent and to do things outside the bedroom sometimes but some people are less social than others and some people prefer to spend the weekend engaging sexually and romantically with their significant other instead of going out to lunch and being around a bunch of people after an exhausting work week  
thats not only perfectly okay its perfectly normal 

my partner and i have a dynamic sort of like this sexually while we dont have a crazy career like you do so we have far more time together during the week and arent as mentally sidetracked with such a crazy workload we have our own challenges throughout the week that make things stressful and preoccupying  
on the weekends thats us time  we will regularly have 12 hour sex sessions that go all daynight where we do all kinds of wild things together explore watch videos weve filmed film new videos for ourselves etc  
friends will hit us up to do things and the answer is sorry today is date daynight  and thats that friends dont pester and we feel no guilt  us time is very important and very healthy to have

that intense release and intense intimacy after a stressful week  we will have sex periodically throughout most weeks sometimes but we also like to save it to build up the tension if we know a big weekend is coming and the week is particularly busyrough  is an amazing reward for getting through it all  
weve been on this cycle for pretty much all of the year and were just fine  
our lives havent fallen apart our friends still know we exist and arent mad at us and our relationship is stronger than ever  and were closer than we couldve ever imagined

dont sweat it as long as you both feel fulfilled and happy love and respect each other and occasionally make time for your friends  even just a phone call or a text or a lunch once a month when you have the energy and mental capacity to deal with it  youre golden 

there is no room in this life for shame guilt or personal insecurity  especially around sex have fun
food  candy especially  is not safe inside the vagina so no it is not
one thing its important to note is that an amphetamine based stimulant is not going to make you less tired either it will also only keep you awake  if it even does that  and potentially help with focusconcentrationattentionetc 

there is no daytime medicine that will take away your feelings of tired of exhaustion its important to set your expectations accordingly
i would never necessarily advise this but my dad  who had never been remotely religious  joined the church for exactly those reasons and it was probably the best decision he couldve made during a time of extreme loneliness depression and hopelessness
finding a supportive community and positive routine is never a bad idea doesnt have to be religion
ive had a bunch of different manufacturers  ive been on adderall for ages  and over time i came to realize that a lot of the generics just plain dont work 

whenever id get a new looking pill id google the manufacturer and what do you know  tons of reviewsposts all around the internet of people complaining that they seem like sugar pills or questioning whether or not theyre going crazy because it feels like their meds suddenly dont do anything

ive been gaslit by medical professionals in the past and told that there is no difference between manufacturers and that thinking some of them dont work is all in my head and not possible  
yet ive also had medical professionals  and have confirmed through research on my own time  that they do indeed differ and some may not be as good as others  
i am inclined to believe the latter because i definitely have noticed that some work better than others  and when there are hundreds of people across the internet posting about that same thing its hard to believe its just a mass delusion

anyway i digress the two manufacturers i personally have used that i know consistently work for me are teva and sandoz my partner who also takes adderall by prescription also agrees that those are the two good ones

others have given me headachesextreme migraines havent worked at allhave made me feel more exhausted caused more dry mouthnausea bad side effects etc

i asked my pharmacy to specify that i will only accept sandoz or teva i told them that other manufacturers trigger extreme migraines for me and those are the two i know that work i couldve just given one but i wanted to have backup so that they could provide the alternative if the first was not available

while i couldve gone off and said i dont feel like other manufacturers are as strongwork as good i didnt feel the need to potentially have another bullshit gaslighting conversation as if i dont know what it feels like when my meds are and arent working or have that come across as red flag type behavior i would suggest going about it the same way if you want to have a manufacturer specified 

you can typically see who manufacturers your prescription by reading the label on the bottle mine says general for adderall and underneath that mfr teva usa for example your label should have this somewhere on it 

im sorry youre having this experience and are being judged as though youre drugseeking its absolute horse shit that medical professionalspharmacists feel justified in having that attitude with patients you have a valid fucking prescription of course youre going to want to fill it and get the medication you need and are prescribed   
dont let them bully you its perfectly reasonable to want to find a solution and get your medication despite the shortage  and its in no way weird or drugseeking to do so by having them change the mg breakdown in order to provide the same damn meds youve been getting

best of luck i hope they work it out for you soon
hell it was really upsetting and uncomfortable even for me as a preteen to witness my parents sobbing while putting down our cats 
absolutely no to bringing a 3 year old 
theyre either going to lose their shit fall apart and create an extremely hard to manage scene because they dont understand the deathwhat has occurred and are shaken by seeing their parent upset or theyre not going to react with the right types of emotions  possibly get impatient or agitated for example  and ruin your final moments with your beloved pet since youll have to be parenting them instead 

have an age appropriate send off beforehand and go without the child i would say
god im so so sorry for your loss and the awful way you had to experience it 
i cant even begin to imagine having to witness that would absolutely shatter me i hope you are able to heal and in time begin to replace those traumatic flashbacks with more cherished memories to reflect on
i dont need a lesson on unmedicated adhd ive had adhd since i was a child i fully understand the symptoms and how they can impact your day to day life  
im well aware that it isnt the lol squirrel disease it can be stereotyped as

i still firmly believe narcoleptics suffer substantially more due to the nature of the disease and lack of capacity to achieve restful restorative sleep and therefore should be prioritized in time of shortage 

kind of hard to worry about my attention issues and mood swings and impulse problems when i cant stay awake could collapse at any moment without warning and cant differentiate between being asleep and awake
not so much of a horror story as just a weird sickness occurrence ive always wondered about 

was at disneyland really excited for the first night of our short visit  it was a ticketed event so we entered the park at around 6pm for an 8 or 9pm event start time i think
i felt great nothing was amiss we go to bengal bbq having not had lunch yet and grab two skewers each 
i finish mine and were letting it settle and making a game plan 
out of nowhere i start feeling absolutely horrible nausea keep freezing up because it feels like projectile vomit is about to come out of nowhere 
finally feel safe enough to make it to the bathroom and take one of the large back stalls 
spent a solid hour and a half or so in there vomiting like crazy id stop feel better sit on the toilet to be sure it was over and collect myself and then it would come back 
finally after the solid 15 hours it seems like it isnt coming back and i put myself back together swish a ton of water in my mouth and try to regain composure and rejoin my boyfriend who was waiting patiently outside 
we take it slow walking towards main street to see if we should go back to the hotel or if im going to manage and im fine for the rest of the night and trip 

i have no idea what happened why i got sick or why it was so short lived but i was so glad i only missed a couple hours of the trip instead of it becoming a prolonged ordeal
it was unlike anything id experienced before i felt so horrible i wish i knew what caused it
10000000 agree grew up with  and obviously still have adhd  but narcolepsy is a totally different much more dangerous and severe can of worms 
youre not going to fall asleep driving or doing dangerous tasks or working if you dont get your adhd meds i absolutely will as a narcoleptic 

but sadly thats not how it works and so for the millionth time narcoleptics are low priority in medicine and well all just suffer through the shortage indefinitely while having pharmacists and doctors treat us like drugseeking pieces of shit 
are you able to change the mg in order to have it filled for the same amount 


i went from taking 6 10s a day to taking the 5mg equivalent  my dosage didnt change i just take twice as many pills now because though they were experiencing a shortage of the 10 and 20mg options in the two manufacturers i will accept they have not experienced a shortage on 5s 
theyll need your doctors approval for this  or you can ask your doctor directly and see if they can help get to the bottom of things and find something that will work with a pharmacy available to you  but it might be a good workaround for you
yeah  nothing is going to drop in price anyone who thinks this is naive delusional and has no idea how businesses work 

but maybe things will level out for a year or two somewhat which is something
therapy should be higher on the priority list than dating and being in a relationship
its okay to be single its okay to be single for a longer period of time while youre working on yourself and getting over and through your issues and fears and its okay to focus on yourself so you can be healthy enough to be with someone in the future 

this is not to say that people cant be in a relationshipdating while theyre in therapyworking through trauma but it sounds like youre not quite ready for that right now and bringing all of that into a relationship right off the bat isnt a great way to start off on a good track with someone especially when you arent even in therapy yet 

im sorry youve gone through this and are struggling regardless i know it can be hard to get started in therapy and its an uphill battle to process trauma and establish boundaries in new relationships i wish you the best
right

like it sounds like this guy is a dick in general or at least from ops perception but like youre a grown ass woman use a towel and get on with your day

ive never once thought to sit there helpless waiting for my partner to clean me up for me im a fully capable human being and it takes no effort to do it myself  is this seriously an expectation people have
most people have better shit to do think about care about pay attention to and focus on than what a random stranger is buying at a store they are also shopping at 
you are not the main character  or even side character interesting extra or memorable cameo  in the lives of strangers at the store 



most humans have sex you can count on it being a fact that almost every person 18 and older  and some younger  at the store will have either had sex at some point in their lives be in a sexual relationship currently be actively seeking sexual encounters or plan to have sex in the future 
being sexually involvedinclined in some capacity is the norm  its human nature 


those who frown upon sex judge others for having it or feel that it is shameful are not normal and do not have a healthy rational mentality about sexsexual behavior  given that why do you care about their thoughts or opinions 
what weight does their internal monologue which may or may not include you specifically and will almost certainly shift away from the fleeting second they saw you purchasing merchandise legally at a store  if they even noticed what you were buying at all  very quickly and you will never be thought about again
no one is going home and spending time thinking about how they saw you buying condoms  and if they are so what you dont even know them so 


if youre mature  for lack of a better word  enough to be sexually active and comfortable doing sexual things with other people you can be mature enough to realize these things and buy whatever you need without stressing yourself out over other people 
other people dont give a fuck if you see them buying all kinds of shit  you arent a factor to them no need to pay more attention to them than they do you 

also online retailers my friend boom
i recently tried to detail to my partner  after seeing a post where shes still photoshopping the everloving shit out of her photos as if we havent seen what she really looks like  the whole ziedrebecca photo ordeal and his mind was blown 
he couldnt wrap his mind around wearing a shirt with your partners face on it  or printing out weird selfies of them to hang in your house for that matter 
i just cant imagine doing this its so cringe and stinks of insecurity and desperation 

bonus points to the rebecca story for being genuinely hilarious nothing like your so wearing a shirt with a highly filtered and edited photo of you on it and then seeing what you really look like in person truly amazing
sure but not in the same way as someone who doesnt have casual sex and views sex as something they only valuewant to pursue with someone they feel strongly aboutknow welletc

neither person is wrong but they are different viewpoints and mentalities and would make those people incompatible
exactly 

my partner and i dont often do things apart and try not to travel separately unless the situation specifically makes it necessary 

my partner is also not a huge textercaller in general and finds traveling super stressful exhausting and distracting and finds it difficult to make a ton of time to be on his phone when traveling

but i still hear from him at least twice  morning and evening  when he travels and we keep each other updated with how things are going a i love you hope everything is going good at night etc  even if we save the details and stories for when were back in person 

first solo trip and not even a things are going good howre youthe kids love you is very odd when you couple that with the lack of info beforehand its a red flag
i mean shit he had no contact info for her friend no idea where exactly she was going  what if something happened given the of aspect of this this couldve been a very dangerous trap for his wife 
maybe when youre a couple that travels solo often these things arent as notable but this does strike me as super odd
super interested would make an amazing holiday gift for my partner who is hard to buy for  and who i wasnt thinking about when halloween stuff was still around   who has a crazy skeleton aesthetic space in our home that needs more inhabitants
how much do you like it 

its only worth as much as the buyer is willing to pay  if you really want it and really like the piece 30 might be worth it to you if you really want it in your collection and dont think youll find the same pieceanything quite like it

personally i wouldnt pay more than maybe 1015 for it if i had the extra spending cash possibly more if it was a really big cupgoblet versus something small i like the look and could imagine it looking good in a lot of different types of displays  it has a classiness about it that makes it versatile 

  
its also pretty dang hardrare to find any uranium glass where im at  and most of it is just super genericbland plates and tea cups  and its all extremely expensive so thats something i factor in too if its easy to find where youre at it wont sting to pass on this for being a bit overpriced

maybe ask her to come down a bit and see if the seller is willing to budge   
if not ultimately 30 is a bit overpriced in my opinion but if you really like it and cant get it out of your mind go ahead and splurge

i mean i get what youre saying but op is claiming theyd never been to wdw ever yet also says the reason they desperately need this reservation is because her favorite memory is dining in the castle at disneyland 

not saying op is lying but the internet is full of fake sob stories so i dont blame people for calling out the major inconsistency there
yep i have narcolepsy this is a daily occurrence for me 
very much couldve been what happened op

dogs dont experience human emotions in the way that we do nor do they experience emotions in the same way as this specific droid is portrayed as experiencing human companionship isnt a concept to dogs  they know where their food is we can anthropomorphize dogs all we want but its simply not the same emotional range or experience
i think thats a bit of an insult to droids frankly which serve a purpose have their own thoughtspersonalitiesdesires to an extent can perform useful and complex tasks etc 
the sadness and companionship the droid youre referencing experiences in andor is more akin to a child or an intelligent andor human companion  these are not things a dog is capable of feeling
ive worked nights before  its definitely a whole strange level of tough totally 

and 100  a coffee shop totally a luxury no one is more entitled than anyone else
which extends to everything of course  your choice to have kids doesnt entitle you to anything
i think i get most frustrated when people insinuate that they have a deeper understanding of exhaustion or tiredness because they have kids  its simply not true and even if it was who gives a shit 
were all here same playing field no one gives me any considerations and im literally disabled and have a crippling disease that impacts my ability to have restorative sleep 
people with cancer still have to deal with the same bullshit the rest of us do 
so why would kids entitle to you anything
no kidding 

i have narcolepsy im incapable of getting restful restorative sleep ever thats not me hyperbolizing thats what this disease is im always mentally and physically running as though im at least 72 hours or more sleep deprived  

and yet entitled moms will still go youre not as tired as me though you dont have kids

absolutely fuck off you dont even know what tired is lady
if someone wants to avoid better care that should be their right and choice 
what you perceive as better care is not always actually better care  and quite frankly you dont have to live through it struggle through it maintain through it or pay for it so it isnt your place to decide if its better care or not 

the person struggling to survive their disability and struggling to survive this life while disabled knows best whether or not theyve exhausted all viable options and if the other options available will genuinely offer a chance at a better quality of life  and without too many risks or negatives to negate the benefits  or if they have finally run out of better choices 

quite frankly even if someone hasnt exhausted all better care options they should be allowed to make this choice with dignity and acceptance 
as someone who cleaned up the literal aftermath of my stepfathers suicide earlier this year people will make this choice when they are done whether they are legally permitted to do so or not 
being able to do so in a comfortable environment with supervision and dignity rather than the all too common alternatives is a huge plus in my mind

no one wants to lose a loved one especially not in circumstances we perceive to be before their time
but that is not for us to decide we dont have to live as them we dont have to suffer through their reality
definitely time for a cabinet display 

i agree  its definitely becoming more and more rare i never see it anywhere where im at when hunting in person and the stuff i see online is often overpriced in bad shape or pretty basic pieces
gotta snag the good stuff when you find it
that tray with the glasses alone would be worth it to me  they look awesome together really cool pieces 
the butter dish and the pitcher  which is gorgeous by the way  are just the icing on the cake absolutely a win thanks for sharing
you surely didnt hear right tattoo removal isnt exactly a one and done quick removal process
i mean look at a certain point for some of us there is no better quality of life 

sure having the financial means to actually live an enjoyable life without employment where housing isnt a concernluxury and isnt substandard and where i could actually enjoy things and do activities instead of just trying to scrape by and exist as inexpensively as possible while being stuck in forced poverty would help but at the end of the day my disabilities are only going to keep getting worse and thats going to make staying alive pretty fucking miserable regardless of any other amenities or benefits im afforded 
it is clear that my disease is not important enough for there to be any major research or treatment options on the horizon to change this or afford me any substantial relief either 
it is harder and harder every day to maintain any semblance of function 

there will come a time where it is no longer worth it at all to continue to drag myself through each day it is too damn painful at that point i would like the option to dignified release from this vessel instead of continuing to be trapped in this physical prison 


i am 100 all for this for those of us who will never have a viable cure or treatment that provides enough relief to maintain a decent quality of life  and thats ignoring the financial strain of existing
yep this right here 

disney will 100 make this right with no hassle at all  know from personal experience and they went above and beyond  but you dont get the internet validation if you just do what youre supposed to and contact them instead of whining online
unfortunately it isnt that simple

first of all  because she was not the owner of the dog there is nothing i cancould do to compel anyone to have the dog put down the owner took the dog and claimed he would not be using her as a dogsitter again so as far as animal control was concerned that was enough i was informed by multiple animal control employees that nothing more could be done and that no court could compel the actual owner to bring the dog in to have it put down since i would not be suing him  i would be suing the woman watching the dog at the time  and they tend to only award verdicts of monetary value since that is all the loss is seen as

i still would like to take her to court but unfortunately it isnt as easy as just going im suing you you killed my animal and walking away with a judgement

she has dodged every attempt at contact and i simply do not have the financial ability to hire a process server nor to pay court fees i am severely disabled and unfortunately that means i am not financially privileged either

small claims does not tend to be the most fruitful experience for anyone and animalloss cases like this are typically not easy to win nor very highpaying

i agree it would have been some justice and i have been trying to see if theres anything i can still do to make her pay in one way or another but it doesnt look promising
it pains me to say that the comment youre referring to likely wasnt me if it was on this subreddit  this is the first time ive commented here so it was likely someone else which unfortunately just goes to show how often this tragedy occurs and how often lives are ruined by irresponsible dog owners and their mutts 

but that aside  thank you so much for your kind words and compassion it really means so much to me to know that people have heard my little dudes story if nothing else  that he wasnt just brushed off and forgotten by everyone just because the woman who caused this chose to handle things that way

please do give your little fuzzballs extra loves from us today  you sound like such a kind and sweet person and i have no doubt theyre very lucky to have you
yeah a lot of hallmark ornaments ive seen lately look terrible super bad paint job zero quality control or consistency between different ornaments of the same design just really thrown together and cheap looking theyve definitely lost any standards of quality they ever had sadly
i dont know personally i think she has now firmly entered was territory i cant possibly see how this could be considered still pretty or attractive in any way her face is horrifying and the general overall vibe of 100 plastic is really off putting she has gone way too far already
thank you so much  give your kittens extra love from me today im glad you have the protective instincts that you do to care for them
the report  and the retelling by the neighbor who called and tracked the bitch down who i am forever grateful to  essentially said that the bitch lied tried to hide the dog and claim there was no dog 



then said that she was housesitting and didnt live there nor was it her dog 



then finally owned up and said she lives there but it isnt her dog  she dog sits for some asshole who lives an hour outside of town and they immediately called him



he came and picked the beast up and was allowed to take it home with zero follow up punishment etc because he said hed never use her for dog sitting again



she tried to say my little dude was on her property and the dog dragged him out from under the shed and then rolled into the alley behind the house where the mauling ended 



in reality this bitch had an unleashed pitbull hanging out unattended in a backyard that barely even had a piece of chicken wire up as a fence and he jumped into the alley and attacked seeing as there was evidence of this  and witnesses  and no evidence it started on her lot 


the dog had to be choked out to release my little guy but by that point he had ripped through his entire abdomen 


it was bloody hellish to hearsee and half the damn street came outside while she bolted with the dog the second it dropped him  she didnt stick around to see if my kitty survived nothing just bolted 



the financial and emotional burden this bitch caused i still havent recovered i dont understand how someone could be so fucking irresponsible  having a pit bull unleashed in a yard with zero fence left unattended
i see red every time i think about it its just too much he didnt deserve to go out like this 

animal control doing nothing was just the icing on the shit cake here
believe me if the risks werent so high id have done it myself already i found out who it was  animal control was called by a neighbor who located the bitch and the hellbeast so i got their information  and they live 4 houses down not a day passes where the fact that there was no justice at all doesnt sting
a lot of people chime in with something that keeps you on your feet and moving constantlykeeps them constantly busy whenever a post about best jobs for narcoleptics comes up and it absolutely boggles my fucking mind 

if i had the energy or ability to be constantly moving or in any way busy and active my narcolepsy wouldnt be much of a problem now would it 
and why the hell would i want a job that is going to keep me constantly moving and busy and thus depletes every last bit of energy reserve i possibly couldve had exhausting me even further every day 
no thank you thats torture 

i wish i knew what to tell ya but sadly i dont have a good answer  i am permanently disabled by my narcolepsy and cannot work 
when i was still trying to cling onto working though something brainless and low key that wouldnt exhaust my energy resources or physically deplete me was the best thing possible 
work from home type thing lots of naps nothing physically demanding or anything that i needed to be constantly moving for 
i suppose everyone is different and if it works for some folks thats great but it definitely wasnt for me
i 100 feel you i wish theyd separate waiting rooms or at least have clients leave and enter separately as so to never cross paths in this way 

back in late june a pitbull mauled my indooronly cat  who bolted outside when startled by a truck backfiring on the street as i came inside  to death and the coward owner fled the scene 
my fuzzy best friend bled to death in my fucking arms he meant the world to me and was a huge help in dealing with my severe disability each day in a number of ways i will never be the same after this loss 


i was never a fan of big dogs  have traumafear from being attacked as a child  but my hatred and fear oftowards pitbulls is immeasurable now 
and theyre fucking everywhere which definitely doesnt help 

i feel rage boil up inside of me the second i even see one these days i actively avoid being anywhere near them  taking other entrances at shops crossing the street etc 

i now have two kittens who i rescued a couple months after losing my little dude and had a similar experience to this at the vet 

no your hellhound cant come near my kittens and curiously or playfully sniff at their cage i dont give a shit that they just want to check it out 
also no your shitbeast is not permitted to get anywhere near me either fuck off 

it can feel embarrassing at first to go against the popular dog crazy way of behaving  be that moving away from them at the vet like you did or verbally stating a boundary and asking them to remove themselves from your space  but the more you do it the less youll care and the happier youll be
who cares what these people think you didnt do anything wrong youre protecting yourself and your pets which is the good responsible thing to do 
anyone taking issue with that has serious issues themselves  and thus their opinion holds zero value 

at the end of the day as much as i dont want to cause problems or have uncomfortable encounters with others all i care about is my safety  and that of my partner and pets 
fuck strangers 
all those pitloving eager to tell you how innocent and friendly their dog is quick to judge idiots arent going to be there helping you pick up the pieces when youre on your knees sobbing and screaming covered in the blood of your petloved oneetc 
gotta look out for you and yours first
if you fully understand the reputation behind pit bulls why the hell do you have one 

i applaud you for muzzling and understanding why people dont want to go near yours but im genuinely confused as to why youre harboring one if youre also aware of the massive problem 

i dont mean this as a jab or an attack im genuinely interested in hearing your reasoning here  and i do promise not to snap back and turn it into a debate thats not my intention
thats ridiculous im sorry you had that experience


definitely cant use sleepy with people as an alternative to tired to try to get people to better understandtake things seriously in my experience at least either 
sleepy sounds way more childish and even less serious
excessive daytime sleepiness being the official term for a big part of narcolepsy makes me irrationally angry it sounds so laughably childish and fake and almost in a way sounds like its mocking the symptomsseverity
trying to tell anyone about narcolepsy using those terms  or trying to get them to take it seriously after they google it and see those terms  is that much harder its so annoying how much language is failing to help us here
never ever is there too much when it comes to cleaning 

every time i shower i use the detachable shower head and go to town down there blasting water everywhere 
absolutely always getting the inside and outside of my assother bits with hot water 
definitely would rather but too much into it than not enough
so you expect us to believe that the staff and management decided to make it their mission to single out your family and ruin your night just for the hell of it

it doesnt matter if you personally agree with the rules or contrived age restriction policies  they are in place for a reason and meow wolf is hardly the only business on the planet that enforces these especially with live events

the bottom line is that you have a minor child a minor child who is as of now still under 16 even

liability is a thing you have no idea why their policies state a child must be 16 or over  or 18 for some events its much bigger than you and your family and goes into insurance legality etc

literally every event on the meow wolf calendarwhere you go to buy tickets states the age policy if you missed it take the loss and move on  
if youre trying to insinuate that the age policy wasnt stateda thing beforehand and management was crafting a story to work against you specifically thats absolutely absurd and no one here is buying it

just because she couldnt provide you anything in writing doesnt make this some grand conspiracy youre not entitled to have the answer given to you in the way you deem acceptable and you can be denied entry for any reason this is not the call out post you think it is
this is 100 it in my opinion


its clear op has never truly faced housing insecurities and has been privileged enough to avoid facing the situations you describe


not all of us have had that luxury 



ive moved every single year for 10 straight years before moving into my current place  february 2023 will be two years here 


it was a scramble every time  rent was raised or they didnt offer me a month to month after my year term was up in order to turn it over at a much higher cost since tenant protections have a cap on rent raises here 
each time i had to leave one shitty place frantically with no real savings  since rent is so damn expensive how do you put money away  just to find another shitty place
nowhere ever felt like home i was always worried and always monitoring craigslist and rental websites 
ive had to live with black mold meth addict neighbors stealing my shit had to occupy a unit while it was flooded with ankle deep water no heatpower no hot water etc etc  the list never ends 



the place im in now is amazing but im scared 247 even after almost two years 
if they raise the rent at all ill be out the market now is so bad i wont find another place theres nothing not even another really awful slumlord owned shack 
it will be a death sentence for me as a disabled person 
when the private landlords i initially rented from informed us they were hiring a sleazy shitbag property management guy it felt like the world was falling apart around me  things couldnt just remain chill of course wed have to face the road to the end sooner rather than later 
i took one look at the rental market and decided to update my will instead of investigating further  when the time finally comes and the rent goes up here its more likely to be useful than anything else 



i get it  owning is stressful and expensive but not having to live at the mercy of shitty landlords who can raise your rent or force you out at any time for any reason at all is worth every cent 
this is no way to live being trapped in forced poverty on top of it truly terrible
yeah agreed i get the sense most of these people havent traveled much or explored other cities scenes whenif they have
theres nothing in portland that isnt done better elsewhere
she posted that to manipulate because she knew it would tug at the hearts of the kind of gullible people shes aiming for 
thats such transparent lazy classic sob story bullshit
exactly if youre genuinely on a tight out of pocket budget trying to make magic happen out of the goodness of your heart your first stop is probably not endlessly browsing mercari and then over sharing your sob story to get people  whose circumstances you dont know and could need the money at full price since these apps are people selling not businesses  to lower their prices 

theres enough red flags in her two messages to decorate this entire fictional gym shes referring to 

trauma based children  this one could just be meme being nitpicky but what trauma based children makes no fucking sense this is not how someone working with children whove gone through trauma would word this i feel like it sounds fake as hell like someone who is scrambling for a background for their sob story trying to come up with something legitimate but failing but again this one is probably just me being picky lol 
but the fact that she opened the conversation with it my rule  and ive never been wrong  is that if someone begins a conversation by over sharingpresenting a sob story its bullshit 100 of the time its not relevant yet  not that it ever would be necessarily  in that first message shes just trying to manipulate from the very first second transparent as hell not even remotely clever 

then that second message 
immediately after whats the best you can do were right back into the sob story whats the lowest you can go youll be helping boys who have no one 
doesnt take a pause just immediately launching into the poor me how low can go you for miserable lonely children 


the one that killed me was the really not trying to low ball you or whatever they call it like lady please 
youve got to be kidding me you werent born yesterday we all know what low balling is how transparent can you be

i cant believe some of the comments here are making it out like this person was clever or potentially legit or somehow very good with this message 
010 lazy sob story transparent as ever


i personally really hate the i shop on this app all the time but this is out of my pocket and im on a tight budget shit too while trying to throw a pity party about wanting to make something magical for these apparently traumatized kids
if you care so much and you shop for yourself all the time it should be no problem to pay a reasonable price  either what op is charging or by making your own reasonable offer without all the bs messaging  to do that for them why is it this strangers job
youre joking right this is a very good sob story to you 

good grief they went right into the normal poor me youd be helping  in need who have nothingno one right away this is as uniform lazy bullshit as it gets
i mean op even said she recognized she was smelling gross long before engaging in sex with him that day and said fuck it and went for it anyway with no warning

im not saying the guy was nice about it or that it isnt a natural thing for some women but if you realize you arent smelling great what the hell is wrong with you that youre going to let someone else put their face in that without warning or even a shower  after a 3 hour drive and full day 
have some basic respect for them 
even just a im just coming off my period lets save oral for another time wouldve sufficed here

that plus unloading on him that after one meeting she had feelings for him probably was enough for him to part ways before getting more invested in a situation with obvious incompatibilities
haha im tempted to do the same i have all the materials to do it right now but havent touched my cricut in ages because im too exhausted and dead to craft most of the time

i guess theres no better time than now
thats definitely what it is a lot of the time especially with people who dont have any tattoos or arent heavily tattooed themselves and while i get it its also so frickin boring and lazy and it seems like no matter how respectfully i try to shift the topic or give the vibe that im not really excited to talk about it people just dont give up and keep going on about it 

feeling like google for peoples every question about tattoos  how much did it costhurthow many do you havewhats the worst spothow much do they typically chargewhat do you think of this ideawhat is the story behind every single oneblah blah blah  has gotten so so old after decades of wearing these tattoos

x200b

i definitely was like that at first too  the first few pieces i got i felt they needed to have a story behind them and have a deep personal meaning but after that i found myself preferring to get tattoos just for the sake of the artbecause i liked them and the way they lookedetc 

its really obnoxious when people without many tattoos or who dont have any at all keep asking about the story behind my pieces 

what do you mean they dont mean anything isnt the point of tattoos to have a story behind them there has to be a story behind them 

groan
dont shit where you eat is a saying for a reason 

mightve turned into a hot thing for you once mightve been an impulsive and dumb drunk night for them but trying to make this a regular occurrence is only going to add drama weirdness and a whole bunch of extra shit  extra shit that it already appears your roommate and his fling are too young stupid and immature to handle respectfully and responsibly
you dont want to add all those elements which have high potential to go south real fast and get really negative to your living situation 
im glad you ended up enjoying it but this was absolutely disgusting to do  without prior consent  on their part and shows a lack of maturity and sexual maturityresponsibility all around 

best to keep your roommate situation sex free youre young it may sound fun but you do not want to deal with how uncomfortable and problematic your home life canwill become ifwhen things arent so cool anymore
portland oregon  a heavily tattooed city in general and its still constant
thank you so much ill check these out really appreciate all the info 
yep you nailed it 

if i could go back in time id never get a single visible tattoo 

im so fucking sick of being asked about them im so fucking sick of people pointing them out sick of them being the first thing anyone sees when they look at me sick of the assumptions people make about methembecause of them sick of people expecting me to be a tattoo faq pageendless google search bar at the drop of a hat sick of people using them to flirt make jokespuns think they know something about me etc 

leave me the fuck alone about them  and in general thanks 

im sure a facial scar  or visible scarring in general  is the same way 
youd hope people would have more grace about scarring than tattoos given the nature but after decades of wearing tattoos around i doubt it people are straight up dumb as bricks about this kind of stuff and really have no sense of boundaries the worst 

that said i think ops scar is striking and doesnt take away from his face at all i totally respect wanting to cover it up but i hope he doesnt feel self conscious about it
unrelated to the op but do you have a uv eyeliner recommendation by chance i keep meaning to find some
yep not a lot of room for anything that isnt echoing the delusional levels of positive ignorant to all problems this is fine outlook here sadly

im not saying we had better choices  kotek was one of three equally terrible options and we really should all be feeling pretty devastated by all three options laid out in front of us we really werent given any suitable choice here

whether you think kotek was the better of the three or not shes what were getting but if you think for a second that shes going to enact any meaningful change youve completely ignored her history and are choosing to be ignorant to the way things are at this point

people werent frustrated with having to vote for her  or choosing to vote against their own party to vote against her out of exhaustion with the current state of things  because she was a promising candidate with real viable plans to fix this homeless crisis  and crime crisis and filth crisis and drug crisis

expect more of the same thats quite literally what was voted in whether thats better than the alternatives or not thats what it is plain and simple

i am definitely pretty perplexed and fascinated by triptan medications myself its pretty crazy how well they work  when they work  at zapping migraines and headaches away so incredibly quickly but they come with some very strange side effects too which is odd
dont get your hopes up she barely wormed in her homeless plans to get herself in the seat but i can all but guarantee well see next to no change if any at all during her time 

not that the other candidates were good either  we were given 3 frankly horrible choices all around  but anyone expecting kotek to do anything of value regarding the homeless is kidding themselves
i have taken stimulant medication for well over two decades  for narcolepsy  so i know what a substance comedown feeling is ive taken opiate pain medication for various conditions and surgeries over the years for shorter  stints in the past as well as highly addictive sleep aides and antianxiety medications as well this is not that

x200b

it is an instant feeling of physical woe that begins very immediately after taking the medication fortunately the relief from a migrainecluster headache if it is going to come is very quick also  sometimes 510 minutes later but again sometimes it doesnt work at all  


if you read up on triptan medications this is not uncommon especially with sumatriptan people report feeling a general sense of malaise directly after taking the medicine that can sometimes last an entire day   
i immediately feel extremely hot and feverish my face  and seemingly the rest of my body  gets flush and i feel a great deal of tension in my face and head almost like everything is tightening dramatically in a very painful way from there its a full body sense of discomfort coupled with a lot of weird and random painful feelings  but its hard to pinpoint what exactly is hurting or put words to exactly how its hurting just that it is   
its unlike anything ive ever experienced its such a bizarre feeling of sick but not in the way a comedown feels
thank you for your kindness 3
thank you 3
thank you 3
unfortunately no he did not both he and my mother were on medicaid and extra expenses like life insurance were out of the question of affordability he worked as a barber so was selfemployed and thus there were no workrelated benefits the pandemic obviously hit his industry incredibly hard which brought them further into poverty than ever before

thank you for your kind words and empathy  i sincerely appreciate that
trying my best to hang in there thank you 3
it definitely killed all the faith i had left in this society to say the least
for me they were all tied into one

if you have the money to go gamble especially during the pandemic you have the money to be responsible for your debts before youre literally sued over them and having your paychecks garnished 


theres a difference between reasoning and plans for your credit card debt so dealing with it slowly and letting it get to the point of collections and garnishments 


the latter reeks of shadiness lack of give a fuck about ones actions and responsibilities and is pretty disgusting from someone in her position 


ive been poor all my life and sadly always will be short of a miracle i understand debt but letting it get to the point she did whilst in office out gambling and treating lesser workers like shit what a disgusting person 


if the casino thing hadnt happened id have still found her insanely irresponsible and gross over the credit card situation so it was on brand for her and that all ties together
yep its disgusting

step father shot himself in front of my mom this year in their shared home the cleaning crew alone wouldve bankrupted her  or me  so i had to try clean the gruesome scene up myself with basic household products alone while she fell apart in the hospital waiting for the donor team to harvest his organs 

ill never forget it its indescribable having to mop up someones insides with your bare hands 

then came the other costs for her and for me the medical bills having to live in a hotel while trying to move therapy medications missed work trying to stay afloat debts etc etc the list never ends 


shit when my cat who i loved more than anything on earth and who i had trained to help me manage some of my disability symptoms was mauled to death by a horrible neighbor and her awful dog who fled the scene  he was indoor only and bolted out the door as i came in when startled by a truck backfiring on the street  the bills were so far beyond what i ever couldve expected im barely surviving right now as if i had any room to breathe after my stepfather passing the death of a pet was so expensive it has nearly put me in the ground 

its insane of all the things that shouldnt be a financial burden death is surely one of them as if loss isnt hard enough for those left behind


as if living isnt hard enough as it is
ill add another comment though it looks like more than enough have responded

i have kaiser through ohp which surely changes some things a bit but i see all the same providers a nonohp person would


their dental is fine nothing fantastic nothing too bad  it seems like most dentistry in this city is a joke to some extent and im getting a lower standard of care being on ohp anyway so given those factors it is sufficient

primary care is hit and miss ive had some great providers and some awful ones the upside is there are tons of providers with locations all over the place so youre likely to find someone you like  even if it takes a few tries  and appointments are usually plentiful 

their sleep lab and sleep doctors are fucking awful and a complete joke

that said their pharmacy has been great and stress free i get everything mailed free  including controlled substance medication  and everything is always on time or early even during periods of shortages of some meds theyve found a way to fill mine  be that working with me on switching manufacturers and switching pill counts filling elsewhere etc 
if you ever take a controlled substance medication youll know how important and how much of a godsend not having to do monthly uas and then having run all over town trying to fill the damn thing is 

when needing to see a specialist its also hit and miss sometimes awesome because theyre in the same complex readily available and its easy to hit multiple stops in one visit
sometimes hellish because appointments are scarce and booked 6 months out
really depends on the department

i will say my experience with other large medical groups in town has been worse on the pharmacy end about the same or worse on everything else so 
do you not experience sleep paralysis a common symptom for most narcoleptics 
yeah ill continue to use paralysis to describe sleep paralysis
honestly with or without holding it against her shes in self preservation mode and theres probably a big sunken cost aspect of it too 

she doesnt want to be homeless again she hasnt even been working lately shes already invested this much time energy and emotion into the relationship and has humiliated herself on a wildly popular reality tv show for quite a while 
leaving ed would mean departing from tlc having to go back to work and make enough to sustain herself and her lifestyle transition and shed likely end up back in her car for a while in the process 
even if shes done and wants to leave him she probably feels like she needs to at least see it through until the point at which she can take something with her when she goes so it wasnt all for nothing
eh i think that only really applies so much 

unfortunately in a micropenis  or close to it  situation it absolutely will matter quite a bit to quite a lot of people there will be partners who are fine with it or dont care but they will be much harder to find and it will absolutely limit the dating pool substantially for those men 

dick jokes and insults are cruel and unkind  its not something a man has any control over i do agree with you there
100 

your friend doesnt need sex right now she needs therapy 
how soon sex will be practical and healing after something like this will vary from person to person but if she hasnt gotten professional help with the trauma and processing side of things the answer is not yet 

i wouldnt get involved in this process if you want to keep her as a friend and have this go smoothly until at minimum there is a professional involved in therapy with her
a budget would be very helpful for both software and machines 

hatch is a great program but its also 1000 this isnt practical for everyone especially people who are mostly hobbyists

machines can start at 450ish for something that does embroidery and can go into the 6000 range for a multi needle more capable machine
wow clay amazing super well done  i definitely wouldve guessed 3d printed clay mustve taken a ton of time and effort thanks for sharing 
thank you 

his response to my comment told me everything i need to know about him frankly impossible to miss the real meaning behind that jab
i didnt really have time to think about it unfortunately 

my best bud was mauled to death by a shitty pit bull it was a completely unexpected loss  he was indoor only and bolted out the door when startled as my partner came in  so we didnt have time to think about final arrangements we had to do something with him 

i havent regretted cremation though we rent so burial never crossed my mind  and even if we owned id be worried about moving someday as id feel devastated to leave him behind 
we have a shelf set up in our kitchen above where he used to eat and decorated it with photos of him the paw prints and fur clippings they took at the cremation facility and his urn 
it feels good to have a memorial for him in our home and the peace of mind of knowing he will be able to move with us wherever life takes us is priceless 
plus hes inside with us where he always was  not outside under a bush something about that just feels right to me this is his home and hes here
im not sure what youre getting at exactly 

people use the term exotic dancer to mean stripper in the us 

people could also say erotic dancer and it would be correct but i dont think thats used nearly as much  or at least i havent seen it often at all exotic is definitely the term used and it definitely is used to describe a stripper not a person of a minority groupwho is otherwise foreign
what a unique and incredibly touching compliment wow your comment is just so wonderfully kind you seriously warmed my heart thank you so much 

i can definitely be an asshole and a cynic  probably too much of the time admittedly  sometimes on the internet but i try to be as genuinely kind and caring as i can when i can too im glad that side of me translates here and thank you for the reminder to choose to be that way more  
you rock please continue being you too
oh no overly salty is literally the worst i am so glad both the op and your comment saved me the cost and hassle

when you dont get to treat yourself often theres nothing worse than the food being literally repulsive and you feeling like youve somehow left yourself in a treat deficit as a result nope nope nope
thank you so much for sharing your thoughts on all the close by spots weve lived in this rental for two years and have only been to pizza roma  went once with my partners mom earlier last year as they have a huge patio and it seemed like a safe spot to eat outdoors when she was worried about covidtraveling  so ive been curious about the other places close by

for the most part it seems like everything in the immediate vicinity  aside from super torta which ive been told countless times to avoid  is probably pretty good but definitely a bit pricy not that we dont venture outside of the neighborhood but were on such a tight budget as it is and go out to eat so infrequently if there isnt something outstanding close by to support might as well stay in
im gonna be honest i have always assumed ottos is just a meat market and doesnt sell hot food so havent even had it on my radar as a place to potentially check out

thank you for the rundown on some of the other spots around 

we are such rare dineouters that weve not really ventured to any of the close by spots despite living in this rental for 2 years now but ive definitely been curious about our options should we decide to treat ourselves

the noodle place seems decent but their menu looked a bit pricy im a huge fan of thai so im stoked to hear theres potentially a good spot close by
oh no im so sorry for your experience that sounds truly terrible

i have friends who swear by that place and im way too broke to care about going out to eat these days but was considering giving them a shot for a splurge after a big surgery i have coming up since theyre cheap and i absolutely love and constantly crave  smash burgers definitely will avoid this place now
thank you for the reviews

we dont get out to eat much maybe a couple times a year if that so havent really been anywhere in the neighborhood despite living in this rental for 2 years  and always in inner se through different apartments just different chunks  and i felt a bit lost this week trying to come up with recommendations while we both had family in town

i still have yet to try super deluxe even  people wont stop recommending it because of my affinity for in n out  but dicks is literally 10ish blocks from me so ive been curious whether its worth the venturecost eventually or not 

sounds like it wouldnt hurt to give it a chance worst case we tried something new best case we find a new favorite
and yet their ask is for wfh jobs specifically


not even factoring in the multitude of reasons why joining the military isnt a job recommendation to be taken lightly
real men has nothing to do with this at all 

you can respect sex work as work and have no problem with sex workers and still not want a relationship with someone in that line of workwho is a stripper 
just like you can respect someone who bartends but not want to be in a relationship with someone who works until 4am around alcohol and drunk people every night 
or not want to date someone who is a traveling truck driver and is away for long lengths of time 

people are allowed to have preferences boundaries and dealbreakers 

stripping comes with its own baggage risks and problems people who dance deserve respect and love but they will not be the right partner for everyone for a multitude of reasons including crazy hours risky environmentsclients etc 

and thats perfectly fine it doesnt make someone not a real man for having different values boundaries or wants in a partnerrelationship
i promise you exotic dancer never refers to a person who is part of a minority group and also dances in a nonsexual way at least in the states 
its nearly always referring to a stripper or otherwise sexual erotic dancer
wasnt aware the military was wfh
what a gem you are 

absolutely disgusting
he doesnt owe you shit 

if you cant even muster up the nerve to ask the man to do it in the first place nonetheless ask him why he hasnt how the hell does he owe you anything

is he supposed to be able to read your mind do you expect him to just out of the blue sense that you want this owed explanation and provide it in a satisfactory way 

part of being an adult in a sexual relationship is acting like an adult and communicating your needs wants questions concerns etc in a relationship 

no one is owed anything if you want something use your words if youre confused about something buck up and clarify 

if youre comfortable enough to fuck the man youre comfortable enough to ask him some basic questions about a very basic sex act
youll also feel better about yourself  speak for yourself buddy 

people who are truly disabled and truly cant work sure the fuck wont feel better about themselves trying to force themselves to handle the demeaning shitshow that 90 of jobs available are 
quite frankly there is nothing that feels worse to some of us than trying to manage working while disabled 
regardless of how pathetic and harmful the ssissdi systembenefits are for some its the only thing that gives any semblance of decent quality of life back to disabled folks
no problem 

best of luck making the switch cats can be really picky but eventually theyll take to it if you keep consistent  theres some great tips online for gradually switching over that i highly recommend versus just thrusting them right into it
ive been to a bunch of banfield locations and theyve all been absolutely shit 
literally the mcdonalds of vet care wouldnt take my cats there even in a dire emergency at this point
i live close by and ive been wondering about that place we never go out to eat but i always wonder what in the neighborhood is worth it on the off chance we can afford a treat out or have family in town or something 
sounds like this place is nothing special  and im always happy to skip something overpriced
our street is pretty dark  desperately needs a fucking street light but apparently thats never going to happen  so i didnt think wed have anyone down our block but my partner put an honor system bowl out anyway 
i was surprised we had a solid 1012 folks come by  doorbell camera so i was able to actually count
were directly connected to woodstock proper lower 60s 
kids looked cold and bundled uplots of umbrellas 
im not a big kids person but i was glad we put a bowl out so much of our neighborhood was lights offno decor and it was probably slim pickings out there for em
right

none of us have to agree with her share her insecurities or understand everything shes thinking but the bottom line is shes entitled to her own boundaries and feelings on the matter
just like some people have a boundary that stripe clubs arent okay or interacting with cam girlsonlyfans girls is unacceptable or whatever else having a boundary about not wanting a partner who films pornographic or overtly sexual nude content is okay 
op doesnt have to agree with or follow the boundary but his partner is well within her rights to leave the relationship if hes unwilling to accept her boundaries

while this wouldnt be a hard dealbreaker for me i wouldnt really want to continue down the path of a long term relationship with someone who will be spending months if not years filming pornographic material for a living
it doesnt really remain on top of the litter because they absolutely still dig and bury the poops i would say they dont dig it as deep in  you dont have to go hunting for it especially if you keep up on scooping  but it will get slightly coated in the pellets which is great because that keeps the smell nonexistent 
the urine doesnt stick to the pellets and doesnt clump in the box and simply drains down into the tray below  since it isnt collecting in the box you have a solid layer of pellets on the bottom and then id explain it as the top layer being where the poop is with a solid layer of pellets surrounding it ive never just had exposed poop on the top in the box its always at minimum coated in a good amount of pellets  they do stick to the poop  as they definitely still kick the pellets at it or bury it with small swipes of litter immediately after going 
ive also noticed that with the pellet system cats seem less interested in digging around in the box or kicking up litter everywhere they go do a little of that backwardskick covering thing or swipe a little on top and then get out and on with their day its all business all the time if theyre in there never any playing around or making a mess
the breeze system is the only thing ill use ever

ive had cats my entire life  since childhood  and god everything else is just disgusting and fails in comparison once you know how it can be you cant go back 

i swear i havent smelled the box once since i started using the system  and ive used it with 3 different cats now first time with my solo cat and then now with my two 65 month old kittens who share a box  even when ive accidentally let it go a few extra days
litter pellets never leave the box and the pad makes cleaning it so easy and so much less grossmessy 
absolutely love it

ive seen cheap knockoff versions and they werent anywhere near as good other kinds of pellets ive seen  my mom tried many  smelled absolutely horrible after a day or two or were a disastrous mess to clean 

breeze system is the way i know i probably sound silly getting this hyped over a cat box but when it works it works

i wouldnt call stuffing your basic humans needs down so far that you eventually turn ll  and are kept ok  with the aid of ssris no less evolving  it would seem youve devolved into being able to tolerate the situation youre in since youve chosen to stay the course but i wouldnt elevate that to evolving at all 

im glad youve found your peace with things and have found happiness with your family but i really hate seeing these kind of one sided compromises branded as evolving when they most certainly are not
i had a black version of this as a kid it was black and white and was a big pull over poncho type thing i wish i wouldve kept it into adulthood just for the sake of having 
what an awesome creation
ujusttrying2makeit

enough this isnt the place to discuss your hypothetical angsty legal threats and the discussion about your supposed previous legal ventures are offtopic and not welcome here

threatening other users is also clearly unacceptable consider this a warning before a temporary ban
i mean the failure of drug decriminalization certainly didnt help and is creating a ton of additional problems here as well as barriers to attempting any kind of solutions

and again so fucking what so what if its happening in cities outside of oregon again this does nothing productive for our problems here and is counterproductive to any meaningful conversation on the subject of our problems here
its counterproductive to any worthwhile meaningful conversation about what is happening here or acknowledging that portland has very real very big problems that very much need change

so fucking what if its happening everywhere  it isnt by the way happening everywhere

the important point is that its happening here and nothing is being done about it  or at least nothing substantial thats proving to be causing any real change

its okay to admit that shit is bad here and to focus just on the problems here shifting focus elsewhere does just that and theres been more than enough of that over the years frankly
thank you

i came to the comments to say similar 

i dont give a flying fuck about your stats  i know what my day to day life here is really like and the experiences of close friends and family   
we may not have been murdered and we may be unlikely to actually be killed on the street but that doesnt excuse the very real very constant dangers occurring all around us at all times

call these stats whatever you want spin them however you want to push your view or angle but to act like anything in this post proves anything of value is just silly  
these stats dont cancel out all the very fucked up shit all around us happening at an alarmingly high rate it doesnt negate the very real very constant crimes all over the city 

and for fucks sake can we stop pretending like portland doesnt have a lot of fucking problems already  
i get it its not fun to talk about it isnt fun to acknowledge that all this bad stuff is going on   
but pretending it isnt acting like it isnt that bad or shrugging it off with a careless its happening everywhere isnt doing anything good for us its counterproductive in fact 

there are very real very bad crimes happening here all the time at a much higher rate than before with a lot more enabling than before with a lot more slaps on the wrist than before

hard to add data to statistics when things arent being called in when cops arent showing uptaking reportsable to do anything when people arent actually receiving consequences or ending up in jail etc

i can tell you that assaults  violent and sexual  theft break ins stabbings shootings arson vandalism car theft other forms of property crime etc are all very much happening here afuckinglot  
i dont give a fuck what some soapboxing holierthanthou redditor wants to spin it as shit here is not good and im tired of it i dont feel safe from a lot of things here and rightfully so i may not be that worried about being murdered but i shouldnt have so damn many menaced by violently assaulted by robbed by chased by etc stories from homelessdrug addicts in this city  nor should my friends and family

i dont think homicides is a great singular metric for danger at all a city can be dangerous miserable filthy unpleasant unsafe and falling apartbeing destroyed with a below average homicide rate just look around were in one
this person is infuriating holy dang felt like i was beating my head against a wall just reading their responses id stop responding to this one nothing of intelligence to be gained 
right 

like the drazen is a good politician but a terrible liar  am i supposed to want to vote for kotek based on that sentence why 
seems like kotek doesnt even know how to have a functional positive narrative in her own ad campaign doesnt exactly give me faith in her abilities as a politician 

if all you have to say in your ads  which should be an attempt to gain voter interest in checking you out at minimum  is ridiculous smear campaign accusations and finger pointing with little to nothing about what youre proposing to do when elected i for one am not interested in voting for you
right it doesnt matter how long i nap theyre completely useless  i never feel any better and i certainly dont ever feel refreshed or freshened up or in any way rested

and how the fuck is a narcoleptic supposed to control how long a nap goes for if i had that ability i wouldnt be half as crippled by this shitty disease i have zero control over how long i will sleep for once i attempt to sleep  no amount of alarms other people or willpower will change that i turn alarms off in my sleep hours before they even go off fucks sake

and yes this is medicated or unmedicated eyeroll 

doctors never get it i cant believe how awful the standard of care for narcolepsy is
well honestly judging by the fact that 110  and so many other dumb taxes measures etc  passed it appears we  well not me specifically i absolutely knew it was a horrible idea and voted against it  very much are a bunch of idiots who dont understand the difference between a cool idea and something that is actually workable
also no one gets paid enough to have to watch that shit on the job on their security footage 


part of having risky publicoutdoor sex is being mature enough not to force your sexual behaviors onto other people 
no one is consenting to watching you having to hear you or deal with your shit and a mature respectful adult realizes this accepts that the world is not their fuckpad and does everything they can to ensure no one will have to witness their sexual escapades 
be a mature adult please 


there are various chargesfines you could catch if caught as well especially in places where a child may be aroundwitness 

theres nothing wrong with outdoorpublic sex  ive done it myself  but being freaky doesnt excuse you from basic respectfulness  to others and public places  and basic responsibility 
if she argues it kills the fun to have to do so much planning or do it safely then shes not mature enough to be engaging in a kinky adult sexual relationship  and is an asshole frankly 

be smart be respectful and have fun
hes stealing from his entire family and selling it to get shit he wants that he doesnt need 

when you live with your parents free of charge and choose to steal from the household isolate in your room and do nothing but smoke weed all day you understandably lose the kind of respect and privacy rights a responsible adult would normally have 

crossdressing  or whatever he is doing with the lingerie  isnt the problem here op made that clear as well youve just chosen to ignore it the problem is that hes a thief and that he violated his sister by going through her things and stealing it 

if he doesnt want his mother checking up on him and his things he can stop rooting through everyone elses belongings and taking them as he sees fit 
or he can get his shit together and work on moving out or seeking self sufficiency so he can better provide for himself and get the things he wants 
he can speak with his parents about wanting to find a way to earn some cash to purchase nonnecessity items 
at no point is it okay or understandable for him to steal from his family just because he wants something 

he is living there free of charge whilst stealing from the home most parentspeople cohabitating would be doing what the mom and sister are doing to try to get their things back keep a watch on the problem etc
frankly id have kicked his ass out personally
this is how it feels for me too  if im understanding your description properly 

my body is in sleep mode but i can still think im having thoughts and internal dialogue and i can hear shit going on around me but im also experiencing a dream simultaneously
sumatriptan makes me feel the strangest kind of horrible theres something just really awful about it my entire head face chest and body feel wrong and fucking bad but i cant quite describe the sensation 
sometimes i kills a migraine or cluster headache but just as often it does nothing and leaves me feeling fucking horrendous instead
ive always been curious what exactly its doing that causes these feelings but im sure ill never get an answer
we  two adults two kittens  rent a 3 bedroom two story townhouse 
we have our bedroom the office room  my desktop cricut embroidery machine craft supplies and organized storage bins of stuff like seasonalholiday items off season clothes keepsakes etc  and the music room  which is where my musician partner has his recording gear instruments etc 


if anything wed opt for a fourth room if we were ever fortunate enough to afford buying a house in order to have a small modest guest room that could double as storage extra cat play zone other activitycrafting space when we dont have guests 


you know what is right for you sounds like you have just the perfect amount of space for your needs
having an extra room for guestsfuture needs is ideal id say  we hate kids so wouldnt be planning it for that potential purpose but thats a bonus for some people  and keeps you from feeling too cramped when visitors happen
plus if you end up wanting a second office space or more room for a hobby or craft or need some extra storage there you go
yep its all about what youre eating during your window

if you tend to reach for high calorie junky foods and tend to have a mini binge during your window youre absolutely going to go over most if not every time and youll be continuously disappointed by the scale during your omad ventures 

having an idea of the general range of calories of your commonly eaten foods and being cautious about serving sizes will definitely help even if you arent weighting foods and calorie counting strictly
i wouldnt doubt she lied about it bitch is disgusting and will do anything to keep the spotlight anywhere near her and to stay relevant enough to remain a feature of the 90d franchise 
i dont believe a word she says about syngin or anyone or anything  and neither should anyone else 
if the alleged abuse doesnt stop you from clout chasing bullshit like this it wasnt abuse and it certainly isnt relevant 

at least she isnt fucking her sister in this one i guess not that we wont see that repeat in the future probably

your second paragraph is an excellent point 

i havent take the max since 2019 and theres no way in hell youd catch me on it or a bus now granted due to disabilities neither is an option for me anymore for a variety of reasons but even if they were 


i was hassled attacked threatened and screamed at enough on both during prepandemic years now if the behaviors the unhinged display on the street are any indication of what i can expect in an enclosed space fuck no
they seem to be doing this kind of thing at a lot of their locations and i agree  its so unpleasant and adds such additional hassle that it completely puts me off shopping there

the mall 205 target had damn near everything in the electronics department not just wrapped in an alarm device but physically chained to the shelves in addition to that 
of course not a single employee to be found anywhere and after walking the entire top floor and finally finding someone  who upon asking had no idea if id ever be helped i think they all left 10 minutes ago or uh someone should be out in 5 minutes yeah i dunno  i ended up standing there for 10 more minutes only to have someone finally come out and act like i was ruining their entire life asking to have the item removed from its shackles so i could purchase it 
if it hadnt have been a necessity i needed quickly i wouldve bailed on the entire experience but surely wont be doing so again its a shame this is what things have come to with all the unmanaged theft in this city

wouldnt be surprised if plexiglass barriers in fast foodpizza places started becoming the norm too like in other places ive lived
ive been looking into the ricoma leasing program youre referencing for similar reasons  135 a month seems like an excellent deal when you consider youre getting a multineedle machine plus the digitizing side of things there arent exactly a plethora of companies out there offering a bundle like that and it makes it a lot more reasonable and accessible for those of us who dont have the privilege of thousands of dollars up front to throw into a pro machine and digitizing software

i think something big to consider is what your goals are and whether or not signing onto something like this is going to be the best route to achieving them while also being a sound idea financially

if you are just looking for a minor side hustle or to practice and maintain a mostly hobbyist level i dont know that this would be the route to gogetting a hobby machine and a mediumtier digitizing software and starting to devote time and energy to practicing with that while maybe selling some custom things as you improve but keeping things on a small scale would definitely be more advisable if youre not trying to start a business or really invest the kind of time money and energy that starting down the path of leasing a big machine like this would warrant

if you think youre ready to devote that time money and energy into really going full force ahead with machine embroidery and you see yourself really working at developing a brand or a shopbusiness then by all means this isnt a bad route to start investigating further and potentially moving forward with

the easier to uselearn programs like hatch are a solid 1000 right off the bat and thats without a decent machine hobbyist machines really arent practical for anything more than very small scale etsy shops with very low sales volume and if you already know you want to move forward on a larger scale it might make more sense to invest that money into a leased multineedle machinepricier digitizing software so you can really dive in big right at the start

this kind of thing also has a lot to do with your personal financesfinancial ability clearly 135 a month isnt out of the question for you since youre here asking but you have to also factor in materials utility cost and the cost of the time youd need to put in to see that money being worth investing if you have a full time job already for example and dont often have an abundance of free time you will have to work a lot harder to make up for that 135 plus materialsother costs than someone who pursues this as a full time selfemployed path

all of the above points are of course assuming youre even looking to get into selling your designscustom things and arent just primarily doing this for yourselffriendsfamilyvery small scale if you dont have any interest on generating income from machine embroidery  however big or small those income goals would be  then all it really comes down to is whether or not 135 a month  before materialsutilities  for a personal hobbyinterest is practical and worth it to you

i cant personally speak to the quality of a ricoma machine i have used their software to digitize a couple times  was lucky enough to have a friend with the software and tried it a few times at their home  and i loved it personally i have used about 5 30 day trials of hatch and produced hundreds of designs in those trial periods and i can say that i absolutely liked ricomas software better and found it much nicer to use with a lot better design results for a lot less effort i am by no means an expert digitizer so found it really easy to understand and learn as someone with an intermediate level of digitizing knowledgeskill

i have watched a ton of videos about their machines on youtube and while its obvious there are a lot of paid reviewers pumping up the companymachines with positive reviews i can also see from these videos that the machines do a perfectly fine good job of stitching out designs the machines do produce quality outcomes and thats whats important to me

are they the best company around with the best machines no probably notare there issues with the company reps and machines i have no doubtsbut as someone who otherwise would not be able to afford to have access to a multineedle machine and nice digitizing software and begin to really get more serious with machine embroidery i think that their program has a lot of benefits and would be perfectly suitable for my needs and for producing the kinds of things i want to createwhereas my hobbyist level brother machine certainly cannot

a lot of people come to threads like this one and go its a rip off and look for a used  higher end brand or finance  or save up for   
that is not a possibility for everyone and for those of us that lack the financial privilege some of these commenters have the ricoma plan is a potentially beneficial option to have access to a better machine software and to be able to advance with machine embroidery and other personal goals only you will know what youre able to do and what is feasible for you and its important to do what you need to for yourself that is within you ability and affordable to you even if it isnt the best machine on earth if its a stepping stone to advancing having more resources to later upgrade etc id say its worth it

their reps have been great to talk to so far and while im unsure if i will take the plunge it has certainly not been a waste of time to look into

best of luck with whatever you decide and wherever your machine embroidery path takes you
im probably missing something obvious or misunderstanding what youre referring to specifically but what does propranolol have in common with stimulants here forgive me if im connecting your comment to the wrong one by mistake on mobile it appears your response is in reply to depends on how much of the stimulants their surgical partners prescribe them they took
the refusal to take side effects seriously or acknowledge that they may outweigh benefits is pretty baffling 


when i was requesting medication to help with fallingstaying asleep after an extremely traumatic event  had to clean up my stepfathers gruesome suicide aftermath solo bare hands and watch my mom care for his living corpse on machines for a week for organ harvesting with a pretty poorly covered head wound  i made it very clear that though i was experiencing ptsd  and anxietypanic related to that though almost entirely at bedtimeovernight  i was not interested in antidepressants and only wanted a temporary sleep aide 



i had multiple primary care doctors try to push them anyway trying to convince me that i must be anxiousdepressed all the time and not just at night or that my problems could only be solved with ssris not a sleeprelated medication 


i explained my disinterest and cited the extremely common and awful side effects as one of many reasons and got some of the most ridiculous responses 


well if you care about your wellbeing badly enough dealing with  is a pretty manageable trade off to not be crippled by anxietydepression anymore


i literally said i am unwilling to risk for example destroying my sex life sexual enjoyment and sexual drive for a medication


well when youre really suffering sex is usually not really important in comparison to fixing the issue  are you kidding me sure let me destroy my sex life with my partner and zap all physical enjoyment and pleasure out of my life that wont have immeasurable consequences in my relationship or cause me more depression
this is the only explanation needed frankly 


it doesnt matter whatwho you arent attracted to that cant be helped no one should be trying to persuade you or change your mind  you like what you like and for the most part those things arent changeablea conscious choice 


what matters is if it stays a personal preference or if it becomes a personal belief that youre trying to put on others or use to demean others 


like you said  im personally not attracted to  is fine
developing that into all  are unattractive crossed the line 


i feel like the openness behind it comes into play too 


for instance thinkingsaying im personally not attracted to black women but if i did meet one and found myself drawn to her attracted to her and wanting to date her that wouldnt be a problem for me though it hasnt happened up to this point 

vs


 i dont find black women attractive and would absolutely not date one for any reason regardless of who they are im confident i will never find a single attractive one out there
exactly how it should be 


were all adults here lets act like it 


clearly your child is having intimate relations with their romantic relationship partner 
you dont have to share sex stories and get raunchy with them  nor they with you  but parents who act offended or disgusted or possessive over their adult child having sex are juvenile and frankly pathetic 



my partners parents are the perfect balance in this area it was never even a question of if i would be sleeping in the same roombed as him when we have visited them it was a given no we arent married for context 
theyve never made any uncomfortable comments or questioned us about anything sexualour sex lives but on the infrequent occasion a sexual story or joke comes up  or some form of media leans sexual  we all chuckle maybe drop a goofy one liner or joke of our own and move on 


there is a clear but unspoken were the parents there is a level of appropriateness vibe to things but its never stiff strict or overreaching and we both feel respected as adults in an adult relationship there isnt a vibe of infantilizing him me our relationship or what happens between adults who are partnered and i really appreciate that


it boggles my mind when ive read posts about couples being forced to sleep in separate roomsone on the couch one in the guest bed when visiting parents 
unless your kid  or their partner  are completely out of control and disrespect the situation by having crazy loud sex when visiting its insanely disrespectful to undermine your childs relationship like that 


if you cant wrap your mind around  and respect  your kid having sex as an adult you shouldnt be a parent first off 


the scenario in op might be a little uncomfy depending on how well the partner knows the parents and the personal sense of humor of all involved but shouldnt require more than a chuckle and moving on
ill second this and add  denying children forced into mental holds or troubled youth boarding facilities the right to call parentsdirect familyanyone while inside 


allows for absolutely unhinged levels of abuse and mistreatment that go completely unreported and unchecked all while the facilities feed parents lines about how anything the kids say regarding mistreatment is a lie meant to manipulate them into bringing them home
this kind of shit is horrific but no one talks about it you think care facilities for adults are bad these are another level entirely
god what an exhaustingly miserable and frustrating person you are
what a useful respectful necessary comment well done 
wow thats in amazing condition absolutely no way at that price but how gorgeous so well kept
dont want to be a debbie downer by any means but this is sadly not always the case 

doordash almost never refundsreplaced the order for the customer when something gets fucked upnever arrives theyre absolutely the worst about this of all the delivery companies ive ever used 

grubhub and ubereats might make it right for the customer if they feel so inclined but also are likely to tell you to get fucked especially if youve had an order messed up with them before  which unfortunately isnt an uncommon occurrence it seems 

im glad op had a come up like this and they absolutely shouldnt ever feel bad  its not like they hid it from the person looking for it this was 100 a good omen for them  just dont want to give these companies more credit than they deserve because they fuck over their customers so often and for people who dont have money to throw away it stings
this is wildly dependent on where you live in portland what your needs are what your schedule is like etc 

the blanket no one needs one here statement couldnt be more wrong
do you ever get tired of being so incredibly wrong and so incredibly predictable or is my assessment that you have nothing of value going on in your life and you feed off your own toxicity and downvotes accurate 

anyway enjoy your weekend bud not going to feed the troll any longer
i never said that and you damn well know it its clear all you exist to do on this subreddit is argue and twist words

regardless you know i never said that 

im all for sanctioned camps im not in support of putting people who actually pay for their housing and are just trying to get by in this filthy city through more hell by shoving them into neighborhoods or areas mostly populated by housing
industrial areasother spaces not directly in neighborhoods do exist believe it or not put them there 
weve had enough of them in our neighborhoods we dont need to sanction an entire shanty town tent village for them near more of them
the only alternative to i dont want these criminal violent unhinged zombies living directly near my house in chaotic filthy hazardous camps isnt well we just wont have them at all then 

believe it or not industrial areas exist as do other areas outside of fucking neighbors and dense housing sections of our city 

they can easily opt to put this shit somewhere like that instead of putting those of us who actually pay for our housing and would like to maintain some semblance of livability at it through more hell
look i get it  these types of things have to go somewhere obviously 



but calling people nimbys simply because they dont want the place they live to be infested with criminal drug addicts that assault harass threaten burglarize and attack whoever they can while destroying and littering every square inch available to them  often with human feces and hazardous used drug paraphernalia  leaving filth causing rat infestations and even causing out of control fires  which have literally burned peoples homes as a result  is a bit ridiculous



its understandable why no one wants these types of safe rest villages or camping compounds in their fucking neighborhoods 
people whove dealt with these types around the city have already had enough of the deplorable behavior they exhibit and the disgusting conditions they leave spaces in 



im absolutely not sorry to be one of many voices to say you know what i pay too damn much in rent for my overpriced already unsafe place to live to want a literal shanty town of authorized campers  and with them unending chaos  to move in anywhere close to my domicile 



i have been stolen from assaulted harassed chased threatened flashed etc fucking enough in this city by our tent camping community members
hell some asshole with a nail bat threatened me at my neighborhood plaid two weeks ago 
if not wanting to welcome a compound of them into my immediate blocks makes me a nimby what the fuck ever 


again yes i get it they have to go somewhere 
but im also in the camp that feels there has to be a place to put them that doesnt punish the housed community more than the lack of action on this already has year after year if that means placing these in industrial districts or away from areas with mostly housingneighborhoods i am all for that personally
thank you so much you absolutely rock  i look forward to trying to stitch the design out myself if you still feel like sharing whenever youre back 

it looks seriously great thanks for sharing
thank you so much for the information really appreciate those tips  and hadnt heard of that machine model it looks really nice

i guess i more asked about the machine because a heavier duty more pro machine can definitely handle stitching through thick tough material a bit better than a lower end  i have found this to be the case with really dense designs on thick fabric anyway

can i bother you with one more question where do you buy your black denim or is there a type you use specifically  
ive gotten a few recommendations from this sub for materials  felt being a big example  but after purchasing some from joannes found it was definitely not the most optimal possibly because i wasnt buying the right kind like the person recommended

sorry to bother you so much thanks again for sharing 
im surprised i havent seen more comments about her ads 
im absolutely sick of them

they tell me nothing about koteks platform values etc  just that all friends of tina kotek know how to do is pay for low effort finger pointing garbage full of buzzwords

we get it tina drazan is bad and maga and qanon all in one 

but what the fuck do you have to offer 

how about dealing with the homeless  the service resistant violent criminal ones littering our streets and attacking residents at an insane rate  in a way that doesnt just throw more money at them 

crime the shootings im constantly witnessinghearing blocks from my overpriced apartment 

nah not gonna prioritize those things what oregonians really care about and whats really gonna win you votes is ads full of childish namecalling cool 

if a campaign ad is meant to draw in interest from voters she has lost me completely in a mere minute and a half with that shit
oof youre entitled to your thoughts and boundaries but this is absolutely off the rails 


humans are visual curious creatures we love to expand our minds fantasize experience new things etc 
for the same movies are mentally stimulating visually and mentally arousing and captivate our minds pornography is an appealing visual aide to many 
it means nothing you arent cheating on your job or your home by watching a movie about a different lifestyle 
media allows us to explore different things and enjoy different scenarios without actually doing them  which further extends to and speaks to the fact that often what people fantasize about and watch porn about isnt necessarily what they want in real life or their preference 

by your logic are you not emotionally cheating if you watch a film or read a book about romance are you not throwing yourself into characters and scenarios about love and relationships that arent with your partner and lusting after them or feeling excited by them 

and where does it end if you see an attractive person on the street and you unintentionally think damn theyre sexy or have a brief fantasy about them sexually  not intentionally of course most peoples brains just do this  are you cheating then 
is a film with nudity okay a sexually charged song or advertisement 

i could see drawing a line with cam girlsonlyfans type stuff where youre paying a human money and potentially interacting with them for pornsexual stimulation yes sex work is a job and many wouldnt consider frequenting a cam girl cheating but i can also see the argument for it being too much and crossing that line  because you are interacting sexually with another person even if only digitally 

but porn sites seriously theres no interaction there its the same as seeing a film in the theater  youre not cheating with leonardo dicaprio just because he gets sexual on screen
very well said and great comparison 

since were playing to ops insecurities here i guess id add  its not that the people in porn are objectively more attractive or better at sex than i find my partner to be its a nice visual aide i enjoy viewing different kinds of things but the best partnerbest sex out there for me is my partner 
its not that theyre not enough or im enjoying something objectively better  its just a meaningless visual aide  like any movie  during me time which my partner cant always be there for and frankly during times i dont always want to have full sex or have the time for it
interesting what type of machine 

i mainly got into machine embroidery to make patches and ive definitely been struggling to find the right material  everything ive used never seems to be firm and flat like yours looks 
your patch looks excellent
that looks great can i ask what kind of fabric you use
alrighty unfortunately im going to have to lock the comments on this one

rsmite is not a place to debate global minimum wages politics the economy personal finances hirezs financial statusdecisions the value of currency or any of the other completely offtopic tangents the comments section has devolved into

anything that needed to be said on this topic  and then some  has been said were going to leave it there

thank you
alrighty ublevyzga and upokemeifyoudare  going to have to shut this conversation down at this point as its devolved into bickering and isnt a constructive respectful conversation

speculation as to why an account was banned has no place on rsmite and is against the posted subreddit rules any account related problems should be addressed with smitehirez directly

further back and forth regarding this subject will be removed  enough has been said at this point

thank you for your understanding

youre fucking joking right

you must be either really privileged really ignorant or both to think theres no uptick in crime here

or sorry have we all just been imagining all the shootings stabbings robberies car thefts assaults rapes businesses devastated by smashandgrabs arsons destruction of countless public areas littering etc  
for some ungodly reason  some people dont count the mass amounts of filthy hazardous open air drug markets in the city as criminal activity but it absolutely counts especially when its creating dangerous hubs for unhinged violent people to commit crimes against the rest of us  and leaves biohazardous waste everywhere

have it your way  we wont call it a crime wave 

but there is more crime happening here than any of us should be even remotely okay with and pretending it isnt a problem makes you the kind of ignorant enabler we desperately need less of 

okay so you dont like law enforcement as an answer  youre entitled to your opinion  but the rest of us who are sick of being attacked and stolen from and who have been devastated by some of these crimescriminals were sick of the no enforcement catch and release bullshit

absolutely love the texturing on the different parts of the landscape it looks fantastic gives a really nice vibe to the scene and its not overwhelming  sometimes a lot of different texturesfill angles looks messy but this is very clean and the colors are so rad

the satin circle border looks a bit puckered or not quite round sure  but hey you did a fantastic job regardless 

im curious  did you digitize it yourself if so what program 
if youd ever share or sell the design id be interested  something about this i just really love and id love to stitch it out as just a circular patch to have

there is a discord group with a trading post as well as a galaxys edge trading post facebook group i would recommend you checking out for this 
youre 100 right 


curling up in a ball and sobbing is not something a well adjusted adult who plans to have an active sexual life with her partner does over a documentary like that 
a well adjusted adult doesnt feel icky over making out with their partner who they intend to marry 


op your partner has some serious problems surrounding sex and intimacy and these need to be addressed in therapy with a professional 


they will absolutely not get better just because you say i do  and she clearly knows this because shes already giving you a heads up on exactly the way its going to go by mentioning her client and wondering if shell feel disgusted after sex with you shes letting you know what your future almost certainly will look like 
shes so traumatized and grossed out by having sex in the past you can all but guarantee once she has roped you into marriage it will never be a priority 


its not my place to comment on religious values but if sex is important to you it is never wise to get with a partner who is saving themselves for marriage 
marriage isnt a small commitment you want to know that youre both very compatible on all levels that matter before taking that plunge 


i personally wouldnt be planning to marry someone ive only been with for a year and a half that ive never had sex with who is waving around insane red flags that say sex disgusts me 
i value sex and intimacy and a sexless marriage would be hell on earth if my partner loves and values me and is compatible with me we have an active sex life that were both thrilled about a compatible partner for me gets excited about sex with me and wants to share that and build on that 

what about for you is sex important to you do you see yourself being happy with a marriage where your partner is disgusted by sex hates herself for having sex with you and resents you for your sexual needs
because it sounds like thats what youre signing up for


if if were me id be slowing my roll with this lady we would not be moving forward towards marriage until she participates in therapy individual at minimum possibly couples counseling as well 
until she can work through some of her feelings towards sex and have a healthier view towards it  and towards future intimacy in the marriage  i would not be able to confidently say a commitment like this would be a good idea
couldnt agree more 

between the seasonal depression 80 shit weather ridiculous and passive aggressive people filth everywhere crime high cost of living insane taxes  getting higher all the time and being misused garbage city and state government abysmal social services for anyone who isnt homeless unhinged homelessdrug addicts assaultingrobbingdestroying every inch of town etc what exactly are we defending here in portland certainly not a high quality of life 

i get it  no one wants to live in a shit hole no one wants to have to say yes its filthy dangerous and unpleasant here 
but just because you deny the realities around you doesnt somehow mean they dont exist and its that portland isnt so bad its worse elsewhere were fine attitude that is making it that much shittier here day by day 

wake the fuck up guys just because your little bubble of privilege has allowed you enough comforts to ignore the greater realities here doesnt mean portland is a nice place to live and without major problems
yes he absolutely should have

their pet didnt deserve to die because your dog was at large and is inclined to kill other animals i dont care that it was a rabbit you are responsible for ensuring your dog doesnt get out and maul another innocent persons pet 

so you are entitled to keeping your pet regardless of other peoples pets lives because what your dog is somehow superior absolutely not

a wild rabbit a wild rabbit in your yard where your dog is fenced in and able to play unsupervised absolutely different story i agree

i feel horrible for the people who had to lose a treasured pet to you and your animal
i wasnt there i dont know whether or not laop is lying 

i dont really care either  i dont have the time to sit and play detective with every post i was obviously commenting under the assumption laop was an honest post if its not its not  none of my business and doesnt change my opinion in the general sense

if the dog actually did take off enough skin from the arm to need reconstruction thats a serious problem

if not and laop is lying or wasting peoples time with bs so be it

i dont know a dog that attacks a random person  especially one that wasnt instigating anything with said dog  and injures them to the point of needing a skin graft absolutely should be put down period

its unfortunate that the owner wasnt responsible and didnt properly lock up their dog but i have zero patience or tolerance for animals that maul other humans  or other pets  out of the blue nope not a chance

edited changed or other animals to or other pets
agreed ive lived in a handful of other states throughout my life  grew up here sadly  and its astonishing how much people here will allow if not downright enable and encourage 
im so sick of the most vulnerable houseless neighbors rhetoric enough is enough 
theres a reason portland is such a disgusting filth covered hellscape these days and a lot of it is how unwilling people are to do anything meaningful about it  and no bitching about it once or twice a week doesnt count as an action 

if i could id move in a heartbeat but unfortunately im disabled and trying to build up a medical care team elsewhere isnt as easy as people think 
i dont foresee any great changes or comeback for the city unfortunately and i say that as someone who will be forced to die here alongside it
if you think this is going to have a notable enjoyable impact on rent think again
amen 

im so sick of seeing its like this everywhere all urban areas have these problems

no it fucking isnt like this everywhere these problems may not be exclusive to portland but the way we enable them fail to clean them up and allow them to run rampant and steal everything that isnt nailed down before shooting it and lighting it on fire sure is a special flavor to this shithole city 

people arent living like this everywhere its crazy how happy people seem elsewhere how clean it is 
im sick of this dump and just as sick of people pretending it isnt as bad as it is theres nothing to defend
yes it does 

as someone who sadly has to use ebt when i purchase things with bottle deposits i do not have to spend actual money on top of my ebt card
give zero fucks about anything at all but themselves
good luck but dont expect success 

my dad who had three strokes could barely care for himself anymore mentally reverted back to a very childlike state all the more complicated by extremely unmanageable diabetes eventually gave up because he couldnt make it through all the ridiculous hoops they force people to backflip through and was literally dying in povertyfrom poverty since you absolutely cannot work during the process no matter long it takes 
they fucking denied him the first time and used letter sorter and paper folder as job titles they thought he could qualify for and work fucking horrible 
ultimately the disgusting and inhumane disability system in the us is what killed him frankly 


as other have said narcolepsy isnt a recognized approval disability for them so it will be an uphill battle in every way at your age without other conditions close to impossible 
they will want to be sure youve tried every treatment option humanely possible for substantial lengths of time and youll have to argue that at such a young age no job is doable for you whatsoever 


this fight again must somehow happen while you have zero income whatsoever for the entire duration and if you do finally get on it you will live in abject poverty for the rest of your life 
thats not to say it isnt worth it  some of us myself included genuinely cant work and have no other options  but its something to consider
the pay isnt worth it  its a last resort when you truly cannot work whatsoever
thanks for sharing these are awesome
i especially love the decanter i cant get over how beautiful that piece is
im sorry honey youre the one who responded to me 
you must be lost
you must have some wildly bad dimensions if its literally difficult and painful to do something so simple
nope its just literally not fucking hard to do at all

but then again i actually like doing it instead of whining about it and half assing it like a lot of yall
according to a lot of the women commenting here yes 

but in reality no 

youre entitled to likes and dislikes and preferences and boundaries it doesnt matter at all why you dont want to do it  just that you dont and wont and that should be respected 100

it will be a deal breaker for some women but others will respect your boundaries and be happy to have sex  and enjoy sex which is very much not just about receiving head  and it sounds like youre more than willing to be attentive to their pleasure and needs so everyone will have a great time

ignore the many fuck men who dont go down comments here these women suck frankly you wont be compatible with everyone but youre not less than or a worse candidate for partner for those who realize theres so much more to enjoy than just receiving head during a sexual encounter
for what its worth im a woman who has been upvoting you 



youre not wrong in a lot of what youre saying



frankly sucking dick isnt fucking hard 



my partner is above average in size and ive never once thought hmm this is painful or difficult and giving head is honestly my favorite sexual activity i have absolutely gone down on him for 3060 minutes without stopping as well as for a combined total of hours when weve had long all day to fuck sessions and i was fine was my jaw sore after hours a bit absolutely but it was fine in a handful of hoursafter a night of sleep and barely more than a minor annoyance not painful



most women in these comments  and the op  talk about how they like giving head but its clear they do not 

you dont genuinely enjoy the act  or selfless intent  of giving a blowjob if you only enjoy it if youre getting something in return
you like it as a gateway to something you want
when its off the table if you dont get what you want you dont actually fucking like it 
and no you dont like pleasing your partner or giving them pleasure if youre only willing to do it under the expectation they will do it back thats like giving a gift or doing a favor only to receive in return  its not really a gift now is it 



granted i am very straight so the thought of eating pussy is repulsive to me but that aside its pretty ridiculous how judgmental some of these women are when a man isnt into going down 



i like receiving but i also like having sex and theres plenty else about a sexual encounter i enjoy and value besides just head i also know how to get myself off during a sexual encounter or guide my partner to do so without his fucking mouth so its not the only option for me to enjoy myself



and frankly if a partner isnt into it im happy they feel they can set that boundary and not be forced to do something theyre repulsed by  no matter what the reason



the entire experience can surely be gross to some people  lots of bodily fluids not always tasting of pure delight lots of textures sweaty thighslegs lots of pressure on your facehead inability to breathe etc  and while many women can say the same of blowjobs in their opinion its ridiculous that some folks here cant seem to wrap their minds around a man not wanting to do it and cant respect that preference 
yet when men post about women not wanting to give blowjobs its all about respecting her in the comments isnt it 


if the only important pleasure you get out of sex is receiving head thats very much a problem with you 
if you cant respect another persons preference not to have someones genitals leaking fluids all over their mouth and face for anywhatever reason and you see them as less than for that thats pretty fucked up  and i sure hope you dont have sexual preferences or hard nos 

not saying you have to have sex with someone who isnt into the things youre into or expect from sex not at all op was fine is setting and following a boundary 
im just so sick of all the fuck men who are like this how dare they comments these same women would be crying out 20 paragraphs about how horrible the man is if the situation were reversed
im so glad that my comment specifically stuck out to you and provided a conversation starter for you and your partner  and even happier that it helped so much 

im so proud of you for having that talk with your partner and deciding that therapy is the route for you 

therapy fucking rocks there is zero shame in seeing a therapist  i firmly believe everyone should get therapy at some point in their life and that everyone can benefit from it  and it can be such an amazing tool to really know yourself better love yourself harder and work through some of the tough shit life throws everyone it can be hard to find a therapist that you fit well with  especially these days coming out of the pandemic it can be hard to get in with a clinician as there is a shortage  but i encourage you to stick with it until you do its seriously amazing how much you can improve  on things you didnt even know you needed to work on  and i promise itll do wonders for your self esteem and your relationship learning how to communicate better and express your emotions in a healthy way  even if your relationship is going great as is  is such an awesome tool to have

best of luck to you going forward take care 
im always dehydrated

i hate drinking water for a lot of reasons  not just i dont like it  and generally drink mexican coke  cant handle the taste of any other soda  occasionally apple juice or green tea or nothing at all i also take stimulant medications in very high doses for narcolepsy  stimulants are dehydrating 
i have been this way for well over a decade 

my boyfriend has never had an issue with the way i taste hes genuinely crazy about my tastescent 
i dont taste myself constantly by any means but its not at all unpleasant when he has had me do so on his fingers or if i go down on him after penetration

which is just to say  be prepared for water to not make much of a difference and not solve anything here it could make a difference it could not 

i eat red meat and dairy but dont drink coffee to comment on the other things in your plan 

some people just have a more bitter taste from what i gather and yours may not even be bad but just odd to you 

best of luck in any event im sure youre fine
you couldnt be more off base with this 

many of us find full time work of any kind to be not at all feasible
narcolepsy for some of us is a legitimate and severe disability full stop not because of multiple health issues or whatever else because its a fucking disability and a horrible debilitating disease
when that season was airing i got sick of call outs towards syngin he knew who he was and was honest about it upfront if she wanted a motivated career driven husband she could manipulate and verbally abuse that wasnt him
people may not agree with his lifestyle choices or whateverness but theres nothing wrong with not wanting to devote to a specific job and not being that driven towards wasting away all day working its not like he expected her to finance his every ambition and make millions while he did nothing some people are fine with less money and more time

god cant believe i had to scroll this far to find something that wasnt just theyre perfect everyone is flawless the way they are never be unhappy with yourself1111111

there is nothing wrong with deciding to have surgery done to improve something 
if its something you genuinely want and the alteration would make you happy go for it
the benefits to this surgery arent nonexistent  besides just improving how they look and your views on them it may make it easier on your back be easier to find clothes that fit properly  or fit in in a way you prefer and enjoy the look of the lifting aspect is something many women covet not to make them perfect but to achieve a more comfortable setup so to speak amongst other reasons 

if youre just getting it because you think you have to in order to be sexy or good enough or because you cant stop comparing yourself to countless other better looking women therapy is what fixes this and is a lot cheaper 

but if you are able to be objective about it and go you know what i love myself my partner loves me and is attracted to me im attractive as is and im happy with myself but you know what the confidence boost id  get from the surgery would be amazing and i would achieve the look i desire and be able to wear things i cant now  even though im fine the way i am today 
then i think looking into surgery is a great idea and theres nothing wrong with it

people are so quick to judge cosmetic surgeries and hate on the reasons behind themthose who get them
its one thing if youre jumping haphazardly into it to please other people or cover up deep self esteem problems you really should be working through in therapy but its not always a bad thing or a bad option and is just like any other body modification when it comes down to it 

regardless i hope youre able to make the right choice for you op im sure your partner loves you just the way you are and i hope you do too
so he has to always meet her needs first and answer to her whims in order to have his needs met absolutely fucking not
bullshit 

if your partner doesnt give a fuck about your needs and doesnt care about showing you love in the way you have indicated is important to you romance isnt usually second nature i dont feel like going out of my way to pay for plan and take someone on a date when they cant even participate in physical intimacy with me 
its 100 the same her needs wont be met if she cant start giving a shit about her partners needs
because shes not the only important fucking partner in the relationship 

if she wants respect for what she wants or doesnt want he deserves equal respect for his needs and dislikes

if she wants romance and her love languages attended to he deserves that as well 100

shes ignoring and denying his needs in the relationship its only fair hers arent his top priority either
i simply had them switch me down to 5s i get the same dose as i always have per day i just have to take 3 times the amount of physical pills to get there they said theyll have plenty of sandos and teva 5s through the end of the shortage  the only two manufacturers ive found to be in any way legitimate  and dont anticipate a shortage so im hoping theyre right on that its annoying to have to take so many tiny pills but it beats having nothing

somehow my partner has been able to get his teva or sandos 20s just fine with zero delay or shortage through fred meyer what kroger is called in oregon and has remained unaffected which is odd

im sure youve done this already but if it happens again ask to have the pills switched  to 5s 10s 20s etc  in a way that allows you to maintain your original dose just with a different breakdown of pills manufacturers can be tricky as there are very few that actually work and are decent but it might be worth looking into switching those if nothing else

also you arent dependent on your medication you wouldnt tell someone who has to use crutches that theyre dependent on them in a negative way you wouldnt say that to someone using insulin or an inhaler its no different here

embroidery frame stand will get you many options like this on google

i purchased mine from amazon with those search terms and have seen nice ones at joanns and michaels as well
unfortunately adderall has not done a thing for my adhd symptoms  nor has any other medication but in fairness after all these years it does very little for my narcolepsy anymore  and nothing else has done a thing either 

the hard part is that adhd and narcolepsy symptoms can overlap a lot 
attention issues memory problems brain fog forgetfulness etc are all narcolepsy symptoms that are very common 
does that mean if you have adhd  n you have double the symptoms or theyre twice as strong 
does it make no difference and your focus should be on treating the symptoms not what they come from
i have no idea nor has any specialist ive ever seen all of whom have been floored by the severity of my symptomsnarcolepsy 

i wish i could provide positive helpful feedback just chiming in with my two cents  youre certainly not the only one dealing with this combo and issue
i know i didnt mean to come off as if i expected that you could i apologize

lost my best friend my kitty who i loved so dearly to a violent dog a few months back so its a sore spot for me i more mentioned it in case any part of you can do anything or say anything about it but of course its not your job to fix everything and i totally get that

smash that like and subscribe button for more sick videos like these alright now were onto number 5 of the top 10 intersections to do meth while stealing a catalytic converter and this one is special guys im telling you
hey now your privilege is showing

those kgw employees have jobs and possessions clearly our most vulnerable neighbors need those electronics and personal bags more than those privileged employed oppressors
i personally wont mess with antidepressants of any kind after many bad experiences with them for nondepression related treatments 
have been put on various forms for migraines nighttime sleep etc  the side effects always suck and the time to adjust after stopping them does too

my understanding from my doctor is that trazodone can cause physical dependence and cant always be stopped cold turkey as well as trouble adjusting to sleeping without it 
given the similar potential side effects to a lot of ssris i wasnt interested in pursuing it


mom began taking it for sleep after trauma earlier this year  she is not diagnosed narcoleptic but its suspected she has had it since her teenage years  and it was messy awful side effects impossible to sleep on nights she didnt take it mood swings etc 


i currently take hydroxyzine  which has worked okay for me 

i like that its a pretty casual medication and i can adjust my dose up and down at will depending on how im feeling it doesnt knock me out  unless im already over tired and take a high dose  but it helps combat the insomnia narcolepsy can cause and i dont feel groggy the next day as if ive taken something heavy 

it doesnt do a ton but xyrem is out of the question so im glad to have something
a dog that is violent towards other animals is a problem that surely needs to be addressed too 

thank you for reporting the cat

regardless of your personal feelings on the matter the subreddit rules are posted and you are expected to read them familiarize yourself with them and follow them just like everyone else

thank you for the genuine laugh i just had at your expense  no we are not hirez advocates paid in free gems nor is anyone on the rsmite mod team in any way affiliated with or employed by hirez

you are not the first  nor will you surely be the last  person to resort to that unoriginal juvenile accusation when you arent getting your way on the subreddit

no one on the moderation team works for hirez and thus to keep the subreddit running smoothly free of toxicitypersonal drama and rants clogging up the feed we as a team have chosen to prohibit posts of this nature that seek to rant about state of the community topics that no one on the moderation team or in the community has any influence over

posts such as yours do not tend to inspire positive productive conversation on the subreddit and often devolve into bickering and toxicity just by looking at the current comments on your post it is clear that this is absolutely the case here as well  i would not call these responses a discussion by any means

if you have suggestions that you would like hirez to see reaching out to them directly is your best plan of action you can do this by voicing your personal opinion over a ticketfeedback email or by reaching out to them via their direct social media  which again rsmite is not

regardless of your personal opinion on the rsmite rules the moderation team expects you to familiarize yourself with the stated rules in the sidebar and to follow them accordingly all users in the rsmite community are expected to understand that we prohibit posts that solely seek to express their complaints on certain topics  as this falls under rule 3  and as such you are expected to follow this rule as well

your post was in direct violation of rule 3 and therefore is not eligible to be reinstated if you repost it it will be removed and continued attempts to do so will result in a ban from the subreddit as you now have been warned and familiarized with the rules and how they apply to you

if you feel the moderation team is pathetic and rsmite is not up to your standards no one is forcing you to engage here

so you started a stimulant medication which is actually meant for the treatment of narcolepsy and helping reduce eds and youre attributing this improvement to a supplement powder 

man i guess there really is something to be said for the placebo effect

i do hope you went off zoloft at the full recommendation and supervision of your doctor and not just because you were afraid of the interaction

when youre just starting out on a new medication it is best to stick with the medical treatment plan set by your medical professional adding in a bunch of unnecessary supplementation can make it quite difficult to know if the medication is working or not or what side effects are coming from where

a horrific meme at that 

this girl has no idea what some of the real horrors of life are like
right all good points 


i personally couldnt imagine staying with or remaining interested in a partner who is as selfish and shortsighted as ops girlfriend


shes fucking 19 she is in no way ready for a baby  whatsoever and is haphazardly planning to bring a life into a world of chaos uncertainty and poverty her family arent financially sound or stable and neither is she  how exactly is she planning to provide a wonderful life for this baby that her partner has made clear he doesnt even want 


i would lose 100 of my interest in continuing a relationship with someone like this and the resentment would grow so strong  as my life is ruined for a child that wasnt wanted needed or planned for  that it would be crippling 



im sorry this has happened op 

yes you had your part in getting her pregnant  though it sounds like you guys did use protection sucks this happened despite being responsible  but she is making a horrible choice all across the board and im sorry its going to destroy the next 18 years of your life 


do not wait to make your views firmly known here continue to repeat how poor of a decision this is how not ready both of you are and how rough this will be for the next two decades for you both 
reiterate that this is not her only opportunity to have a child and she should want to make this choice when prepared and stable and able to give the child the resources and stability it needs  and reiterate that neither of you are anywhere close to that level of stable at this time nor will be in the near future 

reiterate how strenuous this will be on your relationship your relationship will never be the same in many ways negatively you will both be stressed exhausted and pushed to your absolute limit in every way 
sex will be minimal if not nonexistent personal timefree time gone hobbies goals dreams likely out the window for quite a while you will be financially drained and desperately trying to survive paycheck to paycheck in a shit economy with rising inflation and high costs of living and will likely feel as though you can never get ahead
education will be tough if not impossible 
her body will change dramatically and she will have a whole new set of mental and physical woes to deal with for years at only 19  
heaven forbid the child has any physical or developmental issues or disabilities get ready for a potential lifetime of caregiving 


its easy for some people  god knows why i certainly cant figure it out  to be talked into this shit by family or doctors that are antiabortion but they dont have to live with this baby and it isnt their life being destroyed by its arrival 
drill these points home its your last chance to change the path youre both on 

i hope she makes the smart choice and goes back to her initial decision either way i wish you all the best
i like how my cat knocks out my wifi and i get a soft ban but some a hole spams ngr or other slurs and insults gets nothing  
  
this system is a joke

im going to assume youre not seriously claiming that these types of sentences dont fall under no soapboxing rants or complaints but just in case

as stated in the posted subreddit rules constructive criticism is allowed and encouraged but simple complaint posts that dont go into detail and dont encourage discussion will be removed 

if you have problems with the reporting system you can bring this to hirez directly via their support feature or by reaching out to them via their social media with questions concerns or complaints

this issue is brought to the subreddit semifrequently and unfortunately does not tend to encourage constructive civil discussion on the topic as such posts of this nature are removed 

no one here on rsmite knows exactly how hirezsmites banreport system works or what their metrics on players are  
if you have suggestions or concerns regarding this your best bet will be to reach out to hirez directly

in game if you are dealing with a toxic player reporting these players  with a detailed filled out report  and blocking them is the best way to stop encountering a problem user 

unfortunately any online gaming community will have bad apples that bring toxicity  foul language and other unpleasant behaviors into the game the best thing any player can do is ignore these users report and move on   


regardless of your personal opinion on hirezs report system these are the options available to you as such there is no further discussion needed on the topic

literally a few comments down someones flair is larrys uneaten lechon  girl your shameful ass will live on here being roasted for all eternity 
hey folks 

we understand theres some controversy going on around the mizkif allegations and that there are a lot of mixed feelings in the community on the topic 


until hirez makes a statement or takes action  purely meaning if and when they do if they ever feel the need not commenting on if they should or should not  large community discussions on this topic are only tangentially related to smite 
therefore all discussion on the topic should be focused in this post for the time being  and all further posts will be removed 

should the situation develop further and receive official hirez attentionaction a stickied post may be made for discussion 

again until then we do not consider this a smite related topic being as it only tangentially relates to the game and therefore further posts are not needed nor on topic for rsmite 


by no means does this reflect any of the rsmite mod teams personal views or feelings on the alleged actions or topic whatsoever 

we simply feel that until hirez becomes involved it would be best to steer discussion back to smite specifically as that is the purpose of the subreddit 

feel free to continue civil respectful discussion on this post

thank you
received scanning now
first off im so sorry for your loss and that you are going through this right now my heart goes out to both you and your husband 3

its definitely a difficult experience and there are a lot of foreign and hard feelings that come up during these times   
its hard because you know its not anything theyre doing on purpose or anything theyre doing wrong  but even in knowing that its so hard not to feel that resentment anger or sadness anyway i totally get it

im not sure based on what you wrote  are these kittens or older cats

if kittens  absolutely give it time for all of the cats ive ever had theyve all changed a ton over their first few years sometimes it takes a while but as they settle down out of that first year phase  and even out of that first year with you phase regardless of age  they tend to become more snugglybuddied up with their people if youre persistent it can be hard  especially when theyre giving your husband more attention  but if you maintain that constant vibe of i want to give all the love to you i want to be your buddy i want to be close to you and bond strongly it usually develops even if it takes a little longer with you specifically its when you give up and back off and start being more distant around them that they usually match that and it starts to reset those im warming up to this person levels 

if theyre older  not necessarily meaning old  it can definitely take a lot more effort and time but its totally possible i dont believe any cat is firmly set in their ways when theyre cold not so social or distant i think some will certainly be more friendly than others just in general but you can absolutely get to a good strong bond with most cats given persistence maybe with your two new kitties that will just mean some extra google research into different ways to get to that closer snugglier more bonded place and extra catnip and treats surely

but youre right  you lost a really special unique sweet soul youve lost your best friend that shit is impossibly hard the grief is overwhelming and hurts in ways youve never imagined it could theres no fixing that  and theres no replacing nala   
i mean you wouldnt even want to try to replace her right thats crazy talk she was amazing   
it definitely makes it that much harder that these new kitties  despite your happiness to give them a new home and attempts to bond with them  arent the kind of dream cats that are friendly followyoueverywhere snuggle bugs right off the bat sometimes we just get really lucky like with your girl  


i think the hardest thing for my partner was remembering in the moment that they arent our late cat you know that you know they wont be the same but in the moment its hard not to look for those traits or compare them to your memory of the best cat youve ever known its not intentional its just something you do without realizing because youre so used to that special friend and all the great things about them

it can really help to make a conscious effort to try to wipe from your mind your expectations of a cat  not forgetting about nala or her good qualities but not defining my cats as those behaviors she displayed  
this isnt easy and it takes time but it can definitely help to shift to a fresh perspective when dealing with the new pets coming into every interaction with no expectations no hopes for how theyre going to behave and not searching for any specific traits or actions can really help you to warm up to the new fresh personalities that these new cats have and find the things you love and appreciate about them specifically  
when my partner started coming from this perspective it was like a flip switched  i could tell he was visibly happier interacting with them and suddenly he was pointing out all these cute poses and goofy things they do and really engaging in playing with them

when were grieving its hard not to compare to the one that we lost but were only hurting ourselves in the process by limiting the depth and strength of the bonds we could be forming

sorry to write you a novel its still a pretty fresh experience and loss for myself too so i tend to get off on a tangent and ramble a lot 

in any event i wish you  and your husband and new kitties  the absolute best ill be hoping for a strong snuggly amazing bond with these new goobers for you for many years to come
i will take some high quality full scans in a couple hours and send them your way 

if you want to dm me i can send them to your email if youre comfortable  as so to not lose any quality  otherwise ill drop an imgur link
youre jumping to some wild connections there bud not what i was getting at at all 


no i dont agree its anything like flat out rape like youre proposing nowhere near that level 


but it is wrong in my opinion to deceive someone  whether that be lying outright or lying by omission  when engaging with them sexually especially and specifically about things relating to sex


and before any more ridiculous comparisons are made no i dont look at things like lying about say political affiliation or saying you like a band you dont or that you make more money than you do the same way 



i  and many people judging by conversations on similar topics on this subon reddit  do feel that lying about things pertaining directly to sex in order to engage with someone sexually is absolutely wrong and does not allow for fully informed consent 


if i dont want to have sex with a 28 year old virgin be that because i feel unwanted pressure or dont want to have a one night stand with a virgin  for reasons i originally stated above  or dont feel comfortable with how that alters the tone of the sexual encounter or even just because i dont want to  which is everyones right no is a valid reason  then that should 100 be my choice to make 


if the person im engaging with values informed consent and wants me to be enthusiastically willing to have sex with them and wants a partner who is comfortable with them and choosing them fully then they should be fine with me knowing that detail 



if theyre lying about it or deceiving me by omission is it because they fear i wouldnt have sex with them if i knew so theyre deceiving me in order to get me to have sex with them no 
thats pretty fucking disgusting to do someone wouldnt you say 


or is it because theyre afraid of my reaction that i wont be as comfortable that i would want to take it slow and maybe not engage sexually right away or think about it or get to know them better first or talk about it more and set the boundaries and mood more firmly 
why would they not want me to do that 


you dont have to agree with my feelings on it but i personally think lying to a sexual partner about things that pertain to sex specifically  not that any lying is generally necessarily a good habit but thats not what were talking about  makes you a scumbag at best a deceptive manipulator at worst and it does blur ones ability to fully agree to the act in cases where they would not have otherwise


i guess since youre riding really hard on my wording yeah informed consent in a legal sense of rape vs not  youre right but thats not what i meant clearly
with you on everything here except for lying about your virginity status 

some people will not want to be a one night standhookupwhatever else to a 28 year old virgin and its their right to make that choice with informed consent 

not saying this happens for everyone or will for op but there is a lot of emotion uncertainty and all kinds of negative and positive reactions that can come with losing your virginityhaving sex for the first time especially with someone from a heavy religious background 


most people would want to know beforehand that those may arise with the person theyre about to engage sexually with lying about it helps no one here and can only lead to op or her sexual partner becoming very uncomfortable should certain needs emotions etc arise
the store front rent would have to be very cheap for that to be possible for the majority of smallmedium etsy shops especially depending on what products they specialize in and the security would have to be excellent

but that would be awesome if it were possible would much rather see shops like that than big chains
ah yes just what portlands consistently enjoyable weather and crazyunhinged roaming community is good for year round outdoor exposed activities that involve upkeep 

indoor would be neat though

absolutely im so glad my comment helped a bit 

it will definitely be weird at first with the new kitty  it was for us too even though we chose to adopt them and had a say in how soon  but i have no doubts youll come to appreciate the new cat and it will take your mind off things at times 

sometimes its hard because these new kittens we have are very different from iggy he was a special man and the most unique cat ive ever met  one of those that doesnt feel like a cat at all more like a good friend we love our kittens but i have found myself at times feeling sad or disappointed that certain things i loved that he did they dont do 
but those moments pass quickly and i let myself feel them however i need and then things move on and theres new happy moments again as long as you know that its likely youve have a lot of those conflicting moments and are prepared to process them and let them pass i think itll all be just fine 

i hope your family is being empathetic to your feelings and gives you space to talk about the grief  and conflicted emotions around the new cat if they arent im deeply sorry for that too 

something that has brought me a lot of joy has been thinking that iggy would be really happy to know we have given two new cats a good and safe home resources and a peaceful life 
thats the best gift you can give an animal and many are not so lucky 
it sounds like you really love animals and that youre taking the time to set up your kitty spots and prepare for them is really sweet and amazing this new cat will be very lucky to have you and know you 
i lost my best friend my kitty iggy end of june 
it was tragic devastating and very traumatic for my partner and i  he was brutally mauled and died in our arms its an image ill never forget 

we immediately knew it would be difficult to think of getting another cat and had to take a few nights away from our home at a hotel because everywhere we looked we saw iggys stuff or memories of him 

the house started to feel really empty and cold without him around he was like my little shadow and it wasnt often id be in a room without him i talked to him constantly throughout the day and he was a huge part of our lives 
this emptiness really weighed on me and added to the grief and depression from his loss in ways that became unbearable

we werent planning to adopt new cats so soon but we fell in love with a pair of kittens who were being mistreated by a shelter and we impulsively brought them home the same day we met them 

at first my partner really struggled with it he was happy to provide a better life for the kittens but didnt feel quite ready once we got them home and it brought up a lot of conflicting feelings for him 

its been a couple months now and were all doing a lot better with it 
the kittens feel like part of the family and while we miss iggy intensely every day we are so grateful to have them around to fill that empty space 
they bring us a lot of joy are super sweet and snuggly and are such goofy little characters 
we can never replace iggy but we can provide love and security to two new lives  and that feels really good 

im sorry that you dont have a say in the timeline of adopting a new cat i know it will be hard but please be kind and open to this new life  it could be easy to feel resentful or angry with this new pet especially since this was not your choice but its important to remember that this kitty hasnt done anything wrong and they deserve love and happiness too 

they will never replace your lost cat you may find yourself looking for traits that remind you of your lost kitty or trying to get them to act the way that kitty did and becoming irritated when they dont 
alternatively you might feel yourself getting frustrated if they do act like your old cat because they arent them and you resent them for that 
these are all normal human reactions to grief and its important to let yourself process and mourn however you need to 
but in time if you can try to form a new relationship with this kitty  they wont be the same but you can come to love them just as much and find things about them that you will grow just as attached to 

having a new friend around can really help the grieving process even if its hard sometimes hang in there 
this person per their profile does this professionally and has huge multi needle machines for mass producing productspatches 

definitely not a hobbyist or anything near a hobby level amazing work nonetheless but the threadstabilizerfabrics they use will almost certainly not be availablepracticalrelevant to the just starting out level nonetheless the machine  and possibly software 

but theyve got some cool embroideries in their post history to browse
its hard to say i would talk to a vet or otherwise qualified cat expert about that 


i personally would never feel comfortable taking the risk having cremated my indooronly best friend 3 months ago when he was eaten by a disgusting pit bull after bolting out the front door when startled  

i cant imagine taking my kittens out and risking them getting out of the harness after witnessing firsthand just how unsafe it is out there for kitties on their own 


i will say ive collar trained both of my kittens now  plan to have airtag collars on them when theyre big enough just in case a freak accident ever occurred where they got outside  and its been a breeze 


if you get a harness that fits properly isnt binding but isnt loose practice extensively inside and live in an area with minimal big risks  near prey driven dogs loud roads city areas potentially hazardous nature areas etc  you may be fine but i think its a personal choice as to if the risk is worth it and if you feel like your cats will do well with it or not


i would absolutely practice tirelessly for a long time with them wearing it and walking with it inside and in controlled environments where they cannot bolt and escape 

some cats are fine with collarskittens some fight it endlessly some collapse and go limp in protest some lose their shit in the most erratic ways etc 
i think a lot of it has to do with temperament your cats personality and how you introduce them to it  how dedicated you are to training them with it how patient and the environment in which you do that 
as a kitten is definitely better for that kind of stuff but its not impossible for older cats 


if possible a catio is a much safer way to let them enjoy the outdoors but not everyone has the space for that kind of setup
absolutely cracking up thats hilarious  thanks for the laugh
im sorry i wasnt aware we could be choosing beggars 

if the hypothetical treatment that will make me feel better than any other options on the market or be as close to feeling cured as possible has to be administered via iv sign me the fuck up 

some of us have actually lost enough to this god awful disease that thats a tiny and exciting price to pay for relief
im with you on that one

not enough motivation not an important enough or common enough or popular enough disease not enough money to be made over other focuses etc 
and frankly im sure its no cakewalk to come up with ways to fix this that are safe effective practical without horrendous side effects etc 

i dont feel there will be either i would almost guarantee if there is it wont be anywhere near my lifetime id love to be wrong
i always wonder how pets work in the ac world like weve got cat and rabbit and dog villagers in clothes having lives talking but then wed have a petsized version running around the campsite makes you wonder 

id totally love this regardless though
did you design these yourself amazing job either way thanks for sharing 
very envious of those talented at 3d printing its something id love to get into but its a big undertaking to create something as polished as this well done 

if you did would you be okay with me using a few of the designs to make a couple embroidered patches 

i will never sell them or profit off them in any way  i do machine embroidery as a hobby mostly to make patches and would love to make a couple of these to use on some of the jackets i wear when i visit batuu
personal use only purely 

id be happy to send a couple of any i make to you free of charge and free of shipping cost if that interests you at all in exchange for permission 

zero offense if you decline  i wouldnt feel right not asking permission
if you believe a word she says especially avoid jihoon in this situation i have a bridge to sell you 

i wouldnt send her a dime its not going to her childs treatment and that has been apparent shes a grifter and a shameless one at that 

and how is he supposed to get in contact or see him exactly
she profits and wins if hes the bad guy her story falls apart if the truth behind her manipulation is revealed 
is jihoon supposed to get a visa cover high travel costs from south korea to the us  with lodging for an extended period  and then try to locate her to see his son with zero cooperation from her or anyone close to her
is he supposed to just manifest like a magical fairy in the same room as his son who she is keeping from him 
does the child have a cellphone he can just call to obtain unmonitored access to him 

lets be real here 

at a certain point there isnt much you can do 
she has displayed a clear pattern of procreating to gain attention cash and a manipulation tool with multiple men and jihoon was just an unlucky pawn in her game she tossed him out replaced him with another stand in dad she could mold and fetishize and itll likely repeat again when he isnt fitting her will enough 

the way she behaves her history with men and restraining orders hes literally in a foreign country with no way to find and see his son without her allowing it i cant blame him personally
i wouldnt send one penny if i were him that bitch has herself in mind and thats absolutely it  i wouldnt trust that shed use it for the child necessary treatments or bills straight into fillers and luxuries just like any gofundme money shes getting 

jihoon isnt perfect but no one is at this point what is he supposed to do 
get a visa travel from south korea  lets not pretend this is easy or cheap thanks guys  and show up with no idea how to find or see his son and absolutely zero cooperation from her 
really 
were blaming him for not going along with that fantastic plan 
she cut him out and replaced him with another similar instant daddy she can fetishize and bend to her needs  and when he stops fitting the mold shell toss him out too
all she seems to know how to do is procreate to gain attention finding and manipulate menfansfamily and lie i wouldnt believe a word she says 
this happened to my mom as well fortunately she was right by her car and he bolted underneath it and she was able to grab him and toss him back in the vehicle but i told her shes a fool if she ever does it again because she may not be so lucky next time  hes 5 years old and it was his first time using a harnessgoing for a walk he doesnt seem really antsy to learn how to enjoy it at this point in his life 

im so sorry to hear about your little guy i hope he comes home soon or is found and reunited with you you will both be in my thoughts 
so then remove them from the line and stop inflicting them on everyone else while forcing them onto something theyre miserable doing and therefore making everyone else miserable in the process

hi there id love to be considered thank you for this giveaway regardless how wonderful to offer to the community 

recently i have found myself most impacted by the art and creations put on by meow wolf  and associated artists 
its pretty crazy to browse the subredditrelated instagrams and see the amazing worlds the company is bringing in artists to create and nurture 
for those unfamiliar meow wolf currently has three locations of huge interactive art exhibits that have a story to explore with many rooms of wild art and sensory experiences 
i have been really inspired by these creations because it has really expanded my definition of what art could be  what music can do what shapes art can take what film can be used for etc 
ive always felt ive had some form of artistic vision but never felt there was much of a place for me to express it  i mostly do embroidery machine embroidery rug tufting etc which feel a bit bland and limited  but seeing all the unique uses of different artistic mediums really helped bring me out of my creative shell

the hell are you talking about i shave religiously completely bare whether im expecting sex or not it feels more clean and more comfortable to me
right 

we cant know what will make a blow job better for your partner op if he already says youre amazing and hes already able to cum from what youre doing the only improvements you can make will be specific to him 

some guys like certain things done with their balls  some absolutely do not want anything in that area at all
some prefer deeper or faster or more or less hands we cant know that ask him

what my partner loves is likely not going to be what yours is wanting ask him what hes wanted to try or what would really drive him crazy 
it doesnt ruin it to be told its not a guessing game you dont have to magically find it for it to blow his mind
wow 

i hadnt seen that the buildings have to be at least 15 years old for rental assistance to apply thats useless
if things were to go that route theyd not only need absurd amounts of additional rental assistance funding but theyd need to reformat the way it is awarded processed and actually staff the damn places responsible for doing it 
oerap was nothing short of a nightmare failure in many ways and i have zero faith in multnomah county to handle more funding responsibly or in a way that helps those who need it

playing willfully dumb makes you look just that  dumb

i didnt say theres shitty landlords because a few tenants put bacon greese down the drain 

a lot of comments were bragging about all the awful ways theyve treated a property and how its nice to be able to treat their rental home like absolute shit since they arent responsible for fixing it or paying for it

and yes that attitude is why a lot of good honest smalltime landlords stop renting their properties out leaving tenants with nothing but shitty exploitative landlords on the market

but no go ahead pop off some more about a point no one was making because you want to feel smart today enjoy

i mean for someone who has 180 pounds to lose they need more than to just walk around outside  and a better diet is an understatement

i mean sure he failed because he didnt change his habits and establish healthier routines outside of the meal plan but the meal plan isnt to blame for some people it takes a preplanned diet like that to shift their eating habits enough for it to matter you cant just make small changes when youre that overweight
if you cant trust your primary doctor and have to go behind their back and lie to them about major surgery and large components of your health its time to get a new primary doctor 


what if you have complications from the surgery later on what if youre having issues that could be linked to this surgery or couldve formed because of it but she doesnt know to look or go that route because youve lied about it is that when youll decide to tell her  and then have to backtrack on even more years of dishonesty 

i guarantee your doctor will care more about you lying about your health and impeding her ability to treat you fully than she cares that you went elsewhere for surgery and if not thats how you know she isnt an ethical good doctor and its time to go elsewhere 

but i highly doubt shed have much to say after you get the procedure done  theres no going back whats she going to do lecture you 

that has no benefit to her as a medical professional  which is her only relationship to you she doesnt think about or care about you outside of the appointment

whether she would or wouldnt do the procedure isnt really important
youre allowed to visit other doctors and specialists and have procedures done wherever you feel comfortable when youre ready 
maybe your friend had a good experience with a specialist for the same thingthey came highly recommended maybe you couldnt get an appointment with the primary when it was best for your schedule maybe you didnt want to pay for a referral appointment and went straight to the option you knew would handle the procedure there are many valid reasons to go elsewhere for something like this and you wont be the first nor the last person theyve encountered in their medical career who has done so

prepare for many more denials and many more years of waiting and fighting 

be glad ifwhen its less but expect it to be a long hard road as it is for mosthas been for many of us 

it is especially hard to be approved for mental health problems  and even more so if youre younger 

a diagnosis means and guarantees nothing its a long road of proving that youve tried enough treatments medications therapies etc and showing you have enough medical recordsproof
people definitely get weird and wild ive seen it all  casual plain loud wild way too revealing costumes all of it

given seattle weather is much like ours down here in portland  plan for the beforeafter you dont want to be freezing soaking wet or otherwise uncomfortable as youre coming and going from the venue comfort over coolness always  wear shoes you can stand for a while in wont tripbe easily knocked over in etc 


im excited for the saturday show to be 21 only for once  nothing like underage kids in next to no clothing who have no idea how to behave at a concert to put a damper on an experience   and plan to wear something sparklyflashy breathable for the show but with a warm jacket since itll be 60 out all evening i usually wear platform boots to shows since im short so i can see while still being able to balance and stand comfortably 

you really cant go wrong have fun with it and wear what makes you feel good comfortable and ready to party
have fun post some photosvideo if you can  enjoy
absolutely do not ask to have an album signed during a set that is so incredibly rude and disrespectful

trying to catch them by the van merch booth or standing at the front of the stage after the setencore are completely finished and seeing if you can catch anyone is fine and probably your best bet but for the love of all things dont ask them during the set

they posted a video of the merch booth on their story the other night  there was an enamel pin that looked like a green alien a long sleeve shirt for the new album a short sleeve for the new album lots of vinylcds a ur fun poster and of course many of davids wonderful art pieces 

im surely missing a few things but those were the staples i noticed in their story
im sure a lot of us are curious  what medication are you on for how long how is it causing problems and how were you placed on it without any sort of diagnosis 



that aside  the process of pursuing a diagnosis is never easy nor fun 
sleep studies are awful  and can be inconclusive or flat out wrong and need further pursuing or retesting  and thats with or without having to take time off your regularly scheduled medications for some of us that standard 2 week med break is devastating  if not impossible and crippling 
youre not alone in that fear and struggle and im sorry youre having to face it during law school of all things

as embarrassing as it may feel definitely reach out to your school in some capacity they should have a specific department that deals with medical accommodationsa disability specific departmentworker get in touch explain where youre at and let them know you need specific accommodations and exceptions during this time 
sleeping through class without alerting anyone about your specific woes obviously isnt the answer here and wont fly  reputable schools have a system in place to accommodate for cases like yours but they can only implement them and help you if they know about it 
it will feel a bit embarrassing youll feel vulnerable and not everyone will be understanding 100 of the time but if you dont advocate for yourself no one can meet you halfway and help you  see what they can do when you explain and go from there it may not solve 100 of the anxiety or struggle but once you know what patience your courses are willing to give you you can make a better plan 

i hope youre able to find the answers you need with this path of seeking out a formal diagnosis all the best 
have a blast especially being your first time youll be blown away no matter even if you dont know a single song they kill it sound excellent and the stage show is captivating 
i always make a spotify playlist of the set list beforehand to listen to in the days before the show  youve got time to learn some lyrics im sure 
its typically the same yes 

im excited to go still because theyre never a bad time but this is probably my least favorite set list of all the tours ive gone out for  and ive seen them many many times 
that said theres some great songs on there regardless  itll be a great show no matter what
the amount of people on this post who are like right when you rent you can treat the property like complete shit and if you break something the landlord can just pay for it and fix it 

yall are the reason shitty slumlords and predatory property management are about all thats left these days honest good landlords lost all incentive and will to rent their properties out to you heathens
thank you 

there is a difference between op and the all too common deranged homeless person who is chasing you threatening you assaulting you brandishing a weapon leaving feces and drug paraphernalia in the open and creating a massive biohazard engaging in lewd sexual behavior in public stealing breaking into homescars littering the streets with mountains of garbage etc


pretending their isnt is silly 


the sub lacks compassion for the latter for good reason
so bummed it isnt on the set list this tour 
if you dont live with them and youre at their house you sure do need their consent could be advance consent  its cool if you masturbate whenever doesnt bother me  or quick is this cool beforehand but youre most certainly not entitled to whip out your genitals and start going for it at someone elses house whenever you damn feel like it relationshipfwb or not without prior permission

ive seen them probably way too many times so ive gotten to enjoy a lot of dream tracks live over the years so its hard to decide what id want for a full set list given how many ive seen and how much variety there is

trying to give the newest album some slots and thinking about songs i havent heard livehavent heard live in ages and without overthinking it too hard

1 bassem sabry i got way too into this song after hearing it live no shame
2 peace to all freaks
3 id engager 
4 gronlandic edit
5 how lester lost his wife
6 coquet coquette 
7 virgilian lots
8 nightsift
9 sophie calle private game
10 i was a landscape in your dream
11 touched somethings hollow
12 hmm
13 blab sabbath lathe of maiden
14 we will commit wolf murder

encore 

1 st sebastian 
2 deliberate selfharm ha ha
3 suffer for fashion 

ive been to numerous shows on every tour since 2011 so have seen a lot of setlist variety the one tour i missed was for ur fun and i really regret it  wouldve been an amazing nye show  because ive really been loving peace to all freaks st sebastian and deliberate selfharm ha ha lately and wouldve loved to see those tracks live

not that into the setlist for this tour that ive seen posted so far but its never a bad show so im excited nonetheless
was going to say the same thing

op your problem is this entitled why wont girls love me other men are getting women but i havent even been kissed i have a stable job and want a family why are women not lining up for me attitude

the fact that youve even mentioned or considered a mail order brideimporting a wife situation speaks to some of the reasons why you are not finding a partner a girlfriend or spouse is not someone you pick out of a catalog and provide for in exchange for sex loyalty and the partnership of your dreams  
a relationship like youre describing happens organically because you have a good personality genuine love to grow with another person and bring more to the table than cash and stability

if youre looking for a person to have your children live in your house and be given the title of wife youre not going to find a loving genuine relationship because youre not looking for a partner youre looking to check off a list of goals and milestones that screams desperation  which no one finds attractive  and possessive  which is also a huge turn off that attitude also tells potential partners that you dont really care about them just what theyre doing for you or have to offer you

  
the point of starting a family getting married and building a long term relationship is doing it with someone you genuinely care about enjoy and love you should find yourself inspired to do those things with someone youve been dating not entering every relationship assuming its going to get to that point just because you can provide financially and have a house to offer  none of that shit matters to a partner of quality its about the genuine quality of the relationship not how rich or poor the partner may be 

if youre just looking to get laid hire a sex worker for the love of god dont import a wife from a poorer country who would only be with you because she is essentially selling herself into servitude with you  and who will almost definitely leave you as soon as she establishes permanent residency and will absolutely resent you from day one that kind of shit is really exploitative and gross and the fact that youre open to it shows that youre not looking for a real partner just someone to tote around as a wife

i highly recommend some therapy first and foremost 

from there as others have mentioned what do you bring to the table no not stability or financial wellbeing personality hobbies etc you have managed to convey zero of that in this post which tells me you likely havent held it to the same importance as having a decent paycheck and working out  which is absolutely a problem

ukellysweetheart

the posted subreddit rules  which we expect every user to familiarize themselves with before posting and follow accordingly  clearly indicates in rule 4 that posts regarding bugs technical errors and account related issues are prohibited 

we are not directly affiliated with hirez it is pretty clearly stated under the rules in numerous places that if you have a bug technical error or account issue the place to address that is on the official smite discord channel or by opening a ticket with hirez directly  or reaching out to them via their direct social media platforms

no one here can help with crashes on consoles nor compel hirez to respond

continuing to post about it does nothing and your time is better spent reaching out to hirez directly through various platforms 

a post that is titled to include how hirez refuses to respond to an individual users complaintstickets can be classified as a rantpersonal problem  and per rule 3  rsmite is not your personal blog soapbox or helpdesk

the rules are as they are for a reason the amount of misdirected anger ranting unnecessary bug report posts and just plain spam  100 posts in an hour about a game issue that has been identified and is being fixed for example   that come from not enforcing rules like 3 and 4 far outweigh any benefits to allowing those posts to stay up at times the op is no exception and could also have fallen under rule 8

and frankly given that you have absolutely no context because the post was removed in accordance with the subreddit rules im not sure what point you think youre trying to make here

gladstone not holgate

id be curious how old they are too glad theyre still around
i think its definitely different for a lot of men and women

if my partner really wanted me to give it  or anything hisass related  a shot id enthusiastically try it for him once or twice 

but he has expressed that he has zero interest in having that kind of thing done for him and that doesnt disappoint me in the least because i have absolutely no desire to do it and dont think id get anything enjoyable from it and find it super offputting when i think about it

 i havent talked down onabout doing butt stuff on him to him for the record i dont personally find it appealing or see it as something i actively want to explore but i dont want him to feel he cant approach me with those things if hes curiouswants to explore so i keep that to myself fortunately hes very nope not for me about it so were both in the same mindset

on the other hand hes all about anal anal play eating ass all that with me so i think its a preference thing for sure but men are more likely to want to go for it than women from what ive seen

until youre in remission  this wording might make it seem like theres a decent probability youll end up having that experience op but it very much is not the norm

for most of us its a lifelong disability from which there is no remission  and for many it gets worse as time goes on and medication becomes less effective 

not that it cant happen but i dont want you to get your hopes up either  dont let a doctor tell you you should be at that point alreadyever when you know the meds are needed get a second opinion op
damn youre right huuuuge missed opportunity  glad you caught it because even i didnt think of it at first
ive suggested sex therapy but again her ego immediately feels crushed and she feels its her fault for being sexually stunted

at this point it is her fault not for being sexually stunted necessarily but for having too big of an ego to get some therapy and work with her partner in a meaningful way if your ego feels crushed and you shut down any meaningful growth or discussion in your relationship because of it you are not mature enough to be in an adult relationship

if youre unwilling to try anything dont want to take the steps necessary to help yourself grow and work through some of your hang ups and issues but also expect your partner to do 100 of the work and be 100 understanding you are very much the problem

im not saying that she needs to be into everything that op is or that she needs to bend to his every will and be down for everything he wants but it would seem that she recognizes shes too in her head to be a very good sexual partner yet wont do anything to work on it and deflects and points the blame back to op anytime its discussed thats pretty awful

op it doesnt matter what anyone else says  if you are not happy or feeling fulfilled in the relationship be it sexually or otherwise then you have every right to leave   
you can break up with someone for any reason or no reason  if you are no longer feeling it in a relationship or are no longer interested in continuing thats enough of a reason period   
you are not required to stay in a relationship that you arent being fulfilled by just because some of it is good and quite frankly no one should be pressuring you to do so  i imagine your girlfriend wants to be in a relationship with someone who is fully happy and fulfilled not someone who is constantly feeling as though theyre missing out and incompatible

sex is a huge factor in most relationships it is a major part of intimacy and is something that most people value with their partner in some way or another   
a lack of sexual chemistry and sexual fulfillment is a hugely valid reason to leave a relationship especially when you have put as much effort as you have into trying to fix it or work on it and have been met with zero effort by your partner

there are plenty of people out there who think its shallow or superficial to break up over sex and quite frankly they couldnt be more wrong  
these people either dont value sex much have never been in the situation you have where theyve had to make this decision or are inserting their judgmental shaming opinions where they arent needed or wanted to make themselves feel superior in some way

you are the only person who has to live with this relationship and be with your partner therefore it is truly only your opinion and feelings that matter here  
if you are unhappy and feeling incompatible life is too short to continue to beat your head against a wall with a partner who isnt interested in working on things with you 

dont waste 5 more years of your life with someone who isnt right for you let her find someone who will be a better fit for her sexually and go find the right person for you

uthatsmile4646

enough of that consider this a warning before a ban if you cant behave yourself and communicate respectfully you wont be communicating here at all keep it civil
not a man but going to comment anyway so you can possibly expand your post a bit and maybe get some more usefultoyou responses 

why do you ask op 

are you struggling with libido finding that yours is lower than you would like or declining and you are concerned so want to improve it if this is the case id also ask how old you are and how long youve had these concerns


or do you feel your libido is healthy and not of concern but want to level up more so to speak so are just looking for casual practices that could increase it a bit even though youre fine without 


because if its the former you should almost certainly speak with your primary care doctor and perhaps seek to have your hormones  mainly testosterone  checked potentially see a urologist or be recommended to a specialist that can help you directly if its a medical problem  or psychiatric one  things like stretching and supplements might help a little but generally wont do much if you arent identifying addressing and fixing the core issue 


if youre just looking to increase and improve but dont feel you have anything to worry about with it and just want to up your game thats another story 
still doesnt hurt to ask your doctor next time you talk to them as theyll be able to give recommendations more specific to you and what they know of your health


generally maintaining a protein rich healthy balanced diet and getting a lot of vigorous exercise  well balanced exercise that works on different parts of the body as well as cardio  will help nurture a healthy libido  when youre eating like shit and treating your body poorly libido is often one of the first things to get lazy as well 
being sure you arent vitamin deficient and get enough of the core vitamins you need is another one 
in both men and women pornmasturbation habits can impact libido  both positively and negatively  and are a good thing to think about as well 

sleep is another big one good sleep hygiene getting enough sleep etc will help you in all parts of life not just with libido 


cant be of more help beyond that as im not a dude but hopefully someone else can get deeper with it for you
it 100 is and boy am i sick of people who try to reframe it as though its not that bad or could be worse  its absolutely horrible debilitating exhausting depressing and absolutely steals your life from you in many many ways
and to add to this how can you expect someone to have sex with you be satisfied with it and enjoy it at all when youre repulsed by yourself are completely shut off sexually and have no desire to have an open mind or work to please your partner op is very me me me i want a man who is satisfied by the admittedly extremely boring and limited range of things i want to do never anything more which is unreasonably selfish a partnership is just that you may have boundaries and hard limits but how can you expect a partner to be down with the things you want if youll never do the same for them


op desperately needs therapy desperately 
to overcome the selfdefeating insecure selfloathing body imagethoughts about herself and to work to having a more open mind in relationships and towards sex i know therapy isnt an option for everyone but there are  like you said  so many books and other resources to help and guide through this 

op youll be amazed how different relationships feel and work when you value and love yourself are comfortable with your body are open to a mutually satisfying and open minded relationship  sexually and otherwise  and are no longer at odds with yourself  and others  sexually

im so sorry youre feeling this but know you arent alone  many of us can relate myself included 

its very isolating 

no one can possibly understand what this disease is like who doesnt have nih period 

there are people who will try to relate but can never relate on any level stronger than oh yeah ive been really tired when i   which just isnt it not that i dont appreciate that theyre trying to relate its just not the same 

then theres the people who feel like youre being lazy overdramatic etc because ive been really tired before and i was fine 
theres so many people like that and its awful


my partner is amazing and im so grateful for him but i wish he could understand fully what its like hes always understanding and patient but i know he doesnt truly get why i cant do certain things why i feel the way i do a lot and what its like to be truly exhausted i would never want him to go through it and he never makes me feel bad for it but i often wonder what he really thinks about it all since he doesnt truly know 

its hard to relate to people in general because most dont know anything about narcolepsy  or only know the completely inaccurate stereotypes  so trying to explain that you have a severe disability and can never feel rested and start your day 100 points behind everyone else often requires endless explaining and justifying or falls on deaf ears lonely as fuck for real

just know there are others out there suffering through the same horrible disease who feel the same pains and frustrations and who feel for you it sucks that those close to you cant always relate on that level or be as supportive but you arent fully alone 
i hope things improve for you 
my partner and i have been together over 6 years 
we have sex super frequently still every other week we set aside an entire day to do nothing but fuck  we set the downstairs up with lots of fun mood lighting have playlists made watch sexy videos weve shot and go at it for literally 24 hours  sometimes well drink mushroom tea which helps sustain that length too 

we get extremely kinky and wild anytime we have sex its always exciting always super sexually charged and horny and we both tease each other sexually a lot outside of sex 
were highly sexual people talk about sex a lot as a topic  not just about sex between us  and are very sexually open with each other im pretty constantly horny and have a super high sex drive 

theres nothing wrong with this it doesnt have any negative impacts on our relationship and if anything makes it stronger and more fun since our intimate life is healthy and satisfying

but we also talk to each other about other things do other activities and are fine if we arent doing something sexual we discuss issues we work through fights or stressful situations and emotions and dont put off important things indefinitely just to fuck 

theres nothing wrong with being super horny when you guys are together sex is a needed and healthy part of any relationship you should be horny for and around your partner especially this early in the relationship 

but if youre never talking about anything never working through problems or stress and dont do anything or talk about anything its just sex thats not a relationship thats closer to a friends with benefits arrangement 

you both have to decide where your needs are at and what your goals are for the relationship youre young and barely see each other  its okay to just be about sex 
but if youre looking for something more deep and connected on a level that isnt purely sexual you both need to prioritize that and make time to talk about those things 

the fact that shes an adult in college and has a curfew doesnt lend itself well to an adult relationship either
ive also worked in vegas on fremont you have to tune out a lot of shit and focus on your main responsibilities to exist in that type of space on a consistent basis and do your job with the amount of tweakers crazies and just ridiculousness this looks very minor if youre standing farther away from the area and have to be focusing on your job and your place of work expecting employees of another bar or venue to monitor this stage when it isnt their job and notice that this is going on is a bit ridiculous should someone have stepped in absolutely 
but people need to stop pointing fingers at employees who couldnt have been further from needing to take responsibility for this
this has nothing to do with brigading the bar that people keep posting on review sites 

the stage is not associated with them they have no responsibility to watch it or maintain the area nor assign security for the area 

people are so quick to brigade and cancel that theyre doing more harm than good
fitting you should use a gif of portland where securitycops are also nonexistent 
the business was supposed to do what exactly this isnt their stage and this isnt their fault 
yall so ready to brigade you arent even putting your anger in the right place or towards anything worthwhile this is misdirected and does literally nothing
yeah the katana item  sadly for your house not a handheld or backpack item  is really cool customizable in a bunch of colors too
dang really it doesnt say one way or another so i assumed wed get more this long of an event period for 3 tickets total is really silly and the rewards were definitely lackluster 
i was stoked for an actual minigame since the monthly events are so dang repetitive but if its only 3 plays total per person this was weak 
collar training is both a lot more complicated and a lot more simple than it sounds haha

basically just meant  get them a collar put it on them get them to wear it full time  
some cats take to collars right away  the younger they are the easier this will be  and some really hate it you can google guidestips to get cats used to collars  it can be a long and frustrating process with some cats but it is 100 worth it to have the piece of mind of a gpschipped collar if thats something you are willing to invest in and keep on them 247

im telling you  when my kitty got out i have never felt more hopeless i knew that he was microchipped and that if someone picked him up wed get a call but there are so many indooroutdoor cats and strays in my neighborhood and so many overgrown yards for cats to hide i didnt think someone would bring him in  
if we had had a gps collar on him we couldve at least known which block or even which yard to look in that wouldve saved us so much time heartache and frustration i highly recommend it because cats can bolt out at any time and its really helpful to be able to find them yourself

if you do get your cat used to a collar i would not take it off them the point is to have it on 247  which is totally humane and can be comfortable if you get a quality collar that fits well  so that if they do manage to get out somehow  bolt out the door break the screen and jump out etc  you can locate them   
if your cats are still small kittens an airtag is probably a bit too big right now but get them used to a collar anyway so that once theyre a little bigger they can wear one on their collar there are other pet specific gps chipscollars but in my research airtag seemed perfectly accurate and was the most cost effective

x200b

as for spayneuter  get this done asap seriously youll be a lot happier and so will they especially if theyre a male and female pair this cant wait you will end up with kittens   
if its a cost thing look up spay and save type programs there are low income programs for this and it might take time to get scheduled but its extremely important  
as for separating them after i would follow your vets recommendations 

there might be clinicslow income help for vaccines and such too if thats why youve delayed

when giving cats liquid medication unless the vet advises otherwise it is always easier for them to ingest it when mixed with a wet food for example the liquid dewormer i give my kittens i squeeze the syringe onto a small portion of wet food and mix it in being careful not to spread the medication into the bowl but instead keeping it concealed on the food dont do this with too much because they wont finish it but give them each their own bowl separately monitoring them one at a time to make sure they eat it all  ideally do this when theyre hungry not close to a meal

i personally have never trimmed my cats nails nor had it done at the vet i make sure to have quality scratching poststoys everywhere in the house and this has always been enough for me   
people tend to get their cats nails trimmedtrimmed them when they scratch a lot or use furniture as scratching posts if you play with them often provide plenty of toysscratching posts and redirect them when theyre scratching at peoplefurniture you may never need to do this  
i still do the paw rubs to get them used to having their toes touched just in case and because it can be helpful in general for them not to be skittish when touched in that way  
you have to be careful when trimming because you can hurt them if youre interested in doing it yourself frequently i would take them to the vet to have it done again and ask the vet to walk you through it and watch while you do a nail or two they should have no problem doing that they should also be able to recommend products to help with this

it sounds like youve got an awesome scratch cactus for them so far i get little scratch pads that i can mount to the wallsides of furniture in addition to scratching posts and they have a cat tree with beds and posts on it as well  
cats are fickle  some will like certain toys and not others so it can be tricky to find the right stuff make sure and get some active toys not just scratching materials  stuff that encourages them to run around and play actively not lazily so they maintain a good weight

best of luck with your kitties it sounds like you love them a lot and want to do the absolute best for them youre gonna do just fine

some of us absolutely would 

ive suffered in ways most people i meet cant imagine 

goddamn right id give a hand up to absolutely every person i care about who has helped me or who ive seen suffer in my time
id get myself a decent house modest and safe vehicle and a couple practical luxuries  like a nicer computer some decent shoes etc  and from there id be trying however i could to fix and lift up the community around me 
i know that and can say that firmly because thats how ive lived any time ive had any come up  it wasnt straight into savings with the extra or straight to luxuries it was quick to who can i help with this who will fall otherwise 

so speak for yourself yeah gross amounts of wealth changes a person but if you have truly good values and know who you are it doesnt have to be a negative greedy change
storming out is what a child does when they dont get their way 

adults in adults relationships talk things out and if one partner is refusing to apologize they continue to discuss and share perspectives and feelings and come to a reasonable end of the conversation or make a decision to revisit it later throwing a tantrum over a joke that fell flat and then running off to stay at your condo because you didnt get the apology you wanted is childish as fuck and a major overreaction this was a joke it doesnt warrant this level of meltdown period
right 

theyre super annoying to interact with but the items are mostly great 
the pagoda pyramid and sphinx katana these are all awesome items  i honestly love all of his furniture items but those have been the most useful and versatile for me 
i do find his task a bit tedious but it really doesnt take that long

gullivarrrs items i have had less use for but theyre still really cool and his task takes literally 60 seconds one piece and youre done

i dont get all the hate  is he annoying absolutely but the items make it worth it

agreed 100

to me  woman  this is funny id laugh with my partner after a great night and wed be on our way i cant imagine losing my cool over a joke even if i did find it offensive 

the level to which op escalated this is extremely childish and ridiculous and if i were ops boyfriend i would be considering if i wanted to be with someone who threw a tantrum over a joke 
if a joke falls flat it falls flat thats it explain you didnt find it funny and move the fuck on it doesnt require an argument storming off like a child to stay at your condo or anything more than a eh that wasnt funny to me lets skip that one next time 

if he continued to make jokes like this after that sure it would warrant further discussion and eventually be a bigger problem but man talk about an overreaction

i might commenting to save this and remind myself to get back to you later i upgraded to an embroiderysewing machine last year from just one that sews and now that i think about it i have no idea what i did with the old one  which means its still in my house somewhere in a box in excellent working condition
just gotta find it ill look for it tonight and its yours if i find it
collar train your cats and get them airtag collars if you have serious concern of them getting out  honestly everyone should do this its impossible to find your cat once they get out most of the time and something horrible can happen so fast that its worth it 

a microchip is great too and i recommend doing that as soon as you can but if your cats get out a microchip does nothing unless someone catches them and brings them into a vetshelter to scan an airtag allows you to track them 


back in june my kitty got out  bolted when scared by a loud car backfiring as my partner came inside had never even shown interest in the door before  and trying to find him felt so hopeless we literally didnt sleep for 3 days searching endlessly through the neighborhood and putting up posters 
ultimately he was mauled to death by an off leash unmanaged pit bull just a few houses down the owner didnt even stay to see if he was okay or take responsibility just immediately bolted from the scene and then tried to lie to animal control  fortunately other neighbors witnessed and gave their side of the story to the officer 
i wouldve given anything to have been able to know what block he was on nonetheless what house he was hiding at he was chipped but if he had an airtag or other gps collar we couldve maybe brought him home 

sounds like youre doing everything right for them so far if the screens are a concern make sure to keep the windows cracked with next to no room so they cant bust the screens and get out  they will believe me  or try to reinforce them somehow 

enjoy your kitty friends

not just that but establishing yourselfkids on medicaid in a new state  once you get approved  and finding doctors dentists specialists etc 
best hope there isnt a waitlist for all those things that the doctors you get are even remotely competent that you can get the same prescriptions carried over and same standards of care and that the providers that are covered are easily accessible and reasonably close to where you live 

people seem to not factor medicaldental care and coverage  especially if theyre on medicaid or plan to be  in out of state moves its a huge factor that can go wrong in a lot of ways 

yknow before you start factoring in the sheer cost of an out of state move  moving truck transporting all your positions gasflights breaking a lease or moving out costs new depositfirstlast months rent application fees savings while finding secure jobs etc 

thats simply not doable for most people it requires massive savings which most cant accrue anymore this is not a remotely reasonable suggestion for someone in poverty ever
its daily as in a thread that is posted and refreshed daily not daily achievements as in common achievementsfrequent achievements 

this absolutely belongs in the dailyposted achievements thread because it is exactly what that stickied thread aims to keep from clogging up the sub couldnt be more clear what that thread is intended for which is this kind of content
the plaid pantry on woodstock and 55th has always been semi chill but the other day my partner went in for a quick stop and was greeted on the way out by a tweaker with a literal nail bat wrapped in spiked wire
the guy asked him for a cigarette and when that was a no asked for change and blocked him off from getting back in his car boyfriend handed him 2 as thats all the cash he had and the guy finally moved

a fucking nail bat weve been having more and more unfortunate encounters in our neighborhood lately it used to be so mellow
theyre kids  thats cool shouldve thought about that and lined up early enough to get a spot that would accommodate them without ruining the view of everyone else then 

the kids excuse means absolutely nothing to me i dont care about your kids 
i paid an absurd amount of money to be on this vacation and if you wanted your kid to have a specific viewexperience its your job to plan for it and get them there early enough to do it without intruding on the vacation a stranger is having
haha no problem its not immediately obvious if youre not used to looking for collections of posts glad i was able to help 
just click on ops profile you will see the posts as theyre the only post on their profile currently 

well done op really enjoyed looking at these and your past submissions
didnt say anything about orgasm 

if it isnt fun or enjoyable thats an issue foreplay isnt for the woman while piv is for the man  and if thats how youre looking at sex i feel awful for you
an 8 year old has no place being there either period 

if its a kids free event your shitty 8 year old is a kid and you can find a babysitter

rules for thee but not for me is a shitty way to do anything small business or not
that is the fun part for you  uh and the actual intercourse isnt this wording 
foreplay should be enjoyable for both partners anyway as should the rest of the act
god i hope youre joking 

cant imagine agreeing with ops hypocritical and toxic rules and point of view

an 8 year old has no business being at an event like this bosses kid or not 

and regardless of if anyone else will argue it this sends a clear message  i dont value my employees and any rules made only apply to everyone else i am above all rules and considerations and am entitled to do as i wish regardless of anything and everyone else 

good luck maintaining a healthy enjoyable working  or camping event  environment if you go down that road op
these events are usually child free as they should be because its an event adults look forward to all year so they can get drunk and let loose but because were above the rules and our kid is so important and perfect and mature were going to make everyone uncomfortable and bring them anyway doesnt matter that an 8 year old will be uncomfortable in this environment and make all the adults uncomfortable too oh other employees with kids absolutely not were the bosses so we get to bring our kid but that one employee with the wife i dont like better find other arrangements so i dont have to deal with his heathens

not a counter point at all i dont personally think 

ordering a bunch of parts on the internet and piecing them together in your house is nothing like the savis experience building a lightsaber in their workshop and carrying it out into batuu after with a group of other builders feeling the emotion and experiencing the atmosphere not comparable to online shopping whatsoever
yes and i have an invisible disability even 


narcolepsy  no i dont fall asleep randomly or collapse into slumber out of the blue with no notice and start snoring 


but i have been asked to leave various stores restaurants bars etc and have been hassled on public transportation and even at airports or doctors officesappointments 


a sleep attack can cause me to feel extremely dazed fatigued unsteady perhaps dizzy or faint it makes it difficult to think see clearly communicate properly sit upright  need to lean or use more exhausted posture i dont just lay down 

it feels like suddenly being hit by the worlds largest and heaviest truck physically with an unimaginable heaviness crushing down upon you and mentally youre experiencing every fatigueexhaustion symptom possible while your brain and body try to fight the blurred sleepwake phase you live in constantly becoming even more chaotic 


it can be hard to verbalize whats going on i can slurstutter a bit or be very confusedhave trouble vocalizing or finding the right words its like talking to someone whos struggling to come out of anesthesia or who hasnt slept in 72 hours and is being woken up with an air horn every time theyre about to drift off 


i have because of this been accused of being drunk on drugs mentally insanepsychotic of being a mentally ill homeless person here to cause problems of having something seriously wrong with me of trying to pull some kind of scamact off with malicious intent etc


i have been refused service because of this at all kinds of places told to leave hassled and judged and have had security or law enforcement called on me in all kinds of places youd never expect 


i never just fall asleep in public or lay downstart trying to nap or rest anywhere outside of my home 
at most i have sat leaning against a wall  in a proper seat not just randomly where its inappropriate  or using my hand to lean my head up when a table is in front of me eyes still open to breathe through it 
do i look exhausted and drained yes but no im not sleepingeyes closed 


i think a lot of it has to do with me having substantial tattoo work  all professionally done well kept and not vulgar or offensive  and being a younger small female 


people are very quick to judge and assume i must be on drugs or up to something because someone who looks like me couldnt possibly be disabled or experiencing medical distress 

this wouldnt be that noticeable to employees at various establishments if they werent already profiling me for how i look and then noticing that something is off  not that they wouldnt notice when orderingserving at a food placebar or at a cash register for example but this happens far more outside of those actual interactions 


i dont go out anywhere anymore unless i am dressed well makeup done and hair styled  i am assumed to be homelesssome kind of drug addict lowlife if i am not overly presentable despite neither being true  and have a note in my bag about my situation with a number to call my partner or doctor  i dont want to get into a situation where i am too exhausted and burdened by my symptoms to properly explain and am physically removedhassled by security or store employees who think theyre sticking it to another homeless nut job who dared act up in their store 


its pretty ridiculous embarrassing and hurtful i can only imagine what its like for those with more visible disabilities
curious did you end up going with hatch or did you opt to give chroma a try 

the chroma trial definitely has me loving it over hatch but you also cant export in trial mode so i dont know how my designsdigitizing would turn out when actually stitching and that has me unsure as to whether i like hatch better or not
ive done this  it doesnt 

got one from goodwill  i couldnt resist even though i have a few he looked so sad there   and did two wash cycles on hot waterhigh because germsbugs paranoia 
i tied him in a pillow case made sure it was fastened between the two washes and even dried him on medium heat in the dryer  still in a case but with a blanket in there too so he wouldnt bash around  and he was perfectly fine no paint loss at all

a clorox wipe will also do a good job with the plastic parts if youre too worried

so is christmas halloween new years thanksgiving fourth of july memoriallabor days valentines mothersfathers day etc 

every day is just another day  but some people enjoy holidays celebration and feeling a sense of joy on occasion to break up the usual just another days that fill the majority of our lifetime 
birthdays especially are a day for and about you specifically to celebrate your time on earth and making it through another long harsh year of living

whats your point
god i hate when people make that comment

its not a competition and peoples need to be seen as more tired or more exhausted from doing more is pathetic and obnoxious 

but as you say if it were a competition people without narcolepsy wouldnt even begin to stack up 
people really dont want to hear that though and it seldom changes their views or mind 
theyre still going well a single mom with 4 young kids is still way more tired than you or well im a nurse and with my hours i promise you dont even know what tired is
nope point still stands 

people can only really relate by comparing what they know tiredexhaustion to be they have no idea what narcolepsy feels like or does to a person  and the symptoms that come alongside the exhaustion  so cant fathom that its possible to feel this bad i wish there was a simulator we could put people in 
i highly recommend getting a second opinionfinding another doctor if at all possible that is not the legally binding max dose anywhere in the us
he is likely saying its the max dose he prescribes or the max dose for you with him but its clearly not enough for you and by no means is your only option
40mg is the adhd max around 60mg for narcolepsy you absolutely could take a booster or higher dose and a great many of us do i take close to 60mg all ir all at my leisure throughout the day i literally started on 10mg and it was nothing so was gradually brought up over time 

if you can definitely seek out another doctor i understand the fear since its a controlled substance but his word isnt law and if you arent getting the care and treatment you need fuck him find you a good doctor 


the 30 day supply90 day appointment thing is the case in many stateswith many insurance companies 


i can only have a 30 day supply at a time but my prescription is mailed to me every month and i havent had an appointment to check up on it in over a year 


from my understanding its at the requirement of both your insurance and doctor how often you have to come in to get more prescriptions written but 30 day supply limit is standard everywhere in the us 

the max dose thing is separate from this and 20mg is way lower period
do dogs live anywhere near you do people walk their dogs anywhere near you cars do cars exist in your vicinity 
if yes you have predators there that can and may easily kill them if  sorry when  they get out 

my well behaved  since you seem to think that makes a difference  indoor cat who wanted nothing to do with the outdoors for almost 3 years bolted outside when startled when i was coming in with groceries 
literally had to push past me and squeeze through because i barely had the door open at all and was carefully sliding in 
he always would sit and stretch and meow hello when i got home never even sniffed around a door i never wouldve expected this
this was june and it still hurts every day 

i searched for him tirelessly for 3 days literally didnt sleep 

he was mauled to death by a pit bull four houses down the bitch that owned the hellhound fled the scene and didnt even stay to see if he survived my neighbor who witnessed the attack  and who had my number from lost fliers i immediately started putting up  called me and i flew down the street to her backyard he took his last breath next to me while i sobbed and screamed uncontrollably 

i live in a dense nice neighborhood you wouldnt think theres many predators but dogs exist and theyre everywhere 
you dont think itll happen to you but it can anytime a cat gets loose theres predators everywhere for cats that are frantic and out of their element 

cats are hit by cars way too often over here and it kills me every time i hear about it on nextdoor
outdoor or strayferal cats raccoons coyotes  theyre in more places than youd think  certain birds diseases shitty humans its absolutely an issue where you are

and frankly why would you take the risk put a damn roof on the thing for the piece of mind and safety of your cats its a nobrainer and then you dont have to worry about it you already put this much effort into building the thing finish it properly
your doctor said 20mg is the max dose or the max dose for you
out of curiosity because it definitely isnt the max dose prescribeable
on the flip side 10mg is pretty low for a great deal of us id be useless on that tiny dose

op has been taking adderall for 10 years it sounds like  its hard to tell from their wording exactly how long theyve been on it but a diagnosis over a decade ago leaves me to assume stimulants have been involved that long or close to it 
a dose that high  or near it  isnt unreasonable especially given tolerance 

many people who take xr take an ir booster for many reasons ir allows you to choose when you need that extra boost depending on your schedule and other life factors for a lot of people with narcolepsy  and adhd as well for that matter  find that xr does not work or last anywhere near 12 hours especially after prolonged use 

not saying op couldnt use to switch up their meds or play with changing the dose but i dont think anything in their post seems wildly out of the ordinary  aside from their energy levels which quite frankly could just be a result of worsening narcolepsy as i know im not alone in finding that it has gotten progressively worse over the years
maybe because its extremely expensive often doesnt cover a whole lot  unless youre paying for the reeeeeally expensive plans  and still has crippling deductibles 

dental care and dental insurance are abhorrently overpriced and inaccessible for many its not a why dont you just purchase  when so many cant even get close to affording it
i will say from experience lip gets to be a pain to reapply all day and if youre eatingdrinking frequently  or tend to purse your lips a lot in the heat or need frequent chapstick  it tends to get messy even with the best makeup 
the dots will be easier to keep neat and likely last longer if thats the route you go  

have a great visit im sure youll look awesome no matter what you go with
i went to the may 4th after hours event  at west  and ended up doing just the lip makeup 
when i added the dots i personally felt it looked a bit too padme even though the rest of my costume was sith themed and i didnt do my hair like her i think its just such an iconic look that thats instantly where the mind goes but that doesnt mean the rest of the outfit wont stand out or itll be too close just that you cant really do the same makeup without thinking of the original character that wore it 


i think it just depends on your overall look  how are you doing your hair what other costume pieces are you wearing  as to if it looks too similar or not but it sounds like if youre trying for a naboo tourist look even if it does look too padme that isnt a bad thing because a tourist might wear something on purpose to give that kind of nod 

otherwise i agree that ditching the dots or moving the dots  temples along the forehead near the lips  would be a way to keep them but avoid being too similar to padme
agreed  and ive seen quite a few posts randomly while scrolling my front page sharing this sentiment so it isnt just youus 

i only need one more so im hopeful that ill get it in the next before the goals end but its been a slow crawl in comparison to the other tasks 
a few of my friends market boxes have stacks of 10 possibly multiple stacks so some people are getting them but the rng does seem a lot worse than the other goals weve had recently 

i hope youre able to get them in time if the rng is going to be this bad they should at least allow for market box purchases to count at least adds a little extra chance

i dont want to taste my own vaginal fluids and find the thought of going down on a woman absolutely repulsive but i still enjoy receiving oral from my male partner i would never make him do it and have expressed many times that if he isnt into it he doesnt have to do it and i would never have an issue with that 

likewise he doesnt want to taste his own semen but is happy that i enjoy swallowing 

your ultimatum is really pointless and this outlook is incredibly immature 
i doubt most dudes are demanding that you act like its the best taste on earth if they are thats an issue specific to those partners  most men enjoy the sensation and experience but certainly understand it isnt the most enjoyable for some women and are just happy with whatever youre comfortable with so long as its fulfilling their needs just like you have clearly indicated you expect in return
i just wanted to chime in and say that while i have not had a hysterectomy myself your feelings regarding maid are valid and if thats the route you want to go i hope you are able to do so and find peace 

all the comments acting like youre ridiculous for not wanting to go through this process because its relatively safe and theyve had decent quality of life seem to miss the fact that its your choice and not everyone wants to endure these things and struggle through all the steps necessary to recover or gain any decent quality of life afterwards 

ive been severely chronically ill my entire life im exhausted 247 there are definitely some things i would not be willing to go through at this point regardless of the small potential benefits 
ending up in surgically induced menopause is definitely one of those things  ive seen how that played out for my grandmother and mother and it was a nightmare  and i would lose the last bits of comfort i have in this life to that ordeal 
i am not willing to sacrifice my sex life put my sexual setup at risk or endure the awful bullshit that is menopause when im already struggling to be present in 1 of my life as is 

given all the extra risks and factors for you i just wanted to validate your concerns and say that no matter what you decide youre not wrong in doing what you feel is right for you even if other people would choose differently
its not just stds you need to worry about here 

vaginal infections like yeast infections or bacterial vaginosis are a huge risk and problem  and quite frankly come with disgusting symptoms and often require really unpleasant medication  as well as utis and other consequences of putting bacteria where it doesnt belong 

doesnt matter if youre std free and hygienic  these can and will eventually develop if youre being this careless
not sure what your partners balls are like or how youre doing it but no its never been anything like this for me
came here to say exactly this 

they would 100 not be my soulmate if sex wasnt a priority enjoyable shared activity and active part of our relationship period 

i value sex sexual compatibility and would not be happy in  nor stay in  a relationship without an active fulfilling sex life where our sex drives are similar kinks match up etc 

sure things happen and it may be less frequent at times or take a pause when big life events happen but in general its very important to me in a relationship and i wouldnt feel fulfilled or invested without it  and a partner who would be my soul mate and match with me on that level would have the same values and thoughts around sex
inside is what we do most often and its always enjoyable 

i really love swallowing so thats a favorite too but we dont do it as often because we typically with intercourse but its fun when it does happen

i love when he finishes during anal too but its a bit more effort cleanup wise so is also not as frequent 

neither of us are a huge fan of him finishing outside of meon me its a mess and it isnt as satisfying for either of us sensationwise to finish pulled out so to speak

trying to give it a fair chance so listened through it a few times today for the first time and will revisit it a few more  im seeing them next month so want to at least be familiar with the songs not knowing which might show up on tour 

so far the only songs sticking for me are hmm and nightsift  and honestly i love these two tracks 


hmm really resonates with me and feels very raw and emotional  the grief lyrics hit its been a year of loss for me so this song just clicked immediately 

nightsift surprised me  first listen i was definitely ready to listen again and process it in more depth but wasnt sure if i liked it
since that first play earlier ive honestly probably listened to it 50 times today its really catchy to me but not in the way you usually think of catchy the lyrics are a lot to digest but they sound good and the song just works somehow it just feels very polished and interesting to me like i cant stop listening to it and enjoying all the components 

the rest of the tracks havent hit for me yet i dont have them dont dislike them but dont feel any attachment or draw to them at all kind of a miss for me so far but i expect them to grow on me 

overall dont hate it and even if i only end up liking the two tracks and the rest dont click for me i would be satisfied with that because i really love these two tracks 

ill be curious to see what songs make it into the rotation on their tour next month and how they translate live really hoping for nightsift at minimum hmm would be a treat but i might also have an emotional breakdown 
i hope you can find something 
these seem fairly easy to make yourself with minimal skill but i know crafting isnt everyones cup of tea  or the energyother capacity for it just isnt there  so a knockoff would definitely be easier  

maybe reverse image search and see if you can find anything similar browsing google images or shopping
i feel like maybe shein aliexpress alibaba or something of that nature could have something similar 
the quality wont be fantastic but then you can play around with paddingaltering them for your needs and have a few pairs at a cheap price for when they wear out 
alternatively theres some fashion knockoff subreddits maybe check there good luck
agreed 

i always used to be self conscious that the experience wasnt actually that good for my partner but was something he did to please meenjoy seeing me experiencing pleasure 
even though i knew i have good hygiene smell perfectly normal and all that i was always self conscious and couldnt relax during thinking it must smelltaste unpleasant or be a chore

when my partner verbalized how much he enjoys it craves the tastesmell and gets into it it completely changed my feelings towards receiving and made it an enjoyable experience for me and not a tense one 100 verbalize op its a compliment to her and might help her more than you know
this is a designer brand selling fingerless leather fashion gloves not a brand for or marketed at disabled people specifically and in no way selling these as wheelchair gloves  in fact im sure theyd prefer them not to be used in that way and rather as a high end fashion item

these would likely not be that great for the wearer anyway if the intended purpose was a disability aid as they arent constructed to be durable comfortable and supportive for those kinds of needs
definitely feels different

the lazy spooning taking it from behind on my side position feels amazing and is great when were both feeling low energy  tired before bed first thing in the morning etc  but definitely feels different than if im laying on my stomach on my knees with my chesthead down or on all fours all those different angles feel a bit different and allow for varying levels of deepnessforce behind each thrust
i would love the candle holders i collect brasshave my entire home office space done in brass pieces and these would look amazing amongst my collection

the lamps are gorgeous too and would get use with us but dont want to be greedy 
i asked about any potential risks of continuing the pill beforeduringafter surgery and multiple doctors told me they are negligible at best and there was nothing to worry about

ask your doctor if you are concerned as they will better know your circumstances medical history risks etc
i hadnt given this album a shot yet  i wasnt a huge fan of their last the one time i listened through so have been a bit nervous since im seeing them in september and dont want to dread the new tracks  but decided to listen to hmm and nightsift to start after reading your comment and i love these two tracks im going to give the full album a proper listen this evening but even if these are the only 2 i enjoy from it id be plenty satisfied

yeah id order some surgery safe jewelry to pop in right beforehand just to be on the safe side 
hopefully those work and its a relatively easy swap for you whenever your appointment comes up
ah gotcha i feel like for most piercings theres no chance theyre going to close in the very short time youre required to have them out but no idea about nipples
im confused why piercings would close up arent you only required to take them out for the surgery which takes a couple hoursnot even an entire day unless you just got the piercing im not sure how it would close up unless im missing something

hope you find someone awesome who you can excitegets you excited like this when the time is right 
haha we are both very lucky indeed

i feel super silly about it and it definitely can be embarrassing andor inconvenient but i also cant really complain too much  its pretty wild sometimes how quickly the brain can just switch into primal sex mode over something without you really controlling it
a past partner said he would get extremely uncomfortably horny if not a pretty decent halfboner when he thought he was smelling the lotionperfume i wore all the time while out in public 
i was never sure if i really believed him at the time but ive definitely been accidentally conditioned in similar ways since so its definitely a thing 

i hate that one of those things is eye contact with my partner for me we used to never really make eye contact much during sex  no reason just wasnt a big focus i would often close my eyes when giving oral as more of a focus thing  and somehow 7 years later weve gotten into some pretty kinky shit and yet direct eye contact has been a newer thing that drives me crazy the downside is when we have that same direct eye contact in our day to day my brain switches to crazy horny mode immediately regardless of circumstances
yep couldnt agree more

a lot of people who wantlike children are toxic as hell about it like theres something wrong with you if you arent absolutely wild about the gross little shits and everyone is required to want to deal with 18 years of hell because its some sort of miracle and beautiful journey 
i also personally find those with that special kind of intense over the top desire to raise a child by birth a bit narcissistic but thats just me 


yeah my childhood was horrendous but i dont want kids because i find them horrendous which has no ties to my childhood traumas
my life is hard enough without a sticky mouth to feed and as someone with severe chronic illness im frankly doing the world a favor by not procreating

plus all those great things you give up nope
i dont believe youre seriously asking me this as if you somehow dont know but to give you the benefit of the doubt ill put it very simply

youre not having physical sexual contact with someones political views you are with their genitals do the math as to why one is more relevant here than the other

i dont believe you have to disclose every piece of information up front that could potentially change someones views as if reading off some kind of list i do believe you need to be honest if they ask you and i do believe if theres something out of the ordinary or something that could impact someones attractioncomfortpreference you need to disclose it before sex period

theres a reason this trans woman in the op had sex with the lights off and didnt tell him until after she was being intentionally deceitful
the word deceitful is literally in the title he obviously does mention it

x200b

youre being willfully daft and its obnoxious 

x200b

bottom line is when engaging in sexual activity with someone revealing things like this that directly pertain to sex are required for someone to fully consent to having sex with you  
while you might be angry about a hypothetical conservative woman hiding her political beliefs those arent directly related to sex and most people wouldnt assume that they have relevance to that decision i dont think it needs explaining why something like this in ops scenario does
this is the right answer period 

theres no need for well hypothetically what if it was someone who had reconstructive surgery but wasnt trans or yeah but you liked them before  the bottom line is that lying and deceiving someone in order to engage in a sexual encounter is wrong and doesnt allow that person to consent fully 
i would say this about anything  regardless of peoples views on the trans element here they were intentionally dishonest and misled op
he has every right to feel hurt angry upset etc
mostly applies to damn near any laws here 

drug decriminalization means rampant methheroin abuse open air drug markets everywhere dodging used needles on every sidewalk and absolutely unhinged tweakers everywhere

shootings are rampant and very few are solved or consequenced 

we might as well refer to our legal system as catch and release  if caught at all violent menacing offenders are released quickly and likely not truly consequenced 

property theftcrimes are constant

we have a living wage shortage here lets get it right 

the jobs struggling to fill positions are largely not paying enough to make it worth working them 

the jobs that do pay enough to live have a crazy amount of competition anytime theres an opening 

the wages here have absolutely not gone up enough for the majority to make col manageable
uroguerunway

in the interest of fairness consider this a warning also if you dont have anything nice to say move along
alrighty ugarbagelumi thats enough asking people to not be dicks in response to your comments but then snapping back with this level of venom to other users is unacceptable

the report button exists for a reason  if someone is bothering you or being disrespectful report it and move on you are still expected to follow the rules of the subreddit and remain civil to others regardless of the comments other users make 

consider this a warning
absolutely not 

the period of time i was collecting pua  pandemic unemployment for nonw2 jobs  was the best period of my life 
i could afford to live put money in savings and have a safety net and i got to actually enjoy and live my life instead of spending every waking second struggling to survive in constant fear and anxiety 

fuck a job for those of us without the privilege of a high paying career we can actually enjoy and thrive inbe genuinely passionate about its all menial busy work bullshit 
who wants to work entry level minimum wage jobs retail fast food are you kidding me
its all demeaning exhausting horrible busy work nonsense no one wants to do and when it doesnt even pay a living wage its no surprise theyre struggling to staff those awful positions 

i think a great many of us would rather not work the jobs available for the crap pay out there these days
a great many of us would rather be able to enjoy our time on this earth instead of selling it for a pittance 

and for those of us like me who are disabled and will be for the rest of our miserable lives being able to afford to exist while not crippling and killing ourselves further in what few low paying positions are available to us would be a godsend
i just picked up my cats ashes on friday 

iggy was my best friend a type of service animal and my little shadow that followed me everywhere and was very social and involved in each part of my day 
he died unexpectedly after being mauled by a horrible womans pit bull and had a lot of life left to live so i hadnt really put much thought into his final arrangements before the time came prematurely 

i am keeping his ashes in the bamboo urn the crematorium provided and have his clay paw print ink paw impressions and fur clippings the crematorium took sitting on a shelf next to it currently i also have a beautiful painting done by an amazing redditor who helped look for him displayed next to his items with a couple toys he loved 
in the future i plan to have some of the ashes made into a piece of jewelry for myself and a small paperweightcrystal type item for my partner

i personally didnt feel spreading his ashes anywhere was appropriate for the situation he was an indoor only cat and lived with me at only two apartments  my old one which was terrible and the townhouse i currently rent which i surely wont be at forever leaving him at either place doesnt feel healing or right so we are keeping the ashes in the urn  possibly to replace with a nicer urn later  and will be bringing them with us wherever we move to be ideally spread or kept with us when we pass 

some people might think its silly or doesnt signify moving on to keep them around but i couldnt imagine not asking for them getting rid of them or spreading them anywhere though he isnt with us physically anymore i personally feel it gives a lot of respect to those who have passed to keep their ashes safe and displayed honorably  sort of like a gravestone in a way

my mom has done the same with my stepfather who passed tragically this last january 

do what feels right to you if you feel you want to spread them somewhere make a day of it have it be a special event or keep them  you can have all kinds of beautiful things made from them as a keepsake
i would say if youre on the fence absolutely ask to keep them  you can always get rid of them or spread them later but you cant get them back and may have that regret for a lifetime
alrighty comments are getting wildly out of hand here enjoy the art  or dont  and be on your way the sheer amount of juvenile tomfoolery unfolding here has been outrageous and unnecessary
ive never heard the term bonus bones but damn that do be how it is 
its ridiculous im in more pain than ive ever been in in my life thanks to ohp and their terrible dental coverage eating anything is an ordeal and i want to die every time i have to do it but thats what us poors deserve right 

sorry to hear about your illness and financial woes  i hope things start looking up for you even more soon
care credit has a relatively low credit requirement as far as i know so might be worth looking into themsimilar programs but given your situation it may not be viable worth a shot though

hey 500 is something i hope youre able to figure something out and get the work done id look into dental schools in the area but from my experience they tend to be backed up best of luck
dont have any recommendations sadly but wanted to wish you good luck 

its criminal how bad ohps dental coverage is the fact that they wont cover root canals just extractions and then dont cover any form of implants is disgusting
only wealthy people deserve teeth apparently 

wishing you the best of luck i had to have an extraction done because it was all too expensive
are you eligible for care credit or anything of the like

agreed 

cost of living here versus somewhere like kentucky is dramatically higher 
rent all utilities gas parking car insurance health insurance groceries etc all cost more and wont be going down anytime soon 
the quality of life you can provide yourself here might be much much lower depending on your specific savings and what income you manage to get in the future 
i wouldnt leave a low cost of living with a job thats highly invested and provides good benefits nor would i leave a solid medical team  permanently disabled here so i get how important that is and how hard it can be to find 
travel here multiple times a year if you have to but given the high cost of living how much of a nightmare portland is in general and other factors i wouldnt move
im curious have you been to omega mart and if so did you feel they did this tutorial and explanation in a satisfactory way or did you have the same complaints
i felt like it was a perfect balance there
man this would be an interesting new scam i wonder how exactly theyd pull it off and what all it would entail i wouldnt be the least bit surprised but definitely havent heard of this one before

thats awesome i didnt know that ive never been to paris disney but ive wanted to even more ever since they closed dcas tot
two months is way overboard for no sex swimming etc 
completely unnecessary unless youve had specific complications
youre right its fine that youre wrong  glad you can recognize that 
hate that i had to scroll this far to find this answer 

mission breakout feels like the cheap retheming that it is and its bad 

it looks like someone glued a bunch of random computer pieces to a giant tower super ugly and ruins the entire strip that you walk to get to it which used to be a beautiful area framed by the tower 

the ride itself used to be much better too tot was a wonderful ride  yes even though the wdw version is more elaborate  whereas gotg frankly makes zero sense has one of the laziest ride plots ive ever seen and is basically just a bunch of dumb one liners and brief lazy screen flashes 

they couldve kept tot exciting by randomizing the drop sequences and speeding it up like they did for the reskin wedging it into avengers campus was lazy boring and frankly is a huge eyesore from any angle in the park
i think it sometimes depends on the skill level of the giver too 

it sounds like op is maybe not that experienced or that confident in his oral abilities 
if this is the case it could be that his lady would be more into it but he just isnt that great at providing 

or she could be like you said not that into oral in general 
i think op could use to talk to her about it  are you not that into oral in general or are there things i could be doing to make this more enjoyable for you  and perhaps try to improve his skills a bit before writing it off entirely as if she isnt into it at all unless of course she agrees that it isnt her thing

i generally prefer penetration but my partner is awesome at oral so i always really enjoy it too before him oral wasnt my thing because my partners werent good at it and despite my best attempts at giving them tips or guiding them it was lackluster

this is awesome would love to enter 

have a friend whos going through a really tough time and is crazy into dnd would love to surprise him with this
thats definitely privilege speaking i would say 

as much as i would also prefer to pay for my own hotel and attempt to be reimbursed if facing this situation not everyone can afford that i know i certainly couldnt afford nights of hotel with no guarantee of reimbursement right now and we dont know if op has disposable income perhaps theyre just starting this job and are desperately awaiting pay 
many of us dont have the privilege of emergency savings
ive had some great experiences with couchsurfingcom so wanted to chime in and vouch for it as a good possible option 

granted its been quite some years  last time i used it when traveling was 2016  but i have been hosted countless times in the past and never once had a bad experience  and im a very small female who was traveling solo and was pretty young a good deal of the times make sure and read the persons reviews and make sure everything sounds above board  and trust your gut if you get a weird vibe when chatting with them over messages to arrange or even when you show up to meet them  but at least when i used it last there were a lot of genuine awesome people in that community 

i used to host via couchsurfing as well  couple apartments ago inner se portland  and met some fantastic people traveling from all over for various reasons  in town for work and wanted a unique experience couldnt afford typical accommodations etc 

i still talk to a few of them today even 

definitely check it out and see if you can find something that way if other offers dont work out

if you find yourself in a true bind with nowhere to turn but a park bench please message me i am not in a great position to host someone right now  going through some bummer times after our cat was murdered and things have been a bit chaotic  but we have a large two floor apartment with a couch kitchen and a shower and are safe good people if you truly have nowhere else to turn

you cant have it every way you want all the time thats not how life works 

if you cant transport yourself to work but need a job you need to start looking at work from home options 

the government isnt going to subsidize schedule and arrange transportation for you to and from whatever job you choose that is not a program that exists  at most they will expect you to take public transportation and provide benefits towards that 

if youre trying to move to a city with morebetter options and need money to do so id advise you to start being realistic about your employment options and take what is most feasible so you can save up to move somewhere with better opportunities 

im home too much as it is and i cant transport myself to a job put you with little to no options for work


this shit is happening all over the city not in one or two specific wellknown bad areas 
the shootings the stabbings the assaults the carhome breakinsthefts the fires the menacing by insane and unhinged homeless etc are happening all across portland 
you cant just avoid them by sticking to certain areas

never wouldve thought that the block of the nest would be an area to avoid nor that gold dust meridian would be shot up this shit isnt just gang and criminal element shit happening in bad neighborhoods
when there is no law enforced everywhere becomes a bad neighborhood 

theres zero consequences here
i miss when they had pork belly skewers id eat 8 of those suckers in one visit 
their salmon teriyaki donburi is absolutely fantastic though i dont eat nearly enough sushi when i eat there because their other dishes are so awesome
it obviously means that either op or their partner isnt being honest about not having had sexual contact with another person  either before or during this relationship 

no chicken or egg about it its very clear
the boop cards have been accessible and available for quite some time now this is still not solvable with them because its an unfinished part of the story
this will largely depend on the doctorspecialistsurgeon 

i had a 20 minute phone consultation with a cnm where i told her i was seeking a bisalp and we had a quick chat about it

she started by informing me that a tubal ligation was potentially reversible but they advise that you not rely on that possibilityconsider it permanent and that a bisalp was absolutely permanent she asked me if i was okay with this being permanent and said may i ask why you are seeking this procedure to which i said frankly i absolutely hate kids have always hated them and dont want them  and to which she said cool we just have to ask

she let me know that there would be paperwork coming from her in the mail which was basically a document that she signs stating that she believes im of sound mind to make this decision and that shes giving the okay for the procedure and which i will sign as a consent form she said that these forms have a 30 day waiting period  meaning after signed i have to wait 30 days before a procedure can be done  and said shed have them in the mail right away  
she also said shed put in the referral for the surgeon who would give me a call to set the surgery date and answer any further questions i might have she said a further inperson exam could be necessary depending on my health concerns risks and history but that typically a videotelephone consult with the surgeon is plenty

an hour after my phone consult with the cnm i had a phone consult booked with the surgeon for a week later i did not need an exam prior but i also have a fairly normal history in that regard and had a routine pap recently enough that it wasnt something they felt necessary   
i did have to speak with them further about anesthesia issues but that was a personal matter due to my health

another doctor might want you to do an exam first if you havent had one before had one for some time or have some concernsprior issues that they might want to check up on beforehand i would say this is a good thing  you want to make sure youre prepared and that its advisable to move forward before undergoing any surgery  
its impossible to know if they will say no after an exam or not  this would depend on a lot of factors i suppose you could ask and say if i complete this exam barring any major health concerns will we then be moving forward with the bisalp and if the answer is not satisfactory you can determine your next steps
agreed 

maybe in some situations a religious partner and a nonreligious partner could maintain a relationship and be compatible enough to survive long term but i feel like that only works if the religious partner isnt super religious and doesnt subscribe to the limitations their religion imposes on themtheir relationships

theres just no way i could date someone for any length of time that was seriously religious in any capacity not because i have anything against religious people but i just dont see how our values needs wants and mindsets could possibly match up usually that extends into sex which is a huge deal breaker for me

its definitely unfortunate that that conditioning exists im proud of op for acknowledging his needs and sexual values  its crazy to me how many posts on this subreddit are basically i cant break up with someone over sex so what do i do when the answer is break up over sex
my answer would be feel free to get closer to god  as close as you possibly can  but by dropping this ultimatum youve pushed yourself as far from me as possible and the relationship has no hope going forward

im glad op at least recognizes that sex is important to him and something he isnt willing to sacrifice some people get so wrapped up in feeling like i cant dump them over just sex how shallow but sex is such a key part of intimacy and relationships it shouldnt be ignored
honestly the kind of partner who decides for me and for the relationship that sexual intimacy is no longer on the table period indefinitely is not the kind of partner i would want to work things out with phase or not 

it shows a lack of care for her partner that she feels she can drop huge ultimatums on her partner whenever she sees fit and expects hell just cave and go along with it regardless of his needs and values and frankly shows sexual incompatibility to a major extent as she clearly doesnt value sex the same way 

phase or not no thanks too different of values

i mean you would think that but man youd be surprised sometimes especially on this sub lol
well duh most preschoolers have homes get all their needs paid for and get 3 meals a day obviously theyre the privileged ones

youve heard right  the disability process is not quick easy or fun and a major roadblock for many is that you will not be able to work during the process no matter how long it takes 


you need to have substantial documentation from medical professionals validating that you cannot work any job  not just jobs youve worked beforefeel youve been qualified for any job they can come up with from walmart greeter to receipt checker etc  and that you will remain unable to work any job for a minimum of 12 months regardless of any and all treatments  and that youve attempted all treatments available with nothing else on the horizon that your doctor feels might work 

depending on your age and work history you may not qualify for one type of disability if you dont have enough work credits  which would leave you with the other which has strict limits on what assets you can have 

expect to be denied the first time and probably the second expect to have to appeal go through many painful examinations and doctors appointments and to have to explain every aspect of yourself your life and your illnesses countless times 

and of course you cant work during this time so you best hope someone can support you 100 or you have savings to live off because its going to likely be 12 months at minimum before you see a payment 

a payment  if you are approved that is  which of course will be so low each month youll remain in guaranteed poverty as long as youre on the program with no hopes of rising above the poverty line 

not saying dont apply but definitely do your research and decide if its something you can reasonably attempt its a pretty fucked up system
met shaq at my local mall as a kid  i live in portland not exactly a destination town never has been  and man he truly is huge 
he was wearing a gigantic fur coat which definitely drew your attention to him but he certainly didnt need that you could spot him from miles away regardless
im still so curious what happened i drove by it as well seemingly right as it started  the guy who i assume was responsible for it or whos stuff was on fire at least was in the street waving people away frantically 
we drove by on the opposite side of it though it seems like
it was before the yard apartments or whatever those death star looking rentals are id say 4 blocks before those apartments on the right side going towards them i drove by it as well last night
you have no idea what that same day was like

if op wasis as insecure as theyre painting themselves to be this breakup day theyre referencing wasnt some out of the blue were done event that the girl wouldve been caught off guard and totally emotionally wounded by more than likely dude was projecting his insecurities onto for a long time and they probably had a handful of argumentsdisagreementsbad nights as a result she likely knew this or some kind of serious issue was coming and there had been emotional turmoil for them both for a while meaning it wasnt a smooth healthy happy relationship for both of them that suddenly split on this day it was rocky for some time
op is entitled to feeling hurt that she fucked someone that same split day and act accordingly but i also dont think the girl deserves this much hate for fucking around with someone at that time


maybe she regrets it maybe not maybe she was so sick of having ops petty insecurities projected into her and being punished for them and just wanted to have fun and feel sexy and wanted again and it just happened to manifest during a highly emotional time who knows 

op can dump her again if he wants and feel bad about it if he wants and im not saying he is wrong or she is right but lets not pretend to know all the details here often times relationships are over or on break for both parties mentally long before its official not meaning they act on that beforehand but meaning that separation and numbness emotionally is there before
this is semantics though 


person calls to report dog in car asserts that theyre going to break the window to save it

car owner sees person attempting to bash in car window assumes theyre a thiefcriminal goes and protects their property since they believe a crime is being committed 

after the fact cardog owner claims they had the ac running or dog had plenty of air from windowsa cordless fanwhatever 
window breaker claims they did not  and either they truly didnt or person didnt thoroughly check and went straight to smashing 

i dont know about you but id predict this ends in both parties being told its a civil matter  i dont see cops siding with one person or the other necessarily so acting like its so cut and dry thats not usually how stuff like this goes
not everyone likes kids wants them or can even tolerate them
i absolutely hate kids chances are i would never get to the point of love  or even basic likedating  with someone with kids unless he lies and hides them from me because thats so far opposite of what i want value and can stand that i would know right away we werent a match

spacious microstudio in a lively up and coming neighborhood with relaxing openair feel and large gorgeous windows to let in the sights and sounds of the city centrally located with vaulted ceilings and unique modern design 1800 with utilities ample street parking available
i wouldnt say this is quickly  its been a year without any sexual contact intimacy etc 

if ops girlfriend is completely shut off to finding a solution  which it sounds like she is  despite continuous suggestions and attempts to work through it then what exactly is op supposed to do here continue to bang his head against a wall getting nowhere completely shutting off his needs and desires to cater to her stubbornness in this relationship 

hes already waited longer than i feel the majority of us would especially given her attitude at this point she either makes a significant change or a breakup is the only real option
go be argumentative somewhere else bud 

im not going to pretend my personal experiences didnt happen just because you dont agree or like the narrative generally never had problems in nyc cant say that for portland doesnt mean either city is more dangerous than the other nor did i say that or try to infer that 
bottom line is trimet is unpleasant at best and unsafe at times at worst this isnt in comparison to anywhere else nor does it need to be a competition doesnt matter what public transportation is like anywhere else were talking about here 
peoples need to go well its worse elsewhere111 is why this shit continues to be enabled and ignored
never once did i say either one was more dangerous than the other just that in my personal experiences  and those of friends and family  more assaultsharassment has occurred on trimet
sure one or two crazy dudes may not be a huge deal  until it is 

ive lived in bigger cities  including nyc  and have been hassled harassed assaulted and stalked more in portland than anywhere else ive had friendsfamily with similar problems as well more consistently here than anywhere  and the comments on any thread about trimet show these arent rare isolated issues 

just wear headphones isnt a solution 
it doesnt solve the issue  especially when these people escalate from annoyance to actual problem  and frankly people shouldnt have to shrink down and blast music just to tolerate a commute home among all the crazies 

by enabling these folks so heavily by ignoring their ridiculous bs were only making things worse this kind of stuff shouldnt be tolerated period
i dont know about anyone else but personally i dont care if they make it free im still not taking trimet 

its not worth the legitimate risks to my safety all the methed out bullshit the genuinely disgusting shit that happens  people shittingpissingshooting up during rides  the lack of consistent bussestrains the added time it takes to get anywhere etc 

i took trimet for years and it was always a shitty experience 
now the way things are no chance 
you couldnt pay me to take it

i know its the only option for some people and i hope it improves but as it stands now its a lost cause for me personally
this is a great comment and i agree that op should consider these points and really reflect on how he perceives social situations versus how his wife may be taking them 

considering hes admittedly had problems with being too flirtatious in the past to the point where its this deep of a wound for his wife i would guess youre not far off here

regardless couples therapy sounds in order no matter what
thank you for checking back up on us and for your initial comment  it brought me a lot of calm at the time and i really appreciated the sentiment regardless of the way things turned out it was really kind of you 
we are absolutely heartbroken without iggy but are grateful that so many folks reached out and have offered condolences  thank you again 
what

i dont know how you possibly reached this conclusion from this post but youre seriously off base 

shes clumsy cant take direction or suggestion on how to better please her partner just lays there and moans excessively loudly while doing little else half the time has zero rythm and makes no attempts to consistently learn when shown doesnt sound like a sexual ferrari to me
i have a foamhybrid and i honestly never feel my partner get in and out of bed and im generally pretty easily jostled when sleeping 

i dont think its bad for sex at all either sure it isnt bouncing all over the place like a trampoline like some spring mattresses feel but this doesnt impact sex negatively for us at all  if anything its more supportive and makes it easier to hold a position without wobbling all over the place
i refuse to believe this is real what 


is this really a thing tell me youre fucking with me
yeah shit how did they pull that off even some of these tags around town blow my mind  im not that knowledgeable in how people do this shit but where were they at to tag this
nice lots of awesome shows

particularly jealous of heatmiser  how was that
thank you 3
thank you 3
i apologize for responding so late i needed to take a few days to process things  


thank you so much for your kind words and empathy this has by far been the hardest loss i have endured  its crazy how bonded we can become to our animals it feels like a part of me is missing

im trying my best to heal through this and find ways to honor iggy as he deserved  he didnt deserve such a tragic painful end

im finally feeling up to the task of following up with animal control and beginning to see what my options are to pursue the owner  no amount of money will make this better but i feel its only fair she at least pay for the expenses this caused especially as i was not financially prepared to deal with all of this
thank you 3
i will absolutely be going after the woman full force and following up with animal control
thank you 3
thank you so much 3
thank you 3
thank you 3 please give your kitty extra loves for me

i will definitely be going after the owner
thank you so much 3
thank you 3
it really is crazy how close and attached we can be to our little furry family members he was such a sweet little man and didnt deserve to be taken so soon thank you 3
thank you 3
it really does feel that way ive never hurt so deeply from a loss thank you 3
thank you 3
