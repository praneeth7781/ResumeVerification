i know its hard but try not to feel too ashamed shame usually backfires because it makes you feel bad and you just end up indulging in your habit more to escape the bad feeling try to be proud of yourself for every minute hour or day you spend doing other things and focus on the good that will come from doing it less positive reinforcement is a lot more effective than negative exactly my ex boyfriend was rarely direct and analyzed the hell out of things people said and i dont know if itll ever stop bothering me knowing that half the stuff i said he probably assumed i actually meant some whole other thing does it make you crazy when you sense that people are analyzing your words looking for hidden meanings and insinuations because almost nothing makes me more crazy than saying exactly wtf i mean and knowing someone is going to try and figure out what i really mean by it theres nothing to figure out yessss omg when someone,YourFriendMaryGrace
says something multiple different ways to make a single point i struggle so hard not to be like i got it the first time and im currently on my eleventh train of thought just waiting for you to wrap it up lmao its a shame we cant 2x speed conversations the way we can videos your aries mercury interpretation resonates with me i cant stand when people try and talk with a lot of layers and undertones and hidden meanings just give it to me straight gatdammit my brain doesnt want to have to analyze peoples words and i dont want my words to be analyzed i love talking to other aries mercury people because i know were both just saying what we mean and the conversation moves lightning fast which matches my brains usual speed and yes i have to make a very conscious effort not to dominate the conversation when im talking to less fiery people lol thats probably why every single person ive ever dated has been a triple fire sign,YourFriendMaryGrace
guy no one else can keep up with me its making me crazy i cant imagine that thousands and thousands of redditors are organically interested in coming here and rufos just to shit on everything lol most people in real life are either interested and curious or theyre not even thinking about it oh im happy to hear that can i ask the gist of what they said im rooting for ya i have similar placements pisces sun and capricorn moon for me i will forgive and give second chances for as long as i can often at the expense of my own wellbeing but theres a certain amount of hurt that i just cant move past even if i want to its not that i dont forgive them i do but im deeply sensitive and if ive opened my heart to someone and given them my trust only to end up being betrayed its like my heart just cant go back to feeling safe with them again no matter how much i miss,YourFriendMaryGrace
them we love deeply whether we want to or not so were too open and vulnerable with those we love to only let someone in halfway thats why pisces tend to be allornothing in their intimate connections but i would imagine they appreciate that you apologized and acknowledged your mistakes even if they havent responded we pisces tend to withdraw when were hurting and sometimes it just takes a long time for us to come back out of our solitude so its possible they just need some time good luck buddy its the weirdest feeling when it happens i had something similar but i think i remember the whole thing i was taking my kids on a road trip and i set my gps to our destination 3 hours away we only took one quick bathroom stop and we didnt cross any time zones or make any wrong turns it was just a straight shot on the interstate and yet somehow when we arrived i realized that it had taken us almost 6 hours,YourFriendMaryGrace
to get there the weirdest part was that i didnt notice any signs of the time being off until we arrived how did i lose 3 hours when i was conscious and checking the clock regularly it messed with my brain so bad lol well it means a lot to me that you took the time this project is important to me and i listened to those specific parts so many times but my brain just tapped out lol so thank you again fellow interpreter of drawls thank you im glad my rural upbringing came in handy for something haha i craved salt and vinegar chips like crazy when i was pregnant with my daughter id never liked them before and suddenly couldnt get enough and ever since shes started eating big kid food shes been obsessed with anything vinegar based olives pickles chips i feel like she was sending me the cravings lol oh damn thats right i forgot about that story poor lady i read a transcript of a past life hypnosis,YourFriendMaryGrace
session one time where the woman under hypnosis said she intentionally incarnates in areas where a disaster will occur specifically so that when the disaster occurs she can help souls cross over because when it happens so quickly and in a scary way like that some souls just have a hard time letting go really interesting to think about really interesting you say that i feel like theres a lot of different species and they have different intentions and approaches i wrote this comment yesterday about something similar but from a benevolent species that i saw last month oh wow thats really interesting that makes sense my late grandfather was a pilot in the korean war wish i could ask him more about his experiences thank you for sharing this i hadnt seen this before silverback gorillas can lift over 4000 pounds isnt that love and light the best feeling ever if it was a drug id never stop taking it lol ahhh this is awesome thank you so so much at 120 i,YourFriendMaryGrace
was thinking he said assholes too but i wasnt sure your translation makes sense especially since there were other people on the river that night are you from the deep south too i thought more people would be able to help but i guess the accent is more of a barrier than i thought lol im from mississippi thanks again i think it would be tricky for a lot of native speakers to understand as well so no worries i grew up not too far from where this occurred so its a very familiar dialect to me ahhhh i think youre right thank you so much true ive had my own experiences but thankfully theyve all been overwhelmingly positive in nature my heart goes out to people who have been through something like this the older guy hickson actually said quite a bit more in his testimony than the younger man if you scroll to the bottom of this article youll find a longer recording where hickson gives his full testimony parker was in,YourFriendMaryGrace
a panicked state and had difficulty remaining calm enough to be interviewed understandably this brief moment where hes alone with his friend in private is the bulk of his communication that night these recordings werent released until 2020 and parker has said that listening to them made him regret that he wasnt able to say more at that time that line makes me really sad too and the way they keep saying that no one will believe them i cant imagine going through something so traumatizing and then have to worry about being mocked and treated like i was crazy or lying for attention dang thats annoying thanks for letting me know its just the website for the state newspaper so idk why its doing that it does work on a computer though fwiw just a heads up the video of the conversation doesnt seem to work well on mobile people say something like that in every post about these two makes me crazy i bet they were gay like okay and even if,YourFriendMaryGrace
they were doesnt change the fact that they shared an extremely strange and traumatizing event juvenile they worked together and hickson owned land in parkers hometown not sure what youre implying but it isnt unusual for people of different ages to share a hobby whatever happened it wasnt good parker was so distressed he literally started trying to climb the walls during part of their interview hickson said repeatedly that he knew hed become a laughingstock for sharing his story but he felt it was important i guess he was right considering 50 years later the first thing you do is suggest that them being abducted would be better than them having an affair i understand the dialect but i dont have any audio tools if you want to try and help me decipher that would be amazing heres a transcript i made im from mississippi so its easy for me lol heres my transcript yeah hicksons final comment is quite chilling i feel so bad for them its in the second link in,YourFriendMaryGrace
my post or you can click here for some reason it doesnt seem to work well on mobile though at 220 i think he says something about setting a new medical record that was a common joke people would make about any unusual physical condition when i was growing up in mississippi but i left it blank because im not sure the most common themes ive heard are that we should be nicer to each other and take better care of our planet as for mass communication i had a really vivid astral experience about a month ago that was along those lines but more subtle i saw a lot of different types of alien beings communicating subconsciously with millions of people on earth individually they would reveal a bit of information or visualization of themselves and then ask do you feel calm if the individual was still calm theyd reveal a little more repeat and repeat its been interesting over the last month to see soooo many people posting that theyre suddenly having,YourFriendMaryGrace
personal experiences with uap or visions of beings in their dreams after a lifetime of not having any experiences like that seems to correlate with what i saw people say this after miscarriages too you can get pregnant again im so sorry for the loss of your husband sending you love 3 thats gut wrenching i truly cant imagine i am so very sorry for your loss im really sorry for all youve been through please feel free to message me anytime i care 3 im so sorry for your loss are there any memories of her youd like to share no pressure just know that i care 3 i have a 6 year old and the thought of someone that little going through that hurts my heart youre so welcome im happy i could help feel free to reach out if they give you any more trouble but hopefully theyll move along now weird seeing this today i was literally just looking for this picture last night i always wondered if he knew,YourFriendMaryGrace

can always do some basic cleansing rituals sprinkle a little salt in the corners of your rooms burn incense sage or cedar be sure to get the corners and closets and say something like i bless my home and i allow only the highest and purest energies of love and light within these walls that should do it it could be one of two things you have anxiety about your hobby and how it might affect you if spirits become attached to you and that anxiety transferred into your sleep and gave you this dream or you actually did attract some spirits to you and they are now using your dream state to ask you for help i would take a break from this hobby for a bit if i were you some people are just more open in terms of being able to receive contact from the other side and you may be one of them which means that any time you do this youre opening yourself up to a lot of new,YourFriendMaryGrace
energies who may be needy or clingy remember that youre allowed to have boundaries with spirits you can try to encourage them to go homecross over on their own or you can just ask them to leave and not come back if youre feeling generous you can look into ways to help spirits cross over but thats not foolproof as many of them dont actually want to cross over and may just be wanting your attention very much so when i was a child id have very intense waves of a memorylike feeling from the 1960s come over me i was born in 1985 but this feeling would get triggered randomly and id think this is exactly what it felt like in the 60s i was always taught that reincarnation isnt real so i never knew what to make of those feelings but it sure felt real fast forward to a few years ago and i started doing past life regressions one of the 4 lifetimes ive seen ended with me dying in the,YourFriendMaryGrace
mid to late 1960s ive had that nostalgic feeling at other times too though usually very random and intangible and i wonder if maybe theres just lots of little bits of memories from many different lifetimes lingering in there have you ever tried a past life regression meditation on youtube im collecting data on these orange orbs and i have a question for you and op if you dont mind did you see these orbs near pine trees my 6 year old son likes to tell me that im the most beautiful girl in the world and everybody loves me my 9 year old daughter asks me to wait for her when i die so we can go to our next life together gah i love my babies so much just writing this is making me emotional awesome thank you so much this is why im asking if youre curious seems like theres a lot of sightings of them in that area im asking because they seem to show up around pine trees a,YourFriendMaryGrace
large percentage of the time thanks for answering it doesnt sound nutty to me do you happen to live near pine trees were they pine trees by chance were the orange orbs near any pine trees were the orange orbs flying near pine trees he became an alcoholic and his life just kinda spiraled heres an article his son wrote get out thank you so much for sharing your story i know it takes a lot of courage to do so especially when you know youll be met with negative responses its part of why so many of us hesitate to speak out at all i believe this is by design and im highly suspicious of the number of commenters who jump to discredit people before theyve even had time to read and reflect on the post a lot of them could be getting paid others are afraid to consider that reality might not work the way they thought and they are repelled by any other way of thinking about things or they just,YourFriendMaryGrace
think that they sound really smart by saying things like this arent possible despite the fact that its becoming quite clear that they are indeed possible the people who are genuinely curious will consider your perspective and appreciate your input and those of us who have had our own experiences already know that your story makes a lot of sense i love u tooo bb if hed given a lot of exciting information youd say it was too fantastic to be real i think the boring aspect lends credibility youre complaining that hes not using acronyms but why should he when he knows hes talking to civilians and the compartmentalization of information is critical to understanding part of why people dont speak up more often they only know little bits of the story obviously youre free to believe whatever you want i just dont think the reasons you stated alone are enough to discredit him wow i love that thank you for telling me the fact that they were actually climbing one when it,YourFriendMaryGrace
happened is really cool ive seen two different versions that ultimately reflected the same thing the more detailed one i talked about in the fourth paragraph of this post the best answer i can give you based on my own experiences is that theres no hell like we think of in religious and cultural traditions dark and light are two sides of the same coin if youre holding onto a great deal of darkness then when you pass you may be too dark to be able to be taken up by the light its not the light punishing you or pushing you away youre pushing yourself away this isnt a permanent condition at most its a momentary experience of deep darkness that makes the light finally seem much more attractive to you so you let go of the darkness youre holding onto and are then able to move into the the absolute unconditional love and acceptance of the light again this is just my experience i too have stepped on rogue metal mini minecraft,YourFriendMaryGrace
figures they make lego feel like stepping on a cloud yeah i was hopeful about that one too but i did make a lot of new friends with jupiter in aries well with the north node in our 7th houses its a very opportune time for us libra risings to meet someone special or get married good luck i feel so bad for people like this imagine having a completely disorienting terrifying experience and then being mocked and accused of lying for attention when you seek help i read a story recently about a rancher who experienced sightings and mutilations of his cattle and he turned into a running joke in his town because everybody thought he was a loony he died homeless its a shame how many people have probably been through this and died without ever being believed wow this is so interesting i might make a post just for this phenomena because it seems like theres a correlation there for sure do you happen to have any video a friend of,YourFriendMaryGrace
mine got this video this is a slow motion version look familiar awww theyre so cute lol i love them and their love for pine trees this is a slow mo clip of a sighting were they similar to this thats so cool thank you so much for sharing did it look anything like this if it makes you feel better they seem really nice and ive only read positive encounters with them oooo fascinating what did it look like and did you see its movements i dont know exactly last month i had a very vivid dream about these orange orb uap and they kept telling me they like pine trees about a week later my 9 year old daughter had a dream about going to an orange planet on a spaceship and the planet had orange pine trees mind you i hadnt said anything to her about my dream ive asked 2 people i know who have seen them in person and both sightings were near pine trees so now im just,YourFriendMaryGrace
collecting data out of curiosity same i saw 3 uap traveling together one time and 3 other sightings of a single uap those are my favorite were you near any pine trees by chance its only unthinkable because its hard to imagine something we know nothing about they might not even need foodairsunlight the way we do they might source all their basic needs from the depths of the ocean or from another planet entirely so many possibilities ughghhh i understand mine are 6 and 9 so theyre older but at all ages once they start socializing it is so hard to see them deal with any kind of rejection we see their hopes and expectations for interacting with others and we just want it to work out perfectly for them every time and of course thats not always possible but know that by giving her space to talk about it even if she cant say much you are showing her that youre there to support her socially and emotionally i did the same,YourFriendMaryGrace
with my littles at that age and they still want to talk to me about everything they have going on friends bullies etc because they know we can process and problem solve together you sound like a wonderful mama yes the debunked comments are everywhere and you can tell half the time they arent even reading or watching the thing theyre claiming is debunked i saw someone post a compilation video of dozens and dozens of uap sightings someone responded that sighting is debunked and had a ton of upvotes my parents made this discovery about grapes theyd both been buying red grapes for decades thinking the other preferred red they both prefer green i believe so too amazing post and thanks for making it those of us who have already experienced things and are used to the idea that were not alone will be very much needed in helping others stay calm and adjust feel free to message me if youd like someone to talk to 3 this story started out so sad,YourFriendMaryGrace

something in complete honesty that if he was projecting his dishonesty onto me he would have incorrectly decided i was lying or meant something else entirely i noticed he did this a lot when he was talking about something someone else said to him like oh she said xyz but she was probably just trying to make me think abc and i wondered why he always assumed deceptionulterior motive until i realized that he does that a lot himself lol not saying youre exactly like him or anything and no judgement from me either way im just wanting to understand how this trait plays out in your relationships and expectations of others ooo thats such a good point strikes are very aries energy and theyre fighting for fairness and justice both libra things will definitely be interesting to see how else this dichotomy will show up over the next year and a half ope its fixed now thank you mine too we get a double dose of these energies with our houses there last,YourFriendMaryGrace
time we had this transit i met the father of my two babies i have libra in 1st and aries in 7th are you a libra or aries rising yes exactly when theyre unevolved theyll fake confidence and try to impress however they can lying pretending to be someone theyre not hiding their feelings borrowing other peoples jokes and anecdotes etc but once they learn to accept themselves and feel real confidence from within theyre able to stand boldly in their true self heres some info that can be helpful for reflecting on how these might effect us as a collective as well as personally the past and current dates that we had this transit are north node aries south node libra jan 27 1949 jul 26 1950 aug 20 1967 apr 19 1969 apr 7 1986 dec 2 1987 dec 27 2004 jun 22 2006 july 18 2023 january 11 2025 and the dates where we had the opposite alignment north node librasouth node aries jun 17 1958 dec 15 1959 jan 8,YourFriendMaryGrace

a turnoff for you to ask first if someone doesnt appreciate that youre being respectful of their boundaries then theyre immature and not worth your effort thats so sweet i understand that feeling i hope you two find your way back to each other soon im sorry it didnt work out i know how much it hurts to feel that deep passion and connection but end up apart i believe we are destined to meet certain people at certain points in our lives some people we meet lifetime after lifetime its possible youll end up together again in this life or the next the most important thing is that youre continuing to grow and evolve through each life ifwhen you two meeting up and being together can contribute to your growth then it will happen i just went to look for it and inadvertently discovered youre in austin me too we have an austin experiencers meetup every other week and its really fun to sharehear peoples stories if youre ever interested in joining especially,YourFriendMaryGrace

quite a while but we were 3 years into our relationship at that point and i really wanted to experience more intimacy and to feel special and loved in bed he was very clearly upset so i tried to ask why and he said liked the way we were already doing it too much and didnt want to stop i said we could still do that sometimes too i just wanted to feel special and loved at least some of the times nothing changed yeah porn in general is a well its a whole can of worms and you covered a of a lot of my issues with it already i used to try and be cool with it but the more i learned about it the more horrified i became theres ways to create content ethically but that seems to be a low priority for the vast majority of the people running the industry and the psychological impact of having young guys grow up watching these videos where women being treated like garbage,YourFriendMaryGrace
is normal really does scare me them growing up to be bad in bed is probably on the milder side of the negative effects that can have its actually kind of comically delusional these guys that think its totally cool of them to be selfish in bed for real and not just for role play i actually do enjoy role playing and experimenting with dynamics but it has to be consensual and agreed upon beforehand and if you are going to balk and act all disappointed because id like you to be as enthusiastic about my pleasure as i have been about yours then okay then bye and as you mentioned i also feel bad that porn makes guys feel less than for not having gigantic schlong it really and truly makes no difference to me about size if anything i prefer smaller bc im small i feel like most men these days wouldnt even believe its possible for a woman to prefer smaller which makes me sad for them i feel like the,YourFriendMaryGrace
absence of actual intimacy in porn is affecting some peoples behaviorexpectations in bed very badly i asked my last partner if he would slow down and stop acting dominant and aggressive every single time so we could like you know be more romantic sensual really connect as equal partners by the way he reacted to this request youd think id asked him to do advanced calculus in bed like he was turned off confused and disappointed when i was literally just asking for more sensual reciprocal sex she does have trouble sleeping she likes games and shes very creative the biggest challenge for her is sticking with something even if it doesnt work out perfectly right away like yesterday she had an idea for a weirdcore image she wanted to create the instant the photo editing app didnt do what she wanted it to do she was like this is impossible im done and i never know how much i should push her to see things through or just let it go definitely possible,YourFriendMaryGrace

we havent responded super well so far essentially the exact opposite of a scary invasion movie lol its not a stupid question at all and you brought up an interesting point the number of uap sightings and incidents increased pretty dramatically after we started dropping the big bombs and as you said theres been many reports of them shutting down nuclear facilities i suspect that the bombs probably alerted a lot of nhi who werent really paying us much attention before to start keeping an eye on us awww im sure she appreciates all you did to take care of her over the years thats really sweet that shes checking in with you 3 this is purely speculation but i wonder if at least some of the nhi are forcing our leaderships hand in some way or if they anticipate an event or increase in activity such that they wont be able to hide it anyway so theyre trying to get ahead of the game well a lucid dream begins by realizing that youre,YourFriendMaryGrace
in a dream having full control is just something you can work up to once you have the ability to recognize that youre in a dream so its still technically a lucid dream even if you arent able to control it yet lots of people have to work just to get to the point where they can realize theyre in a dream so youre ahead of the game its a lucid dream theres lots of techniques for learning how to control it check out the lucid dreaming sub aww this is lovely to hear thank you and no worries if and when you feel like sharing your experiences were here for it ya the type of people who mock others and pick apart peoples appearances behaviors and actions as if theyre soooo much better its a sure sign of insecurity and its very unpleasant to be around not to mention its pretty much guaranteed that if they talk shit behind other peoples backs theyre talking shit behind your back too just gross bystander apathy,YourFriendMaryGrace
is crazy a few months ago i had to break up a fist fight between two middle school aged boys while a bunch of dads twice my size just stood around lol im glad you were there and acted quickly i relate i have a 6 year old son who sees things as well its hard to say what type of entity it is but dark energies feed off of fear so unfortunately kids who are perceptive to that world make easy targets traditional methods of cleansing blessing smudging salt in the corners etc are often very helpful you can also help him exercise spiritual boundaries by going to the space where he saw it and telling the entity that its not welcome in your home and it needs to move along do this with love which is repellent to them and firmness no anger as they feed off that as well sometimes ill also visualize white light pouring out of my hands and sort of sweeping them out the door or windows with,YourFriendMaryGrace
my hands it seems to work really well now he just comes and finds me when he sees something so i can kick it out for him lol but im working on empowering him to do it too the majority of dreams are made by your subconscious mind as its trying to work through your feelings some dreams can be premonitions but given your anxiety about this situation and your past trauma id say this is just your brain trying to help you confront your fears it doesnt mean itll happen again youre so strong congratulations on getting on the road to recovery i recommend smudging which is where you use smoke to cleanse the room i like to burn cedar but sage or any kind of incense works make sure to get it in the corners you can sprinkle salt in the corners as well most importantly know that you can practice boundaries with entities just like you do with people be kind but firm and let them know that only the highest,YourFriendMaryGrace
most benevolent energies are welcome in your space i suggest doing this regularly and do your best not to feel anger or fear towards any negative energies they like to feed off that love and light are repellent to dark energy so imagining a beam of light coming from your heart and surrounding yourself and the room can really help as well edit one more thing you should do whats best for you so just disregard this if its not helpful but theres a lot of ways besides catholicism to connect with higher energies and grow spiritually i was raised christian and while i still appreciate the teachings of loving others and doing good ive found that exploring spirituality apart from religion has been the most beneficial thing ive ever done i love this story thank you for sharing its incredibly common for people who have passed on to use the dream state to visit loved ones i saw my grandfather about a month after he passed early in the morning when i was,YourFriendMaryGrace
just starting to wake up i told him i was sad that he couldnt be there to see us grandkids grow up and that my baby sister had started walking and he missed it and he just smiled and said i know she started walking i can check in on yall from time to time fast forward about 20 years and he showed back up to comfort me when i was going through a rough time he appeared to my mom and my sister in law as well dont worry about your words to him being less than perfect he can feel your immense love for him very clearly 3 vibrations are everything if someone is in a low vibration angry afraid then its unlikely that a benevolent spirit will be able to connect with them so he probably tried to but couldnt he may have been ready to cross over and just needed to do that first its really nice that they give specific references i feel like that helps a lot my,YourFriendMaryGrace
friends dad said he was going to wait for her before he fully crossed over so maybe thats why he had time to wait around and communicate more than usual im sure you brought his mom so much comfort and him as well yeah pretty much i was doing yoga and then out of nowhere i felt the presence of an older man i couldnt see him exactly but i could just tell he was a nice old guy he basically just said can you get kelsey for me like he wanted to talk to her through me ive received messages from spirits before but never as out of the blue as this one i was hesitant so i stalled for like a week but the whole time i could just feel him waiting patiently lol so i finally reached out to her and she was super open about it and invited me over almost as soon as i got there messages just started pouring in about all kinds of things lots of specific,YourFriendMaryGrace
references and of course just general love and comfort they were incredibly close and hed died suddenly so she hadnt really gotten to say goodbye its really an honor to be able to help people in that way im open to doing it again but it hasnt happened since ive wondered this about sightings if everybody has them but only the people who are able to handle the experience actually retain the memories i recently posted about a uap sighting i had with another person where i felt calm and happy when we saw it but he kinda freaked out a couple years later hed completely forgot about the experience but he remembers a previous sighting we had together perfectly fine and it just so happens that he was pretty calm when we had that sighting so i posted on another sub and found that a lot of people have had the same experience where they remember but their coexperiencer freaked out and then later seemed to forget very curious im so excited for,YourFriendMaryGrace
you i love your metaphor of the butterfly thats beautiful it sounds like we are seeing very similar things with the sparkles and blueish purplish orbs i see the black flecks as well sometimes but not coming from people at least not that ive noticed the sparkles and orbs feel sooo benevolent to me i do feel like they are beings of some kind possibly from other dimensions which is why were not able to see their full form i love them i always giggle and say hi lol wow thank you for sharing it sounds like you had an awful lot on your plate at that time i wonder if they were helpers of some kind showing up for you and your family thats so cool that you saw them together what size were they thats adorable i hope you two have many happy years together thats really sad but so lovely that you were able to receive the message and pass it along to her i once received a message from my,YourFriendMaryGrace
friends dad who had recently passed id never met him so i was surprised he came to me and like you i was worried about sounding crazy but it meant a lot to my friend i think some souls just linger until they can find a way to pass along some comfort to their loved ones thank you for helping him 3 not being able to spoon is the hardest challenge i face as a single person right now theres just 1 flying around san diego now there were like 20 of them earlier ududemanthing1983 totally understand that this one is anecdotal if you guys are interested in the subject yall might enjoy checking out the research done by dr jim tucker and dr ian stevenson into past life recollection thats been done at the university of virginia for many decades theyve compiled a staggering number of children who recalled very specific details including the names of family members where they lived what their house looked like their occupation etc that were later matched,YourFriendMaryGrace
to real life people interestingly the memories seem to disappear by around age seven this particular publication has some cool stories ooo thats intriguing was it moving at all oooo thats very interesting that your optometrist hears that from patients a lot pinpoints of light is a good way to describe it i dont know what they are either but i usually call them angel sparkles lol because they feel so benevolent to me have you noticed any patterns in whenwhere you see them same this just brought back deeply repressed memories lol wow id never heard of this one before thats sad but also really cool rip and congrats on getting your justice ms zona why does it feel like i have a snake in my forehead is my new favorite google search ive ever seen lol congrats on your awakening as you probably know by now youre in very good company what do they look like wow this is amazing im so happy you shared isnt it incredible how once you become,YourFriendMaryGrace
open and willing the path unfolds with such mind blowing discoveries synchronicities and experiences i love that you were able to help get the mans message to leonard i often think about how good it must feel to spirits who have passed on to be able to find an open channel to communicate to their loved ones through also artemis was one of the first beings i connected with as well i just love her sounds like you have an incredibly special calling im excited for you 3 some souls are just extra motivated to get justice it seems heres a kinda similar story a 3 year old boy told his family that he was murdered with an axe in his last life he took them to his former village pointed out who killed him then showed them where the body and the axe were buried i cried instantly it was so helpful for me and my kids to be able to talk about healing scary feelings leftover from their past experiences my kids,YourFriendMaryGrace
6 and 9 and i just watched this one last night and it sent them both into a full blown existential crisis they were both running around yelling what if were puppets what if were an animation what if people are watching our show it was amazing and hilarious in my experience you wont see anything that you arent ready to see the subconscious mind has a way of protecting you which is why we dont walk around with all the bad memories of all our lives all the time i knew i had a particular traumatic past life and did a lot of regressions to try and figure out what happened but i wasnt able to see it for years by that point i was ready though and if you do decide to try it remember to send yourself past and present lots of love you may see something traumatic but its kind of like watching a movie so you arent necessarily fully experiencing it as if it was happening again and even,YourFriendMaryGrace
though seeing difficult memories isnt fun its been really helpful for me to identify where some of my fears and hangups came from and work through them just my thoughts the most important thing is to do what feels right to you thats really cool thank you for sharing this its not uncommon at all for past life memories to come flooding up out of nowhere like that if youd like to see more of this lifetime you can check out past life regression meditations on youtube you dont have to be used to meditating for it to be helpful we live infinitely so for this particular memory to come back to you likely means theres something you can learn from it or something left over from that time that wants to heal within you if you have any questions feel free to ask hope that helps in some way 3 were not even talking about weight you silly goose bot well theres nothing wrong with that at all finding the right balance for,YourFriendMaryGrace
you is a lifetime journey and its normal for levels to change and fluctuate you can even learn to work with the energies to achieve certain things i tend to utilize my masculine energy for completing tasks communicating and planning my feminine energy i often use for listening creating and intuition the most important thing is to send yourself lots of love and acceptance for who you are and how you feel every day theres no right or wrong way to feel as long as you keep practicing loving yourself its really interesting that you have experienced a life as a man who felt and dressed feminine and now it seems that you are experiencing the opposite in a way our souls want to grow and expand in each lifetime so we very often will choose to have these opposite experiences in different ways we will be rich poor attractive unattractive etc so that we can get to know our truest deepest nature over time which is ultimately not defined by any of those,YourFriendMaryGrace
things perhaps part of what youre learning is to accept and embrace both your masculine and feminine energies as one it might help to learn more about these energies apart from the cultural perspectives we all have both energies within us masculine energy is active it helps you go forth and build its an energy of doing feminine energy is receptive it helps you receive and nurture things its an energy of being at our most evolved we are able to balance both those energies within us beautifully regardless of our outside appearances im so glad youre here sounds like your journey is off to an amazing start first of all i want to say that your intuition is your best guide and from everything youve shared i feel youre very well in tune with it so ill share some of my experiences as they relate to yours but of course nothing i say is definitive so take what resonates and leave the rest your experience with the uap is really cool and i,YourFriendMaryGrace
relate to what youre saying about how it wanted you to be able to see it isnt that the most amazing thing theyre very aware of us and im glad they stopped by to say hi and get you started on your journey i have also experienced a sudden burst of growth dreams and abilities after a visit it almost seems as if part of their stopping by to see us sometimes is to give us a sort of personalized spiritual upgrade package the dreams could very well be a mix of things and again your own intuition is key if you feel that the one with the woman might have been a past life then it very likely was the apocalyptic one might have been a metaphor for your difficult childhood or perhaps something else entirely i do believe that seeing flashes of light is a very common part of waking up process were surrounded by dimensions and so much more we dont normally see but i think were all capable of seeing,YourFriendMaryGrace
much more than we realize and just becoming aware of that possibility can be a gateway to seeing more i began seeing little white spots during the day when i first started meditating years ago now i also see violet blue and gold ovals as well white streaks they always make me smile youre exactly right to feel out the energy you accept in your space remember that you can have boundaries in the spirit realm too the benevolent entities will respect that as youve already experienced when you arent sure if the vibes are right with a particular presence try sending it love the malevolent ones tend to be repelled by that and the benevolent ones will appreciate it as for determining what sort of entity you encountered it very well could be reptilian if that resonates with you in general id advise staying open minded and curious because entities will make themselves more known to you when the time is right if its important for you to know you may encounter things,YourFriendMaryGrace
that you later discover many people have seen you may also encounter things only you have seen its a very big universe full of possibilities please feel free to message me any time if i can be of help thanks for sharing 3 yay im glad it was helpful sounds like youre lingering in a meditative state before falling asleep its like you describe you are still conscious but your mind is able to see things without you having to imagine or really do anything i highly recommend starting a meditation practice its got so many benefits and youre a natural i used to have this same dream a lot it depends on whats going on in your life but generally speaking its illustrating that you know youre supposed be learning and growing but you arent really sure what you should be learning or how you can learn what you need to know to be able to move forward in life you might not be sure who to ask for guidance trying to find,YourFriendMaryGrace
the office so youre kind of in a limbo state does that resonate so thankful for this community we appreciate all you guys do to provide us with a safe space to share and connect right aries is literally the sign of the warrior i have a capricorn moon and venus in aries i fall in love quite rarely but when i do it happens very fast and i try very hard and often longer than i should to make it last absolutely as far as sightings go ive had 3 separate uap sightings with my kids dad i tend to connect telepathically with people im dating to varying degrees and ive made 3 friends that i share dreams and mediation visions with its really cool i definitely have flashbacks but mostly during the day like you said sometimes itll be a dream i havent thought about in years i just randomly see the location of the dream in my minds eye and usually feel the primary emotion attached to the dream interestingly ive,YourFriendMaryGrace
found that when this happens with bad dreams i can sort of tell my brain that ive seen enough of that one and would like to release it and the flashbacks of that dream will stop took me years of uncomfortable repeating flashbacks to figure that out though right like she has gossip and funny stories and opinions in there the last thing she wants is secrecy my scorpio sunrising son never forgets an insult when he was about 3 years old we went to a playground and a kid there refused to share his trucks more than 2 weeks go by and i tell him were going back to the playground he goes and gets his trucks and says i not gonna share these i just know he was hoping that same kid would be there and he could give him a taste of his own medicine my gemini sunmoon daughter absolutely loves to learn and she will share interesting facts with anyone who will listen she started keeping a journal but she,YourFriendMaryGrace
writes not private on the front of each one and asks people if theyd like to read it all the time thank you for your kind words and worries at all to be fair i have absolutely attracted creepy dudes who clearly are into me for that reason so its certainly not always an untrue assumption but some guys just genuinely like petite women for other reasons and im thankful for that its kinda weird reading this as a petite woman myself not picking on you lots of people say this and i know youre just explaining why the downvotes its just weird and inadvertently insulting to hear that the only way someone would be attracted to me is if theyre a pedo im sorry people say things like that i know how discouraging it can feel when you try and share only to be ridiculed just fyi rexperiencers is really cool and supportive place for people who have been through stuff like this what makes you think so if it makes you feel,YourFriendMaryGrace
any better from what ive seen doing that tends to backfire on people very badly i guess well never know for sure but it seems highly likely that her brother burke did it he had a lot of behavioral problems and had already beaten her with a golf club a year earlier not too much of a stretch to think hed do it again with a flashlight would also explain why the parents werent as adamant as youd expect about getting the case solved im really sorry for your loss i believe our loved ones can use dreams and other states of consciousness to connect with us im sure he was very happy to see you too if that doesnt work give it a solk instead omg thats awesome i love your mom i almost wonder if being petite in a world where physically threatening people are everywhere just makes our brains go fuck it at some point and then we become irrationally brave i was about to offer my condolences but now im,YourFriendMaryGrace
not sure what to offer congrats i got my big muscley drugdealing neighbor to stop hitting and shoving his girlfriend into his car just by walking up and yelling at him to stop im 54 and like 105 pounds i think the unlikelihood of the fact that i was going right up to him hollering like i could easily take him must have made him assume i had a gun on me or something i dont know but he looked legit startled and confused and he backed off so i walked away with his girlfriend in peace then i drove her to her friends house my sense of selfpreservation in danger is not great lol ive put myself in a lot of situations where i could have been beat up or killed but so far its worked out just fine i believe we plan some things including when were born but with many possibilities left open for example perhaps you and another soul plan to meet at a certain point in your lives and,YourFriendMaryGrace
become romantically involved from there you may end up breaking up living happily ever after or simply deciding to be friends so the initial interactions are destined but you cant really determine what the outcome will be ahead of time too many variables but regardless of the outcome meeting your person will help you both grow in some way and thats why its important edit i missed your other question i do think karma plays a huge role but not in a punishing way our souls are meant to grow through each lifetime so we probably cant or wont choose the same thing over and over like if you are given a lot of gifts in life like attractiveness intelligence material success etc and then you use those gifts solely for your own benefit or as a way to look down on others it will help your souls growth in the next life to experience what its like not to have all those gifts so you can learn to how to be more communityminded,YourFriendMaryGrace
and that true happiness and selfworth comes from within i havent but i absolutely would planning a wedding is just way too much planning lol i was excited to read the scientists account because it perfectly matched what ive seen from my past life regressions of my life on another planet so for me it was comforting confirmation but i understand how it could be unsettling just remember that whatever the truth is its been that way your entire life the only thing thats changing is your awareness keep living your life to the fullest and stay grounded you will be okay 3 i had a lot of strong pluto aspects with my ex boyfriend i felt a viscerally strong connection with him almost instantly weve been broken up over a year and i still feel it its tough i wish things would have worked out with him because if it werent for his betrayal of my trust i would have never ever wanted it to end as an aries venus mercury and mars,YourFriendMaryGrace
i agree if i like you youre gonna know it and ill want to see you again expeditiously i dont have the patience for games pretty accurate actually lol im a libra rising which is possibly the friendliest rising there is also a pisces sun with mars venus and mercury in aries in my 7th house so im passionate about my oneonone relationships thats a fun question ill cover the rest of the days thanks to that movie i can still rapidly recite the names of all of santas reindeer in order and in an austrian accent thats so cool i just saw this post the other day where a mother and son shared a dream lots of comments in there of similar stories you might like to read i love doing this sometimes i challenge myself by trying to guess the major placements of celebrities and then i look them up to see if im right i usually am its crazy right some people just scream the energy of a certain sign lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats a beautiful outcome im so happy for you im glad you posted i hope you continue to have beneficial experiences 3 that sounds so scary im sorry you experienced that hat man is a crazy common entity sighting but like you most people are surprised to find that out im fascinated by him or them its such a common occurrence that its hard to believe its just one spirit doing all that work lol like surely theres a team of them but then again hes probably not constrained by time hope he stays far away from you from here on out gemini in venus has a reputation for being cheaters bc they like variety but of course thats not always the case and with it being in your 7th house you could also be drawn to long term relationships i suggest looking for someone who is fun intelligent will have adventures with you and keep your mind stimulated i watched this happen on twitter and gawker rip when hillary was running it was,YourFriendMaryGrace
so obvious just like whats happening here is tons of people appeared out of nowhere who seemed to live their whole lives just to talk about how hillary was the greatest person of all time and harass anyone who said otherwise but saying that it seemed coordinatedpaid for of course got people further harassed then it turned out to be true with the whole correct the record superpac thing this isnt a political statement btw im sure both sides and lots of other organizations do this long way of saying i agree with you the amount of money it would cost to do this is minuscule to them and the benefit of disrupting the peoples ability to effectively communicate is huge edit what a surprise that your post got removed gahhh was the shadow man wearing a hat by chance with regards to the interdimensional world when you think about how theres likely at least 10 dimensions and we mostly only perceive 3 of them that leaves a lot of space for all kinds,YourFriendMaryGrace
of possibilities i suspect that what we see as shadows ghosts orbs etc would look very very different if we had the ability to perceive them in their full range of dimension we just see whatever part of them is dense enough to materialize in the 3 dimensions were accustomed to true i think the misperception that pisces are endlessly perfectly sweet and patient works to our advantage though people really show their true colors when they think they can get away with anything yes it was froot loops then fruit loops and then back to froot loops same with the flintstones its bizarre to see a mandela effect that is regularly discussed go back to how it was it makes me crazy luckily i dont come across people like that too often anymore but i have this tool in my pocket if i ever need it again me too i almost wish id told him myself but the silent satisfaction was too good omg hi twin i guess the pisces and the libra,YourFriendMaryGrace
makes us accepting of people as long as they treat others well but the capricorn just wont let us put up with bullshit for very long lol shes beautiful and you were adorable makes me happy to know that shes still with us and doing well thanks for sharing i wish i knew im a pisces sun cap moon libra rising in high school there was a guy who annoyed me really bad because he was so pretentious and always trying to act smarter than everyone so one day i told him a nonsense word salad philosophical quote id just made up and he said oh yeah thats a good one i already studied that one i was satisfied that i had proved to myself that he was full of shit lol im so thankful science is advancing in ways that are making it harder for people to label experiencers as liars or crazy oh thats fascinating i met my now ex husband in the first one and had a baby in the second,YourFriendMaryGrace
one thanks for this tip im even more curious now what this transit will bring exactly this i promise you once youve had time to grieve the relationship you will be amazed at the peace of mind that comes from letting go of someone who you love but cant trust you deserve to be with someone who adores you and cherishes the relationship enough that this kind of thing would never be a problem its not worth the hurt and worry mosquito larvae most likely im really sorry for your loss i bet that is a strange feeling indeed hope youre doing okay 3 yeah id be upset too if i was her but what you did isnt gaslighting op that term is chronically misused now i really appreciate your response ive only had acquaintances with it but no one close to me so ive never felt comfortable asking id think that would be really tough to deal with especially since when youre manic id imagine you probably dont want to come down sorry,YourFriendMaryGrace
about the charges youre dealing with and i hope things turn out well for you 3 ive seen a past life that had my kids dad in it and hes seen at least one with me in it too we arent together romantically anymore in this life but we will always be dear friends i think we just like being in each others lives one way or another im not very familiar with bpd so if you dont feel like sharing its okay but im just curious what do you mean theres no way of stopping yourself is it like another part of you takes over that doesnt care about the consequences or just doesnt think there will be any consequences poor john i wonder what happened i cant tell if mike broke up with him or died sick cycle carousel by lifehouse and breathing by lifehouse been revisiting my emotional teenager feelings with that album all i wanted was for someone to feel about me the way he feels about whoever hes singing,YourFriendMaryGrace
about in breathing please dont waste your time i spent 3 years encouraging an emotionally stunted man to heal and grow as a person so we could have a healthier relationship and i shouldnt have learn from my mistakes he wont get better hell use your love and devotion as evidence that he can continue contributing far less to the relationship than you do and youll still keep coming around i promise youll be happier being single than stuck in something like this its a slow and painful heartbreak i wouldnt wish on anybody thats so sweet congratulations on your 60th like attracts like she probably wont like this suggestion but i would recommend she remove the horror movie posters and anything else that has creepy energy from the room even the silly ones like chucky can provide a little portal for dark energy to come through put salt in the corners and burn sage or cedar the most potent repellent to dark energy is love and light so tell her not to hold,YourFriendMaryGrace
on to feelings of anger towards whatever is doing this that just feeds them if you find it let me know i scanned the whole page looking for him exactly were very unaware of the higher dimensions in modern times and so we arent even thinking about the multitude of entities that have been living in them for who knows how long so then we look at the egyptians and their mythology as a silly group of people worshipping some nonexistent gods and think were so much smarter lol i dont believe that theyre gods per se but powerful beings that arent bound to space and time the way we are they probably arent as active with modern humans because most modern humans dont even understand what they are nor do they reach the levels of consciousness needed to communicate with them the same goes for many other deities and mythologized creatures id imagine hes my favorite too i want to make friends with him youre perfectly human theres nothing wrong with only feeling,YourFriendMaryGrace
sexual attraction when youre emotionally connected as well i think its beautiful dont let the hookup culture fool you casual sex isnt inherently better just because its considered normal well if you havent already i hope you find someone who appreciates all that you bring to the table and does everything they can to make your life better too 3 right good luck ever finding anyone who cares about you like your wife does op most people these days are flaky and will bail on you the minute they see someone new and shiny just like youre about to do to your devoted wife when youre old and alone if not much sooner you will regret this time to the core of your being i love your placements now pls be my nonstop source of comfort spontaneity and emotional support bc thats just how you are and let me be the curmudgeonly cynic who drains your energy by always needing to be pushed and prodded into making any kind of positive changes in my,YourFriendMaryGrace
life lolol psychedelics are probably one of the most potent portals you will find meditation as well i also love the other suggestions youve gotten like ley lines and the earth chakras also try not to worry too much about the people who think youre off your rocker theyre the ones who are ignorant and uninformed and the way disclosure and scientific discovery is going theyll have to realize that sooner or later wow never thought about it like that it is just a projection and i have heavy neptunepisces influences you just helped me understand so much about myself thank you xd ive been called that a bunch of times im a pisces sun libra rising with lots of aries placements and uranus aspects so im kinda weird hyper and i have my own sense of fashion which i guess is mpdgish always have mixed feelings about being called that though it feels like im going to be expected to fill some kind of endless inspirational role in their life and never need,YourFriendMaryGrace
anything in return but thats just a tangent rant lol keep in mind whatever is out there has been there your entire life the only thing thats really changing is your and the publics awareness i highly suggest mediation both for the mental health benefits as well as for the opportunity to slowly adjust to and even access these higher dimensions theres an old saying first enlightenment then the laundry and i think thats very important and wise no matter what happens no matter how much our understanding of reality expands we still have clothes to wash and pets to feed and stuff so allow yourself to explore the higher dimensions but be intentional about staying grounded in the 3d as well i was raised christian and learned long ago that reality is nothing like were taught feel free to reach out if i can help when i was about 11 i had pet bunny rabbits that lived in a hutch outside the hutch was off the ground and really sturdy and our backyard,YourFriendMaryGrace
was fenced in so i never really worried about them one night i dreamt that dogs broke into the yard and killed them and my dad had tried to save them but couldnt less than a week later thats exactly what happened i knew from then on that time doesnt work like we think it does more recently a coworker that i hadnt really talked to much before he was a temporary worker told me in a dream he was writing a book a few days later he told me he was writing a book lol ive had more but those are the first two that came to mind you are so welcome you deserve the support and im happy that i saw your post and was able to help in some way youve got a lot going on and its completely understandable to need to vent everyone does sometimes again please feel free to reach out anytime 3 i care im glad it was helpful theres lots of past life regression meditations on,YourFriendMaryGrace
youtube if you feel like you want to explore deeper hahaha i assume it was just cloaking everything but its leg maybe like a test run to see if i could handle that before showing me the rest of itself which needless to say i didnt pass it was bizarre and i have no definitive answers for you im happy it resonated with you i see i believe that there are probably a larger variety of species than we can even imagine so predicting what they are like or how they operate isnt really possible as they arent a homogenous group but statistically yes there likely are at least some nhi that operate as you described you might find paul hellyer the former minister of defense of canada accounts comforting he has said that the vast majority of them are benevolent and would like to help us i think were kinda like the bad neighborhood of the universe and the majority of species are more concerned with us messing up our planet to the,YourFriendMaryGrace
point where it affects other planets and species than anything just my humble thoughts are you saying you believe the nhi themselves are malevolent my experiences started very young and were always with benevolent energies so that probably helped a lot im pretty attuned to energy so i can feel when an entity isnt trustworthy and i tell it to leave me be that being said ive still gotten startled and noped out of experiences that i wish i wouldnt have one time i was in my living room and saw the leg of a mantis creature walking by even though i could feel that it was friendly i still kinda panicked and it disappeared its been 6 years and im still hoping they give me another chance to see them the good entities dont want to frighten you so you probably wont have an experience with them until youre ready for it and ifwhen you do try to summon feelings of love peace and excitement the good ones love that and the bad,YourFriendMaryGrace
ones are repelled by it could be but i feel like a bunker is something most people with a ton of money to spare would build anyway i know i would doesnt necessarily mean theyre planning an event also nuclear fallout effects them too unless they want to stay underground forever which would get pretty old im sure you know this but uap sightings increased dramatically after we dropped the bombs and theyve been known to shut down nuclear sites for decades im hopeful that theyre here to stop us from doing worse and maybe help us access the free energy thats been withheld and stuff time will tell maybe thats what theyre trying to help us prevent we can hope i agree i think thats why sightings by regular people seem to be way more prevalent in the last year or two theyre tired of trying to work with our mess of a government and theyre forcing their hands knowing this is probably also why government officials are coming forward with information so,YourFriendMaryGrace
rapidly and the ones who dont have access to information are going on the record as trying to get information they dont want to be known as one of the ones who were keeping secrets crazy times its a total 180 and im delighted thats very sad but also pretty cool ive read lots of accounts of people visiting a new place and past life memories flooding back also souls often like to incarnate within the same family line so they can be with their loved ones again so its very possible you were one of your ancestors happy 16th birthday im glad you opened up and shared here i want to respond to everything so im gonna break it down into a few parts first of all i am so so sorry that you were sa as a child i was too and i know how it feels to not want anyone to know i kept it a secret until i was 27 and i regret that a lot i wish id told,YourFriendMaryGrace
someone much sooner so i could get help even if you dont feel like its affecting you its still really important to be able to get therapy as soon as possible so you can work to process it i encourage you to tell your parents i know its scary but if they are good parents theyll want to know and hopefully they can help you find someone affordable to help you a lot of times insurance will cover therapy as well its perfectly normal to be confused about your sexuality its a spectrum anyway and you dont have to decide how you feel about it just let yourself be open and curious and youll figure it out the most important thing is to love yourself every part of yourself you shouldnt have to be the therapist all the time you deserve support too sometimes parents get overwhelmed and they start to lean on their children more than they should you can be a listening ear if you want to but that doesnt mean you,YourFriendMaryGrace

are being unscientific i keep my experiences to myself unless im confident the person im talking to is open minded and even then i only reveal what i feel comfortable revealing which is often just a small fraction of my experience but if you do feel like trying to demonstrate that you arent being unscientific you can point them to scientific sources on how there are likely at least 10 dimensions and how our eyes see less than half a percent of the electromagnetic spectrum it doesnt always work but it can help people realize that just because they cant see it with their own eyes doesnt mean its not real remember that as disclosure continues on the skeptics are going to have no choice but to accept that reality is not what they thought ive had people who would get so annoyed and argumentative with me talking about aliens eventually end up realizing they were wrong and start asking me questions also that reaction of mocking you or trying to discredit your experience,YourFriendMaryGrace
is likely coming from a place of fear theyre scared to consider that we arent alone and they are just trying to comfort themselves into not believing it by turning on you where did he think eggs came from i need to know pls dont let me down im sorry this happened to you im not familiar with these particular creatures but i do have a suggestion that might help you avoid such encounters make a habit of consciously sending loving protective white light into and surrounding yourself and your home you can practice boundaries with entities just like you do with humans im not saying its foolproof but it can really help this is so cool thank you for sharing are you familiar with philip k dicks experiences with et they helped him save his childs life by informing him of a very serious medical condition the child had that he was unaware of your father calling you guys when youre sick before you even told him reminded me of that im so,YourFriendMaryGrace
sorry this is happening to you 3 thats awful and i know it hurts as the other commenter said be sure you get tested i can relate i was in a relationship where i was very encouraging of his sexual exploration and wanted him to feel so safe and comfortable talking with me about his kinks and stuff i was also clear that i was open to polyamory if it was something he wanted to explore and he always said he wasnt interested then i found out that i had an std and of course the only person id had sex with was him it hurts a lot when youre so open and willing to accommodate and then they just go and do as they please behind your back with no regard for you or your wellbeing but you will pick yourself up and move on and find great happiness just give yourself lots of time and lots of love hes shown you that he cant be trusted youll look back and be so,YourFriendMaryGrace
proud of yourself for leaving him to his own devices sending you big hugs feel free to message me anytime moon and venus signs will tell you a lot more about how you operate in relationships than sun sign example im a pisces sun so i do love to romanticize but my practical capricorn moon and my fiery aries venus will override and cut a toxic person off with a quickness no matter what time they text me lol yes many if not most of these beings are from higher dimensions so our brains and eyes literally cant perceive what they actually look like we just see the shimmers or shadows or orbs or whatever other aspect of them is dense enough to show up in the 3d i think it went something like this boomers created the bullshit with the help of some silent gen gen x knew it was bullshit but were outnumbered so resigned to it and participated millennials been screaming that its all bullshit since 2008 and were called whiny,YourFriendMaryGrace
and entitled for not wanting to participate gen z is now joining in the fight so we are no longer so outnumbered and can maybe actually join together and do something i hope thats so cool all the egyptian deities are powerful and helpful in their own ways im sure but hes the only one ive met so far just my personal experience his energy is very interesting he can alternate between being the fearsome deliverer of karmic justice and this surprisingly goofy friendly guy depending upon how he feels about you and your deeds i guess but hes definitely a protector of those who are trying to bring love and fairness to this world this resonates very well with the information ive received with love and compassion and encouraging others in their selfempowerment being the main focus for me its frustrating sometimes because much of humanity is stuck in a materialistic mindset where they feel they must compete rather than cooperate with others but very large numbers of people are waking up so,YourFriendMaryGrace
im very grateful and hopeful for the future thats a really sad first memory im so sorry hugs thanks for sharing ive definitely had similar experiences perhaps next time you can let go a bit more if youre comfortable leaving your body and astral traveling is amazing and it sounds like you have a lovely helper to guide you in at least one of my past lives i was one of those catlike people 3 made me happy to see you mention them did you ever get a sense of where the ones you interacted with came from well it worked out nicely bc i got to hear more of your awesome music one more piece of advice if i may from my personal experience regarding meeting spirits they tend to show themselves to us when we most need them but they are always there regardless so if you dont meet thoth right away it doesnt mean he doesnt like you when he introduced himself to me last year he said it was because,YourFriendMaryGrace
i was getting a lot of negative energy sent to me from certain people and energies and he was blocking it for me and returning it to them karmically at other times ive had alien encounters that helped me with my mental health ive met the spirits of deceased artists who helped me with my paintings my late grandfather checked in with me when i was having a really hard time going through divorce stuff like that so yeah just be open and meditate and see what happens youre welcome id love to dm were completely surrounded by things we cant see theres at least 10 dimensions and the visible light that humans can perceive is less than half a percent of the actual spectrum so yeah theres no one single giant truth that all experiencers know other than that theres much more to reality than what our almost completely blind human eyes usually see weve seen into those dimensions or have seen pieces of that missing visible light enough to know that aliens,YourFriendMaryGrace
fairies whatever else we have seen are absolutely real some people cannot handle that thought and will try and find any way they can to convince themselves that if they cant see it its not real its scary to them but it exists regardless just like the color red continues to exist whether a colorblind person believes in it or not ohhh i met you the other day in my post about memory gaps after a sighting im sorry i didnt recognize your username at first but i love your style and your drumming and your passion for it thanks so much for sharing 3 i would love to hear your music if youre open to sharing really cool that you write your own according to the egyptians written words are thoths thing too lol yeah its easy for me to say its adorable when im not the one coming face to face with it i just like how it defended its eye shape by comparing it to spider mans eyes makes sense as,YourFriendMaryGrace
a way to try and ease a childs fears it reminds me of my little brother when we were kids he said that a big monster creature had come in his room and she brought a baby monster with her that was very cute so he wouldnt be afraid it seems like they have a lot of strategies for making contact with certain people without scaring us too bad did you feel or sense anything in particular when they held your hand this is adorable lol ive had so many experiences yet ive never met a grey if i ever do get to meet one i hope its one like uppo for me it happened out of the blue one day while i was meditating he told me that he is protective of me and that he especially likes a friend of mine who i had just recently met so i texted that friend about it and turned out he had just finished painting a portrait of thoth i had no idea my friend,YourFriendMaryGrace
and i had never even talked about him before he seems to be drawn to artists writers and most importantly people who are very fair minded he is benevolent but he can dole out karma like a boss so hes not one to take lightly i would suggest just kind of mentally saying hi to him as you go into meditation or sleep and see what happens ooo i wonder the significance of the brokenmissing top then and isnt that the best feeling when you have a visceral experience that is so real and impossible to forget and then you learn of someone else having seen the exact same thing i wonder what happened to poor mars so long ago ive read some very sad past life hypnosis stories of people who were there long ago and they felt so devastated by the sudden destruction of the climate to me it almost sounds like a nuclear catastrophe of some kind but i dont know it could just as easily be a comet or a,YourFriendMaryGrace
technology failure or something ive never had any astral or rv experiences with mars myself but im quite curious about it this is a lovely response and absolutely resonates thanks so much the first time i saw one was as a child and it had such a friendly energy as do the ones im seeing now its really cool that theyre protectors makes me feel extra thankful to be seeing them just whatever information you feel like sharing really i keep seeing them in my dreams this week for the most part no names one exception to this is thoth he introduced himself by name about a year ago i know him by his egyptian name though djehuty hes cool and has a very protective energy and i feel thankful that he seems to like me bc damn it would be scary to be on his bad side lol do you have any experiences or insight into the orange orb type of ships theres been reports for decades of them shutting down our nuclear,YourFriendMaryGrace
facilities dodging missiles and running circles around our jets if they wanted to hurt us they would have by now and i think were about as much of a threat to them as a toddler with a toy sword is to a grownup its also a lot easier for us to stay calm and receptive when were sleeping or meditating and i feel like not scaring us is a big priority for them im curious have you or uvoodoolord ever read this remote viewing report from the cia website that takes place in ancient mars the viewer describes giant pyramids and obelisks and gentle giants really cool experience op thanks so much for sharing absolutely my dreams intuition and ability to sense energy is popping off too its been extra ramped up since sunday it feels like our conscious minds are expanding stay grounded loving and fearless everybody i love it setting a reminder on my phone wow this is synchronous i have been dreaming about these orange orbs a lot lately i saw,YourFriendMaryGrace
one when i was a kid it was cute lol thanks for sharing this theory it makes a lot of sense i suspect that they probably use all sorts of methods and make use of elements we humans cant see or fully comprehend just yet would you mind sharing about the orange orb you saw like where were you what did it do edit never mind i found your old post love it and im glad i found you bc like i said i keep dreamingthinking about the orange ones all the sudden it feels theres a lot of them hanging around earth for the past week or so edit again do you happen to recall what kind of trees it was hanging out above when you first spotted it the ones i see seem to like pine trees so i was just curious youre welcome i might not be able to relate to everything youve been through but i know how much it hurts to have your trust betrayed to feel guilt about,YourFriendMaryGrace
mistakes and ive been able to work through a lot of trauma over time and learn to release myself from a lot of pain if i can help you too im happy to do it so pls feel free to message any time i care love this question i remember my first nightmare clearly i was about 4 or 5 years old the dream took place late at night at my grandparents house with my whole extended family gathered together we all knew that the wolves were coming this was absolutely terrifying it wasnt clear what the wolves were going to do to us just that it was very very bad and there was nothing we could do to save ourselves there were giant purple clocks on the wall loudly ticking the time away other than that it was silent all we could do was wait for the wolves to come wow i wish we could chat in real life i could talk about all this for hours i have astral traveled to just,YourFriendMaryGrace
one ancient site but it changed the way i view humanity for sure love this comment thank you for responding thats so sweet thank you for sharing this story its a lovely reminder of how even a simple word or gesture can make someones life better i hope youre doing well and that your family continues to learn to love and support you as you are thats really tough im sorry youre going through this other than informing your friends parents or a school counselor about it theres only so much you can do be prepared to explain your concerns to your friend and remind them that they dont deserve to be treated that way im glad youre still here hope youre doing okay 3 thanks so much for the recommendation im very interested especially in the antediluvian so i will check those out i love this really thoughtprovoking thanks to you and chatgpt for sharing your thoughts youre welcome always here if you want to chat hey im really sorry for your loss,YourFriendMaryGrace
friend 3 grief is a weird process some days you might feel energized and focused on what needs to be done other days you might feel lost like you cant think straight it can even change by the hour just know that theres no right or wrong way to feel at any given time when you do feel like crying really let it out it helps so much lots of love to you and your family this made me laugh so hard i cant imagine how painful that would be to try and snort i hope hes doing well wherever he is lol i agree that certainly seems to be the deciding factor in all these cases those who freak out forget those who stay relatively calm recall i can only speak for my personal experiences and how theyve felt to me but i always sense that they just want to make sure i see them and sort of introduce themselves gently perhaps by sprinkling sightings and experiences throughout peoples lives theyre identifying who,YourFriendMaryGrace
can handle their presence and who will be overwhelmed by fear much more polite than the hollywood ufo movie way of just barging in doing what they want and leaving chaos and confusion in their wake lol i wonder what their next steps will be im looking forward to seeing what happens hey i appreciate you taking my perspective into consideration youre a great writer btw i was with you all the way up until the end theres no reason at all to assume this is cause for alarm its beautiful and most people are reporting feeling great today its not my place to tell you how to feel but personally i think fear is not needed or helpful at this time its a measurement of the earths magnetic frequencies so imagine it like a heartbeat chart for the earth youd expect it to have lines going up and down and thats about it all we can say right now is that its entirely unprecedented and beyond what any of us would have thought,YourFriendMaryGrace
possible personally ive been in a funk and woke up today feeling amazing many people are saying similar so anecdotally i think its a great thing thank you so much it is indeed very freeing im headed to the backyard now to paint some more im so sorry that happened to you friend 3 im glad you had the ability to channel all those heavy emotions through music i do the same with my art its therapeutic for sure i hope youre doing better now damn 30 orbs thats a lot its interesting that you guys were with his folks do you remember what their reaction was like that first one is so odd like he was ready to deny it right away lol your second one is similar to an experience i had when i was about 11 years old i was hanging out on some land my parents had just bought i talked to my older brother for a few minutes and then wandered out into a field by myself the last,YourFriendMaryGrace
thing i remember was just spinning and frolicking around having fun then suddenly i woke up lying on the ground i wasnt in any pain i somehow sensed that more time had passed than the 5 or 10 minutes since id seen my brother so i went and found him and asked how long id been gone and he said at least an hour for some reason i felt totally chill about it but didnt want to tell him or my parents i agree it seems like some of us are monitored or something because it seems like people either have zero sightingsexperiences or they have several yes super vivid dreams im so excited right now ive been checking this almost daily for about 5 years and its never ever looked anything remotely close to this im so excited assuming you mean its me thats delusional do you consider all of the air force pilots dept heads of the us and many other countries as well as countless other citizens who report sightings delusional,YourFriendMaryGrace
too how hard is it for you to believe that were not alone in this universe and that our spacetraversing technology might be primitive in comparison to other species to me it seems more likely than not but of course i respect your right to differ eeeesh yeah that would have really freaked me out i wonder what they were doing i always feel like there must be some kind of purpose to them being seen when and where they are considering how they seem to be able to cloakzip away as they please wow that song is powerful so much emotion and intensity im so glad you shared it ive always wished i could be a drummer but i lack the coordination lol heres a video of me painting like a crazy person bc why not always nice to meet a fellow creative soul im sorry he distanced himself from you that sucks i feel like with all the disclosure ramping up folks like him are going to have a hard time adjusting,YourFriendMaryGrace
but eventually they will get used to the idea that were not alone and who knows maybe you can patch things up edit unless of course hes not of this earth himself in which case i have no idea how disclosure might affect him oooo see thats super interesting because it seems like that would indicate that they do a memory wipe of some kind but its faulty or maybe its designed that way idk maybe by setting it so that you only recall it when its a few days later youre able to process the experience without as much panic did you happen to notice any missing time i read a story of a couple that had a similar sighting but there was a few hours missing from their recollection wow im not generally afraid of uap but your particular sighting probably would have freaked me out too its cool that she was able to eventually communicate with you about why she was downplaying it before that must have been a relief for,YourFriendMaryGrace
you on some level lol i truly appreciate the empathy honestly the experience of him suddenly not remembering it was almost as startling as the sighting itself if brett ever forgets pls update me nope i had left my phone on my blanket in the middle of the yard when i went inside to get him the sighting was only about 15 seconds long and happened as soon as we stepped off the back porch but tbh i understand now why so many people dont take videos even when they have a sighting with phone in hand its such a completely overwhelming experience that most people are going to have some kind of amygdala based response lol i can absolutely see how it would activate a freeze response for many people and that primitive survival instinct takes precedence over filming wow thats fascinating thank you quite a few comments in there about people experiencing memory loss after having one of these sightings oh man thats creepy almost sounds like some sort of mind programming,YourFriendMaryGrace
does he just change the subject or go silent until you do ooo would you mind linking me to info on this lol i mean whistleblowers have been known to say the nordics walk among us so who knows either way its curious that he doesnt want to recall or talk about it the cognitive dissonance of not wanting to believe but also seeing proof with their own eyes is very very uncomfortable for some people i guess is it though i was raised christian and it seemed about 5050 on whether or not christians believed aliens could exist ive even heard john 1016 jesus saying i have other sheep that are not of this fold interpreted as possibly referring to beings on other planets not trying to argue just curious what makes you say its unbiblical ohhh thats interesting i guess maybe she remembers then but just tries not to im glad at least your son remembered and can talk about it im curious what your mom will say update me if you,YourFriendMaryGrace
can thats not true at all ive been mediating for years and i agree that the benefits are life changing but ive also done mdma for therapeutic purposes and experienced permanent life changing results from that as well i healed more from my trauma in one day with mdma than i had in years of therapy combined i was able to get off of antidepressants for good when done properly the benefits last a lifetime im so glad its not just me i really wish i knew why this happens if my kids dad was the type to disbelieve or just try and ignore things id assume he blocked it out of his mind on purpose but hes not like that at all hes very open minded and curious i wonder if the aliens themselves would have reason to remove certain peoples memories but if so why would they take his and your wifes memories but not ours id love to hear more of your story if youre interested in sharing im curious what,YourFriendMaryGrace
your wifes reaction was to it at the time and did you two talk about it afterwards do you know about how long after the sighting she seemed to forget thanks for sharing your experience its really cool i have several but heres two of my favorites i left my body by accidentally astral projecting i woke up one morning but laid there with my eyes closed bc i didnt want to get up yet but the fear of oversleeping for work kept me right in that perfect inbetween meditative state so that when i finally decided to sit up i just floated right out of my body towards the ceiling lol i knew what was happening so i tried to get the mechanics right and move intentionally but it was tricky i finally got enough of a hang of it enough to start floating towards one of my paintings to see if i could touch it but then my snooze alarm went off and i floated gently back to my body intriguingly it,YourFriendMaryGrace
seemed to be an alternate timeline or something because it was a different house entirely until i got back into my body but i knew it was my house this one might not count because it was during a past life regression so its more like a memory of leaving my body that i saw in first person it was the 1960s and i was a woman in my 40s very sick in the hospital i was sleeping and all the sudden i was floating above my body i had no spiritual or religious beliefs in this lifetime so i was just floating there like wtf do i do now for what felt like a long time until i finally realized that i had no obligation to stay there with my body then i was a little ball of light and i zipped around the world looking at the eiffel tower and stuff id always wanted to see then i went up to a very heavenly looking place and reunited with my long lost,YourFriendMaryGrace
childhood best friend hes the father of my children in this life and still my best friend wow ive never read a nde quite like this before thank you so much for sharing im glad you came back and wish all the best for you and your loved ones its so crazy to think about right how not only are we blind to other dimensions but we see less than half a percent of the electromagnetic spectrum thats why it makes me a little crazy when people say that aliens fairies or whatever else cant possibly be real to me its like a color blind person refusing to believe the color red could be real thats crazy i cant imagine something like that becoming routine but i guess just about anything does if you do it long enough im so intrigued i wouldnt have guessed this was so common i guess its hard to know but are these likely to be murdered and stashed bodies tell him that youre concerned about him that youve,YourFriendMaryGrace
been noticing him acting differently that you love him and you want to help remind him that you guys are supposed to be together in good times and bad and that you wont think any less of him for having a hard time if hes reluctant to go to therapy on his own offering to go together might help oh sweetheart what youre feeling is completely understandable allow yourself plenty of time to grieve for the relationship and the friendships and the future you hoped to have with them dont feel bad for feeling sad thats just adding shame on top of the sadness let yourself cry and listen to sad songs and whatever else you need to do to get it out but make sure to keep doing things you enjoy too look for opportunities to make new friends by volunteering or joining groups that do activities you like or would like to try things will get better a little at a time hugs im so sorry for all you experienced both the,YourFriendMaryGrace
painful of your dad loss and the complete lack of support from your partner not to mention the cheating thats awful if you can trust a woman on the internet enough to accept some internet hugs then hugs try going to therapy if you can they can help you work through the feelings of guilt and shame and also help you figure out why you did these things in the first place have you ever heard the expression hurt people hurt people its true usually when people cause others pain its because they have some unresolved issues that are causing them to act like they are getting to the bottom of that will be really helpful in forgiving yourself as well as doing better going forward big hugs 3 well wanting to be a better person is the best place to start try to forgive yourself we all make mistakes and have regrets it may be too late to get this person back in your life but you can grow and do better and,YourFriendMaryGrace
be better for the next person yeah ive been the ex in this situation and at a certain point it just starts to feel like just they apologize to get you back into their life so they can hurt you again its possible your ex wont want to hear it no matter what you say but if you really want to say something like i deeply regret the pain i caused you im so sorry for my actions and for the way i made you feel i care about you very much and i hope you are doing well i would focus more on the apology than the gift express your remorse and acknowledge your mistakes without making excuses without knowing what you did its hard to say what you should write specifically but thats a good start its very much okay that you cant be fully supportive of your friends in a genuine way right now it doesnt make you a bad friend at all for now you can go through the motions,YourFriendMaryGrace
by following a simple formula listen empathize and reflect for example im sorry youre going through this at work right now it sounds really frustrating for bonus points you can ask a follow up question and just listen some more most of the time people just need to vent more than anything but dont put pressure on yourself if theyre good friends theyll understand that you cant be at full friend capacity right now sincere condolences for the loss of your sister be patient with yourself and kind to yourself man matthew 6 is jam packed with things most christians try so hard to ignore i guess thats true of most things jesus said though i dont expect anyone to believe me but i saw the leg just the leg of one of these guys walk through my living room about 6 years ago it felt like my heart stopped ive always wondered if it meant to be seen or if it was just a brief interdimensional glitch just because people have it worse,YourFriendMaryGrace
doesnt mean you arent supposed to be sad or upset about things remember that youre still growing and changing your brain wont even be done developing for like 7 more years you do have a lot to look forward to and its not hopeless as for the social anxiety and assuming the worst try and remember that people are busy with their own lives and it isnt a reflection of you i sometimes forget to message people that i love very much for like days lol try and get involved in some new hobbies and learn new things life will get better be kind to yourself my heart hurts for you im so so very sorry i cant imagine the pain you must be feeling please get into therapy as soon as you possibly can you need and deserve the support sending you lots of love and hugs i think its time to tell your mom everything about the phone and waking up to him touching you all of it i know its really,YourFriendMaryGrace
hard and scary and uncertain but the spying alone in so messed up and she needs to know what her husband is doing for her protection and yours he wont stop and he cant keep getting away with it you and your mom arent safe im so sorry that youve had your feelings dismissed and been made to feel like a burden humans are social creatures and its natural to want to belong and feel supported im always here if you want to chat im really sorry i can only imagine how sad and stressful that must be for what its worth this internet stranger is thinking of you and sending you hugs and cozy blankets and chamomile tea first of all happy birthday im sorry youre going through all this thats a huge amount of stress on your father that im sure he is still traumatized by so try not to take his words too personally im sure he loves you very much give it a little more time and hopefully you two,YourFriendMaryGrace
can talk it out oh sweetie its gonna be okay im sorry i felt very similarly at your age and it felt like id feel like that forever but guess what it didnt looking back im so so thankful i held on because i had no idea at the time how much better life could be please dont worry about being a burden or them needing to spend more money i promise you theyd rather spend every penny they have than lose you you deserve to be happy be kind to yourself and keep doing things you enjoy even when you dont feel like it im always here if you want to chat 3 lol a dancing monkey exactly im sure theres plenty of people out there who feel the same and will appreciate a genuine person being themselves so dont lose hope and thank you you do deserve better i really benefited from taking some time off from dating to work on my confidence and building up my sense of self until you,YourFriendMaryGrace
really respect yourself enough to not put up with peoples bullshit youll keep attracting the bullshit people im a 38 year old woman but i very much relate online dating is so messed up you have to try and post the best pics and describe yourself in a cute catchy way and then be witty in texts and it all just feels so forced and fake and yeah people are very flakey i feel like everyone has it in their heads that someone better is just a swipe away so theyre not even trying to get to know anybody in depth also a lot of men get really mad if you arent trying to sleep with them on the first date like scary mad im at the same point as you not giving up but not interested in putting in much effort anymore either i do hope you find someone great tho seconding this learning about my north node sign and house has helped me immensely especially since many of us tend to shy,YourFriendMaryGrace
away from the very things were meant to be working towards could definitely be past lives its also possible to accidentally remote view in a dream in which case they would be strangers and your subconscious just kinda clicked onto their channel i have experienced both and for me viewing past lives feels very personal i know its me whereas remote viewing feels more distant and unfamiliar even though im seeing it from their perspective edit to add just as an example ive seen a lifetime in which i was a little tribal boy even though his life was nothing like my current life everything about it felt so real and relatable and like a memory in remote viewing ive accidentally seen through the perspective of a woman my age with a similar lifestyle yet she felt like a complete stranger maybe he was just glad to see you and the words didnt seem so important as just making sure you knew that he knew you were there 3 im so sorry for your,YourFriendMaryGrace
loss ive seen a life in multiple past life regressions plus a few vivid dreams where i was a catlikehumanoid being on another planet most of my friends were these giant blue lobster looking guys i liked to run fast and climb trees the terrain was not too different from earth but everyone lived in small houses with no hierarchies or government or money just communities this might sound weird but it was so peaceful that it was kind of boring to me personally sometimes so i would periodically go on spaceships to negotiate with other species in other ships that were not as peaceful as us and basically try and persuade them to be nicer to each other lol but when i was on the ships i couldnt run and climb so id get stir crazy and frustrated so it was always kind of a challenge of being under stimulated one way or another stay hydrated and only watchlisten to stuff thats happy and positive itll wear off eventually i promise im so,YourFriendMaryGrace
sorry 3 this is so heartbreaking im so sorry you went to this nightmare i wish i could give you a hug ive had to do a lot of healing work myself and would be happy to chat any time just reach out 3 it really helped me feel better about death i hope it helps you too wishing you all the best im sorry for your loss he was lucky to have someone like you in his life who cared about him are you in contact with his mom at all it might be healing to reach out to her and let her know that youre thinking of her and remember her son fondly i did that for the mom of an old friend of mine who passed and im glad i did i felt weird about it bc he and i hadnt talked for years but she was so grateful also it might be helpful for you to search up stories about peoples near death experiences theres tons of them online and,YourFriendMaryGrace
they are so cool the vast majority of people experience total peace and acceptance im sure your friend did too first of all i want to acknowledge that you have stepped up in this kiddos life and are doing your best to support her i know its not easy try and keep in mind that shes at an incredibly difficult age right now between the hormones and her brain developing and changing rapidly you gotta understand that shes just going to be challenging a lot of the time its not personal and its not even indicative of her true personality i couldnt stand my mom when i was that age and now i adore her lol that combined with the difficulty of having an unhealthy mom is im sure really hard for your stepdaughter theres nothing wrong with her being excited about a new room or wanting to be with her mom even if it isnt at all in her best interests so try not to hold that against her it worries me that,YourFriendMaryGrace
yall decided if she wants to act like an adult she can deal with it like an adult please dont keep her out of the conversation and cause her more pain and frustration just to teach her a lesson she needs support and understanding here shes going to be an adult before you know it and shell remember this time please take breaks and take care of yourself so youre able to handle her teenage years with love care and most of all empathy and make sure youre incorporating plenty positive reinforcement for her efforts at school its far more healthy and uplifting than punishments edited to add a sentence i really think you should get into therapy if you possibly can it sounds like youre holding onto a lot of pain from the relationship understandable and you could use some help sorting it out guilt is helpful if it helps you learn how to be a better person but if its holding you back from being able to live a good life or,YourFriendMaryGrace
feel like you deserve to be happy than thats not helping anyone the world doesnt benefit from you feeling like shit about yourself forever also karma is a tricky thing sometimes it can take years for people to learn from their mistakes some people never do you cant assume shes happy just because shes pretending to be on the internet im glad to hear that its a long road but youll feel better little by little be patient with yourself and again im so sorry for everything youve been through you do deserve to be happy obviously cheating is wrong but so is physical abuse everybody makes mistakes its okay you can learn from this not to stay in an unhealthy relationship especially if theres abuse of any kind and i really doubt theyre as happy as they seem it sounds more like they teamed up to try and hurt you id strongly suggest blocking them both and moving on with your life learn about healthy relationships and how they work so youre better,YourFriendMaryGrace

sending lots of love feel free to message if you want to chat i read your whole post and damn i am so very sorry youve experienced so many tragic losses my heart goes out to you i can understand why youd be afraid to make friends now after so much trauma i think it might be worth trying to find another therapist unfortunately some of them just suck and anyone who would tell you simply get a pet isnt a good fit you need help to unpack and process all of this im so glad the mushrooms were helpful the amazing thing about them is that they actually help you create new neural pathways in your brain so they can help you heal from trauma on a physical level literally rewiring your thought processes have you ever looked into microdosing them it might be worth a try also if youre open to it and can do so safely mdma is incredibly healing when taken in a peaceful environment with the intention to heal,YourFriendMaryGrace
trauma im always here if you want to chat its not trauma dumping to want to express what youre feeling to someone who cares and i care im sorry 3 would talk to your lawyer about it but in most places releasing that type of content without your consent would get him in a lot of trouble i know it sucks but personally i wouldnt bring it up to him like you said it probably would just make him more likely to be manipulative about it hugs going to university right after high school is overrated and a lot of times just a bad idea its not realistic or fair to expect people that young to know what they want to do for the rest of their lives i love your dream of being a florist i suggest finding a job at a florist so you can learn about the business while saving up money when people ask you about what youll be studying you dont have to tell them that you didnt get,YourFriendMaryGrace
accepted just say that youre going to take some time to work and help your family out and remember that you dont have to go to school to study english or literature the internet is an endless resource and you can learn the things that interest you most also im very sorry for the loss of your mom im a mom and i just want to say that youre doing great and im very proud of you 3 wait whats that i eat avocados every day i wanna try it for me it was very vivid imagery it was like watching a movie where you dont know what will happen next but it played out very quickly in a few scenes depending on the lifetime you see you may experience some unpleasant emotions but even those are very helpful for understanding what affects they have on you in this lifetime and you can always stop it at any time well im a mostly white person im horrified by racism and would never defend it,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont hang out with anyone who would i really think you need to get out in the real world a little more and spend less time on the internet friend your perspectives are very skewed and its causing you to live in a really ugly version of reality im not saying that the world is all rainbows and sunshine but theres so much more kindness and compassion than you seem to realize social media is dangerous because it shows you more of what you respond to good or bad for every woman or man on the internet you see doing awful things theres thousands more going through life being loving caring people i was in a relationship with a very narcissistic guy and because i searched up narcissistic men on tiktok suddenly my fyp was full of toxic men doing horrible things it would be easy to start believing all men are like that but i know it simply isnt true youll miss out on all the good things and people in life,YourFriendMaryGrace
if youre focused on the bad if youre happy with being single then theres nothing broken at all society makes romantic relationships seem like the ultimate form of happiness in life but thats simply not true so dont beat yourself up about it do the things that make you happy and focus on your friendships if later on you feel like dating go for it but do it because you want to and not because you feel like youre supposed to im sorry for some reason a lot of people think that its fine to make comments about someones weight as long as theyre skinny and not overweight its weird and its really rude dont be afraid to tell people that you dont want to hear comments about your body or how much youre eating its none of their business im really sorry its hard to lose a connection with someone she definitely should have answered you honestly when you asked if she was in a relationship give yourself time to feel sad about,YourFriendMaryGrace
it and know that little by little you will feel better you deserve to be loved and appreciated and you deserve to be with someone who can be honest with you youll find someone and in the meantime please give yourself a hug from me 3 youre so welcome love you deserve all the kindness and support you can get i know what you mean about not being able to bring yourself to say the words out loud i was 27 before i finally told someone but the minute i finally said it out loud to someone i felt enormous relief i know it can feel like youre the only person in the world whos been through this but sadly its not uncommon at all therapists are there to help and they are trained to help with this exact situation including the feelings of shame and guilt which are also very common im here for you anytime you want to talk 3 thats really cool you were able to lucid dream a little bit,YourFriendMaryGrace
ive only managed it twice and both times i woke up as soon as i realized lol auntyflo is probably my favorite it has a massive amount of dream interpretations and usually has a few possible meanings for each one depending on context it sounds like you have a lot of conditioning and ideas about what men should be like that are confusing you you are you and you are a unique person with lots to offer id suggest putting down the porn and the romance books for a while both are complete fiction and not at all a realistic idea of what it is to be in a relationship women are diverse and they are looking for different things so try not to get caught up in the idea that all women want this or that one womans fantasy is another womans nightmare lol i know it sounds cliche but try to just focus on learning who you are apart from all these other peoples opinions the more you learn to be who,YourFriendMaryGrace
you are the more youll find people who appreciate you i am so very sorry this happened to you my heart hurts for you the only responsibility that man had was to protect you and he did the opposite it was never your fault and you were never to blame even if you straight up asked him to it would still be entirely and completely his fault have you been able to get into therapy sending you lots of love i promise you even the people who seem like they never have to question themselves or how they fit in still do i worked with celebrities for years and you would be amazed at how many of those people were cripplingly insecure no matter how rich famous beautiful straight whatever you are real happiness only comes from within selfacceptance is a journey and for me it didnt come until my early 30s after lots of therapy including some alternative therapy also you mentioned not feeling like you fit in with the current queer culture,YourFriendMaryGrace
please know thats totally okay theres something painful but beautiful about not quite fitting in anywhere it means you have something special to offer to the world and if you try to fit perfectly into a little box youll never shine the way youre meant to theres a whole lot of philosophies and religions that are based on these ideas so i dont know of one particular name to give you but you might enjoy checking out rreincarnation and rpastlives theres discussions and tons of amazing stories past life regression meditation is where you go into a meditative state and with the help of a hypnotist irl or on the video you are able to look at a life youve lived before it doesnt always work so dont get discouraged ive probably done it at least a dozen times but ive only seen 4 lives heres a good one but theres lots more if that one doesnt work for you also if youre on tiktok i highly recommend searching christian deconstructing theres a huge,YourFriendMaryGrace
community of people who are going through the same process you are and its very encouraging i understand its a process and its not always linear im proud of you for working on your healing its not easy and you are strong im sorry this is happening to you dreams are your subconscious minds way of trying to make you face what youre feeling in real life unfortunately it does this by writing crazy scripts packed with metaphors since you often dream about being trapped id imagine you are feeling trapped in some way in your real life you can google any detail of your dreams and the meaning and find lots of possible interpretations but feel free to message me if you like i was raised christian and now i believe exactly what you described i did some past life regression meditations on youtube that totally changed my perspective if you scroll down through my old posts i wrote about it in one called i feel like i was healed of some inherited,YourFriendMaryGrace
trauma while meditating where i described one of my experiences that one left me unable to believe in a god that would send people to hell ever again i know how hard it is to leave religion especially when youve been in it your whole life and your friends and family are in it too but remember that you and only you get to decide what you believe and you dont even have to decide give yourself time and space to just be open minded and curious and explore and let your heart guide you wow thats actually pretty special i study dreams and my advice would be to try and work with them as soon as you open your eyes in the morning write down or type in your phone every detail of the dreams that you can remember you can learn a lot about what your subconscious mind is trying to tell you by googling the meaning behind various aspects of your dreams for example people who are in a stressful out,YourFriendMaryGrace
of control situation in life often dream of being in a speeding car they cant properly drive or with brakes that dont work but meanings aside just the act of starting the day by writing out your dreams will help you create a clearer distinction between waking and dreaming time and side note theres a lot of fun things you can do with dreams like lucid dreaming and astral projection that might be easier for you than most im so sorry this happened to you and so sorry that the adults who should have protected you failed to do so you deserved better if you havent already going to therapy could really really help sa affects us in ways that arent always obvious but you can work through it i promise hahaha this johnny cash guy is gonna make a name for himself someday i can feel it i love that did anything in particular prompt you to start coming up with it a most delicious discovery i remember having a sore throat when,YourFriendMaryGrace
i was little and noticing how good it felt to breathe the steam coming from the dishwasher i definitely thought i was going to be famous for discovering that steam relieves sore throats its hard to explain to anyone who hasnt experienced it a massive something flew over my car silently late at night on my 30th birthday my husband and i were freaking out and staring in disbelief and it did occur to me to get my phone out but i just didnt i couldnt stop staring and i didnt want to miss anything i get why people who havent seen anything like that would think that it would be second nature to whip out the phone but it just felt like a very low priority to me in that moment for some reason i would be very tempted to accidentally not make it to the bathroom every time i needed to vomit for the rest of the shift the only thing that would stop me is knowing someone who is also underpaid,YourFriendMaryGrace
would have to clean it up if yall arent in contact i think it would be best to keep it that way i agree with you perhaps i should have worded it differently and said that she should be with someone who loves her as she is you should be doing what makes you feel good and he should love you as you are its weird that hes mad about this if he likes seeing you dressed up thats cool but he should give you a chance to get dressed up for something that makes sense like a nice dinner not football lol im sorry you are capable of having a healthy happy relationship even if it didnt work out for your mom she probably means well but shes misguided in thinking that all marriages end horribly lol you have to live your own life and make the choices that are right for you run no amount of beauty is worth being physically abused and manipulated over shell only get worse i promise you,YourFriendMaryGrace
youll be 10x happier with someone who is sane loving and would never dream of hurting you on purpose i dont feel like its that simple for this long of a relationship it kinda is though whether youve been together for a month or a decade the fact that his family does not support your relationship and not only excludes you but actively tries to replace you is a huge problem clearly hes not able to make them cut it out completely and respect your relationship together hes trying to toe the line between pleasing you and them but thats not possible because theyre opposed to you being around at all i know its hard but please consider if this is what you want for your future because they wont change and it will be a continual source of tension and hurt can you please give some examples of him needling poking the bear its hard to get a read on the situation without more context if you feel yourself getting angry do you,YourFriendMaryGrace
walk away from the conversation to cool off yes that is very manipulative for sure thats emotional abuse on top of the physical abuse im very glad you got away from him now you know to walk away at the first sign of someone not respecting your boundaries because if theyll do it once theyll do it again worse and worse big hugs to you im proud of you for getting away and learning from it im so sorry this happened to you im concerned that you feel bad about threatening to punch him in that scenario please know that if youre ever in that situation again you need to do what you need to do to get away punch him in the face balls whatever you can your friend is the one whos fake af if shes taking his side keep them and people like them out of your life thats really sad for her im so glad shes in therapy her innocence was taken away at a very young age due to,YourFriendMaryGrace
that exposure and she needs support be a listening ear empathize with her and be supportive of her going to therapy and working through the trauma healing is very much possible and it sounds like shes doing what she can youre allowed to feel how you feel porn is highly addictive and he may have a problem if thats a deal breaker for you thats completely fine and nothing you should feel bad about talk to him about it and see how he responds dont feel bad about how you feel or try and pretend to be cool with it if youre not yeah and im sure that was difficult to deal with since youre only trying to help try and keep in mind that ed is a form of addiction so just like with any addict when they feel like their addiction is being threatened they will lash out even at the people who are trying to help its tough and my heart goes out to you personally the mundane daily life stuff,YourFriendMaryGrace
from the ancient past is the most interesting to me im not that interested in battles or notable events but i love looking at ancient hair and makeup products restaurants home decor etc it sounds like he felt cornered and accused next time try and use more empathetic language like i love the both of you very much and your health and well being is important to me please know that if you ever need support with your ed or anything else now or in the future id like to help they are adults and they have to make their own decisions so theres only so much you can do im sorry oh my usqitten has given you some solid advice that i agree with please take it to heart the next step with people like her is usually gaslighting making you feel confused and crazy for having a problem with her behavior so please try to keep a clear head and get some outside support as soon as possible that scares me so,YourFriendMaryGrace
much to know that people are being actively shamed for showing empathy empathy is like the 1 ingredient to a healthy society lack of empathy indicates a seriously emotionally unintelligent person if that becomes the ideal were screwed whaaa familiarize yourself with darvo deny attack reverse victim and offender thats what shes doing theres nothing misogynistic about standing up for yourself and not wanting to be called names does she do this with issues you try to address i am so very sorry that you lost your brother and father thats an enormous trauma and its very understandable that its affecting your relationships are you in therapy i think you touched on something very important when you said its the same thing i say to myself most of the time we can only give to others the amount of love and empathy that we give to ourselves if youre telling yourself that you shouldnt complain about little problems you wont be able to empathize with others problems either pain comes in all shapes and,YourFriendMaryGrace
sizes youre allowed to feel upset about things even if they seem small compared to the tragedy youve experienced and other people are too try and find compassion for yourself and it will get easier to show compassion to your friends please give yourself a hug from me and feel free to reach out any time i care im afraid that cant be your problem he has to want to change make solid efforts to do so and find support along the way as it stands youre enabling him which is the last thing he needs i dont want to sound harsh because i know youre confused and caught up in all this but you have to kick him out and let him hit rock bottom out of your sight for your own sake and his coming back to add congrats on getting sober and pulling your life together again that takes enormous strength and im proud of you now boot him lol oh my bad im not sure why i thought it was,YourFriendMaryGrace
it sounds like she might not even be aware of why shes getting triggered but even if she is aware the fact that she wont communicate her issue is all the more reason to try and not let it affect you too much at any age but at your age especially relationships are about learning and growing and getting to know yourself better dont let her weirdness throw you off and make you overthink something thats making you happy thats odd i wonder if deep down shes feeling sadweird about the fact that youre in your first relationship and just trying to slow it down for her own comfort at 4 months its perfectly normal to talk every day you could try asking her if shes got any concerns but at the end of the day only you can decide whats best for you in this relationship i hope op sees this i feel so bad for him well regardless shes definitely into you and i think you should ask her to hang out,YourFriendMaryGrace
sometime absolutely do not keep him around kick him out change the locks and never speak to him again he ruined your life once and hell do it again narcissistic people almost always have an addiction of some kind and they will bleed you dry of your time energy and money for as long as you let them who cares that hes attractive i promise you youd be a billion times better off with a healthy happy partner who is less attractive than this mess of a person do not fool yourself into thinking you can help him or that youre his best chance to selfimprovement narcissists love it when you think youre the super special person that can save them because it incentives you to keep trying hes not going to change no matter what you do it sounds like its way too early for either of you to really know how you feel besides that you like each other and want to see where it goes so im not sure what your,YourFriendMaryGrace
question is from what youve shared here shes 100 into you she was probably hoping for more than just what when she said shed kiss you so she took it back if shes shy then youre probably gonna have to make the next move aww man my heart goes out to you friend i can tell that you take things very seriously when it comes to how you behave and treat others you are not a horrible person by any means your intentions were misguided but honorable i think you already know this but your definition of love is very skewed love is not about putting your own needs and feelings aside and suffering in silence not at all in fact you can only love others to the degree that you love yourself i gather that it might be challenging for you as you tend to intellectualize more than you feel but try to really offer yourself as much love and respect and forgiveness as you can throughout all this youve already been selfharming,YourFriendMaryGrace
by way of ignoring your own needs dont double down on it by shaming yourself for the fallout if you can get into therapy i think it would be really helpful and definitely try reading some books on healthy relationships so you have a better understanding about what it means to be a good partner youre welcome i hope the conversation goes well aww man im glad youre at least a little more comfortable but still that sucks dont let the fact that your mom is paying for everything keep you from being upfront about your needs and having a bed is a pretty basic need if she really cares about you having a nice time thats the least she can do and congrats on the wedding i am so sorry youre going through this i dont know of course but its possible he could have attachment issues read up on avoidant attachment specifically but regardless of the reason which you may never know for sure allow yourself plenty of time to grieve the,YourFriendMaryGrace
loss of what you had and what you hoped you could have together youre in the hardest part right now and it will get easier i promise i went through something similar and had to learn the hard way to pace myself in relationships because it really does take time to learn how another person operates on a deep level i think that as you heal and grow from this it will get easier to vet future partners and give yourself some time to feel it out before falling too deep there are people out there who will love you just as deeply as you love them i promise another thought if you are able to you could go ahead and go find a couch or something in the house and that will kickstart the conversation in the morning when she finds you no longer on the boat oh my you have every right to be annoyed youre the one being celebrated you shouldnt be sleeping on the floor lol im sorry babe it,YourFriendMaryGrace
sounds like its too late to switch it up tonight but in the morning i would tell her that you were really uncomfortable and will need an actual bed for the remainder of the trip if you think she might be argumentative or weird about it then bring it up in the group so that others can help you figure something out definitely bring it up if its bothering you theres a whole range of possibilities he could just be feeling a little down and its affecting his communication style he could have avoidant attachment issues and you guys getting closer triggered him etc try to open up communication and see what he says if you cant get a straight answer from him or he says nothings wrong but then continues to be distant its probably time to walk away good luck that makes my day thank you love ahhhh thank you so much ive been thinking of it like a portal so looking at it through your eyes as a sun or moon,YourFriendMaryGrace
adds a whole new perspective and i love it uartisticnoob both those comparisons are making my day thank you guys that means so much to me thank you love this gorgeous love the title too thank you so much thank you so much heres a video showing a bit of my process i love your style thank you love the background colors oops meant to write 4ft tall cardboard not 5ft anyway heres a video of my process yes i use brushes occasionally but i find that painting with my hands really helps me loosen up and stop overthinking everything im glad it found you and you replied its really nice to know its not just me i have an aries stellium too lol we neeeeed the excitement i have an aries mars so i act like i have no sense whatsoever oh my goodness this made me cry so much wow wow wow i am so proud of you and happy for you and thankful to hear that youre doing so well 3,YourFriendMaryGrace
you have unbelievable strength and power to have made it through everything youve been through i knew you could do it 3 thank you so much for this message it means the world to know that it helped you im always in your corner and here for you any time i have a capricorn moon so i feel bad for myself that i dont know how to feel well that was way too accurate no problem good luck to both of you guys absolutely just the fact that you already kinda talked about it even if it was just joking really helps my ex and i would joke about staying friends no matter what too and we have you might need some time to adjust and reset as individuals but just continue to be respectful and supportive of each other and youll be good i love this so so much oh my goodness im so very sorry you went through that especially so many times its a heartbreak i wouldnt wish on my worst,YourFriendMaryGrace
enemy and yes we do need much better resources for helping people cope and less stigma around talking about it because its so common but so rarely discussed i mean yes of course thats a bizarre and disturbing thing to do but people dealing with extreme traumatragedy dont always react in logical or appropriate ways i had a miscarriage at 12 weeks and the grief of that alone made me kinda crazy for a while not to mention after childbirth theres a massive hormonal change and a bunch of other stuff thats challenging even when you have a healthy baby idk i just think its way too simplistic to write it off as simply wanting attention or caring about getting likes too much or whatever and i feel bad for her to go through all that and then be dragged down further bc she coped in a really weird way oh i love these the meat one is so gross but so relatable lol something about being slightly high gets me super in touch,YourFriendMaryGrace
with my intuition sometimes i end up doing what seems like completely random shit but then i end up understanding the reason why i felt compelled to do it after the fact nothing as crazy as that though usually just stuff like feeling the need to reach out to a friend and it turns out they just got bad news or something whoa thats pretty cool did it seem unusually big to you at the time or only in retrospect after that nap like did it go from normal to big and then back to normal or just normal and then way smaller i dont know if that makes sense but i tried id love to hear some of your experiences if you feel like sharing i wish i had for some reason i had the feeling like i shouldnt go in there im not sure if it was actually a bad idea or just a fear of the unknown but i couldnt bring myself to crawl in and then it was gone this,YourFriendMaryGrace
is my favorite one and i totally believe you i think kids have an ability to peer into dimensions that for whatever reason get harder to see as adults my story isnt as cool as yours but when i was a kid i looked into a pile of pillows that were kind of stacked together in a tunnel shape but somehow the tunnel went on and on like hundreds of times longer than the pillows themselves i walked away and walked back to look again and it was just back to being a normal stack of pillows yes or like we want to be their new bff when actually were just being genuinely friendly but not like we want to be like friend friends thats the only downside of the placement imo accidentally leading people on just curious do you feel like that in real life trying to figure out the best direction to take and keep ending up in the wrong places i would say that the guilt and shame of killing the,YourFriendMaryGrace
dog probably factored into the situation a lot but regardless please do not think that all women are like this i have spent the last 3 years trying to help my boyfriend open up cry rage whatever he needs to process his feelings every bit of progress hes made has been so incredibly rewarding and brought us closer together the only way id weed him out as a mate is if he stopped working on expressing his feelings and started trying to be all stoic again as a partner its exhausting and isolating always having to wonder what your mate is really feeling if you end up with another person who cant handle seeing you cry weed her out and dont look back you do not deserve that sexist bullshit im sure theres a lot of additional factors like that but from what i understand the tradition stems from the days where talking about womens problems like periods menopause etc were taboo and so miscarriage was supposed to be kept quiet but if someone,YourFriendMaryGrace
wants to tell their friends and family early on its easy enough to say that its still early and they should wait a few months before making any purchases i actually wish the whole dont tell anyone too early notion would go away too losing your pregnancy even if you have only been pregnant for a few weeks can be so incredibly sad and if you havent told anyone then youre either alone in that pain or having to tell people that you need support from that you were pregnant and now youre not of course some people would rather be alone in that process regardless and if thats how they feel theres nothing wrong at all with keeping it quiet i just wish there wasnt a stigma around announcing too early it kind of creates a social isolation around anyone grieving before that 12 week mark it makes me glad to see someone else talking about the just world fallacy i used to post about it online like a reverse evangelist all the,YourFriendMaryGrace
time bc i think its so important for people to understand that this way of thinking is prevalent and insidious even nonreligious people do it without realizing it either to avoid having to empathize or to make themselves feel like if they just do everything right theyll be safe im curious about the microdose my life has been changed in other ways due to a standard amount of it on separate 3 occasions over 2 years was it a one time thing and did you go into it with the intention of facing your addictions edit also congrats on your accomplishment really encouraging to hear your progress i have a theory that the rest of your chart plays into what kind of connections youll enjoy which is a little too complicated for an app to take into consideration for example my venus is in aries so i kinda like it when things are exciting aka complicated lol so for me a delicate or complex bond is stimulating and fun but an extraordinary or powerful,YourFriendMaryGrace
bond can be boring like its too easy what did the tire look like ahh same here i guess its been about 2 or 3 weeks for me that ive obsessing over my jaw muscles bc something just felt off i kept trying different massage techniques to make it feel normal again this is really interesting did you feel it when our ribs changed you sound like a really good person your mama is lucky to have you thats beautiful it seems like most souls tend to reincarnate within the same family i bet hes been really looking forward to seeing you guys again first of all im very sorry for your loss thats really cool about the dream and i firmly believe that the women in a family line are super tuned in to the energy of new babies when i was pregnant with my kids i didnt want to know the gender until they were born but me my mom and my grandmother were completely positive i was having a girl and,YourFriendMaryGrace
i was same thing with my next baby we knew it was a boy and he was pluto heres a pic of my chart feel free to ask any questions i have those two in my second house i tend to have a lot of money or none lol how did it work out if you dont mind sharing this hurt my heart to read i love people who dress however makes them happy and i hate to think of her being made to feel bad about her awesome quirky self thank you so much 3 im okay im thankful that my dogs life was so full and happy and that she had such a peaceful ending and there are positives to being single and not having an elderly dog to tend to any more such as being more free and independent traveling etc so its really hard to cope with all at once but im trying to think of it as a new chapter with gratitude in my 9th house on the night,YourFriendMaryGrace
of the lunar eclipse i told my boyfriend for the billionth time that we needed to start doing some very things differently because i just wasnt happy in our relationship and he said hed work on it but he didnt so on june 8th i broke things off then later that night my sweet little dogs health took a serious turn for the worse and i had to put her down on the morning of the eclipse ive had her with me for 14 years she was a gemini sun and sagittarius moon im heartbroken its amazing you were able to recognize the pain you were causing and turn it around especially after everything you went through yourself just commenting to say im proud of you and dont give up on your brother closest in age it may take time but if hes able to heal on his own he may come around to the idea of a closer relationship with you happy birthday thats a good life skill to have did you get,YourFriendMaryGrace
to play with them so it was entrapment what a bastard aww thats a good one my little boy is 4 years old now and i always wonder what random stuff hell remember lol and of all the beverages you could have chosen to spit out you went with the one most likely to stain the carpet aww those early childhood accomplishments are the best how did that turn out i have a vivid memory of standing in my cousins yard staring at a tree im not a christian but uanotherreaderofstuff is right the bible does say that although its in matthew not revelation start on verse 34 of jesus sermon in matthew 25 hes saying that if you didnt take care of the poor imprisoned etc while you were on earth you dont get a spot in heaven wow thats really cool would you mind sharing what sort of meaningless thoughts and views you saw yourself having as a teen i feel like i waste a lot of energy on meaningless thoughts now,YourFriendMaryGrace
as an adult but im trying to improve thanks for sharing i hope the despair goes away completely soon and that you find more and more warmth and happiness in your life yeah its a different song but its a similar vibe to the beach boys so im thinking op might have just misremembered slightly are you thinking of this one thats a real gift i have it too with some close friends for example once i started spontaneously crying while i was in the shower and i had no idea why i wasnt even sad but my friends name came to mind immediately after so i texted him and sure enough hed just had a heartbreaking thing happen to him i think its possible our brains are silently communicating with each other in ways we cant observe with current technology and some may just have stronger communication links than others whatever it is im glad you guys found each other thank you you should give it a go theres some great ones on,YourFriendMaryGrace
youtube you could try people seem to have a lot of success with this one i totally get being wary but it seems like the subconscious has a mechanism of sorts that will only allow you to see what you can handle i tried many times before i saw anything and when i finally did i understood why i hadnt been able to see it before i actually participated in a thread about this recently if youre interested it seems to be a somewhat common experience its its complicated lol but i love him very much when i saw him in the glass thing i looked at him for a long time and then i understood that hed be hurting a lot in this life then i understood a second thing that made me agree to him being my dad unfortunately i dont remember at all what that second thing was but i assume its something that im not supposed to remember just learn over time oh wow ill have to check it out,YourFriendMaryGrace
thank you for telling me i did a past life regression once where i saw myself choosing my parents i was sat in front of a giant clear glass with a gold frame that had pictures of all the options and i could kind of flip through them like turning pages in a book but with my mind i was flipping through them thinking nope nope nope because i felt nothing when i looked at the couple until i got to my parents and i totally freaked out with excitement because i recognized my moms soul from having what felt like thousands of happy lifetimes together i said she could be my mom yes yes yes and then i looked at my dad and didnt recognize him at all but understood they were a package deal theres more details but yeah it was very interesting oh interesting my little boy always called water by what sounded like whoa im curious now if that sound matches the word for water in another language oh wow,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love this thank you for sharing theoretically though if a conscious or soul if you prefer doesnt need a living brain and body to operate from then one could exist in a plant animal maybe even a drop of rain or just floating in space 22 is an incredibly powerful number in numerology its considered by many to be the most powerful master number really cool that you have a significant astrological event on that date i cant tell you what to expect but i wish you the best adderall starts trying to make the bed while youre still in it youre awesome thank you for saying that i sure want to be a good mother she deserves it re my big 3 yes i absolutely feel pulled in many directions a lot today my pisces sun just wants to meditate feel my feelings read tarot cards and sit with my crystals while my libra rising wants to shop for new nail polish and hang out with my boyfriend meanwhile my cap moon,YourFriendMaryGrace
is telling me that all of the above is a luxury and i shouldnt indulge until my house is spotless and ive researched some investments bless you this is all so helpful and encouraging and helps me understand whats going on in her brilliant little head going from distraught to cracking jokes is sooo her its nice to know that isnt unusual and i absolutely love the idea of turning the process of talking about her feelings into a game itself i think shed really enjoy that and it would help create a more positive association with emotional processing bc right now i think she wants to but then feels like it is too boring lol shes a great reader but shes not writing fast enough yet to keep up with all she wants to say so maybe i can create another little game for that where she can tell me what shes thinking and i write it down for her im a pisces sun capricorn moon and libra rising my only gemini placement,YourFriendMaryGrace
is my chiron but i do have my moon and neptune in the third house look up attachment styles and specifically anxious attachment i have this and its a struggle but being aware of it is hugely helpful this is such lovely and helpful advice i cant thank you enough definitely sounds like my little fairy she even says no one understands me sometimes which makes my heart ache i have another question if you dont mind a lot of times when shes feeling things deeply and lashing out i take her to a private place and give her space to talk about what shes feeling she often says that first she wants to play some word games like coming up with a word for each letter of the alphabet sooo gemini and i do but then it can be almost impossible to get her to actually start talking about her feelings shell just keep suggesting other games i guess what im trying to figure out is if playing games is actually helping her,YourFriendMaryGrace
or is she just avoiding processing her feelings my 6 year old daughter has the same big 3 as you if you have any parenting advice pls share my lifetime before this one i was human in terms of how i felt like my sense of individuality and my emotions but i looked more like a cheetah or leopard on two legs i could run and climb really really fast the planet i lived on was completely peaceful so much so that i found it almost boring i spent most of my time on a small space craft doing missions with my friends who were giant blue lobster looking guys we all communicated telepathically i remember more details about my job than anything else unfortunately i dont remember anything about my childhood and i dont remember there being anything like what we would call a couple or a family so i wonder how babies were even made there wish i could remember more maybe someday yeah those memories were rough they were so much,YourFriendMaryGrace
worse than i would have guessed as for who he is in this life the tv show is still on the air and hes still on it so i have some idea of what hes like in this lifetime it seems like hes still got some anger issues but hes come a loooooong way thats for sure i havent tried to contact him im afraid id just sound like a deranged fan lol but im okay with not meeting him in this life i feel like we reincarnate with the people who were meant to learn from in each life so if theres anything to be gained by us meeting itll happen on its own and its a pleasure talking with you too thank you for sharing your story i was in high school when 911 happened and it was all so shocking and tragic its oddly comforting to think of the victims living new lives and the things that happened to them being a distant memory but im so very sorry that happened,YourFriendMaryGrace
to you and i hope you get the answers you seek not the person youre responding to but ive had experience with not being ready to remember certain things years ago i used to watch this tv show with a clist celebrity that isnt very interesting on his own but watching him made me feel deeply angry but also kind of aroused im not someone who easily forms emotional attachments to celebrities so this was really confusing bc the feelings were just so irrationally strong i did at least half a dozen past life regressions and never saw anything about him then years later after i had done a lot of work on personal stuff that was affecting me in this life a flood of memories came back while i was meditating that pretty much answered all my questions i wont get into the details but basically he was my uncle in a past life and he was horrible to me but i had a stockholm syndrome type of affection for him nonetheless i,YourFriendMaryGrace
saw the horrific things he did to me and yeah i was definitely not ready to see that back when i first started trying the reasons youre not able to see it might be different but like uredseaaquamarine said youll see it when youre ready and itll probably make sense to you then why you couldnt see it before aries scorpio leo im up for almost anything but prefer that it be exciting or novel in some way i feel a little awkward being romantic in the traditional sense so flowers chocolate etc is definitely not a requirement this is great advice thank you so much thank you aries wow thats interesting i found myself reflecting on some events that i experienced in feb 2018 just this morning do you happen to have any more info my son is a scorpio sun and rising leo moon hes only 4 years old though any advice you may have for me as a parent would be appreciated how long do you cook for im close pisces,YourFriendMaryGrace
sun cap moon and libra rising im your slightly more approachable sibling not that it matters but what the hell is the context of that like whos children immigrants liberals just random kids no problem this one from 2016 is good because it recaps the historic events that followed previous similar conjunctions like the ones had last year it depends on what youre looking at studying theres different areas of focus like personal astrology your ownsomeone elses birth chart synastry how two peoples charts interact with each other which is used for relationships mundane astrology is used to predict events and tbh im not educated enough on the methods to help with a recommendation i usually look at similar themes in my real life housesapts often represent the dreamers own mind so in this case it might be about wanting to make some changes in yourself but feeling like youre going from bad to worse mentally just an example but hopefully helps theres a lot of old like years old astrology articles saying that,YourFriendMaryGrace
2020 would be a globally historic shitshow we had a whole lot of these types of conjunctions over the past year and were not done the newspaper style horoscopes and stuff are definitely bs but actual astrology the type that is ancient and takes years to learn is really very interesting i really like em i think the piscescap combo balance each other out nicely and the libra rising gives me a nice approachable vibe libra rising yayyy how do you feel about the combo hey were almost twins i have libra rising i couldnt get into the clinical trials so i did a kind of diy version on my own but heres a good rundown on how they do it i had a friend sit with me and im so thankful id love to pay it forward so if you need someone to sit with you id be very glad to help via zoom or something i still struggle at times with intimacy but ive come a loooong way regular therapy helped a,YourFriendMaryGrace
lot as well as using mdma aka molly in a therapeutic setting i can go into more details about that if youre interested for me the biggest hurdle was admitting to myself that i needed help processing it and healing thats so awful and so fucked up of your friends to respond that way im so sorry theres nothing lucky about having your bodily autonomy violated no matter what the violator looks like to suggest otherwise is a gross ignorant lack of empathy and understanding it took me 13 years to tell anyone what happened to me because i was so afraid of not being believed so my heart really really goes out to you knowing how much not being believed just adds to the trauma of it all i believe you and im so sorry that happened to you please dont think that because you didnt force her off that you are to blame in any way response to trauma is automatic and we dont really get to consciously choose between fight flight,YourFriendMaryGrace
and freeze i froze when i was coerced into sexual abuse as a teen and for a long time i felt shame about it but i shouldnt and neither should you could be a past life memory i have a few questions that would help with interpretation whos house is it are you in the same house every time or does it change what about the locations are you in the living room basement etc are there any patterns in which part of the house the attackers come through where is your glowworm now seems like theres quite a few of us i hope its symbolic like of an era in a spiritual sense also funny sync that you responded to me just now bc i was literally just thinking about you you wrote me some very kind encouraging words during a rough patch a few years ago and im forever thankful weird my boyfriend and i both had vivid dreams last night in his dream he lost his job and his house burned,YourFriendMaryGrace
down in my dream my house was being torn apart an apocalyptic storm and my son was terribly injured theyre in the very late degrees of capricorn right now and by the 21st of this month theyll be in aquarius what are you listening to same here i miss being able to look at the houses im sorry when you say everybody else who do you mean hey congrats i got off mine about 3 years ago and im so glad i did i learned that the meds were putting a damper on my positive feels too not just the negative ones so while i might have some moments once in a while of feeling much sadder than i would on meds i also get to experience a lot more excitement love happiness etc every day btw i highly recommend taking st johns wort herbal supplements if you can theyre cheap otc nonaddictive and as effective as some ssris at curbing depression anyway whats a song youve listened to lately whats the weirdest food,YourFriendMaryGrace
order youve ever gotten well the fact you skate tells me that you arent too lazy to move your body you know how to get back up when you fall and you like to learn new things keep it up you can apply the same energy to other things now and in the future well maybe you just havent found out what makes you feel alive yet school is great but its not everything and failing definitely doesnt make you a loser what do you do when youre not being productive what makes you think youre a loser i see i dont know if it will require a harness or not then but maybe is that something that youre worried about gah thats messed up i wonder if theres any kind of loans for stuff like this that would have lower payments im uninsured right now and thankfully my health is good but yeah its scary how fast medical debt can pile up here in the states and youre welcome im always here if,YourFriendMaryGrace
you want to chat or vent or just need some encouragement youll see the other side of this someday and in the meantime be kind to yourself im so sorry for everything youre going through thats a lot why do you have to come up with the money in just two days im sorry this happened to you thats awful you deserve better people in your life and i hope you find them im not sure theres different types of buses but usually they dont have harnesses i relate to this i was raised in an uberconservative environment i literally only knew of two people in my hometown who were openly liberal lol and it wasnt until my midtwenties that i felt safe expressing just how different my views are now if i can offer some advice when you do start talking about it be as calm and as humble as you can im amazed how open minded people can be when they dont feel like they have to defend themselves using phrases like,YourFriendMaryGrace
i was surprised to learn or something ive been thinking about lately really helps i think it will also help a lot that you are interested in doing things differently and what you would like to see in a new political party the whole democrats vs republicans thing is so toxic and it gets people all worked up but by approaching it from a neutral perspective and making it about new ideas you can really help people open their mind even if they dont admit it to you are you trying to decide whether you want to try it lol i get that what part of history are you learning about rn i hope you enjoy the new program im sure it will be a cool and safe experience do the people around you know that you no longer agree with those views or are you keeping it quiet for now if they know how did they respond whats one thing youd change about your life right now if you could im afraid have,YourFriendMaryGrace
massively different perspectives on this my friend i can see how you feel im being obtuse because you seem obtuse from my perspective but were not were just on very different pages and thats okay you are fully entitled to your perspective and i wish you well they could share that wealth to an enormously powerful beneficial extent if they chose to but they choose not to if youre a part of my company supply chain whatever and you help me earn 20 dollars and then i keep 1999 for myself and gift you with a penny i have generated wealth for you doesnt mean i am a great person doing great things for you im a selfish dick capitalizing off your work and reaping the benefits they are not generating immense wealth for anybody but themselves and their shareholders instead of murdering a dozen or so people serial killer style they are in possession of millions of wage slaves who must grind away for decades just to hopefully have food shelter and healthcare,YourFriendMaryGrace
that is not productive use in my book not at all of course and btw i think the story of your friend giving you the crystal is so cool those spiritually intuitive kinda friends are a blessing i dont think its idiotic at all i think its really cool that theyll share those placements and i bet they will have a lot of understanding for each other as they grow up i was curious too so i found this tldr he said he wanted to save the government money by hiring his own security team as others have already mentioned thats not a good astrology app but in addition i think they have some kind of listening capability builtin because their do and dont keywords have been way too accurate for me more than once when i was redecorating my front porch i got front porch as a do for the day another time i was asking my boyfriend if we had any parchment paper and parchment was one of my dos the next,YourFriendMaryGrace
day thats not astrology thats spying lol i have the same theory the whole jesus as messiah storyline is remarkably similar to much older mythological origin stories including the virgin birth and coming back from the dead and its paul who flipped all the stuff jesus said about helping the poor on its head and said instead if a man doesnt work he shouldnt eat actually paul flipped just about everything jesus said around and christians believe what paul says jesus uh meant to say far more than they believe what jesus actually said christianity is 100 a religion of paul jesus the man would have wanted nothing to do with it taxpayers are already footing the bill for their being arrested sentenced jailed on probation etc treating it as an addiction rather than a crime might very well end up being cheaper and actually help people but we will see agree withu2muckingfuch that this will serve as a good test run either way i like you youre smart i think the democratic party,YourFriendMaryGrace
has utterly failed to address the most important issues facing americans and frankly im not convinced those at the top level care one bit except for bernie of course theyd rather go hog wild combatting fringe issues and demonizing anybody who supports trump than look at themselves critically in 2016 i wrote a mildly critical comment about hillary on a liberal site and got nasty hateful messages for weeks and i even said in my comment that i do not at all support trump theres this selfrighteous fuck everybody who disagrees attitude among democrats that is gonna be the death of them if they dont change im like you still figuring out my politics but socialism seems to be the best way forward for us imo but like uapi is saying we have to start by putting up a candidate who will earnestly address the very legitimate concerns of the american heartland and stop being so damn unwelcoming to anyone who isnt already on our side at the end of the day humans just,YourFriendMaryGrace
want to feel like theyre safe and cared for trump obviously makes people feel that way and while i dont understand why i do understand how the left makes them feel unsafe and unwelcome definitely look into wing chun according to legend it was created by a woman which is pretty cool im a small person as well and i dont like violence so the approach of training primarily to disableescape from attackers appealed to me i wish more people understood this i really hope youre right my friend conservatives say its all soros liberals say its all koch bros andor putin i think the truth is probably all of the above and much more were merely puppets on the string of the super wealthy being manipulated into turning on each other so we dont look up and realize were all being swindled by the same forces anybody who thinks the billionaires on their side are actually on their side are painfully naive its an illusion if we united as a people wed be,YourFriendMaryGrace
too powerful for their absolute greed to continue going unchecked as it has been for decades and thats their worst nightmare i really truly think that this civil war narrative is being pushed into the conversations of both sides by an outside source theres major world powers that would have a lot to gain by americans being so divided against each other i have dear loved ones on both sides and nobody i know irl wants bloodshed online though i see it brought up more and more by both sides equally and both sides seem convinced that they have no choice because the other side is already planning on it i dunno maybe im paranoid but it all just feels very orchestrated for sure then again it could just as well be about anger youre actually feeling towards him but its just being illustrated in a satirical and overthetop kinda way dreamland is a very symbolic and metaphorical place and the details matter for example the computer keyboard the sloppy food they both mean,YourFriendMaryGrace
something specific about something in your life that is or has made you feel pretty strongly the computer keyboard might mean that this is a dream about anger youre feeling specifically in regards your communications with the outside world or perhaps while working from home the sloppy food might mean youre feeling disgust too im just spitballing but you get the idea hope its ok that i said all that i just get excited about dreams lol love your style i help people interpret their dreams as a hobby and i might be able to shed a little light quite often the people we see in our dreams arent playing the part of themselves they often represent a different side of yourself that you identify in them for example i have a very spiritual side but i also have a very logical reasoning side i have a friend darion who is pretty dismissive of anything spiritual metaphysical etc when ive had moments of feeling conflicted about these two sides of myself theyre often followed,YourFriendMaryGrace
by dreams of me and darion being on bad terms even though were getting along fine so i see it as darion representing my logical side and my subconscious mind trying to tell a story that calls attention to this disconnected person within me just something to consider in case its helpful i have the same placement i think it is playing out for me like this the scorpio south node means that my past lives and my past in this life tends to be filled with drama power struggles abuse of some kind and money problems i feel my mission is to find peace stability and prosperity in this life and basically stop expectingcocreating chaos i think this tumultuous time period were in with the virus and worldwide political issues is such a good opportunity to be a port in the storm so to speak the inspiring thing about this placement is that if you believe in past lives you can bet that you have already been through just about everything a person,YourFriendMaryGrace
can go through and youre still here youre stronger for it and you can handle anything its okay to just relax and enjoy life and lean into those lovely taurean traits like gardening enjoying good food and indulging all your senses absolutely my bffexhusband and i have had a lot of lives together i think it sounds so cheesy but the first night we spent together we didnt even fool around just stared into each others eyes and felt completely at home i didnt even believe in past lives at the time yet i felt like id finally found him now 15 years later hes still the only person i can just look into their eyes forever and never feel uncomfortable were divorced but we are still as close as ever weve both done past life regressions and seen lives weve had together usually as a couple or just dear friends i have another friend that i feel for some reason was my son in a past life ive also had the experience of,YourFriendMaryGrace
simply locking eyes with a stranger and thinking i know them like an instant love and familiarity and it always makes me wonder if its a loved one from another lifetime you need to be able to heal and process and release trauma before those experiences become helpful imo ive dealt with everything from sexual abuse to homelessness and for a long time it did weaken me but years and a lot of psychedelics therapy yoga etc later i feel pretty damn powerful i think that what doesnt kill you saying does a disservice in the same way that calling cancer patients fighters does it gives the impression that if you dont possess a superhuman ability to immediately bounce back to better than before youre somehow deficient the focus should be on healing and transmuting and being supported until you start to feel stronger im here for you if you ever want to chat my cap moon is in the 4th house and cleaning my home makes 95 of my bad feelings feel better,YourFriendMaryGrace
for a little while i have a pisces sun but a cap moon and 4 aries placements i still come across as gentle to most people at first theres a lot of interpretations but generally i just take it as a sign im on the right path i would look into numerology if youre interested in learning more about the particular energy numbers carry you can even generate a free reading online based on your name and birthdate it really does thank you shes amazing and i love the way her clever little mind works and i just want to support her the best i can that sounds just like my 6 year old gemini sunmoon daughter any parenting advice for me especially when it comes to the tantrums to be fair a lot of things have happened this year that we wouldnt have thought would happen in a million years its kind of the theme thats what i hope for at this point those are great placements imo having your moon and ascendant,YourFriendMaryGrace
in the same sign helps because peoples first impression of you is better aligned with your inner self descendant signs can often represent your shadow side parts of yourself that are underdeveloped but having it the same sign as your sun means those traits are much more inherent in you amazing i have the same placement of chiron and related to all of this i started unintentionally having spiritualmetaphysical experiences at a very young age that didnt jive with the religion of my family and community it was difficult enough just to process those experiences alone and trying to explain them was impossible and socially risky so i kept quiet im still figuring out how to share my thoughts and feelings about things without sounding crazy lol i feel the same way about my pisces suncap moon thankful to have both bc i can see myself being extremely lazy or a workaholic with just one or the other lol if the relationship is no longer healthy and the parents cant get along they already,YourFriendMaryGrace
have an unstable family unit plenty of people grow up to wish their parents had just divorced rather than stay together arguing and being passive aggressive all the time the 29th degree sun year is said to be a time of preparation for the changes to come when your progressed sun changes signs mine changes from aries to taurus next year and i am kind of feeling that energy like im getting ready for something if he knew anything about true astrology hed know that summing someone up based on their sun sign is ridiculous unfortunately there will always be people who have a prejudice against certain signs but thats life you geminis are awesome and he sounds like a terrible friend lol i feel like its safe to say they hardly ever use it that way this is their time to plot and scheme amongst themselves safe from the peoples expectations and opinions getting in the way really rough but ultimately it was all necessary for me to transform into a much more,YourFriendMaryGrace
authentic version of myself yes i hear what youre saying and i cosign your petition for everyone to stop with the gun waving right im referring to ops comment about his real life interactions the ones that know were not racist were there last night and people with open minds were willing to hear us out and have conversations with us and saying that i dont think its fair to dismiss what hes saying about his real life experience and intentions just because it sounds like something trolls say its crazy and honestly it scares me im reminded of that noam chomsky quote all the time lately the smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion but allow very lively debate within that spectrum im sorry but thats a stretch billions of people converse every day lol you cant attribute everything that is said and done in the real world to divisive online lingo personally i prefer to engage in good faith and if it,YourFriendMaryGrace
doesnt work out i move on why are we really at the point where wanting to have a conversation is suspicious if so then were completely screwed because exchanging ideas and perspectives is crucial for peace woah thats crazy my first name in this life is similar to a name ive had before but dying in an alley and being reborn as ali is wild i hope remembering how tough you had it before has helped you release any guilt about having it good in this life you deserve all the best ali yes ive done it many times probably at least a dozen times lol but its only worked twice in total ive seen 4 of my past lives one through regular meditation one through a guided meditation like this one was in a dream i had after a psychedelic trip and the most vivid and recent one ive been remembering since i was a little girl thats funny i almost asked you if you have any fears related to big cities or,YourFriendMaryGrace
alleyways honestly its really great to hear that youve had a good life this time your story was very sad and it sounds like youshe more than deserved a break this go round do you have any experiences or feelings in this life that might be influenced by hers im always interested in the parallels like ive had a lifelong determination to only have sex with people who truly appreciate me as a person and then in one of my past life regressions i saw myself as a woman who had really low selfesteem and let herself be used by a bazillion different guys bc she thought being sexy was her only valuable quality magician and i relate to the description very cool thanks for sharing thats really heartbreaking im sorry 3 well im 35 years old and im embodying my libra rising more than ever so dont hold your breath wow this is my boyfriends placement if you dont mind me asking were you bullied or just generally made to feel small by,YourFriendMaryGrace
a parent weird i didnt sleep at all last night and my 3yo was awake until like 3am my 6yo woke up about 4am and never went back to sleep no problem im still fairly new myself browsing this sub plus reading birth and synastry charts of people i know then looking up the placements and aspects that interest me have been my best learning tools its giving you the option of which astrological method youd like to use placidius and whole sign are probably the most commonly used ones around here personally i prefer whole sign you can search those terms in this sub for a lot more info did you guys get more than a one time relief payment of 1200 months ago damn im so sorry youre going through all this another fireball checking in i have mars mercury and venus in aries also lilith do you mean that mars is in your third house in your natal chart or transit natal placements tell you how those energies will most clearly,YourFriendMaryGrace
manifest in your life as a whole transit charts ie where mars is in your chart right now will tell you how youre currently being affected is it in your 6th house in your birth chart or do you mean thats your current mars transit my natal mars is aries in the 7th house but right now its transiting my 6th house i am feeling super motivated in my health and wellness routines and getting a lot of things done that ive been putting off well thats awesome youve already laid out a foundation for some really helpful stuff definitely give mdma a go if you can get your hands on some quality stuff if you need someone available to talk to during your trip id be really happy to help dm me i think you already know this but start by putting dating wayyy on the back burner until youre in a better relationship with yourself this woman was able to use you because you dont yet fully believe you deserve to be,YourFriendMaryGrace
treated as an equal as for what to do expect some trial and error and be open to trying a lot of different things i highly recommend beginning a meditation practice because over time you will learn to detach yourself from your thoughts rather than letting them run the show and negative selfimage is the product of negative thoughts about yourself run wild it sounds like you have a lot of emotional trauma with regards to women and being in society in general so therapy can help you work through a lot of things using psychedelics like mdma with the intention of revisitinghealing negative experiences has been lifechanging for me but of course you should do your research and proceed with caution etc etc also work on building healthy platonic relationships its much easier to get sucked into an unhealthy romantic relationship when you dont have a solid friend or two you can lean on for support and honest feedback im sorry this happened to you and i hope you keep working on yourself,YourFriendMaryGrace
and your mindset because there really are great people out there who will treat you as well as you treat them i worked in the tiny backstage of a 105 year theatre before i got laid off due to not being able to have shows anymore i dont know for sure because testing wasnt really available in my area at the time but i think i had the virus already working with internationally traveling performers and crew every day in tight quarters is challenging even without this particular virus idk if i can do that lifestyle again it kinda blew my mind how people were celebrating it like i can understand being happy to see liberal media go down if you arent at all liberal but how could it not even cross their minds it what an awful precedent it was setting yeah hulk hogan vs gawker and im still sad about it gawker could be hella trashy but they had some really great journalists too and were one of the very few mainstream,YourFriendMaryGrace
media companies left that were not owned by a billionaire my dad is a retired doctor and has been in a remarkable number of situations where he has been able to help people off the clock via witnessing car accidents people having heart attacks on planes and at a gas station i dont know what it is either but i like to think the universe has a way of putting brave and helpful people like you guys where theyre needed sometimes what is the factor not his literal house though he said my fathers house meaning the temple people had basically turned the temple into a moneymaking scheme and jesus was extremely not okay with that thus the table flipping and such because paul the opportunist came along and claimed to be miraculously converted from the guy who loved dragging jesuss followers to be stoned to the guy who was given special permission to tell everyone what jesus really meant to say he proceeded to write tons and tons of letters that he claimed,YourFriendMaryGrace
were the word of god to the point that more than half of the new testament is just paul blabbering on urging people to be judgmental saying stuff completely opposite of what jesus taught and modern christianity is entirely based on pauls teaching not jesus rpracticaleffects especially this post gosh i have a bunch of these and i do think some might be actual alternate timelines playing out like my dream self pops over to experience it for a little while theres a huge openair church that looks like a remodeledexpanded version of the church i grew up in i am no longer religious and i dont go to church but in these dreams it seems im still trying to play along and its very lonely disempowered feeling but the most frequent ones happened around 20122013 and they were scary the world was a dangerous lawless place and my ex husband we were still married at the time though and i had to be extremely careful about leaving our apartment bc there were so,YourFriendMaryGrace
many violent people everywhere but every time i was there i knew that apartment complex parking lot etc like the back of my hand even though it doesnt exist in my life here i really like to help people interpret their dreams because i have a gift for reading the metaphorical language of dreams but these types of dreams are just so different in the way they feel and the content is so undreamlike that when i have them i dont even try to interpret them anymore i just assume i went timeline hopping again lol i read somewhere that the draconic nn is set to aries because of the idea that ultimately were all on a solo soul mission of some kind and aries represents that energy personally i resonate with my draconic chart in some ways more so than my birth chart but im not educated enough on it to speak to its validity you dont have to do anything really except be mindful of your thoughts and feelings if you feel,YourFriendMaryGrace
anger frustration anxiety whatever lean into it enough to see whats really under there we all have shadows and trauma and stuff weighing us down but remember that this is the energy of rebirth too releasing the old makes room for the new i like to do some symbolic things too like during the day i will clean my house really well get rid of some clutter and at night ill take a long bath or shower idk just something about getting my environment and myself super clean while thinking about releasing and cleansing stuff that my old self went through really feels good you can google rituals and stuff but i suggest trying different things and seeing what feels good and helpful to you just remember to keep directing your mind im a pisces so i cant do anything about it myself lol my capricorn moon strongly disagrees ooo id be interested in reading this if you have a link im a capricorn moon my mom is a virgo moon and she had,YourFriendMaryGrace
me when she was 25yo she is a cancer sun and i think thats a combo that led to difficulty expressing her emotions in a healthy way but shes improved a lot i had my first born gemini moon when i was 29 and my second child leo moon 25 years later i think so i feel like i relate to my draconic chart more now than i would have if id seen it at a younger age but i think a lot of it depends on the souls evolution and intention for this incarnation maybe we take on the natal chart characteristics well need for this leg of the journey and for some people more than others that may mean a drastic change in how they operate compared to their draconian chart for example my exs draconic chart has a ton of capricorn and virgo placements which is baffling because he hardly has a drop of those energies in his birth chart or personality lol but his north node is in gemini so,YourFriendMaryGrace
it kind of makes sense like if he came into this life with a capvirgo heavy chart itd be that much harder for him to embrace the free curious excitable gemini qualities hes meant to embrace this goround is it really that bad i have toe thumbs and i try to tell myself its okay but i dont feel like its okay pisces being lazy my capricorn moon almost completely cancels out my ability to be lazy unless my chores are done and im at somebody elses house where im not distracted by other things i could be getting done when i was really little i was so gentle and looooved helping people to the point where my older brothers friends would take advantage of my kindness asking me to go get them water or whatever stuff they could have easily done for themselves and id do it one of my earliest memories of getting really pissed off is from when i was in first grade and my brothers friend told me to go,YourFriendMaryGrace
get him something and i realized i was getting walked on and said no after that i was a lot less helpful for a few years lol and ive been quite wary of being taken advantage of ever since its funny looking back because thats the year i turned into a little aries im moving into taurus next year i was just thinking about this last night my boyfriend has some troublesome aspects like pluto square venus and i have a lot of 7th house aries placements from what hes told me about his younger self i dont think we would have gotten along very well at all if we were the same age and wed dated in our twenties hes fifteen years older than me though so he has been working through a lot of relationship stuff since before i was even dating age hes also a leo but by progressions hes a virgo which i love i have venus mars lilith and mercury all in aries in the 7th house and i,YourFriendMaryGrace
endorse this comment libra rising 25 degrees i have mars in aries best was with fellow fire mars people im a cap moon and i have learned to embrace my rather mechanical structured approach to processing emotions i think it can actually be very helpful for working out problems with others or for helping people sort out their own feelings because the analytical skills i have for it help me break issues down to the root cause see how different feelings are interconnected etc part of fortune is where you can find success so if its in capricorn in the 7th house maybe you find success by working hard alongside your significant other or a business partner chiron is where youre wounded but can ultimately help others heal for example mine is in gemini in the 9th house and boy oh boy does that resonate i was raised with a very strong religious doctrine 9th house stuff but from a young age was having my own spiritual experiences that didnt jive with what i,YourFriendMaryGrace
was being taught so talking about my own beliefs sharing what i learned on my own gemini stuff was a liability that would have led to being told that i was wrong a sinner etc which honestly still hurts all these years later i think part of my purpose is to be brave enough to share and in doing so help others feel free of religious constraints lilith is a little more varied in interpretation some people say its the part of you that society rejects or a part of your life where you embrace darkness i would look at different articles about your specific placement of lilith and see what feels applicable how did you determine which fated events were indicated by them by looking at transits or was it the symbology of the placements making it clear internet word for small youd rather die than live without compliments thats crazy i have both the sun and saturn trine my mc what about you and yes im definitely used to making changes in,YourFriendMaryGrace
my life some of the things ive been through just in the past year i never anticipated happening to me like a divorce sometimes i think that might be part of my growth process learning how to be stable and consistent and enjoy life despite seemingly never being able to be sure whatll happen next yay how do you feel about your sunmoon combo i like it because i think the cap moon helps me stay grounded in reality and keeps the stereotypical pisces laziness under control but sometimes it feels like my feelings are overly filtered out because i wanna analyze them to death before i share them well i definitely relate to my scorpio south node im oddly comfortable with crisis darkness and the idea of just burning it all down about 7 years ago i gave away almost everything i owned and drove out to the desert with no plan except to start over this was before i discovered astrology ha ha and it was right before my saturn return but,YourFriendMaryGrace
i can see how it reflected both nodes kind of a south node reaction with north node intentions my mc is in cancer so that combined with my nn signhouse im wondering if my calling is at least in part to be a source of comfort and stability in other peoples time of crisis what about you i have nn in taurus in the 8th house which honestly feels kind of contradictory i can imagine that im meant to focus on taurean qualities like stability comfort followthrough and generally just enjoying life but the 8th house would seem to be the opposite of a lot of that im a pisces sun capricorn moon and libra rising we should be friends did you also feel a libra risingesque fear of displeasing other people by admitting that youre told that youre pretty because i did and still do libra rising and i think i am pretty in a very conventional sort of way none of my facial features stand out as exceptionally good or bad i,YourFriendMaryGrace
just have good symmetry i guess im clumsy but that always surprises people once they notice because im told i seem like id be very graceful lol im 54 and weigh about 115lbs so fairly petite i think most of this is aligned with the standard libra rising description except for my height as ive read they tend to be taller than average okay im not arguing with your data as ive yet to see it myself im just saying that your phrasing gives the impression that being gay is unfortunate and even if you dont care about hurting peoples feelings i think youll get a more productive discussion out of this post if you share what youve been researching in a more neutral less negative light saturn just entered my 5th house like 2 weeks ago so my experience is very limited but i feel the sudden urge to buckle down and complete a short film i startedabandoned two years ago whereas new creative ideas arent really coming to me ive also been,YourFriendMaryGrace
doing a lot of reflecting about what i really need in a romantic relationship and what im really willing to contribute another thing i think its interesting timing that im stuck with my children almost 247 right now because its made me more aware of what they individually need from me as their mom and a lot of it seems to involve me being more structured planning ahead better etc hopefully you get some more responses im very interested in reading about this from people who have been through it can you give some examples might want to change your wording too lol i think i get what you mean but saying risk of sounds like being gay is a disease or something i assume she means venus in aries maybe venus in scorpio too if going by traditional rulerships depends on what you need us to be whats your rising sign im a libra rising venus in aries and my style is similar what country do you live in check out rprecognition this,YourFriendMaryGrace
is a lot more common than you might expect happy birthday same here and i was terrified to grow up i cried a lot when i was getting ready to turn 13 because i felt like i was gonna be a teen and not a kid anymore now im 35 and i guess ive accepted it but if i could be someones kid forever i would lol listen to take a walk on the wild side first then listen to can i kick it and you cant possibly miss it and a tiger saw a man thats funny i had the same recurring dream as a newlywed i think sometimes our brains just run through alternate path scenarios via dreams and your emotions in the dream help you feel what making different choices might have felt like you cant be serious lmao these are babies when i was this age i told my babysitter i was gonna cut off her head i wasnt a future murderer just a little kid copying what i heard,YourFriendMaryGrace
disney villains say if you wanna predict adult personalities based on tiny childrens behavior youd have to come to the conclusion that theyre all gonna be psychopaths thatd be great thank you trying to avoid unnecessary trips the grocery store plus having way more time than usual to spend in my back yard definitely has me veggie gardening wish theyd reverse it turning churches into homes even temporarily would do a lot more to help the sick and the poor you know the people jesus said to look after no im kind of the opposite of that if they seem uninterested i lose interest too capricorn moon in the 4th house im cleaning and organizing the shit out of my home and putting together a homeschool plan for my kindergarten and preschool age children hold on by alabama shakes mine also happy birthday birthday twins edit omg a slice of pi award and our bdays are on pi day this is the best ever thank you upoky23 i love you the article is wrong,YourFriendMaryGrace
it was actually a single dad banana hes still married but separated while he and his wife try and work out their differences congrats on your new baby boy im sorry you wont have visitors extra sets of hands really help with those newborns but i hope you two enjoy lots of happy healthy snuggle time im here if you wanna talk i dont know if youve ever been miserably sick with the flu before but posting on reddit was probably the last thing on everyones mind and regardless of whether or not the commenters here had covid19 maybe we did maybe we didnt its not at all surprising statistically that out of over a million subscribers half a dozen or so people would have had their worst flu ever in the past few months statistically it probably happened to way more than half a dozen doesnt make us liars just unlucky yeah just lifting a cup of water felt like a physical feat at the time i was too out of it to,YourFriendMaryGrace
post anything i honestly for the first time understood how otherwise healthy people could die from the flu but i think i wrote some texts about how at one point my fever reached 104 and i was sleeping so hard i wouldnt have even woken up to take medication if my ex hadnt stayed over to keep watch on me and our kids and checked my forehead in the middle of the night edit oh and i have texts that i sent to my dad a doctor about how to watch for pneumonia bc my kiddos breathing was sounding wheezy interesting i definitely had the worst flu of my life in december and my children caught it and both had some difficulty breathing for a few days maybe a dumb question but would that give us immunity now if it was indeed the same thing alright well i hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend lola asking about specific placements isnt allowed here for some reason its okay on rastrologymemes and raskatrologers though,YourFriendMaryGrace
if you wanna repost this i think you might find this post and comments really helpful ahhh yeah that makes sense i think pisces can be a very childlike placement if its not balanced out with some strong earth or fire signs i have a lot of aries which helps and without it id probably be looking for guidance all the time in an effort to feel grounded thats interesting i have mars and venus in aries both in the 7th house which makes me a little relationshipcrazy lol ive had to teach myself to be picky about who i date because if im not careful ill stick with people who arent actually good for me he has a lot of first house placements which do make him a little selffocused but hes definitely a relationship person his venus is in 7th as well and its actually been good for me to be with someone who has his own stuff going on because my pisces tendency to get lost in people is kind of,YourFriendMaryGrace
kept at bay im more able to rememberfocus on my goals and personal activities as opposed to other relationships where i got so wrapped up in someone that i lost touch with myself all that to say pisces relationships might work better for you if shes able to accept your individuality and let it encourage her to focus on her own as well id say trust your gut feeling pretty much regardless of placements im so sorry for your loss youre a good sibling you have a lot of signs and often times the sun sign is less relevant to the personality than others for example im a pisces but i have a shit ton of aries in my chart and it shows lol so a lot of the classic pisces descriptions lazy reserved a pushover dont describe me at all put your info in a birth chart calculator and youll get a lot more insight into yourself yes i have a bowl shaped chart and its said that people with this shape often,YourFriendMaryGrace
feel incomplete as though the missing half of the chart is felt but not entirely accessible i only started studying astrology last year but looking back at the charts of people ive dated i see now that i have definitely been drawn to guys with heavy taurus gemini leo and virgo placements maybe in part because theyre bringing some of those energies to the table that i dont have a lot of on my own definitely this has been going on for quite a few years think how many apps you have and how many of them could easily be listening with your permission per the terms and conditions i love the 8th house its nothing to be scared of honestly yes it deals with death but also rebirth transformation contracts secrets sex etc if it makes you feel any better my 50 year old boyfriend has some of these placements and hes one of the most welladjusted and lucky mfers i know lol he does have quite a fascination with horror movies though,YourFriendMaryGrace
my saturn return was god awful although in hindsight of course i can see how myself and my life is much better because of those trials im at the end of my sade sati and its been really rough and just as lifechanging but not nearly as heartbreaking as the stuff i went through with saturn return the flight attendant said i want this lady off my flight and then the woman started apologizing saying she was really stressed out etc no worries i was actually responding to unettlepunk about his capricorn date but re your post im dating a leo guy and id say your best bet is just hype him up with genuine compliments often and carry on like it never happened next time something embarrassing happens to you maybe tell him about it for laughs so he remembers embarrassing things happen to everyone im a pisces and i listened to under the bridge obsessively in high school so i could feel all the feels i really want to know what happened,YourFriendMaryGrace
now i love this decoding my toddlers mystery phrases is one of my favorite things about having a toddler lol i felt like a genius when i finally figured out boocoos was blues clues lykeen was lightening mcqueen etc he looks unwell but someone showed methis clip of him dancing with little kids and its pretty damn cute so im pulling for him i can definitely understand taking issue with him as a psychiatrist proposing that conclusion but he is far from the only one the cia did some fascinating research on the topic of consciousness that particular link is a rather dense read but its really fun to ponder all the potential implications if youre into that kinda thing first of all thanks for engaging in convo with me respectfully secondly im not looking to convince you or anyone to believe one way or the other i do want to say though that a lot of the children remembered random people who the parents couldnt have known about and in some cases they,YourFriendMaryGrace
recalled correct details that were not publicly available information also for his consciousness theories he rely on theories of quantum physics quantum mechanics theories which is not the same as pseudoscience but i acknowledge that the birthmarks could be coincidence some kids remembered incorrect details etc again believe what feels right to you and be as skeptical as feels right to you im open to the idea of reincarnation but mostly in the camp of who the fuck can ever really know how this crazy universe works thats a depressing yet empowering thought lol on the one hand i dont wanna be a bug but on the other hand now i feel like a badass for making it to the mammal level at least once fuck yeah im a mammal lotta possibilities like maybe their past lives were on other planets or maybe not everyone is reincarnated or maybe our consciousness spends time elsewhere before returning to a physical body so theres not extra people right now just a lot more here at one,YourFriendMaryGrace
time than usual edit could also be that we reincarnate as creatures sometimes if so i would like to be a bear next time because annual hibernation sounds awesome i think youd enjoy reading dr jim tuckers research hes a actually continuing another u of virginia school of medicine psychiatristresearchers work dr ian stevenson so their combined collection of data from children who have past life memories spans decades most children lose these memories by age 7 or so theyve matched soooo many childrens memories with real life people its nuts interestingly most often the remembered deaths are traumatic or sudden in nature so lil suicide baby in the meme fits right in lol just let him go i definitely understand the need for closure but some people just arent willing to have the conversation and hes pretty clearly unwilling you deserve to be with someone who wants to be with you so put your focus on that and try not to take it personally lots of great people out there will want exactly,YourFriendMaryGrace
what you have to offer dreams of having a baby are usually to do with birthing a project or a part of yourself something like that similarly a miscarriage dream can be about something that you maybe planned on or started working on that ended for whatever reason but you were happy about it so if theres something you startedended around 2 months ago that you feel good about it ending its likely symbolizing that rather than an actual miscarriage dream interpretation is tricky with strangers because you dont have any idea whats going on in the dreamers life and feelings that may be symbolized but hopefully that helps you get started whenever youre listening youre really just quietly wondering how long until you can talk about yourself some more aww yay no problem im so glad it was helpful best of luck to you and your boyfriend i see what you mean now thank you for clarifying and youre right i dont disagree i just wanted to point out that there are more,YourFriendMaryGrace
legit options than say costar for example and for someone like me and presumably op who still has a lot to learn its kind of nice to have something simple to start with not all astrology apps are social media based and some of them are remarkably indepth timepassages has over 70 aspects just for my birth chart with most of the descriptions being multiple paragraphs long including less known aspects like biquintile and asteroids like juno their synastry is just as indepth but you do have to pay for the individual additional charts you sound a lot like me and my boyfriend im a pisces sun cap moon and hes a leo sag moon its been about a year for us as well and we are really compatible if you can get the app timepassages and pay 99 cents for his chart youll be able to use their compare charts feature which is awesome the most thorough and accurate synastry reading ive found it spelled out what makes us compatible really well and,YourFriendMaryGrace
even explains the challenges in a helpful hopeful way heyyy you have the same placements as my little 3 year old boy got any parenting advice for me if you can find out his birthdate you can find out his moon sign venus north node and more which will be far more helpful than going by the sun sign alone im a pisces with a leo boyfriend and those two signs are supposedly incompatible but its a really lovely relationship for lent im giving up a little bit of work to work on my life not a bad idea actually nodal returns squares and reverses never miss me lol you can read the timing and descriptions here i grew up in america but this one makes me sad too i feel like humans are meant to live in community and sharing taking care of each other but instead we isolate ourselves and just schedule time to not be alone once in a while im a pisces with a leo boyfriend sometimes our love languages,YourFriendMaryGrace
arent exactly aligned like he loves spoiling me with gifts and taking me to nice restaurants and stuff which is very appreciated but id be just as happy smoking a bowl whilst wearing jammies and talking about our childhoods lol im a very affirming person though which works well with his need for praise and i love his physically affectionate nature our senses of humor are pretty compatible too i think if id met him earlier in my life i wouldnt have appreciated our differences nearly as much as i do now it took a long time for me to realize that being super similar to my partner doesnt actually work out too well for me edit another interesting thing is that according to the synestry of some other placements we have we should be butting heads a lot and having to reign in our tempers but i have never had such a peaceful gentle relationship before and when we do have issues were able to talk a them out in a really empathetic,YourFriendMaryGrace
and loving way which again may come down to having met at the right time what was your experience like with this combo im a pisces and my baby daddy is an aries we have a 5 year old gemini and a 3 year old scorpio i like to think our parenting styles provide a wellrounded balance but i dont know pluto and saturn making squares oppositions and sextiles to practically everything in my chart lol basically the last two years have been an unending journey watching of everything i used to think would never change changing including my marriage got divorced this past summer doing my best to sit with the uncertainty of it all and trust that greater fulfillment and selfrealization are on the other side aww lol they were giggling so much as they signed it i wondered if they were writing crazy stuff but i guess they were just happy to be signing it thank you thank you this was sad but i enjoyed reading the details thank you for,YourFriendMaryGrace
sharing if you dont mind sharing how do you feel about relationships in your current life at a theater where artists are allowed to sign the walls backstage a bunch of teenage performers wrote this and id love to know what it says mr rogers for pisces sensitive gentle guy who lived to make people feel loved and empathized with he had a 29 pisces sun with moon mercury and venus in pisces too lol wow til never really looked into these before but i just looked it up and my life has definitely shifted dramatically right on schedule with these returnsreverse returns no idea we lived there for 3 years and never heard anything like that before or after birth chart and transit chart so very grateful for any input at all i can offer dream interpretation in return this happened to me and my ex one time when we were the only ones in the house two really loud knocks on the bathroom door the only place i have gemini is my,YourFriendMaryGrace
chiron but feel like i relate to gemini the most of any sign could be my partners north node is my sun sign and we have the rare and exceptional pattern it specifically says that being together supports the person hes becoming im a cap moonpisces sun and i feel things very strongly but i wont reveal my feelings until im ready which isnt often and i can only talk about my feelings to like 3 people and even then its usually after ive ruminated over it and tried to feel better on my own for a long time i set mine for desired nap length approx how long i think it will take me to fall asleep 10 minutes because it always takes me longer than i think it will i can relate as i have a pisces suncap moon but im learning to appreciate the beauty of being able to deeply empathize with people without getting swept up in whatever is going on with them and that i can have my head,YourFriendMaryGrace
in the clouds and my feet on the ground at the same time i would definitely pass on the message even if anonymously like usubfootlover suggested who knows maybe this message could spur an awakening in her that would lead her to change her ways in my experience youll only remember the things youre ready to see i had a deeply uncomfortable feeling of dislike almost hatred for a very minor celebrity on a show i used to watch even though i had no conscious or logical reason why years later id mostly forgotten about him but then i started thinking about him again at random times and feeling so uncomfortable i tried past life regressions many times before eventually seeing flashes of a life in which he was my horrifically abusive uncle now of course that was not a fun thing to relive but it was actually really helpful for me in working through some issues i had around sex and relationships with men but if id remembered all that earlier i dont,YourFriendMaryGrace
think i would have been ready whats interesting too is that i no longer feel that anger or dislike of him anymore at all i actually find it comforting that hes evolved over his lifetimes and is now as far as i can tell a good guy weve probably all been horrible people in the past so whatever you learn from it know that it doesnt define you now im so sorry this happened to your girlfriend shes really lucky to have you in her corner i think a lot of people are intimidated by those who march to the beat of their own drum because theyre unconsciously forced to confront their own conformity like were all incredibly unique at heart but when fitting in is your priority you suppress your own unique qualities and then resent the people who are able to let theirs show i hope that makes sense its something ive thought about a lot as ive dealt with it in my own way keep doing you you sound awesome costar,YourFriendMaryGrace
powered by pretentious delusional robots i got caught in that cycle for a while when i was young i didnt have enough selfrespect to leave him but i had enough strength not to do what he said of course its shitty but some people just repeating what they see normalized and havent learned how much better and different a relationship can be my brain went to the same place and i liked it i have taurus in my 8th house as well as ceres in taurus in the 8th what confuses me is that my north node is taurus in the 8th house and the descriptions of having a taurus nn is basically the opposite of the 8th house nn description am i supposed to be embracing comfort and stability or learning to live without it im so sorry you lost your son readingrpastlives might make you feel better my venus is in aries and ive never related to the falls in and out of love quickly thing if i commit to someone its,YourFriendMaryGrace
because im hoping it lasts forever my venus is retrograde though so that may have some impact aww well needless to say im a big sag moon fan and yeah the needing space thing took some getting used to because i felt rejected at first but that didnt stop me because my aries venusmars loves the chase lol just curious but have you ever lived with a partner before and how do you handle your need for alone time my two most significant relationships including my ex who i was with for 12 years have been with guys who had a sag moon in the 1st house from my perspective their common themes are loyalty and a deep deep need for autonomy and freedom also both have a very funloving nature i love you i can tell just by looking at you that youre a kind person and i bet youre fun to hang out with too keep being awesome the world needs more people like you ill believe you you might enjoy checking,YourFriendMaryGrace
out rprecognition thats so weird but ive read similar stories before so youre not alone what time was it before you blinked vs after thats so beautiful no prob im glad it was helpful the collective unconscious fascinates me too i started learning about it when i was studying dream interpretation and how our subconscious minds use similar themes water emotions for example in dreams to illustrate our deeper feelings i think that and probably many other influences numerical astrological etc probably play a big role in these types of persontoperson coincidences which arent actually coincidental at all take your kiddos with you i drove mine to randomly generated spot in the middle of a suburban neighborhood and there were like 10 deer ambling around it was wild and they loved it never know what you might see i dont have an explanation but id say definitely keep in touch with him you can keep it light and casual and see where it goes maybe youve found each other for a reason if nothing,YourFriendMaryGrace
else you know youve got a kindred spirit out there and thats always a blessing in itself if its a metaphorical dream he probably represents a part of yourself that youd like to get reacquainted with or theres something about him that youd like to be more like think about his qualities and if theres anything about him you particularly admired could also be a glimpse into an alternate timeline as a latenights working mom of a 3 and 5 year old quiet time is vital to my sanity lol just having even fifteen minutes or so to myself really helps me regroup and keep going what did she keep in there kenan good morning you sexy beast maybe but im glad you did i think i the way i worded that question was a little more bleak than i intended and i agree with you im still healing but its a process of getting happier and happier and a lot of my healing has happened through metaphorical dreams like these because they help,YourFriendMaryGrace
me identify what im feeling on an unconscious level which is why your question caught my eye thank you for the thoughtful response do you also feel like you went through hard times that dramatically decreased your capacity for joy to this day because thats where i think my shitty disney world dreams come from i have recurring locations but what happens there varies theres a ridiculously large mostly empty church that i wander around in sometimes a postapocalyptic disney world where everything is shitty and unsafe but its the best we can do i only date people who are mature enough to value the content of someones character over the color of their skin one of the past life memories i have is of being a woman who died in the 1960s with no spiritualreligious beliefs at all i floated above my hospital bed and just kind of hovered there for a long time before i realized that i wasnt obligated to stay in the room with my body lol after that i,YourFriendMaryGrace
zipped around the world and saw things id always wanted to see like the eiffel tower before eventually making my way up to the clouds and beyond to start the betweenlives process which is a long way of saying that i think some souls need time to process the experience of not having a body or they simply arent ready to cross over because of fear or the feeling of unfinished business in this realm and thats probably where a lot of ghost sightings come from edit i dont attribute all spiritual entities to this sort of thing though i think energy good and bad can manifest in this realm all kinds of ways and theres probably an untold number of extradimensional beings passing through at any given time that we cant fully perceive on this planet ps i was raised christian as well welcome to the wonderful world of following your own path wherever it may take you a shuttle cock for bad mitten sounds like the title of a whimsical porn written,YourFriendMaryGrace
by a childrens book author my boyfriend has never said i love you to me even though ive said it to him many times hes incredibly kind and affectionate and generous and thoughtful which makes me feel loved but not hearing it is really starting to hurt i wrote about mine here i went to school with someone who is getting fairly well known as a comedian a few people found her annoying but most people including me thought she was funny i guess its still a little surprising just because so few people actually make it in the entertainment industry and she did it i think the idea that anyone can be a bad dancer is silly just move your body in whatever way feels good to you whether alone or with people those who make fun probably just wish they were brave enough to dance its never too late to turn things around geraldo i said no one of either gender should be forced into killing being killed didnt expect that to,YourFriendMaryGrace
be an offensive statement how about the kind of equality where no one of either gender gets forced into killingbeing killed on behalf of some rich dudes my moon is in capricorn and i feel like im good at stepping up to the plate for other people not so much for myself lol definitely feel guilty about my irresponsibility on a daily basis but guilt doesnt seem to motivate me so im trying to be more selfaffirming yes been getting a normal amount of sleep at night yet feeling desperate for naps and caffeine just to get through the day way more dreams than usual too this article is really fascinating to me they talk extensively about the pole shift and estimate the number of smaller circular structures similar to this one to be in the millions but for more indepth reading you might find this and this interesting english explorers who discovered the ruins in the late 1800s found it inhabited as is illustrated in the picture i linked above and documented some,YourFriendMaryGrace
of the things locals said about it i think it would be super awkward at first and yes painful for a while but personally i believe the vast majority of people are really good at heart and so much of the pain we cause each other is really because we ourselves are confused afraid and hurting and that telepathy would ultimately bring us closer together in a new way because wed be able to feel the pain thats causing people to act the way they do and maybe even inherently understand the source of their pain and the feeling of being understood and empathized with would change peoples lives for the better i think thered still be factions but it would be a much more massive yet simpler twosided one of good vs evil instead of the everymanforhimself sort of world we live in now but im just speculating of course thanks for reading i have had mixed results sharing this with people in real life so its nice to be able to talk,YourFriendMaryGrace
about it and not feel like im coming across as crazy haha its weird i feel a deep sense of tragedy and loss looking at pictures of the ruins and if really it was an accident that shifted the poles and caused us to lose telepathy that really would be a great tragedy to be able to communicate and empathize seamlessly and effortlessly and then suddenly everything changes for everybody in an instant and nobody understands why misunderstandings uncertainty about peoples motivations and so much more would be a problem for the first time and our resulting sense of being alone in the world would be so painful to experience all at once and if that is what happened it makes sense that there would be factions and people would start splitting up into tribes and inventing their own way of communicating like in the story of the tower of babel edit another interesting thing about these ruins is that theyve discovered hundreds of much smaller versions of it covering a wide area around,YourFriendMaryGrace
it as though the people who built it were experimenting and working their way up to the big one and it doesnt make sense as a fortress or city walls or a place for livestock or really any of the things we associate with ancient human lifestyles i have past life memories and by far the most vivid one is of being shown the footprint of a massive structure and understanding something similar to what youre saying except the languages came to exist because of a sudden loss of telepathic abilities as a child i would see the shape of this structures footprint everywhere in clouds popcorn ceilings the floral pattern of my bedding and it drove me crazy because i couldnt put into words what it was and how i recognized it then a few years ago i ran across this image of the footprint of the great zimbabwe ruins and it stopped me in my tracks because its the exact same shape ive remembered my whole life then i started reading more,YourFriendMaryGrace
about the legends surrounding it and it sounds an awful lot like the tower of babel theres even theories about it being some sort of natural energy producing mechanism that was just too big and too powerful and the people who built it ended up accidentally shifting the magnetic poles which could indeed affect the way our brain computers link up anyway i could go on and on but its a fascinating rabbit hole to fall down for sure or hear me out you love things about yourself that youve actually accomplished things about yourself that make you a good person or a unique individual etc and dont need to cling to where you happened to be born as a form of identity i wanna see as you grow and evolve youll take on characteristics of the sign following your natal sun for example im a pisces sun and i still have many of those characteristics but ive been a progressed aries sun since childhood and i relate to that because i had to,YourFriendMaryGrace
learn to be more independent and assertive than the typical pisces at a young age who always has their dms open if you need someone to talk to not at all everyone needs to feel wanted and loved i hope you find someone who appreciates you for you really soon speaking with kindness hearing them out and acknowledging their feelingsperspective even if i disagree and sharing my own feelingsperspective without insisting that my way of thinking about it is the only correct way basically i make every effort to have a polite discussion rather than an argument and by doing so i find that its far more likely to go my way and even if we stay on different pages the relationship can usually carry on just fine i am happy birthday just call it a leg injury and reduce your recovery time by two weeks i love you aww thank you very much for saying that my man i hope you have a great day too youre awesome thank you for chatting with,YourFriendMaryGrace
me about this i agree with you that the media is pushing it pretty hard and as someone who has almost zero trust in the media i do have to question why but at the end of the day i think its a good thing for kids to feel free to explore the world around them without having to deal with all the cultural input theyll be dealing with the rest of their lives and if this kind of thing helps parents feel better about itnot read into it too much i think thats great anyway thanks again it says a lot about you that youd earnestly consider the other side and be willing to change your way of looking at it the world would be a much better place if more people were brave enough to do that i have to work on it myself all the time ive read all your comments here and im not a fan of arguing id like to understand your side i dont get it yet but,YourFriendMaryGrace
im trying it seems youre okay with your son consciously choosing to dress as a woman once hes old enough to understand that what hes wearing will be perceived as feminine and good for you i think thats great what i dont understand is why youre not okay with a little dude playing dress up before hes old enough to have picked up on all the culturalgendered associations isnt that inherently more pure in intention its like you want to teach him its not okay but then be cool about it if he does it anyway which in my personal opinion is kinda sad because then hell only be able to express himself with the knowledge that hes going against what his parents have taught him is acceptable i have a transgender friend who still gets emotional talking about the time as a child when they said they wanted to wear a waitress costume and their parents laughed at them and said no thats for girls it was the beginning of a 20 year,YourFriendMaryGrace
long shameridden hide out in the closet until they were finally able to even think about expressing their femininity again and they still arent close with their parents statistically the odds that one of my kids will be transgender gay etc is low but regardless id so much rather be supportive of them wearing what they like than set up a precedent where they feel like they have to audit their choices based on my personal feelings as long as theyre safe and not hurting anybody i dont see any reason to get picky if a little boy wants to wear a dress its got nothing to do with their sexuality and everything to do with wanting to look like a character they enjoy my 3 year old boy likes to put my makeup on sometimes bc mommy does it and its colorful sparkly shit that can go on your face all of which appeals to his toddler sensibilities assuming that makes him gaytranswhatever would be idiotic i hear you on the first point,YourFriendMaryGrace
but you cant just lock your door and keep sleeping when your kids wake up early unless theyre old enough to be unsupervised which takes years ya got me there pal maybe hes allergic to cats befriend everyone on the planet one by one until were all cool just hanging out and making nachos and stuff making all my own decisions isnt nearly as much fun as i expected is this love by bob marley hes singing about the happy life hell have with his lady friend and when he said for ja provide the bread i heard well jump rope on a bridge which i thought was a cute but oddly specific couples activity i love you i walked through my apartment complex after a light rain and the sidewalk was covered in snails just so many snails it freaked me out but i kept on walking until i crunched one at which point i screamed and took off running crunching snails and screaming all the way home psychedelics taken for therapeutic purposes,YourFriendMaryGrace
give yourself time to grieve ryan were here for you well done linda and michael amicably coparenting with your ex can be challenging but the rewards are so worth the effort pattern i am my day job i work with artists but not doing art myself but ive been painting for a few years and sell them sometimes ultimately i want to be a filmmaker too im learning how to animate and id like to make short films what about you oh thank you that made me smile and youre welcome please feel free to reach out any time you have a dream youd like some help figuring out of course youre the best interpreter of your dreams because youre living the experiences that lead up to having them but it always seems to help me having someone readhear mine and tell me what sticks out to them i used to have chronic nightmares as well and learning how to understand what my brain was trying to sort outtell me made a huge difference,YourFriendMaryGrace
i also usually google the setting and such for common interpretations which helps like last night i had a dream that took place in a stadium and i was on a computer trying to animate i read that dreaming youre in a stadium can mean that you are trying to be more assertive and put yourself out there more which sure enough is what im trying to do with my art so it makes sense interesting im a pisces sun cap moon and an infj makes sense since infj are known for their empathetic yet emotionally reserved ways oh yeah i know but it still might be relevant since the description of the metaphor strangulation stifled emotions aggression kinda fits with your description of the dog having to be kept in the garden due to being aggressive with certain people im sorry it made you feel horrible bad dreams can be really upsetting i would interpret that as your minds way of telling you that whatever the dog represents be it stifling your emotions,YourFriendMaryGrace
or something else its a valuable part of yourself that you should protect no part of ourselves are ever really killed forever they just get pushed back or forgotten but theyre still there and you can nurture them it might be worth a try to ask yourself what the dog represents before going to bed tonight i do that sometimes and will get a new dream that illustrates it differently hmm thats interesting i googled the meaning of dreams about strangulation and this came up in dreams the feeling of being strangled suggests a deliberate act of suppression strangulation suggests a violent act of suppression emotionally our more violent aggressive side may not allow us to act appropriately in certain situations to dream of strangling someone is an attempt to stifle our own emotions maybe something in your life has made you feel like you were too aggressive or said too much or like you had to stifle your emotional responses that might explain why your brain chose that dog specifically for this dream,YourFriendMaryGrace
possibly but that someone could also be you the subconscious usually creates a character for each part of yourself that it wants to illustrate so sometimes you are all the elements of the dream do you remember any more details like how the dog was killed how would you describe your cousins dogs personality irl animals often represent a vulnerable part of yourself it might help to think about it metaphorically and whether you might feel like youve lost a part of your personality mars in aries here too and same im a pisces woman with a leo man i like our differences for the most part the biggest hurdle probably had to do with his sag moon though he doesnt like to talk about feelings until theres a problem and i could talk about feelings all day lol but ive learned to appreciate his love language of making fun plans and helping me with stuff instead of expecting him to express it my way happy birthday if you look in the shared experiences,YourFriendMaryGrace
section of a particular pattern some of the comments may tell you what its based on a lot of things seem to be based on the rising signmc is your rahu different from the north node my western north node is in taurus but if i do a vedic chart i get aries rahu me heres what its like for me personally the cons too much of my self esteem is tied up in feeling accomplished i have an emotion and then i immediately feel compelled to ignore it categorize it explain it away or feel bad for feeling it in the first place lol i rarely get comfortable just feeling i spend a lot more energy thinking about what i should and shouldnt feel the pros it overrides a lot of the less helpful pisces sun traits like laziness lack of boundless and so on also makes me popular with employers as i have a very overpowering urge to work hard edit to add i like to think that as i continue to,YourFriendMaryGrace
learn how to accept and integrate what im feeling it will be even more of an asset i hope i can learn to use my pisces empathy and my libra social skills combined with cap moon stoic side to be a port in the storm for others thanks so much and btw if youre ever interested in reading professionally id love to be a client just read your kim post and its fascinating could you recommend a site for calculating midpoint in synastry charts asenchal oil well you sound like a good parent to me and i appreciate that we were able to chat about our different perspectives without it turning into a pointless fight all the best to you and your family wanting to wear someone elses clothes sure sounds like creatively experimenting to me obviously well have to agree to disagree here and thats fine but my belief is at least partially formed by experiences like when i sat across the table from a gay friend of mine last year and held,YourFriendMaryGrace
his hand as he cried about the time when he was 4 years old and his conservative manly man dad made him feel ashamed for wanting to buy a barbie hes 30 years old and that shit still hurts another friend who is trans has memories of being laughed at by his parents for wanting to wear a waitress costume these parents didnt raise manlier boys by censoring their interestsexperimentation they raised boys who grew up to feel like their true selves werent good enough for their parents im not saying youd do these things just explaining why i dont want to be the person who makes my kids feel bad about experimenting and liking what they like theyll get plenty of that from the rest of the world and when that happens ive got their back i get you i was just responding to the other persons question of why not and i get your reason for saying no in your case but yes id let him wear his sisters clothes to school,YourFriendMaryGrace
if thats what he wanted to do and she didnt mind hes only 3 but hes worn her shirt with the hearts on it out and about before lil homie just really likes hearts as long as theyre safe and not hurting anybody i try and let them figure out what they like without putting my personal feelings and bias in the mix i have kids and i let my son wear his sisters pajamas lol theyre the same size and she doesnt mind he likes them so yeah why not i think its all pretty much done by ai like they have certain plugin phrases for planetsignhouseaspects and the robots then string sentences together based on your transits for example my moon is in capricorn in the 4th house and my venus is in aries in the 7th house so when theres a transit happening with my moon and venus it might say something like explore what happens when you allow your sturdy emotional connection with home and family to recharge your energy,YourFriendMaryGrace
for significant relationships sometimes its eerily helpful and accurate sometimes its just word salad kids will be petty no matter what you do though id rather teach my kids to express themselves in spite of the occasional negative feedback than teach them to try and fit in my 3 year old son likes fire trucks and digging in the dirt and stuff but he also likes having his nails painted different colors he studies his options carefully and usually picks specific colors for specific fingers its cute but if later on he stops wanting to do it ill be cool with it i think theres a balance between encouraging them to be themselves and forcing them to buck the trend all the time i hope i get it right but im far from the perfect parent thats so awesome youre definitely not alone i wasnt feeling well and didnt have the best experience last night in particular but generally i find the days before during and after a new moon and full moon to,YourFriendMaryGrace
be extra beneficial for that kind of inner healing libra rising with a lot of aries and scorpio im petite like 53 and 110lbs dark curly hair which i usually have as a pixie cut or a kind of mop top lol big brown eyes small nose often told i look like a fairy libra rising and this moon is transiting my 8th house also my north node is taurus in the 8th house im thinking about my future a lot what will truly make me feel happy and comfortable im also feeling a strong urge to examine my inner self and what my actual wantsneeds are vs what i feel like i should wantneed my moon is in capricorn so i dont often get the urge to just let myself feel what i feel riding the wave while i can full moons are great for releasing think about yourself as a cup and the feeling of heaviness as a symptom of being too full what behaviors fears thought patterns etc are you ready,YourFriendMaryGrace
to release edit the moon is in taurus so you can work with the energy of this specific full moon by also thinking about your five senses and indulging in pleasure take a long bath eat something yummy listen to beautiful music etc no worries at all just wanted to offer i bet youll find the perfect deck in no time i dont use tarot myself but ive enjoyed getting readings so if you ever want to practice on someone lemme know well they say your first deck should be given to you if youre comfortable sharing a mailing address with me send me a pm id love to gift you a deck from amazon if not no worries ive seen them in stores that sell games and any crystal or magick shop should have them thats so cool you gotta do it keep me posted if you have time second house is in scorpio with saturn in scorpio and uranus in sagittarius there as well i dont know what im good at but,YourFriendMaryGrace
it sure isnt makingkeeping money interestingly my south node is in scorpio in the 2nd house using whole sign so it seems i should be able to overcome this but idk im still pretty new to astrology its cool you had this dream so close to todays date of 1111 i typically read dreams metaphorically but this one might be worth looking into literally get yourself some tarot cards and learn how to read even if its just for fun im so sorry for your loss i hope things look up for you as the days go by be patient with yourself im sure you know this but the grieving process takes time im always here for you if you want to chat i have the exact same placements and disposition thats sounds about right the circumstances of my childhood made me feel like i had to be very stoic and cheerful especially around my mom shes in a much better place now and our relationship is good so i forget how much that,YourFriendMaryGrace
probably still affects me subconsciously i think of cancer like a mama bear looks very cuddly and sweet likes to hibernate but holy shit dont mess with her or her loved ones im mostly basing this on my own mama bear who is a lovely very badass cancer and my cancer granddad who was the same way im a pisces sun with a lot of scorpio and while i have some great qualities from those placements sometimes i think theyre less practicalhelpful in the outside world than cancer qualities oh thats really interesting my south node is in scorpio and my life came crashing down at age 27 i went full scorpio lol and basically expedited the burnitdown process myself so i could move on to rebuilding and i had a pretty major epiphany that could be called a spiritual awakening it was a rough time in my life but im thankful for it now everything i lost was just stuff id built trying to please or impress other people oh man i totally,YourFriendMaryGrace
do that lol for me its usually because something ive been ignoringsuppressing with various distraction tactics has suddenly bubbled up to the surface and i cant get it out of my mind and because i dont like to talk about my feelings until ive had time to process them alone i end up sitting there unable to pretend nothing is wrong and unable to talk about what is wrong its awkward edit you can help by not forcing them to talk about it just let them know youre there if they want to talk capricorn moon i was just reading about it this placement this morning actually bc im 34 and i still dont understand my own emotions very well id say that it applies to my current career in a sense my midheaven is in cancer and i work with a lot of emotionally sensitive people a nurturing personality isnt required for my job but it sure helps ultimately id like to be an artist fulltime and i can see how my art,YourFriendMaryGrace
might take on some cancerlike qualities eventually right now its very scorpio though wow thats awesome i cant think of a more appropriate profession based on your sunrising empathetic yet very comfortable with death re the bowl shape i find it confusing because some of the information i read seemed to indicate that the best way to move forward in life would be to work counterclockwise starting with the first empty area which would be taurus8th house others seemed to be saying that sorting out the saturnscorpio 2nd house stuff would be the biggest factor re the aries at 29 degrees in the 7th house i feel confused about what it means i got married too young and i still struggle with the balance between being myself and going for what i want vs truly merging with another person and my north node is in the 7th house so i feel like this is important to figure out edit i forgot that i used whole sign for this chart which puts my north node,YourFriendMaryGrace
in the 8th house and finally my progressed sun hits 29 degrees in aries next march which feels significant heres a pic of my progressed chart for that date in case its helpful any help or insight suggestions etc with any of the above would be hugely appreciated go for it i like to learn what charity why should i move my backpack off the one empty seat left on the bus when youre capable of standing why should i not be a murderer we all do a lot of things because its the right thing to do why do you want the people who run companies to be an exception so bad im glad you mentioned infrastructure because its a great example of what im saying pipelayers provide an incredibly valuable service and the work is difficult af starting pay is about 24000 a year does that seem fair to you yeah it would be dumb because bench pressing cars has no value getting the food i ordered in mere minutes does and,YourFriendMaryGrace
just because people arent properly compensated for doing difficult work doesnt mean they shouldnt be if you have a dog capable of standing up for hours at a time in a hot kitchen keeping track of multiple orders at a time busting ass to collect bag each order in well under 5 minutes interacting with customers many of whom are unpleasant working with computer systemscash registers and making correct change you should get that dog a tv show ill never understand why people think working at mcdonalds is easy i get tired just watching them because the white car ended up on top of the red truck that tried to pull it out of the water i think im no expert but i think thats more of a synastry question specifically where you have placements in each others 5th house maybe 4th house too go to astro seek or horoscope yourself websites and make a birth chart using that info lol my 5 year old has been a demanding lil punk all morning i,YourFriendMaryGrace
was just telling her that she should try being positive and encouraging more often if she wants people to care enough to cooperate with her this video couldnt have come at a better time the night i met my boyfriend he had an astounding number of conjunctions happening with his natal venus and his north node was parallel his sun sign which is kinda cool because his north node is my sun sign mars in aries 7th house i think just about everybody does that in one way or another driving in a dream usually symbolizes the way your life is going so the fact that youre the one driving and nothing scary happens is a great sign probably indicates that you feel in control of your life people who are stressed about life circumstances often dream theyre driving a car with no brakes for example it being your dads car probably symbolizes having to do some things your dads way or with his permission which makes sense given your age just my perspective,YourFriendMaryGrace
take it with a grain of salt oh thats interesting sometimes i think i might be projecting and its actually me that keeps us from talking about stuff lol i feel self conscious because my circumstances at present are keeping us from being able to progress at any rate its nice to hear that sag moons are capable of getting excited about commitment the stereotype is so bleak when it comes to sags and commitment my boyfriend has the same placements and this describes him to a t im curious though how do you feel about talking about the future with regards to relationships hes a sag moonasc so maybe that plays into it but hell talk my ear off about nearly everything but the relationship even though all the other things he says and does point to him being as committed if not more so than me hahaha thats a perfect nickname im a pisces sun so we probably have a lot of the same tendencies i have dreams where im leading a,YourFriendMaryGrace
goth girl army whose weapon of choice is literal fireflies flies that zoom into buildings and burst into flames then another part of me dressed in white swoops in and saves the people i like so clearly theres a subconscious conflict within me between wanting to help everyone and wanting to watch it all burn to the ground lol im a libra rising with pluto in scorpio in the 1st house i make a very cheerful feminine first impression and then people seem surprised when im very comfortable with the darksexualtaboo sides of life i also have very dark brown eyes its 6 people standing with their arms in the air look at the black space between the womens legs as tall skinny women in a dress and the vulva is a neckhead once you see them youll see two men in between them and men on the far left and right sides i have costar and use it as a quick reference point sometimes but astroseek is a lot more detailed and will,YourFriendMaryGrace
give you more information such as your north and south nodes which imo are some of the most helpful things to know about yourself but i definitely recommend supplementing your knowledge by googling stuff no app or website really covers everything time passages is another great app btw google venus in aries and read some articles then google venus in the 5th house and read some more the combination of what you read will give you a fuller picture edit astroseek gives birth charts that include interpretation of both house and sign but its usually a very brief description from what i can tell it can cause people to be extremely cautious about entering a relationship or even having sex i was in my 20s before i had sex and in my 30s before i had sex with someone else from what i understand thats not uncommon with venus retrograde people i really like sex id just rather be celibate than be intimate with someone i dont feel a strong connection with this thread,YourFriendMaryGrace
might be helpful science is not a belief system it does not rely on hopes and dreams i completely agree with you which is why im sharing scientific research with you instead of my hopes and dreams i have no idea whether or not pluto or the apparent retrograde of planets etc affects us neither do you but thanks to decades of research we can say with mathematical certainty that the cycles of the moon as well as some of the inner planets do in fact affect us i dont think you were expecting that so youre pretending like im linking you to pictures of voodoo dolls burning in sage piles rather than engaging with what ive actually written i also agree with you that clinging to beliefs is antiscience which is why its disappointing to see you clinging to your belief that planets have no effect on us despite being shown hard data indicating that some of them do i linked you to properly scientifically conducted research on the topic of planetary effects,YourFriendMaryGrace
on humans hoping to have a cordial sciencebased discussion it seems youre more interested in being insulting im not insulted but it feels like you want me to be and arguing against a meme that im in no way trying to defend so i dont really know how to engage with you now arguing on the internet just isnt my thing but lemme know if you ever feel like discussing research and the implications of the results btw i checked out your music and youre very talented i also work in film and i used to live in ocean beach if you believe in science and i suspect that you do then approach this scientifically and see if the evidence supports your hypothesis you stated earlier that the planets moon etc do not affect personality life experiences etc conveniently this is by definition a null hypothesis which means that nearly all the research found here applies to your hypothesis statistically significant meaning that mathematically speaking the correlations cannot be attributed to random chance evidence,YourFriendMaryGrace
rejects this null hypothesis which as scientific research usually does brings up a whole slew of new questions youve already listed some really great ones in the comment im replying to now which is why its a bummer to see you close by restating your belief that its all silly and nonsensical rather than examining the evidence and seeking the answers to your own questions asking questions and examining the evidence is the best approach we humans have for learning about our universe the idea that the earth revolves around the sun was once considered silly and nonsensical too but naturally the scientists of the time kept asking questions and examining the evidence and found it to be true and fwiw i do understand where youre coming from im 34 years old and up until may of this year i believed that astrology was a bunch of make believe woowoo nonsense and to be fair the socalled astrology seen in memes and pop culture very often is made up written by people who arent,YourFriendMaryGrace
even using astrological methods to back their claims but when i ran across an article citing scientifically conducted studies showing that ancient astrological methods can be used to predict certain human behaviors and experiences to a statistically significant degree i had to accept that i might be wrong of course you are fully entitled to your beliefs and fully entitled to disregard any evidence contradictory to your beliefs but theres a lot to be said for keeping an open curious mind without open curious minds there would be no scientists dreams are often metaphorical but this one might be a little more straightforward perhaps youve been thinking even just hypothetically about having sex and what the ramifications would be in a worst case scenario or maybe youre trying to separate your true feelings about sex from how your parents raised you to think about it just my perspective may or may not be true for you fwiw i grew up in the same kind of household and it took me a while to let,YourFriendMaryGrace
go of the guiltshamefears i had about sex but ultimately these types of dreams are helpful and probably a good sign that youre letting go of some obstacles to being yourself well now youre just being obtuse lol my second link has a long list of statistically significant data on the effects of not just the moon but many of the other planets everything is cited and you can even read many of the studies yourself and see the data if you just feel like arguing knock yourself out but calling research done by phds using blind studies and scientific methods of measurement voodoo makes no sense in no way does it effect humans emotions or personalities or life experiences theres an awful lot of statistically significant data suggesting otherwise heres a very small collection of examples and more here but theres lots more out there if youre interested thank you for saying that i hope it helps someone im very glad youre still here this made me sad im sorry your parents reacted,YourFriendMaryGrace
like that when what you needed was empathy and support i hope you feel better soon this is so cool i cant wait to try it thank you for sharing it could be a reflection of how you feel youre currently progressing through life for example when people are feeling good where theyre going in life they might dream of driving a nice car down a beautiful road or flying in an airplane lately ive been dreaming of being in a car thats out of control with no brakes so youre not alone lol can you think of anything in your life lately that youve killed it could be a relationship an idea you decided not to pursue a part of yourself that youve suppressed or even someone whos feelings you hurt the fact that you did it without thinking but felt bad afterwards is probably a helpful clue im so sorry to hear that same here and i dont relate to the typical venus in aries description very much im extremely choosy about,YourFriendMaryGrace
who i have sex with and rather than lose interest quickly as venus in aries supposedly do ill stick around way longer than is healthy for me in answer to your question op i think i interact fairly normally but under the surface im a bundle of insecurities for the beginning of the relationship and even once im settled in i have an underlying fear im not good enough ive come a long way but i still need fairly regular reassurance from my partner thats actually an urban legend and not at all based in factual evidence the universe and i have arrived at the conclusion that youre a six foot tall pile of awesome i would love that someone posted a dream here like a year ago where aliens invaded and created a test to determine whether she was a real human or an alien in disguise it said what did you do last summer yes or no and she was sweating it out trying to guess what the aliens thought a human,YourFriendMaryGrace
would respond that needs to be a meme i still laugh when i think about it im glad it was helpful and congrats on making big strides forward im a straight woman and im not even on tinder but samantha has the power to change all that definitely start keeping a dream journal it will help you start remembering them with way more clarity also check out rprecognition youre not alone the profile pic in my dream was a little different her pose was less sassy and more fml with her shoulders slouching arms down and she was frowning but i could only find so many options for images of women in coveralls isnt it crazy i only discovered the nodes a few months ago and i was amazed as my north node is precisely what i had realized that i needed to cultivate in myself earlier this year i showed a friend of mine how to look up his and he had the same reaction best of luck to you we got this,YourFriendMaryGrace
driving your life path the dream with your high school friends might have been about the path you were on back then bridge connection between things so it could be pastpresent and future for example where an unfinished bridge represents an uncertain future or unclear path to get what you want busbus station public aspect of your life journey or the parts of your life that you have less control over these are just some possible metaphors to consider dreams are usually little stories we tell ourselves to illustrate how we feel so think about the feelings in the dreams and what they might represent for you personally like the fear of heights you have in the dreams might represent a fear you have about falling or losing control in some aspect of your real life right now thank you so much normally i default to the metaphorical method of dream interpretation but this is one of those dreams that feels more spiritualenergy related to me i do think its relevant that youre doing,YourFriendMaryGrace
emdr therapy right now if i had to guess id say that youre probably ridding yourself of some yucky energy that accumulated in the time you lived in that house and the therapy is bringing it to the surface to be dealt with so while im sure it was awfully scary its probably a sign of progress renergywork might be a good resource for releasing it just remember that youre safe and in control would you mind recommending a website ive tried astroseek and the timepassages app but neither of them seem to include north node in their synastry interpretations the person im seeing now his north node is my sun sign which id think would be a good thing but im an astrology newb how can you tell that hes activating your north node your sister and i have the same sunmoon placements i agree about the pushover stereotype i think its because pisces are intuitive enough to recognize why someone is behaving badly and empathetic enough to give them a pass if,YourFriendMaryGrace
they feel like it like if someone is going off on me about some trivial thing i can see that theyre actually stressedangry about something that has nothing to do with me and it makes me feel like figuring out whats actually bothering them more than getting defensive so from an outside perspective it looks like im just incapable of standing up for myself when actually its a conscious choice to let them off the hook and see if i can help my mars is in aries though so im fully equipped with a temper lol it just doesnt flare up easily or to run away from peoplerelationships if you feel pressure to conform to circumstances or the partner i love aquarius so i think thats a nice placement however oh snap thats definitely me i can hang in there for a while i just ended a 12 year marriage that i was mentally ready to leave 6 years ago but i feel very claustrophobic when a partner expects to have a lot of,YourFriendMaryGrace
sway in my decisions im still trying to figure out whats fair in that regard and i love leos btw i have no leo in my chart and i wish i did theres just a cheerful magnetism in the leos i know that draws me in like a moth to a flame lol im currently seeing a leo sunsag moon which seems to be working out well in that he needs his freedom and respects mine the lack of communication is trying though secondary characters often represent parts of your psyche that arent fully integrated sex kissing etc often represents the integration or merging of this part of yourself into the whole so for example if youve been working on being more assertive your subconscious might illustrate that with a dream like this thats just one possibility to consider you can try asking yourself what the man represents as you fall asleep and it may be illustrated in a different way with a new dream my jupiter is in aquarius in the 4th house,YourFriendMaryGrace
of all my placements ive probably looked into that one the least im still not sure how it manifests in my life my venus is in the 6th house and opposite the ascendant within 35 degrees according to timepassages would that be considered wiggle room mars opposite ascendant within 45 degrees i dont relate to the venus in aries descriptions very much i never knew why but what you said about the double negative and directing the typically outward tendencies onto oneself is interesting and got me thinking mine is 22 degrees so from what i understand if i were to pick up on the tendencies of another venus placement itd be taurus but i relate more to the venus in pisces descriptions hey cool im a libra rising too i wish i could take credit for the chart analysis but it must have been someone with a similar user name im still kinda new to astrology but im glad another your friend or mary grace out there was helpful ha my lilith is,YourFriendMaryGrace
also in aries as is my mars both in the 7th house and conjunct my venus it occurred to me recently that in all my major relationships theres been an ongoing power struggle where my independence and need for autonomy is perceived as a threat to the relationship im also very choosy about who i have sex with to the point of long periods of celibacy even though i have a really high sex drive i dont even know why but i just cant do causal sex and im happy with how i look now but its been a loooong road to get here how do you feel like it affects you im a retrograde venus in aries ive forgotten several including the big one that seemed to cause some major glitches in the following days i take it as a sign that my jump was so successful ive just forgotten the previous timeline you can find out right now using this free calculator once you know what nodes you have google north node,YourFriendMaryGrace
in and read a few different sites to get a good understanding if you do locate your chart it should also tell you what houses your nodes are in which will give you even more insight into your souls journey i love all of this shes very artistic but she has a short attention span so i think something that requires figuring it out as she goes would be perfect and hold her attention better thanks so much for the suggestions this is so fascinating i absolutely give in to her wanting to quit things all the time and i would say ive been doing less discipline than id planned im a softie pisces sun lol but i can see how it is more helpful to her in the long run to teach her perseverance and responsibility now thanks for taking the time to respond its really useful stuff wow its really good you brought this up because her dad and i are very recently divorced so theres lots of changes happening and my,YourFriendMaryGrace
tendency is to keep her out of the loop unless its a big obvious thing that needs to be discussed but shes so observant that i find her asking questions that she wouldnt be asking if she hadnt already picked up on a lot of what is going unsaid thank you if youre open to astrology calculate your birth chart and see what your north node and south node is theyre commonly known as karmic parts of the chart with the north node being the traits you should develop and the south node being what you need to overcome for example my south node is in scorpio which indicates my past lives have been dramatic and probably full of controlabuse issues this is reflected in my past life memories and has been true for my current life as well and my north node is in taurus so im meant to learn how to be in control of myself alone and build a stable enjoyable life for myself i suppose it comes down to a,YourFriendMaryGrace
matter of belief but personally i believe that our loved ones animals included can use the dream world as a vehicle to come check in on us and let us know theyre still around i had some very memorable dream moments of conversing with my granddad after he died as did several other people in my family who were close to him im sorry for your losses and hope it helped to be able to see them again this is so helpful and encouraging thank you it definitely sounds like her she loves to paint and seems to have a knack for learning languages my challenge with her is that she is very interactive she doesnt like to entertain herself and wants me to be engaged in everything she does and she wants to do a lot so im always looking for ways to keep her busy so she doesnt feel ignored when mama needs a minute im so sorry to hear that my 5 year old daughter is a gemini sun and moon,YourFriendMaryGrace
pisces rising would you guys mind sharing your parenting tips what helped or would have helped little you thrive and feel supported growing up im a pisces sun and a capricorn moon i consider it a blessing because the practical downtoearth cap qualities help me regulate my spaced out pisces tendencies youre the best interpreter of your own dreams so the following is just my first impression take whats helpful and disregard the rest seeing her in a gritty fast food restaurant this was not a healthy or nurturing relationship resembling someone you dislike seeing with new clarity the aspects of her that didnt jive with you all black clothing endings closure holding a baby new beginnings fwiw i find its pretty normal and common to dream of an ex once you find a better partner when youre still single and searching it can be harder to process the emotional impact of a past relationship and harder to see it clearly too youve found someone more compatible which makes it easier for your brain,YourFriendMaryGrace
to sort out what was wrong before think of it like selftherapy its possible you woke up after did you ever love me because thats not something you can really be certain of either way hope that helps and best of luck with your new relationship the hot and cold thing ok thank you for the straightforward feedback i definitely dont want to change him i guess i just wanted to understand if this is his true nature or if im just not someone he feels safe opening up to or what hes a leo sun not positive but i think hes an aquarius rising no aries in his main planets but a neptune in scorpio venus in gemini yes to the temper tantrum letting it go quickly though the tantrums have so far been directed at people he feels are being tricky or unfair and not at me he does get jealouspissed at the thought of guys hitting on me though i i am so glad you told me this thats the opposite,YourFriendMaryGrace
of my natural reaction lol thank you but what if he never brings up anything thats bothering him like ever until eventually hes so fed up about something that he wants to end things and its something i could have made better if only id known does anyone here have advice on getting a sag moon partner to open up about his feelings or at least admit to having them thats amazing if you havent already looked at the research into past lives i think youll be surprised how much evidence there is to support it jim tucker is a great place to start that being said i find its helpful to think about it from the perspective that regardless of whether or not the memories are real these images and storylines came from your own subconscious mind so theres something in olivers experiences that you can learn from or relate to in this life i did one of those regressions and had vivid recollections of being a really sad and sexually degraded woman,YourFriendMaryGrace
named marnie who married for money and then spent the rest of her life depressed and bored out of her mind ive always had a strong desire to marry for love respectown my sexuality and make my own living and maybe those hard lessons marnie learned are part of the reason why or maybe its just a story my brain told me to illustrate how i feel either way it was helpful thanks for the update how would this affect someone with their venus in gemini i dont know but i do think it gets easier with practice for me the mental diet definitely seems to be helping that being said last night i found myself worrying again haha so im still learning im reading this 44 minutes after you posted it im so sorry for the things you never got to experience with him i bet hes so proud of you he cant stand it first of all im really sorry youre feeling this way id suggest you start by manifesting better selfesteem,YourFriendMaryGrace
imagine that youre happier and more confident in yourself than youve ever been imagine that youre turning heads when you walk into the room or getting compliments that make your day whatever feels like a wish fulfilled of being a confident person to you just leave sp out of it as much as possible for now and when you do think of him try to simply intend that hes happy and fulfilled too i know its not easy and definitely give yourself a grace period of processing that anger but it will help you in the long run to work towards genuinely wishing him well in life with or without you once youve got that selfesteem up then work on the sp by then you may not even be interested in getting back together but if you are youll be all set to have a healthier happier relationship sat state akin to sleep but im not sure how it might be translated into the books youve read its the method of getting very relaxed,YourFriendMaryGrace
but still awake and visualising the end result of what you intend to manifest sp specific or special person its not a neville term as far as i know its used by people who have a particular person usually someone they know like a friend or an ex they want to date damn thats exciting youre a badass and you got this there ya go perfect step one for your new formula i like being subscribed to rhydrohomies because its like a wholesome drinking game for me lol if im scrolling reddit and i see one of their posts i stop and drink some water it also helps me to keep a reusable water bottle i can carry around with me its a little annoying to keep up with but thats part of what makes it an effective tool for remembering to hydrate once you get used to the wonderful feeling of being well hydrated for a few days in a row i bet itll become a habit the mental clarity alone makes it,YourFriendMaryGrace
worthwhile not to mention youll start to look and feel more healthy without any specifics its hard to offer advice but generally speaking i think starting with small changes in the way youre going about life can get the ball rolling go to bed thirty minutes earlier tonight drink a little more water than usual tomorrow say hi to that neighbor you usually dont speak to kind of depends on the context of the dream but it often represents some new or underdeveloped part of yourself could be an aspect of your personality thats ready to grow or even an idea youd like to see brought to life feel free to message me if youd like some help with anything specific from the dreams usually overwhelming emotions maybe youve been through or are in the midst of an emotional experience the good news is that you either made it through or youre well on your way to making it through oh man thats a lot of stress to deal with and i think its,YourFriendMaryGrace
understandable that youd feel totally overwhelmed by it but its also the kind of thing that a few years from now you could be telling a new partner or friend or colleague about and theyd say what you did that and laugh their ass off because it is so out of character for the person theyve come to know and love one of my favorite people in my life is a guy who got duis and stole shit in his younger days even spent some time in jail and now hes so damn accomplished and successful and happy that i a relatively successful woman with two kids look up to him a lot point is as bad as this may seem it is really and truly okay and you can get through it and come out the other side with lessons learned and a hell of a story try and cut yourself some slack were lucky to have you here and i really hope you stick around i often dream of my friends as,YourFriendMaryGrace
a representation of some part of myself and sex dreams can often be symbolic of mergingintegratingaccepting two or more disconnected parts of yourself it might be helpful to think of the first thing that comes to mind when you think of each friend for example lets say kevin is really comfortable in social situations a dream about having sex with him might be your subconscious minds way of illustrating that theres a part of you that can also be comfortable around new people and you can integrate it you would probably find rastralprojection very useful youre already halfway there i think first and foremost you should follow what brings you joy that being said real love in my opinion doesnt involve trickery and confusion and demands of loyalty its just freely given to you as you are im wary of anyone or anything that expects you to jump through hoops to meet their needsdesires it sounds like both these fellas have you in a rather vulnerable and confused place even as they may say,YourFriendMaryGrace
its for your own good you are all you need to be empowered and vibe high i dont know that theres anything we can be 100 certain about in this realm of existence thats part of the adventure but you might find it helpful or at least entertaining to do a past life regression meditation on youtube i saw myself in vivid detail as a humanoid cheetah looking being from another planet who decided to come here to spread love and light the revelations about that life and what i was like before continued to come to me through dreams and meditation for about a year afterwards regardless of whether or not its true it all came from my subconscious mind and really helped me know myself better as well as refocus my energy and refine my goals for this lifetime i havent experienced flips with anything but fruit loops and it seems to flip every few months for me this reads like a message from you to yourself that you can be more,YourFriendMaryGrace
assertive its all started with you saying yes to a date not because youre dying to go but because you dont want to be rude and then you stay in a very uncomfortable situation because he told you to you only get freedom in the end by doing what you want and need to do in spite of the guys orders it seems like a horror story about being passive in other words but thats just my interpretation and i might just be seeing it that way because i tend to be way too passive and im working on being more true to myself gotcha thank you for clarifying were probably going to have to agree to disagree here but personally i believe holding fast to love and light is the only way to fight the dark responding with violence only begets more violence and round and round it goes nothing new about that i also believe that respecting the free will of others is essential to being truly loving and as such we,YourFriendMaryGrace
cant really wake people up we find our own way when were ready ok but what does fight mean to you as in physical violence what do you mean by fight is that across the street from the thinkery four years ago at the time there were a lot of sightings reported around there and iirc there was a group of austin people who would meditate together at night in manor because it always seemed to summon ufo but i should have said it used to be a hot spot as i dont know how many have been spotted there as of the last couple years manor seems to be a hot spot for ufo i saw one there on my 30th birthday keep googling them theres an article for just about every number you could possibly see but know this the idea of good and bad numbers is a human concept angels will only send you love and encouragement i get 43 pretty often and i like the last paragraph of this interpretation,YourFriendMaryGrace
as it often crops up when im overwhelmed by the clutter in my home or workplace edit oops just realized you said 42 not 43 but hopefully something i said was helpful anyway can confirm am the wife interesting that they chose to live as the person they dont remember being i would rather continue living the life i remembered and as a family member id rather be around the person who thoughtactedremembered as the person i knew than be with a virtual stranger who only looked like my loved one thank you dreams of having a baby are often about birthing or in this case losing a part of yourself i think its interesting that the baby looked fake to you my guess is that the baby represents some aspect of yourself that you lost in the process of datingbreaking up with him the fact that youre not very sad about it and it didnt look real to you in the first place maybe suggests this part of yourself and wasnt a part,YourFriendMaryGrace
of who you truly are just something to consider if it doesnt resonate disregard happy birthday this is a synchronicity for me i had a strong urge yesterday and this morning to lie in the grass and get some sunshine i felt a little bad about it both times because my brain was so quick to remind me that theres chores to be done gotta get ready for work etc but yesterday my 2 year old seemed to read my mind and ran into the back yard and stretched out in the grass smiling i followed suit and then did it again this morning that little bit of spontaneous relaxation just for the pleasure of it seemed to set my whole body and soul on a better track reading this at 1111 oh my never knew about this before but its super intriguing thanks i think so too and i wonder if the magnetic pole shift believed to have happened many thousands of years ago may have messed up earths frequencies or messed up,YourFriendMaryGrace
our ability to receive them ive also wondered if this is where the tower of babel story comes from people working together to build something suddenly lose their ability to communicate and have to invent languages amongst themselves youre welcome so glad to hear it was helpful i relate to that very much especially the fear theres always a dozen whatifs that stop me from doing things that i know would serve me and others well we can unlock those chains i believe in us mindless activities like riding the bus can put you in a hypnotic state much like meditation so it could have been some subconscious imagery coming through not unlike a dream it might help to think about it metaphorically bikes are used to move us forward is there a metaphorical bike youre leaving chained up when you could be well on your way to somethingsomewhere else could be a spiritual emotional or even literal journey youre ready to go on when i was ready to go back to work after,YourFriendMaryGrace
having my baby but i was nervous and hesitating i started dreaming of cars stuck in a garage feel free to send me a message if youre open to the idea check out the subs for past lives and reincarnation you just made me lol for real full of blood that only music allowed is a solo performance by kenny g i thought he meant it like if youre afraid of death it would mean that you love life but i may have misunderstood it might be helpful to do some imagination work with the end result in mind imagine your excitement in telling your mom how everything is going at work imagine how you feel a little nervous on your first day imagine a year from now when you are welcoming a new employee and remembering back to when you were the new guy i had an interesting conversation with my husband the other day that prior to learning about the me would have turned into an argument lol we were discussing some,YourFriendMaryGrace
decisions we made over the summer and the motivations behind them without going into boring detail basically the way i remember his motivations are completely different from the motivations he remembers not only having but discussing with me at length before this would have angered me and i would have thought he was delusional but seeing how me has effected us both differently some of the differences being cultural stuff that has happened since weve been married i feel like theres really no use trying to insist that im right about how i remember him feeling we might just be coming from slightly different timelines ohhh i get it now that makes so much sense thank you for clarifying gonna try it tonight do you set an alarm for every 90 minutes if nikola tesla and johnny depp had a baby thats really sweet one of my coworkers was telling me recently that his wife watched the andy griffith show every night at the same time after she passed away he was watching a,YourFriendMaryGrace
game with his friend neither of them touching the remote and the channel flipped over to the andy griffith show not once but twice they were really in love and when her cancer got really bad she told him before she died that she would do her best to let him know she was saying hi from the other side he had a lot of cool experiences like this ps so sorry for your loss hope its a comfort to know hes never really gone its usually a good thing a sign that youre discovering new or long forgotten parts of yourself the windows might represent that this part of yourself gives you a new outlook on life or the world around you heres the original post for 2 cups usneakyrabbit you look like little michael yagoobian before he turns evil which makes me want to take you home with me and love you if youre up for adoption please let me know before its too late love your style probably so the subconscious,YourFriendMaryGrace
tends to tell stories to help us work through whatever were consciously thinking about you might really enjoy taking something like meyers briggs to help you get to know yourself better i was in the same boat trying to figure out who i was without the outward influences and it really helped me to take this and read about my type if the first result you get doesnt feel like it describes you very well try this one hope that helps re your post title you might find it interesting to check out the recent research coming out on the nature of our dreams it would seem that they are often meant to be helpful in processing our emotions and experiences anyway i think the finale of the dream is quite interesting because bathrooms are where we tend to our most private business and in dreams they often represent the same thing but youre in a public bathroom which seems to be a hint that this is symbolizing a private element of your life,YourFriendMaryGrace
that is difficult to keep under wraps the costume or rather pretending that you are wearing a costume makes me wonder if theres some part of yourself or your personal life that you try to disown in front of others but you are the best interpreter of your dreams since you alone know whats on your mind and whats happening in your life if any of this was helpful awesome but if not please disregard asking for help is an act of strength not weakness theres nothing pathetic about it and the sooner you can accept that the faster youll be able to make some strides this has been the biggest lesson ive had to learn this year and its tough its sad because we come into the world as little babies who are completely dependant on others for survival and we accept this about ourselves naturally but over time we internalize messages about being independent and forget that humanity wouldnt have survived nor would it continue to survive without relying on each other,YourFriendMaryGrace
its natural and human to need help and by asking youre giving people like me a chance to experience the joy of lending a hand another thing i see in your post is the negative spin youre putting on your life story i have failed at many things as well but thats just one way to look at my life i could just as easily frame my failures as many different things ive had the opportunity to learn the story we tell about ourselves is very very powerful and sets the stage for our future so look again at your life experiences and think about how much youve grown what youve learned what lessons and experiences youve had that you can utilize in your new chapter i also recommend taking a personality test that can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses i really like meyers briggs which of course is not perfect but has really helped me to understand myself and how i best fit into the world okay i could go on,YourFriendMaryGrace
and on but the most important thing i wanna say is that you are doing great housing debt wealth and all other forms of material success can never ever tell us about who you truly are you were worthy of love and acceptance the day you were born and you didnt bring a dime with you the same is true for you now even if it doesnt feel like it i love you and im proud of you and im here for you anytime dreams like this usually represent neglecting yourself in some way water often symbolizes emotions so perhaps you have some emotional cleaning out to do the big dangerous fish could represent anger sadness or some other feelings that are affecting your wellbeing of course this is just one possible interpretation thoughts lots of them have shut down in the past few days heres a partial list credit to uthadudeabidez via this comment more that are down webcams located at soar observatory the southern astrophysical research telescope located in chile brt tenerife,YourFriendMaryGrace

if its set in the past there would be some indication of that in the dream which there doesnt seem to be the person trying to stop you from mopping up the water could be a lot of things think about who or what in your life is an obstacle to sorting out your feelings it could be a representation of some part of yourself that avoids working through difficult times the finale is a bit difficult to guess could indicate that the overwhelming emotions are workrelated but honestly im not sure does any of that help the nasa solar page is down as are a bunch of other observatories ps truthfully i do hope its aliens ive been following this as well and one of the main reasons people have been skeptical about it being related to the sun is that other solar observatories around the world are still up and running interestingly that no longer appears to be the case list of solar observatories going offline very curious i take it as,YourFriendMaryGrace
a sign im on the right track i think we live in the midst of infinite timelines and repeating signs that feel positive are basically a function of the more optimal timelines happy cake day friend thanks for sharing this great picture of your handsome pops and uncle you are an amazing artist this is beautiful the most effective tip ive found is setting the intention as youve already done by jumping and carrying on as if its already done think about it like placing an online order you trust that it will come to you but you dont expect it to show up instantly or order it again and again you just place the order and know it will be delivered it also greatly helps to put it out of your mind as much as possible and when you do think of it practice feeling grateful for the thing youve asked for in other words think im so thankful that i get to have rather than why havent i gotten my yet ahh,YourFriendMaryGrace
fair enough well i wish you the best of luck and if i can help you with your experimentation lemme know i think your belief in it working is pretty helpful so going into it expecting it wont work may manifest exactly that not working i wouldnt advise you plan on trying again for the same thing rather do your best to expect the jump you already did will work that being said i typically wait at least a week between jumps more gradual methods can be found at rlawofattraction or rnevillegoddard ive had success with both but mostly prefer these over the jumping methods loving and forgiving people brings you much greater joy and peace of mind than holding onto your frustrations and pain easier said than done i know but worth the effort every time narwals are not a fictional creature i used to coordinate weddings brides and grooms were 10x easier to deal with than the parents of the couple tended to be moms of the bride and groom ime are,YourFriendMaryGrace

in fear of crunching another one it took my husband a while to convince me to start walking again and almost as soon as i did i stepped on another snail rather than get stuck again or ya know watch where i was walking i decided to make a run for it crunching snails and screaming all the way home st johns wort its otc and remarkably effective also just taking good care of myself even or especially when i dont feel like it specifically i try to have at least one green smoothie every day so im sure i get at least 45 daily fruits and vegetables getting out in the sunshine exercising several days a week limiting my internetscreen time and making time to do creative stuff this is not medical advice by any means but personally i took antidepressants for years and they werent nearly as helpful as all of the above also finding friends who arent judgmental and will listen to my problems and empathize ive been fortunate to find,YourFriendMaryGrace

use my gifts of service its a wildly different perspective but it seems like im getting the message that being financially strapped is actually keeping me in a place where i have to think about my needs more than i would without financial stress i think too that i need to learn to trust myself im terrified to turn into a selfinterested rich person who is negligent in the needs of those less fortunate so i keep myself in a situation where im always busy trying to make ends meet which isnt really helping the less fortunate either the silver triangle i havent had the chance to watch your video yet but your title is a little synchronicity for me as ive had the phrase you cant pour from an empty cup running through my mind lately i have two children 4 and 2yo a husband a dog a cat two parttime jobs friends and family who have their own emotional and practical needs i try to fill the list goes on and i,YourFriendMaryGrace
can do a lot but i tend to be selfsacrificing to the point where i simply dont take the time to nourish myself or get enough sleep i used to consider taking care of myself as service to self but i no longer see it that way i see that getting adequate nourishment and rest putting on clothes that make me feel confident instead of schlepping around in whatever i pull from the drawer first exercising getting out in the sunshine and putting on makeup or earrings or whatever else feels fun that day these things allow me to open my arms wider and work harder for others to me the only real difference is intention im refilling my cup so i have more to pour out not so i can keep it full and set it aside just for me as for the darkworkers thing i actually never heard that term until this week but it perfectly describes my pastlife memories on a spaceship and essentially what i do best in this life,YourFriendMaryGrace
i seem to have a knack for walking right up to the bad guys and diffusing situations breaking up fights etc which is kind of funny because im tiny but when i first ground myself in love and light i am somehow able to gently talk down angry men who could chuck me across the street if they wanted to lol but it is essential to do so as though they are my beloved brothers because they are so i consider myself a lightworker i just thrive in the presence of darkness and transmute it the best i can this sounds like a game i would have played all day you should try rtipofmytongue,YourFriendMaryGrace
