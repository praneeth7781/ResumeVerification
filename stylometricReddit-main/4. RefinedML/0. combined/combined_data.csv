i dont know anything about fashion week either but this does not sound legit at all tell her not to pay anyone any money for anything you know you did the right thing in breaking up with him he wasnt being a good partner to you you seem to think him going to therapy has somehow made whatever intimacy issues he has disappear thats probably not the case he may be having sex with whoever the new guy is but will it continue you had no issue in the beginning also he may get this guy get comfortable and stop having sex with him too im not so sure that being in contact with him is good for you youre having a really hard time getting over him but really you shouldnt be you have so much going on in your life youre successful good looking have new friends basically youre a catch speaking with someone is good it might help you re think what exactly you are so upset about losing maybe instead,Mentalcomposer
of being sad about him or what hes doing start being mad mad that he refused to be a good partner and put in the work that needed to be done mad that he robbed you of 6 years that you could have spent building a life with someone who values and appreciates you youre not broken maybe a little bent but bendy things bounce back and you will too no she says she doesnt want to block ppl from the past and its toxic and youre stronger than that but he was already blocked until now so why did she unblock him now somethings not right i hate saying it but is she lining him up for when she gets rid of you how long are you married is everything ok i dont know what you should do because if she shows you that she blocks him shell just unblock him when you dont know if you truly think youre heading for a divorce instead of getting back together then start divorcing him,Mentalcomposer
that way theres no way he can get citizenship even without your documents if youre no longer married and tell your fam whats going on so they dont help him i have 3 kids and am 1 of 6 siblings might have been ok to have 4 i always thought of it like this between both parents we have 4 hands so we can hold hands with 4 kids but no way in hell would i have gone past that there is no way to really give any substantive time energy or affection to a dozen kids while i agree with you the diff is the friends wife specifically made sure that op was not invited to their wedding even tho friend wanted to invite her i wouldnt invite her either and friend can decide if he wants to come solo its also good for your liver cleans it out or something we always have it in our house use it on beef or cocktail sauce honestly you really couldnt afford to go and,Mentalcomposer
then you wanted to be there for a whole week you should have gone the day before the party and left the day after you would have seen everyone at the party this is the third time ive seen this same post and the second time you left out running into the nearest store and not coming out youre not getting whatever answer you want so you keep trying ok heres the answer you want hes a fool to have ever stopped wanting to date you you are just the most amazing woman on the planet and how he didnt see it is a mystery to all of us because we can tell with your obsessive need to harp on this one date and why he didnt want you that you would make an absolute splendid partner if he would only see that all would be right with the world s if you couldnt tell there happy you got the affirmation you so longingly hoped for please get some help based on your post,Mentalcomposer
n t a butyou dont say how old both are or how long youre dating im gonna need that to try to figure out why this whole situation is bizarre the way you word it were your parents out of town or something these are things you sit down with your parents and discuss your bf asked permission to ask you im gonna guess your dad didnt say he wanted him and your mom to be there not that i think bf should have done that but he could have had that convo with your dad at that time hes not affectionate enough but they forbid that what exactly is it about him that they do not like what are they seeing that makes them think youll be disrespected if you marry him what signals is dad seeing that you dont or you know you can be happy youll be away from these crazy people once you marry nta why do i think your bro purposely either didnt tell fianc you couldnt make that,Mentalcomposer
date or picked that date just to screw with you im sure by now his fianc knows about the conflict so what does she have to say about it and how is it that nobody ever mentioned to her that date is off limits does she never see your family does she never talk wedding things with your mom id go to the friends wedding your bros was planned after and youre a groomsman the mere fact that her dad called your mom about this is staggering to me who is he to get involved is his d so upset that her future bil cant attend weird just tell him to open his own investment acct most people dont really share an investment acct whats wrong with just not having sex with her until she is more secure that this is going somewhere its only been a few weeks if you like her you wait if she doesnt want to respect that and drop it and if you really cant date her without sex,Mentalcomposer
then be honest with her and tell her that our rule of thumb was 1 sport per season and 1 non sport we had 3 kids so if a sport had 2 practices a week and 1 game that was 9 places we had to be every week plus 3 more for the non sport the non sport thing was usually once per week but that depends on what they do as they get older some non sports become more frequent dance gymnastics and if they play a sport on a hs team thats every day plus a game but its not that bad because they go right from school so its just a later pick up i was realistic about activities with the kids unless they showed an absolute talent for an activity there were no private lessons no travel teams i knew parents that had their grade schoolers in private sport lessons or dance classes 3x a week they got bored at some point and quit and this is a very small,Mentalcomposer
sample size but i can recall 2 kids who actually played semi professionally and one didnt even start till hs so encourage what they want to try but dont make their schedule rule the household just my very personal opinion and you just lay there while hes getting off id be up in a flash and there would be a reckoning he really cant disrespect you anymore by doing that jfc say something idk about others but its my experience that long term couples do not stop having sex because of weight gain especially if both people have gained some im talking nominal amounts of weight not excessive snapping his fingers and pointing at his dick would get him a kick in the balls anything having to do with ig i cant comment on as i or my partner do not use any sm that involves following sex workers for me all of the above adds up to breaking up i refuse to be in a sexless disrespectful relationship you should rethink your self,Mentalcomposer
worth and decide if this is what you deserve and i really hope you come to the only decision it can be esh while i understand just how upset your wife was and not being able to reach you when theres an emergency just compounds the worry been there 8 mo pregnant done that the thing is she knows your phone gets locked up so calling it would do absolutely no good if youre ok you dont have it with you to answer it and if youre not ok you wouldnt be answering your phone anyway so either scenario is not going to get her the answers that she needed anyway yelling at her isnt going to help the situation but getting written up when this was an extenuating circumstance is pretty crappy of your job did you explain to your boss about the d d and the override and just how worried your wife was id suggest you give her the number to an office where she can actually speak to someone in,Mentalcomposer
case there is an actual emergency like if a family members is taken to the hospital not to ask you to bring home milk hotspurs advice of approaching this talk as coming from a place of love is the way to go stress that it really has nothing to do with matt and how you feel or not about him its more about how you feel and care about your friend best of luck but she doesnt own half theyre not married so assets wont pass to her if he dies and her name is on nothing the biggest problem in all this is that at the time you purchased homes 23 you didnt insist that your name be put on the deed it doesnt matter who put the money toward the down payments who pays the bills or any other thing your name is not in the deed therefore if you two split up he is sole owner of all those properties idk if by not putting your name on the deed was,Mentalcomposer
due to you having a lower credit score which would make getting a mortgage together harder or youd get a worse rate or if it was your reasoning if scamming the govt idk how that even works to be honest but for whatever reason if you think you should be a legal half owner of these properties the only way is to have your name added to the deed if youre counting on him to put it in his will that you get all his assets if when he passes then you can do that but im pretty sure if he passes as it is right now his assets will go to his next of kin and that is not you you were very shortsighted when it came to protecting yourself not that i blame you being how long term you two are but if i was you id get all the papers that i need to add my name to the deed of at least one home bring it to him and fight,Mentalcomposer
with him cause it will be a fight to sign it and then get it filed ill just add hes a pretty crappy partner in that he doesnt have care in the world that you will be left homeless if something were to happen to him you are being a hypocrite he can do playstation and play games which they talk to each other while playing but you wont let him just plain talk to his friends lighten up if you must keep your insane amount of control then make his down time from midnight to 8 am what do you expect him to do after 9 pm in the summer youre treating him like a grade schooler i agree with everything hotspurjr said it is possible that since theyve been together for so long that your friend just doesnt see a way out he may be unhappy but not know what else to do he may be ok with his life but you wont know that until you talk with him if you,Mentalcomposer
can do it offer him a place to stay somewhere he can get a better perspective on what his life has become please talk to him i think you should sub for a year or so before you go back to school make sure you actually like it i went back to school later than you and i got my degree in education i wanted to be a middle school science teacher loved the material my last year of schooling was my student teaching year i came home crying more days than not it was absolutely horrible and i never worked as a full time teacher shes not wrong for asking but her timing could have been better its not like you just met if arent comfortable with being with someone with a high count or a low count or any count then you find that out before youre engaged in what could lead to adding to their body count maybe this time things progressed faster and further and she wasnt expecting it to,Mentalcomposer
go as far and never got around to asking before sorry i think i did wrong thats federal maybe so i just looked at my nj 1040 if you have to pay send it here nj division of taxation revenue processing center pi box 111 trenton nj 086450111 include san and make check payable to state of nj tgi if you do not owe send here nj dept of taxation revenue processing center po box 555 trenton nj 086470555 took a pic but it didnt copy here you go yeah but my kids have friends ive known for years but mainly from the occasional time they come over hearing about them over the years but im not sure if id want to vacation with them i think thats what theyre saying they dont really know this guy if this guy hasnt hung out with the family for any amount of time you really never know if everyone gets along or not that would suck to find out on a vacation dont answer any requests,Mentalcomposer
from people you dont know ir set your acct private idk ig so is that even possible ignore ignore ignore if you blocked them everywhere how are they reaching out to you does she have any friends to talk to maybe she wants to talk about you so she cant talk to you about you is there anything new happening in her life that would bother her is she going off to college in the fall if in the us maybe shes afraid being apart or maybe she wants to break up and be single in college or shes just looking for attention ask her if its any of those things but id tell her she looks pathetic posting things like that nta youve let your bro decide the relationships you have had with family members for the last 4 years its time to take back the ones you can salvage but id leave your wife home she doesnt deserve the vitriol and can i just say for a person who is antimental illness,Mentalcomposer
he sure seems like hes a candidate for intense therapy what is it about your wife that he hates with such an intensity does or did her ocd impact him in any way when you were all living together im missing what she could have done that just the sight of her has him going into a tantrum are you sure youre the only one shes seeing you barely see this woman its been 6 months you see her once a week she ignores your texts and your intimacy is close to none what exactly are you getting out of this relationship she may be a great woman but it feels like youre more just friends you need to have an open and honest conversation about all of these things and whatever else is bothering you its great you like her enough to give her time to work on her issues but how much time are you willing to wait you two should be growing closer but it seems like youre at the same,Mentalcomposer
place you were when you first started dating the only part i cant figure out is why she would talk of a future when she barely sees you i wouldnt be staying at her place the majority of the nights and i absolutely wouldnt be moving in after 6 months you have a place use it dont you just ever want to have time to yourself come on give the relationship some time and space stop playing house after such a short amount of time if its meant to be itll still be there in another 6 months or a year and if its not then you saved yourself some angst idk whats going on with her searches it could be as simple as she just wants to see who they moved on to or just curiosity what theyre up to but my advice still stands slow it way down why did she put her clothes outside of the bedroom is this the norm do you also leave your clothes outside the bedroom i,Mentalcomposer
want to say this cannot actually be real as i cant imagine you could have failed your d over and over again yta in what universe does a woman not immediately throw the pervy disgusting man out of the house the second he gets done saying hes attracted to your d this cannot possibly be someone you want to continue to be married to youre trying to fix the wrong things but it seems youve been doing that for the whole of your ds life your first marriage was so bad that your d has developed mental health issues from it you stayed too long with a man who was no good for you and your d your d is being bullied yet you once again made the wrong decision on how to handle that situation take a shower thats the absolute best you could do mom oh im sorry i see you were too busy trying to salvage a horrible marriage s then you marry yet another man who is creeping on your,Mentalcomposer
d and once again you made the wrong decision heres a tip your marriage is not a healthy one is it any wonder that your d disassociates shes trying to block out you shes an introvert of course she is she stays to herself because she knows she literally has no one to support her so your solution to that is to put her out of the house how in the world do you think that is going to help her since you dont know what to do ill tell you kick the h out have d live with her dad leave your d alone youve done enough fixing get into therapy to figure out why you are possibly the most self centered selfish and mean mother to your d explore in therapy why you choose absolutely horrible men get your d into therapy so she can heal the wounds you left her with somethings odd here if your friend group is all marrying at such a young age why is that is it,Mentalcomposer
a religion thing because i cannot even imagine how or why your friends think its a good idea to marry while still in school you need to be up front and tell your gf that there is no way youre going to propose until youre done with school and have a steady job you have told her that before and you havent changed your stance in this if that doesnt work for her then as much as it would hurt you will let her go to find someone who wants to marry on her timeline its impossible to think that you arent doing anything that bothers him or annoys him not a knock at you but nobodys perfect but maybe its just not that big of a deal to him at the time he gets a bit annoyed not enough to mention it he takes it in stride and moves on so maybe the things that you bring up he feels are just not that big or important enough that it should bother you,Mentalcomposer
as much as it does you can of course feel the way you feel idk if thats the case but maybe think about the things that youve fought about and ask him if thats the case ask him what are the things he gets annoyed about with you that he doesnt bother saying anything about he might just be a real laid back doesnt sweat the small stuff kind of guy yta did you ever think that jacob was a bit freaked out and got quiet when your answer meant that you were the cheater since he knows your stance on cheating since he thought you and nick were dating then why were you the one cheating in his mind esh you because you didnt know what to say to her how about be honest shes nice youre enjoying spending time with her but kids are a dealbreaker for you so lets not waste both our time just as casually as she mentioned having a child you could have just countered with you being,Mentalcomposer
sure that you dont want kids and that its unfair to both of you to continue this as a romantic thing her for waiting weeks to let you know about her child she should def be more upfront with that info either a guy wont care and continue dating to see how it goes or she wont waste her time with guys who are opposed to kids what would she do if she finds a guy she really likes and he isnt ok with kids shes setting herself up for hurt i agree she needs a man who will love her and her child but she has to weed out the ones that dont want kids first how in 11 years do you still not know his exact views on marriage thats a conversation you have to have if he says he doesnt want marriage then you go your separate ways and find someone who does if he says he believes in marriage but never got around to it mainly because you havent talked,Mentalcomposer
about it didnt push the issue etc then you tell him to get a ring and youre planning a wedding stop sitting around waiting for things that you dont express you want if your ex was in the bed with them what does she say about it did you tell your ex what your d said about the tickling id tell my d that if anything makes her uncomfortable that she yell and scream her little head off if she kicked up a big enough fuss mom wakes up and sees whats going on id call my lawyer and ask what can be done can you change your agreement that d is never to sleep over this creeps me out he wouldnt come his wife wont let him hes got to forget his other family hers is the only one that matters i sure hope your aunt and grands know all about what his wife said to you tell his side that they can tell him all about the party and to do it,Mentalcomposer
in person and to watch carefully to the wifes reaction at the mention of your name thatll be all the proof they need that your dad is well and good out of your life and why the thing is you just dont like him not you dont like the father he is you dont like him as a person if you met him and he wasnt your dad would you want to be friends with him because once were all adults its less about being parentchild and more about being friends of course parents still think of their kids as kids and kids think of parents as parents but its a more level relationship he came back when you were a young adult on some level you wanted needed him to be the dad that you somewhere in your head had an idealized version of its just taken you a bit longer to realize he is never going to be that person you also have some unresolved feeling of something not really toward your,Mentalcomposer
half bro but toward your dad for favoring him but it still hurts and it hurts on a deep level that you probably buried so as to not rock the boat when he came back into your life so you have to decide if you can accept him warts and all or if you genuinely just dont like him as a person enough to cut contact theres nothing wrong with either decision youve made a good life for yourself despite his non support and youll continue to do so its not an easy decision i wish you peace with whatever you choose thats crazy at least you can escape to the other room what is the temp outside do you at least have a fan i always feel better if a fan is blowing on me basically the games are exactly the same minor leaguers are farm teams for the majors so theres talent there minor leagues are smaller stadiums so less people and they sometimes do some fun stuff between innings theres no,Mentalcomposer
major league team in nj youd have to travel to the bronx in ny for a yankees game or queens in ny for a mets game both sort of far from jersey id suggest if youre in south jersey for anything else to maybe check out a philadelphia phillies game nicer ride to get there and nicer neighborhood i think theres a train there too but i dont know enough about it and if you go you must eat a philly cheesesteak atlantic city is fun beach boardwalk casinos asbury park is cool to walk around and theres usually some kind of concert going on tour the battleship nj the pinelands might be interesting take in a minor league baseball game the jersey shore blue claws you two are so perfectly matched and i dont mean in a good way ill leave it at that but i would have serious reservations that a person who claims to love me could be that cruel this woman was a huge part of your bfs life for,Mentalcomposer
a long time and he at one time loved her too dont forget that part idc what she did back when you were only dating for 6 months she showed up where you were and yelled at you boo hoo had her friends be mean to you on sm aw you must have been traumatized but she was a young woman scared and wanting to be with the person she loved to help alleviate some of her fears do i think he should have went back to her no but a little empathy goes a long way his callousness is just to great for me to ever overlook i dont think she caused you or your bf any irreparable harm that you or him should have demonize her to the extent you both did and even years later this guy has absolutely zero feelings even if not for her personally but for the knowledge that the person he onced love is dying and his only reply is basically i dont care shows his true,Mentalcomposer
character i wouldnt want to be you if you two have a really bad break up he has shown you that once hes done hes done and hell go scorched earth on anyone he did it to her and hell do it to you too since you agree he needs professional help why dont you suggest you will go with him not to a session but more to interview the therapists im sure the therapist would agree to this if you explain he had a bad time last time and is therapy shy because of it so youre trying to help him see they arent all terrible if you can get him started on that road you and him might feel better about him living on his own nta do whats best for your family meaning wife and kids your bro owns a house hes not using he can go live there you are not responsible for taking care of a grown man if your mom is so worried she can become his roommate,Mentalcomposer
if you consider gambling your job then you are a professional gambler she likes you but doesnt want anyone to know if you date shes doesnt want to be your wife men get better looking with age yet you dont think youre good looking youre talking about wifey material which is kind of gross but you want to have a wild phase who thinks like that if it happens it happens i doubt most people plan that out so you just want her to be the start of your wild phase you admit to not being mature enough for a relationship so save the people you are even thinking of dating or having a situationship the trouble she works for your dad if this goes sideways its gonna get ugly for you her and your dad this is a disaster waiting to happen esh just cause youre both too stubborn im sorry but this made me laugh this is such a silly thing to argue about if thats the worst it is in your,Mentalcomposer
marriage consider yourself lucky does it really matter why he doesnt like you smelling of old spice i think youre looking too much into that it is possible that your body chemistry just doesnt go with the old spice smell like how some perfumes just smell awful on some people go back to your own products and move on what i replied to was the assertion that nobody loved the kid enough to set up a college fund thats unfair to a lot of parents who dont have the means i pointed out just my thoughts in regard to that one statement it has nothing to do with should she pay or not you should try moisture wicking underwear thats kind of unfair no do you also feel that low income parents dont love their kids if they cant afford college how about single parent households where dad or mom skipped out how about families where one parent has died and the surviving one is just making ends meet loving your kid is not,Mentalcomposer
dependent on whether you have the means to set up a college fund or outright pay for college nta dad paying his support all these years has nothing to do with paying for college they are 2 separate things unless his divorce says he has to pay his half which i doubt because mom wouldnt be telling son dad has to pay all of it if she knows legally hes on the hook for half because then so is she interesting that kid isnt the least bit pissed at his mom for not having the money for college no threatening to not talk to mom anymore its just dad he seems to think has to fund this endeavor for all those saying dad should have been saving for college nobody mentioned that it seems mom isnt saving either if by age 8 she told the kid to tell that dad had to pay dad is not obligated to pay did we forget that there are lots and lots of families that havent saved any,Mentalcomposer
money for college no one is demonizing them yet because sm makes apparently good money shes obligated for the sole reason that she married the dad dad can continue his support amount for the 4 years that kid is in college but that still isnt going to totally fund the college bill theres also no indication that dad and sm arent going to provide info for fafsa so until that comes out its also a non issue what op is saying and i agree with her is that once the kid has gone thru the college app process and fafsa forms and any scholarships the kid might get shes not paying the bill for his college and she shouldnt have to it doesnt seem like her husband is the one pressuring her to do it its just the ss who she is not obligated to if kid wants to cut dad off over this thats his choice but you still cant blood from a stone if dad doesnt have it he just doesnt have,Mentalcomposer
it can i just point out also that the expected family contribution that you get after fafsa does all its calculations is wildly inaccurate at least for my 3 kids i dont remember the exact numbers but i remember thinking theres no way we have an extra whatever the number was it was in the multiple 10s of thousands i agree with you only on some of these points but i think op should reply back and start a dialogue while i understand the anger of the son thru and after the divorce and the op tried everything he could to see his son until he was so beat down that he stopped at some point he had to get on with his life and at that time he knew his son hated him and never wanted to see him i think he should meet up with the son to see just what he has to say for himself there are a lot of years that the son could have reached out and he,Mentalcomposer
didnt he may be feeling guilt over that or maybe becoming a dad has made him realize the love that a father has for his kids and that his dad did actually love him id want to know if the son actually realizes just how badly he hurt op my biggest fear for op would be that he and his son get back in contact and the op isnt this idealized version of the dad that the son wants him to be when we grow up with our parents we see them and know their morals values ideas on life their sense of humor their politics their faults and strengths and we accept them because all these things we have seen day in and day out and were used to them im afraid that the son will find his dad lacking in some way and reject him again im not sure op will be able to come back from that a second time or we can look at is as trying to be a,Mentalcomposer
bit more equitable to your partner of two years who you would assume you love since youre moving your relationship forward but i guess im an outlier in that thinking gonna have to work on my me first attitude maybe she should start charging him for all the house chores and cooking she does since just because she has sex with him doesnt mean hes entitled to her labor its either a true partnership or its not slightly esh what is it about weddings that make people literally lose their common sense civility and decency i have never in my life heard of getting a dress approved for most normal weddings everyone is told the bridal party color and people just stay away from that in this instance i would have stayed well clear of any shade of green so thats your ah part your brother is the biggest slight ah for going off on you you said youd return the dresses that should have been the end of it and to say that,Mentalcomposer
you bought the same exact dress they did for their d is absurd what are the actual chances of that unless there is literally only one store that you all have to shop at and if by some weird stroke of fate that is what happened you didnt fight about it you just said youd change dresses its not that big of a deal but then he brought your mom into it if he has a problem with her dress he should address it with her and then he got mean toward you with the name calling your mom is slightly the ah for buying a dress with green in it even if its floral there are a million other colors and patterns to choose why that she should just get a diff dress because as i said steer clear of any shade of green this wedding is a nightmare stop asking about it pretend like its a distant cousins event and just show up have you asked him if he is going to,Mentalcomposer
use that money toward rent and bills explain that thats what that money is meant for that you dont mind sharing that expense but you cant do a 5050 split because you dont make as much money suggest splitting your mutual bills by of what each earn and any money you each have left over is your own you live together you both go to school and both work but you do all the household chores why thats something you might want to revise also otherwise you can go back to however you were living before you moved in since you had to have been able to afford that stop being taken advantage of as far as the chores and figure out a mutual agreed fair way of splitting bills stop wasting your time you havent seen her in years and shes dodging you at every turn how old are you if you are of age where you can work then get a job some people have a job as a teen and are,Mentalcomposer
able to at least put some money away but many work while still going to school and use that money as their spending money and save nothing then we graduate hs and if were not going to college we get a job im not sure what your problem is with your parents not leaving you any money are you saying they are both now gone and didnt have any money to leave you in that case you should have known this would happen as you would have seen them struggle to make ends meet if they did have money and didnt leave any to you and left it to others or charity then you should also have some idea why they did that too im gonna need a lot more info to determine if you never worked and lived off your parents or whatever is going on its only been 4 months look at this objectively hes telling you he thinks hes incapable of taking care of a child think about that you may,Mentalcomposer
want to pretend that hes going to get all his issues straightened out and be able to be a participating dad but hes 29 hes been dealing with his issues probably most of his adult life he knows what he can and cant handle believe him and you think youll be ok with raising this child with minimal help from him but it wont just be the child youll have a disabled partner too and you say youre disabled also ofc i have no idea what either of your limitations are but you did lead with that this is not a good long term scenario for either of you nta i have no problem with him paying rent however i do think you should lower it its usually recommended to pay no more than 13 of your take home pay on rent now i realize rent everywhere is so overpriced at this time but i think if you want him to be able to stay sober you need to help alleviate just a little,Mentalcomposer
of the stress that might drive him back to drink if he doesnt have money stress and can actually save some money that could be a big thing just some food for thought but also can you just give the kid some credit for staying sober for a whole year you say youre not proud of him but just you saying it will go a long way he needs support and to feel like what hes doing now is a good thing dont withhold kind words hes sober but probably dealing with his mh issues still i think youd be better off not online dating girls and guys are going to pass right by anyone who is heavier just based on that dont you know everyone is a 10 and deserves a 10 your best bet is to join a club volunteer go out with friends and meet people check out meetup its an online thing where people post meet ups for a specific thing could be a sport a lunch or brunch lectures,Mentalcomposer
etc i def agree your weight will be less an issue once girls get to know you and once you find one dont try to keep her by spending on her that will lead to you getting hurt theres not a lot of strategy when you think about it the only thing id say is if you can afford it dont play the minimum but that doesnt mean you have to play max either i switch up but i always do 3 or 4 spins at a higher price than the minimum then move down and then up maybe if i play 10 or 15 spins and win nothing i move everyone has their faves so heres mine lightning links its a multi denomination with a min 50 i usually play 02 or 05 denom with a total bet of 250 or 5 heavenly treasure is fun because you sometimes get a random bonus but that max is like 8 or something so i go somewhere in the middle i wont win huge but,Mentalcomposer
im ok with that game of thrones for 3 is fun if you get a bonus 88 fortunes diamond is another fave if you get a winning hand with a diamond in the middle row the diamond grows and multiples the win just walk around and choose whatever looks fun to you good luck i hate days when it seems like all i do is lose and then i come upon something new and i live to play another day slight yta we married 34 years ago and i actually thought we got a good deal but when i talk to my 20 something kids whose friends are getting married there is no way we could have afforded our wedding and it was not extravagant by any means so i think you and i just havent been exposed to what things cost in the realm of weddings an example the average price where we live per person for a sit down dinner at a venue is 125 yes i was shocked too and im,Mentalcomposer
pretty sure there is no haggling to be had the price is the price photographers florists and decorators do this for a living they are professionals not people just doing it for extra cash so tell your son you had no idea how expensive things have gotten and you didnt mean to insult him and hes not spoiled and maybe give him another 5000 condolences to you and your daughter id caution you to not rush into anything it has only been 6 months i know everyone grieves differently but i cant imagine that your d is ready to have you dating and you should be sure that you are ready too its perfectly normal to be lonely after losing a spouse but you need to make sure you have processed your wifes death or you will not be a good partner to someone else no woman wants to be a substitute for a dead woman nta it was about time someone had the guts to actually tell her what everyone else has known,Mentalcomposer
for a while shes only 21 so she has time to get her life straightened out obviously she has addiction issues but i dont know why people are jumping to mh issues also she must know she has issues ask her why she hasnt done anything to get help for them have her explain it and then point out the flaws in her explanation and then find a place for her to go yta emy is a bully and a ringleader of the bullies a straight up mean girl and you dont even seem to care well i dont care that she had to sit on the porch you need to sit her down tell her what she did was mean and cruel and she had the nerve to do this in the other girls own home and that at the very least she owes ava a huge apology its ok that these girls dont have the same interests but its not ok that emy thinks its ok to make fun of someone elses,Mentalcomposer
interests and id be having words with the parents of emys friends just so they have an idea what their little angels are doing too ok so you need to find out where his head is at in regard to the baby what does he worry about what are his fears about being a father what does he fear about how or if your relationship will change you need to talk less about how you feel and what you want and more about what he feels and needs about this big upheaval thats happened even tho a baby is a good thing some people woman included are so fearful of the responsibility that they draw into themselves because they dont know how to deal with their fears men may feel they cant be vulnerable about these things their partner will see them as weak so as hard as it is try to put your issues in the back burner for a bit and concentrate on his you cant make someone show you that they,Mentalcomposer
love and want you they either feel that for themselves and act on it or they dont id take a brutally honest assessment of your relationship did his selfishness begin when you got pregnant after the baby was born or does it go back even further what did he used to do that he doesnt now i think youll find he has always been a me first and ill fit you when when i feel like it guy and you might have been ok with that when you had your own stuff going on maybe you worked saw friends whatever and you didnt even realize he wasnt as invested in you as you go back to work full time start making your own money and put the baby in daycare if he balks at that just tell him he needs to pay half and thats the way it is if he doesnt like that he can stay home and care for the baby you need to look out for you the baby and your,Mentalcomposer
future even if that doesnt include the bf stop thinking youre stuck with him just because of the child nta a few things need to happen here bf needs to tell her in as serious a ti e as he can that she needs to stop being so forward hes not interested he will never be interested and its disrespectful to him you and your relationship plus shes embarrassing herself bf needs to block her everywhere there is absolutely no reason she should even have his phone number why does she bf is not her car service she needs to figure out her own rides if she gets brazen and does or says anything when others including your fam is around he needs to say loud and clear to her to stop its getting ridiculous shes embarrassing herself whatever so others can catch on to how shes behaving im guessing your mom doesnt know this is going on you should clue her in even if shes judge mental that judgement should be on your,Mentalcomposer
sis not you or bf you can say innocently oh bf had to block sis because its been going on a while but hes gotten really uncomfortable with it so he did that and then told me if i was you i wouldnt say anything to her it is your bfs issue to fight if you get involved its going to make her think youre jealous or feel threatened by her thats a boost to her ego and shell keep going if she asks you or more likely accuses you of making bf block her just tell her he explained she was crossing lines and boundaries and he was tired of it you had nothing to do with it even if youre not close to your sis i wouldnt cut her off just limit contact you dont always have to answer every call or text why have any family drama happening its going to escalate and spill over to others at some point shell grow up and stop or get another bf the big,Mentalcomposer
thing for me was when he said he got used to you being gone and that its going to take a while time to build back up the connection really youve been together over a year and while it stinks that you had to be gone the last thing anyone would do is resolve to forget about a partner while theyre off working its not like you just up and went off on a grand adventure and left him home id be counting off the days till my partner came home and i agree that his behavior was and is atrocious you dont need to be made to feel bad for the job you have you should have a partner who misses you when youre gone and makes you feel appreciated when you get home cut him lose you gave him enough time for him to straighten out whatever it is thats going on in his head now he can have all the time to realize what he had no the fitted sheet covers,Mentalcomposer
the mattress then a top sheet lays on top of the fitted sheet and then you put the comforter on top of the top sheet the top sheet helps to keep the comforter from needing to be washed as often because your body isnt touching the comforter im on the fence about this one i theorize with absolutely no hard evidence mind you that since young kids have had screens in front of them since basically toddler age that may have altered their perception they are impatient because everything on a screen is so fast unable to stay on task due to the nature of games constantly changing so they dont have to concentrate too long on one thing and need almost instant gratification at all times because thats what a computer does all these things mimic adhd no that could explain why medication helps them their actual cognition is altered since their young brains are still developing but on the other hand i thought there was proven differences in actual brain chemistry in,Mentalcomposer
adhd people explains why meds help them so some may have adhd by nature and some may develop it by nurture in a way nta its about time someone told leah that your family vacation is not fodder for her social media i would go as far as to tell her no more pics of me ever if she wants to post your bro her bf not a problem but not anyone else as for the party first i would def tell her no phone you will hold it for her for the day or she can leave it in the hotel and no fan girl behavior these are your friends they are not there in a professional setting this is personal if she cannot agree to these boundaries then shes not welcome its may be hard for your friends to even let their guard down with her there anyway they dont know what shes going to spread around and im sure theyve been in that position before and if she gets out of,Mentalcomposer
line speak up dont let her get away with it even once id even tell the friends they can say something also if she does something they dont like so you broke up with ex because she moved now dating new girl but youll be breaking up when you move to the town ex is in ex wants to come but it will upset new girl you dont want to tell ex not to come obviously you dont want to upset the ex because once you break up with new girl and move to exs town you will go from new girl right back to the ex im not sure what that says about you but if i was new girl id break up with you now us too the idea that a relationship is hard work is so odd to me im of the opinion that the right relationship is easy it just works if i have to work at it its not worth it we just do sums it up perfectly nta,Mentalcomposer
you funded the whole party you had everything you needed if someone else bought and brought something i wouldnt be paying for it ive had lots of parties and covered everything if a guest brings something extra drinks desert etc thats meant to be shared with everyone theyve never asked for me to pay for it and i never did ill say this as nice as i can youre are being stupid paying any expenses for someone youve only been with for 4 months is just plain stupid adhering to her demand that you stop hanging out with people because she doesnt like them is just stupid staying with her when she doesnt get her friend to stop disparaging you is stupid putting up with her incessant complaining over little things is just stupid you giving in and giving every minute detail of where you go and with whom is stupid she can do whatever she wants with her room and hygiene but you dont have to go there if youre not comfortable with,Mentalcomposer
it thats you being wait for it stupid what exactly do you love about this girl she is bad for you and to you she basically sits around all day doing nothing and expects you to do what she wants when she wants get out now shes just not a nice person and a horrible gf congratulations thats awesome if youre made to sit thru the dvc pitch its not really bad there is no hard sell so go walk thru the model listen and then make your excuse why you cant buy or maybe you want to but i will say our first stay was in a 1 br at boardwalk that we paid cash for we walked thru the model got the details went home and called a few days later and bought in dont regret it at all and we were an every other year disney fam while the kids were growing up we do other vacations too oddly enough i just saw an interview on a morning news program with,Mentalcomposer
matt damon who said him and ben afflack have set up a production company and the main reason for doing it was that so everyone working on a production would be paid on a more equal basis im not sure how it all works but he did say there is so much bloat and since they know about it they figured out how to cut down on it something about each dept is separate from the others and he said paraphrasing everyone deserves to make more money sorry this is jumbled but it was on nbc ny this morning if you want to see it so if a few more of the more wealthy actors and actresses did that more non acting production people would want to work with them they could revise the whole system edited had the wrong network sorry i hate putting it this way but your financial support of them is your leverage you can basically sit them down tell them whatever you want them to know about how you,Mentalcomposer
live your life and if they give you any push back you cut off the funding is that mean sure and they can be mad what good is that going to do for them and if it somehow comes out so what you tell them its their fault that you had to resort to keeping your life secret because of the things they have done while you were growing up but they have to realize at some point that you are an adult who can make the choices you want and they have to come to terms with the fact that however they raised you has forced you to be so secretive but it also made you a responsible adult one who is supporting them if you can your drive when the kids would normally sleep that gives you a few good hours to get on the road we tried to time it so theyd wake up when it was time to stop for breakfast so if you leave at like 11 or midnight,Mentalcomposer
once they wake up and you get some food its only 5 or 6 hours left to go then theyre happy after a good sleep they can watch a movie or play games on a device that only lasts so long so things like mad libs was fun cause it kept all of us involved we did a lot of trivia on a game boy id ask the qs but the 3 yo cant really do that but you can make up your own qs for them based off of what they like things like what is the monkeys name in dora the explorer did i just date myself haha or whatever they like it might actually be good for him to live with friends is hes a bit of a peter pan let them show him how much responsibility it is to live on his own hell get used to cleaning up after himself doing his own laundry cooking for himself etc things he may be under a false impression that you would,Mentalcomposer
do for him since youre the woman and his mom probably did for him if thats the case if you want to buy a place i think you should do it this should be solely your decision buy where you want to live living on your own will also show you what its like to be responsible for the whole place but id caution you to not let your place become his place ofc he can stay over sometimes but dont make it every day and dont get into a routine of him coming over every day and you cooking for him iow dont do living together things all the time if youre not actually living together if it turns out that you two move in together then you can figure out at that time if the area you buy in works for both of you plus if he annoys you you always have a place to go back to im curious if the cruise was full im not sure i could handle a,Mentalcomposer
lot of sea days if the ship was crowded how long are you together nta i think i must have missed something here your 44 yo bf got pissy because you couldnt see him on friday night because you didnt feel well but youve been seeing him every fri mon since youve been dating what is wrong with him id expect a child to throw a tantrum when theyre looking forward to something and then it doesnt happen but not a grown man and who has a birthday weekend at his age and you didnt have any real plans except of course his end of the week hour long massage i wouldnt even bother contacting him he can get over his tantrum and apologize or he can get lost you are a fantastic artist nta its perfectly ok for you to have a solo or even a guys trip without her and she can do the same time doing something for yourself does not mean you dont prioritize the relationship it means that you,Mentalcomposer
prioritize your well being and enjoyment for a week out of your relationship what shes saying is if you go on this trip you wont have enough money to take her on the lavish trips you have in the past you wont have as much money to spend even tho you split the cost she says her gfs wont go but she hasnt even asked them take the cruise treat yourself and enjoy yta first off hes not your child you are his stepmom he has a mom second psych isnt a bad degree as long as he realizes that he cant be an actual therapist if he doesnt get his masters at least in my state i actually think there is going to be an explosion in the therapy field third you know the kid is not thrilled with you why in the world would you say anything about his future plans nod and say that sounds great youll be a great therapist well miss you when you go to college stop making,Mentalcomposer
problems and then claiming to be the victim reddit coins arent in any way shape or form crypto they are coins that can be bought and used solely to gift to other reditt posters for posts or comments they make they signify things like great advice wholesomeness etc so your ex from 8 years ago who has a partner and a child gets in touch for the purpose of having sex and youre entertaining this idea why why would you want to be someones plaything i would be so insulted and im not sure why you arent and didnt tell him to get lost nta honestly why are you even going to this wedding you knew this girl in college havent stayed in any sort of close contact its nice that you called when she got engaged but thats as far as it should have gone im trying to figure out why youd want to spend money on an event when afterward you will go back to being basically no contact with this person,Mentalcomposer
same as it was for the past few years you already wasted money on a big that you didnt go to why waste more nta news flash they are annoyed with you nta but only because im wasnt thrilled with leaving my kids in the house with friends at that age if i wasnt there either didnt matter the sex just too many things that could happen power goes out someone gets hurt they decide to make food etc but you did say they were going to play video games and you said that was in the lr where you have cameras so that would have been ok i dont think youre worried about pregnancy or even intercourse at this age but kids are curious and who knows what they could get up to but i will say you need to talk to your son about girls sex consent all of it he is not too young at all if hes as responsible as you say then give him the knowledge to be responsible,Mentalcomposer
you and your partner are what real love is give him a huge hug and kiss i wish you all the best but is it homophobic when op said in another comment that the wife didnt allow girls to sleepover before he came out i think its more that mom doesnt want to think that her teenager is having sex with anyone in the house doctor said she probably had it for a couple months not years theyve been together 6 months op says she knows bf passed it to her my reply is based on what she said nta at all this is your home too you go put your photos up shes being ridiculous what diff does it make when the photos were taken tell her youd love to put up family photos only from when you two met but since your parents arent here anymore thats gonna be impossible so should your parents never be displayed in your home your friends are your family will she never allow baby pics to,Mentalcomposer
be displayed how about your college diploma those was pre her how did you marry a girl who isnt mature enough to realize that your life didnt begin when you met her nta why is he not an ex already you have absolutely nothing zero nada to feel guilty for so he gives you an std and then told you it isnt his fault when it most obviously is his fault this is the first time you should have broke up with him then it gets worse hes tired of your problems that you couldnt blame him or bother him about it well if he didnt give you an std you wouldnt have this problem this is the seco d time you should have broken up with him get rid of him hes not worth any of this crap and he thinks sex is so important and not getting enough well thats why he has an std to begin with hes not very responsible with his own sex life hes not going to be,Mentalcomposer
with yours it anyone elses that still doesnt tell me what your mom wanted you to do did she want you in the home when the cleaners come since thats the only thing going on today im assuming she scheduled her dentist around that appt since she was the one who scheduled the cleaners so she was planning on being in the house anyway or does she want you to be there but didnt bother to tell you until today honestly tho deep cleaning the house before a party is a waste the party is in the yard so the only time ppl will be in the house is to use the bathroom really i have a relative who lives in easton and works in the city they take the bus its 90 minutes but they also have a start time of 7730 so i think theres less traffic earlier but the bus is at least a relaxing ride assuming youd be driving 78 i wouldnt drive all the way to newark to then,Mentalcomposer
take the train you might be better off driving to a closer nj train station to where you live and taking the train from there parking would probably be cheaper and youd almost certainly encounter worse traffic the further east you go on 78 get a nj transit schedule and see what the cost is from a few stations then look up parking rates and see how long the trip would be its not cheap tho our tix from central jersey are almost 30 round trip but a monthly pass will be discounted and parking here is a monthly thru the town so its also cheaper than daily but thats a resident rate also the commute is doable but you have to mentally be prepared for it day in and day out i need info it depends on what your mother wanted you to do the tent table and chairs are all set up youre not responsible for cooking food decorations cant be done today so what did she want you to do bridal,Mentalcomposer
shower things or general house things or something else nta so you have no contact with brother and you see your mom only when hes not around and he sees your mom only when youre not around that all sounds perfectly fine to me now as for nephews you really dont have to get gifts for them for the reason that you dont have a relationship with your brother i highly doubt those kids miss one gift from a person that they havent seen in over a year and might not even remember you exist nevermind why he does this does he ever say what he actually does like about you just tell him you dont like that he doesnt like you so youre cutting him loose to go find his tight glutted straight toothed skinny fit girl with blonde hair nta this is an amy problem she wouldnt have a good time if you go but you would have been just fine so she should have stayed home im taking bets amy is,Mentalcomposer
interested in paul and didnt want you there theyll be dating when they get home as it is now all three of you are each paying a third of the mortgage in an empty house that you all own equally you all own it equally thats the key if your sister lives in the house you all still need to pay one third of the mortgage because you all still own the house equally your sisters idea that she shouldnt be paying anything toward the mortgage makes no sense at all she still is obligated for her third of ownership therefore one third of the mortgage but if one is living in the house they should be paying all the utilities since they are the only one using them im curious what you three are going to do with this house in the future once the mortgage is paid off only one of you can actually live in it so unless that person can buy out the others youre going to have to sell,Mentalcomposer

your kids dont think its there fault that they cant see their friends honestly you need to let him go as a partner im dont know why he would even want to stay hes done nothing wrong and youve consistently treated him like trash its going to be very hard for him to trust you and even if he doesnt say it it will manifest in other ways stay single or dont commit to one person if you have to date that way you can do what you want with who you want as long as everyone knows thats the deal its only been 2 months in therapy do you really think thats enough time to say youve got it all figured out you may know what the underlying issues are but it seems your need to step out on a partner comes from how you feel about yourself you need to get to a place where youre ok with you before you can be ok with a partner good for you you look,Mentalcomposer
great nta if she knew how much money you made then she had this planned figured youd be so enamored with her youd agree since you were already living together just tell her youre not supporting her at all not fully not helping with rent when shes short nothing but a reasonable split whatever you agree to if she balks even slightly go get an apt by yourself or break up and move wherever you want do not let her goad you into giving her time to find another job that will not be happening and whatever you do do not get her pregnant id actually not even have sex with her unless she has a job but im overly cautious do not ignore your instinct on this one you knew it was too soon but you did it anyway yta just for having a 1030 curfew for a 17 yo and then also for tracking her every movement find out what her best friends curfew is and adopt the same one that way,Mentalcomposer
theres always someone else heading home at the same time as your d you say the river is dodgy but you then want your d to make her way home all by herself because none of her other friends are going to leave so early she has a higher chance of something happening to her if shes by herself were you long distance for the whole 4 years just do a mock booking on each cruise line site youll almost for sure have to do a 34 or 5 day and youll all have to share a cabin but you probably will only use it to shower and sleep so it may be tight but its doable keep in mind this is what youll have to pay base cruise fare taxes and port fees daily gratuities these are extra drink pkg any specialty dining keep in mind most people give their room steward an extra cash tip at the end of the cruise you dont have to its totally up to you so id,Mentalcomposer
check carnival ncl and royal caribbean the advantage to ncl is that your drink pkg is sort of included where you pay the 20 gratuity amount based off the full price of what the pkg would cost and youll get at least 1 specialty dining restaurant included again you pay just the gratuity carnival is fun but the drink pkg cost will probably put you over the budget for example a 3 day pkg is close to 200 i havent been on royal for a long while so i cant say anything about them also check out each ship some are smaller without all the stuff rock walls go carts etc if you just want to get away lay by the pool have some drinks visit an island or two to go lay in a beach youll should be able to find something that keeps getting said but the reality is that you just cant expect two teen girls to become fast friends just because their parents marry each parent should have been having,Mentalcomposer
continued conversations with their child and they should have been having ongoing talks with the others child also and they should have been having talks with all of them together and since theyre not averse to therapy they should have gotten some guidance there too op says his d was handling the transition ok but was she really maybe not if an argument over bread turns into insults and he says the step d was not no wonder remember this girl was moved to a new house probably a new school left all her old friends behind they are the same age so the same grade except d has been in this school has her friends and social life all ready in place and since sd was having a tough time she gets sent to therapy how did that make her feel and everyone thinks that isnt going to cause a conflict the girls should have been spending so much time with each other that any kind of issues would have come out and,Mentalcomposer
they could have been dealt with so no the kids dont dictate what the parents do but the parents needed to ensure a smooth transition for everyone and im not sure they did i think they thought there would be some bumps along the way but ill bet they werent expecting the girls to viciously go after each other so whats done is done but now the girls need someone to counsel both of them about how they can be respectful and civil to each other because if they dont figure it out the parents marriage will not last neither one will allow their child to be the victim of the other one most im gonna say i doubt that find better people even small colleges are big i wouldnt because i wouldnt even engage with someone with that view were you trying to change their mind why bother nta hes a grown man give him a list of all the doctors phone numbers and tell him to schedule and take care of his,Mentalcomposer

the only way i dont understand yet again why parents blend families when they know that one or more of the kids is not happy about it now they are stuck with this mess get both girls into therapy together they dont have to be even friends but they have to find a way to have some semblance of a respectful civil relationship she has basically told you that she doesnt want kids in a round about way forward sure but that comes from her knowing that this relationship will end if she tells you outright and she doesnt want that you can spend the next how ever many years together hoping shell change her mind but if she doesnt and finally gets around to being brutally honest with you you both will have wasted those years together she could change her mind but you need to decide if this is something you are willing to chance do you really want a child with someone who doesnt want them and is only having them,Mentalcomposer
to satisfy you what kind of mom is she going to be in that scenario she wont do the same to him cause hes a dr and has money shes an ex so i dont really know why you even care what she has to say unless the reason shes your ex is because she didnt want you to help your sister ever and you refused in that case good riddance ill be the downer sorry maybe its not that youre too comfortable but maybe its that youre both trying desperately to hang onto something that just isnt there anymore too many down times have worn you both out and neither of you have the will to fight back up to the good times so youre trying to force it with romance youre both not happy have nothing to talk about and dont enjoy each other and no amount of romantic gestures is going to change that you can try but she needs to be gesturing also why does it have to be you,Mentalcomposer
it reads as if shes looking for you to make her happy and feeling loved instead of both of you being happy and feeling loved it cannot be one sided im just curious who ties your shoes they do make no tie shoelaces if you think that would be something you want to try since its not just shoes maybe theres an issue with your fine motor skills or is it gross motor not sure if you have any physical therapists that work at your school maybe you can ask them nta has your sil never realized your d has the developmental capacity of a 3 or 4 yo shes obviously been around your d for the last 19 years does she think shes just going to magically outgrow her autism meet a boy get married and have children i commend you for doing what is really the best for your d why should she suffer but especially that she cannot understand why ok good i feel better for you so basically you allowed,Mentalcomposer

excuse in the book in order to not see that he is just a shtty bf you dont want to admit it because you think that will reflect badly on you that you picked the worst bf and stayed for years and how could you have been so stupid but every single person on this thread has given you the same advice and that is to not take him on vacation and to get rid of him and you know why because we collectively the women and also the men of reditt have had multiple years of dating experience we have gone thru done been there went back again and tried it all over again and we can tell you he is not ever going to change please listen to the universe you dont want some things to change you want a completely different boyfriend and you really should find one this guy is horrible did it really take you two years to realize that you do so much more for him than he,Mentalcomposer
ever did for you i think youre making a huge mistake taking him on this trip find a friend and take them someone who will pay their half and actually enjoy spending time with you because it doesnt seem like your bf is all that into you nta for saying no why do his friends even want to stay at your apt i wouldnt all i can think of is that my home would turn into party central but its not a stupid q because its also his home so he has the right to ask and at least he did ask do we really want to start this he packs it gets some things done thru the courts then when the presidency changes party they pack it even more get a few things done and rinse and repeat until when you didnt even advocate for what you wanted to eat why not thats on you if a date told me to order x and i wanted y id just say no i dont,Mentalcomposer
want that im getting y if he argues with me over it then hes not for me is he just stingy with money who knows you can continue seeing him for a few more dates but id keep it casual for now see if there are any other odd behaviors its fine if you dont want to date right now but the idea that you have nothing to offer a partner comes off as you arent happy with yourself so dont date continue finding yourself and along the way you will find if not a passion at least a hobby or activity that will make you happy once that happens you may or may not want to find someone to share yourself with do you really not know that being yelled out insulted and a door slammed on you is abuse are you waiting for it to escalate even further and he did this in front of his crying child seeing that didnt even make him stop hes a horrible person he needs to,Mentalcomposer
get help for his childhood baggage hes carrying around and then flinging at you its been 6 months cut your losses get out and never look back nta does your dad know that you want to work on your relationship with just him and that right now shes an impediment to that that you want to go one step at a time plus your mom is at the party im sure she doesnt want to see the affair partner there she probably would prefer hes not even there so tell him this is the best you can do at this time youre at least working on it he doesnt seem to be doing anything you know things arent going to change by the end of the year if he were planning anything more permanent his answers would have been more along the lines of that hes got a timeline not to worry hes thinking toward the future etc why should he change anything about his life at home his mom takes care of all,Mentalcomposer
the mundane chores he has no expenses and he gets to see you on the weekend to do stuff with he knows if you two move in hell have to contribute money and do chores be careful what you wish for if you move in with him youll be the one taking care of him and all the housework as great as he is do you want to be doing that wait you have a five year old and a dead bedroom for the past 5 years ive had kids and sure the sex was lagging a bit after each one for a little while but it never stopped completely never to be had again ask her why shes so averse to even discussing this issue if you say you communicate so well i honestly believe my h wouldnt have left me over no sex but he sure as hell would have needed to have at the very least a reason for why and id feel as though id owe him one for me,Mentalcomposer
thats an absolute never gonna happen would you even feel comfortable being with another man while being watched id never be able to get into it but i also view sex as private its not a spectator sport that being said there are people who find that exciting and a turn on and theres nothing wrong with that if thats you then go for it nta for not clearing it with your d but when its brought to your attention that shes feeling some way about the situation why wouldnt you just ask her whats going on not to ask permission more to alleviate whatever she is having trouble with ignoring your ds angst isnt going to be good for a relationship with her going forward and ifwhen this relationship ends you will have changed and possibly ruined the relationship you have with your d do you really want to take that chance nta go on the trip with your family it will mean a lot to your parents i know this cause im,Mentalcomposer
trying to plan a fam trip with my adult kids and its also a cruise plus your bf is 25 hes old enough that he shouldnt be pouting about his bday youll be home early enough to hang out with him stop not blaming him you have been with this man a year and still havent met his best friend enough times that she would give you a heads up about a party shes throwing him even if you two dont get along you should have been invited if he valued you as much as a year king relationship should he would have made apologies at the party and come to you the fact that he had no idea why you would be upset is staggering what the heck did he think you were going to do the night you had plans once he cancelled them hes not that invested in you im sorry to say i wouldnt waste any more time on him esh you deleted kyle off fb but did you ever,Mentalcomposer
actually tell him that what he said was rude offensive and uncalled for then you told chase you wouldnt travel with those two except for birthdays or their wedding why the exceptions id never want to be around those two chase took that as youre really not serious about not being around kyle chase is because he invited two people you dont like on a vacation without talking to you about it thats common courtesy you cant realistically stop them from booking but it might have been early enough for you to cancel and make other plans if the cruise is in a few weeks you cant cancel or youd lose a lot of money id still go but i wouldnt be anywhere near kyle or steve no dining together no excursions no hanging out at all and id let chase know that if he wants to hang with you and your wife if the others show up youre leaving once is an accidentgetting caught up in the moment two more times is intentional,Mentalcomposer
i say you should look for a used mazda 3 we had 3 still going strong until a month ago a 20102014 and 2017 older ones passed to kids when h bought a new one the 2010 was running fine but oldest traded it in for another model mazda these cars last with no major issues for us i will forever recommend this car but also call your insurance before actually purchasing to make sure of the monthly payment dont want any surprises and idk how you blew an engine but if it was something you did dont do that again please nta i dont think randy thought it would embarrass zach but now that he knows he wont do it again or at least until the girl jokes stop which is really a crappy thing to say you didnt tell your son to tamp down his out and proud gayness i hope that didnt come out as rude not meant to you just told him he should be a bit more mindful of,Mentalcomposer
zachs feelings zach is still feeling out how much and what public displays he is comfortable but if randy knows that zach is getting some slack he should have known this wouldnt go over well but theyre young and will learn and may need some guidance just like any other teen couple they do they make mistakes they learn and grow from it the thing with the auto gratuity is that you can have it removed at guest services on the ship this is what royal says about the auto grat according to royal caribbean gratuities are shared among dining bar culinary services staff stateroom attendants and other hotel services teams who work behind the scenes to enhance the cruise experience that being said if you remove the auto grat please tip these people whatever you are comfortable with but know that there may be ppl that you never see that might be included that will then miss out and the grat on any drinks purchased without having purchased the drink pkg is basically,Mentalcomposer
the tip you would give to a bartender or server kind of like everywhere else so you get your drink and dont have to give them a dollar or whatever now if you buy the drink pkg you pay the gratuity up front which again just means you dont have to give the server the dollar or so you are free to do it of course and some do and some dont as for specialty dining if you went out to eat wouldnt you tip your server most people usually tip at least 20 so the 18 isnt that bad nta why didnt you really mean what you said you are absolutely correct in what you said if his position is the male should be the providers and that the man pays for the woman and carry the burden then thats what he should be doing i cant believe he doesnt realize what hes saying as he isnt the provider hes not paying for you and he has no burdens to carry nothing wrong,Mentalcomposer
with you working and him staying home whatever works for a couple is good for them its his attitude thats messed up his friend calling you saying you were too hard on him can take care of bf with kid gloves all he wants now let him stay gone for a bit he might realize hes not as alpha his definition of alpha as he pretends to be yta i didnt even read the whole thing after realizing youre probably close to 40 if not older your gf is 27 and the first few lines of how nuts she is i didnt need any more info and based on the last paragraph you have a savior complex ditch the gf pay attention to your children and find a hobby instead of trying to fix the girl as your hobby really this isnt a hard decision go back to medical just tell them youre worried the headache is lasting so long better to be safe im surprised they didnt tell you to come back for,Mentalcomposer
a check in the following day i hurt myself on a ship and they had me come in every day to for a check in the things they were looking for were obvious signs that something was going more wrong so it seemed like overkill to me id be able to see and feel what they were looking for you dont have to justify anything tho you both know this marriage has not been working for a long time so her saying horrible things about you while hurtful to you really doesnt help or hurt your divorce case if anything she wrote show any kind of abuse emotionally or financially keeping that to yourself could be one of the grounds for a divorce you may be able to get a slightly better settlement due to that for instance if she says im keeping him around to support me while enjoying other men and i love seeing him miserable as i go out on dates maybe financial abuse maybe emotional i really do t know,Mentalcomposer
the answer to that tho ask a lawyer you cannot do this alone anyway might as well get professional advice consultations are usually free use them see more than one lawyer some may be more of a pit bull type wants to win but more so want to destroy the other side i wouldnt do that dont show her what you have go for the separation it might give her the push she needs to get a job which would help you financially in a divorce if she at least had some income and once youre separated go about your life knowing its only a matter of time until youre divorced and free to find your happiness that may be with another partner or even by yourself see a lawyer ask what the divorce might look like financially for you so that youre not blindsided with the lawyer try to figure out an equitable settlement and when youre ready present it to your now separated wife make it at least fair enough that she,Mentalcomposer
wont deny all of it but leave some room for negotiation youre very young still if hes this irrational now it will be worse if you marry him he is going to be gone to uni for a while how is he going to monitor your every move are you supposed to walk around with a camera so he can see where and what you do every second of every day but yet he doesnt have to account for anything that doesnt sound right to you does it forget the sex thing i realize it will weigh heavy on you but you need to come to terms with that aspect youll find a good guy who either doesnt care or who also has had premarital sex and that guy will not abuse you hurt you and try to control your every move you have to realize that nobody in a committed relationship wants to feel like they have to constantly reassure their partner whether that be that they love them are in for the,Mentalcomposer
long haul need assurances they are their number one etc its exhausting you wanted your partner to be your number one cheerleader yet you barely did anything to make her feel like she even mattered her promotion didnt matter only the co workers did therapy is good for you to know where your insecurities come from but you havent put anything you learned into practice why should she stay let her go she needs time to build herself back up because you sure knocked her down enough work on you if not to get back with this woman but for any future partners you will have what do you want us to revolt over are you willing to start this revolt there are two very large sides to every issue you will never get a big enough percentage of the population that agrees with more than one issue to have an effective revolt lets complain about gun violence and then propose a revolt which by its very nature needs armed people no thank you,Mentalcomposer
id rather keep on trying to change whatever i disagree with by working the system if thats voting or lobbying or hell even running for office in some capacity than have to live thru violence in the streets in every state or storming govt buildings or kidnapping and holding representatives hostage or whatever other means you think a revolt will look like do you want to live thru that what if you dont live thru that if your parents or kids dont lets at least pretend were a more civilized society then that please shes not thats just a fact wishing wont change that so your other comments indicate you have zero experience with anything sex related kissing making out foreplay without penetration is something most of us do as teens while dating thats how we learn so either start doing those things or let her go shes gonna get tired of the rejection you need to tell her at this point shes got to be wondering whats wrong with her that youre not,Mentalcomposer
sexually into her if you keep pulling back shes gonna break up with you if she feels youre not into her honesty is your friend nta youre way more nice than i would ever be what he wrote is disgusting and inexcusable i would have just put him out with nothing let his sister pay his fare home this guy was bad news from the jump you never even met and let him move in you had no idea who he really was did you really agree to just have him show up and do nothing while you supported him does your gf know youre a virgin and that youre nervous make sure you are completely comfortable with your gf work up to it do everything else then let her take the lead itll be a gradual lead up to actual piv sex she knows what shes doing but make sure you let her know if you dont like something shes doing stop worrying if youll be good enough and honestly you probably wont,Mentalcomposer
be but at first thats just due to your inexperience in time you two will forge your own satisfying sex life funny how he notices when you purchase a big ticket item for your enjoyment but doesnt notice when you could be going months without purchasing anything for yourself and thats what you need to explain to him not that you should even have to you wanted something that cost more than one month if your fun money so you had to forego your fun spend until you saved up it would be the same as if you bought a new chair one month the pc the next and the desk the next and gtfoh with his stupid buzz words what even is financial infidelity nta this is not normal behavior for a 17 yo why cant he live with his dad millions of kids have parents that go thru a divorce and dont need to live elsewhere why are they treating him with such kid gloves just leave your h isnt supporting you,Mentalcomposer
and id say being just as disrespectful as his brother was he just supposed to sit around and wait for when you decide you want to be with him you are the one who told him you couldnt date him when he asked why did he do it if he liked you so much because you rejected him and she was there and he wanted to so really if you would have just started dating him he wouldnt have been with her its been 2 years move on from this stop asking about it it really isnt your business anyway well not good that hes in jail but good that you visited im sure the message was to let you know he appreciates the visit i think the problem is that although you were together you were separated by distance when you date someone who you can freely see a few times a week you get to really seethat person you see how they live you see how they interact with their friends and,Mentalcomposer
family you see how they deal with stress and problems that come up you two know each other im sure but seeing the other is a diff perspective you two didnt get to do that the 3 weeks you spent together was like a vacation everyone on their best behavior now that you are living together you both are seeing the nitty gritty of each other it may be growing pains or it may be an indication that you two arent compatible idk what the small stuff is that youre arguing about but would it help if you have house rules chore charts and maybe even nights after work that you not spend together one of you stay in the lr one in the br just to give you each time to gradually get used to the other person always being there whatever the small stuff was make sure you completely resolved them and theyre not lingering do you see any kind of a future with someone who is this gullible really shell always,Mentalcomposer
be looking for the next get rich scam i wouldnt give her any money and i wouldnt pay for anything for her but id also break up with her yeah i found the idea that italy doesnt have lines odd ill wait my turn whatever im on line for will still be there when i get there nta you need to remind your bro and especially his gf that this is your and your other bros home they are guests if they dont like what goes on in it they might want to find another place to live youve been gaming before they got there and youll be gaming long after they finally get their adult lives on track free speech just means you can say anything you want it doesnt mean you are free from the consequences of what you say if social media wants to allow anything what are the chances that the whole platform will be taken over by either side i would think there are more users to any sight,Mentalcomposer
that are not extreme in their views and arent most sm platforms friend based where you are linked to your friends not like reditt where you can basically see anybodys posts in that case most people wont be seeing extremist posts unless they are friends with the person posting if they get through you block or mute it unfollow it whatever if the banter does i fact go back and forth then id say nah im guessing that your friend has moved to europe not that you moved to the us so its possible that she really is struggling with the cultural differences and even if its just silly banter to you id guess she may feel a bit ganged up on because there are 2 of you against her one so her misconceptions are pointed out way more than you and your friends if you sincerely enjoy this friend it might be worth it to message her and explain that any slights werent meant to hurt her you thought she knew that see,Mentalcomposer
what she says she may be really struggling and not know how to tell you for fear youll either make fun of her or not want to be her friend anymore and then id stop the banter thank you ill be in mostly big cities im not an aggressive person so ill line up and see how it goes while i agree wherever you go its better to adjust to how they do things it makes sense really but if everyone just rushed to the front of a line what does that look like is it really just a fight for who can push past first ill be in italy later this year so id really like to know do i really just walk to the front of any line are there any rules or social norms i need to know that you can share so i dont look like the rude american bravo well wellwell thatll do it conveniently left that out now did she you dont you should have been gone literally,Mentalcomposer
the day you found out what are you thinking why would you want to be with this person we are all trying to figure out what exactly you want us to tell you because any woman with any sense would have been gone you are 20 hes not the love of your life obviously cry yell curse his name eat lots of chocolate or ice cream whatever but do not even think about contacting him or anyone who knows him give yourself a week and then pick yourself up and start living your life do not let him take another minute if your time did she say why you are not invited did your bf tell sis hes not happy about that decision do you two not get along there has to be more to this where are you going to run to are you going to keep the baby if you are how are you going to support both of you rent childcarefood utilities is there a dad who is going to help,Mentalcomposer
you you need to think long and hard about what the future is going to look like whatever decision you make its up to you if you want to push this issue you can keep making your own foodbut id be making sure everyone knows mom isnt as accomodating to her own d as she is to the in laws gee wouldnt it be nice if mom liked me as much as you bil shes so thoughtful of your allergy or when youre invited you can ask what shes making and if its not something you can eat just keep declining it sucks cause im sure its fun to be around everyone but maybe shell get the message when her family isnt all together youre nta for getting upset but what did your mom say when you asked her 2 adults get the 2 meal dining package only if those 2 adults are booked as guests 1 and 2 in the same balcony or above cabin you were guest 1 in an interior cabin,Mentalcomposer
with a child you get 1 dining because you are the only adult your wife was guest 1 in a balcony cabin with a child she gets 2 dining because she is the only adult in the cabin that mix up is absolutely not ncls fault you misunderstood how that works im not sure what the problem with the internet pkg was did you buy a pkg before you left did you not know how to log in did you not understand that it was for 1 device did you know that you could have shared 1 internet pkg between devices as long as there is only 1 person logged in at a time you would have been ok what were all of you doing on your phones at the same time and slow internet really is nothing new on cruise ships i dont do the arcade so i wont comment on that but i do know that it too can be purchased pre boarding each line has different policies before i ever book,Mentalcomposer
a new cruise line i make sure i read everything i can so i know exactly what im in for everything you encountered has been discussed many times on many diff places online what you should do dont contact her dont chase her you reached out the first time if she wants this to work she will reach out to you she doesnt want to deal with a problem but you can drive her to work do you see a pattern everything is on her terms when do you get to dictate the terms id consider it over just because you love her doesnt mean shes good for you you need someone who will talk to you to solve a problem that is not her she likes to blame you and just wait till it gets forgotten until the next time this is a very dramatic response to basically what reads like i got rejected by my crush so ill martyr myself and get sterilized and live as a hermit sorry it seems so,Mentalcomposer
over the top im not sure how youre going about meeting someone but heres a thought if youre doing online dating what does your profile look like dont focus on the negative like never been in a relationship play up your strengths what you like to do in your spare time music you like places youd like to travel to show that you are an interesting person your pics should be you smiling laughing having fun even being goofy dont stick with your usual type you say you meet average inexperienced guys go outside your regular go for the extroverted has lots of friends goofy life of the party type go for the guy who has an unusual hobby pick an intellectual pick a guy who is out of your level whos to say what your level is anyway basically whoever matches with you and doesnt give off serial killer vibes meet for coffee during the day you may be narrowing your choices too much find the diamond in the rough give it a,Mentalcomposer
year and see where that gets you but change your mopey woe is me attitude you may think you hide it but it will come through nta what do they want you to do at their house you just buried your last parent its been months of turmoil for you and everyone you need time time to grieve heal and get back to your own life telling them your list of reasons will only inflame them if thats ok with you then go ahead but do you really want to be fighting with your sib right now just make up excuses every time they invite you there is no normal but i think this is way too much time together do you or her have any other friends when do you spend time with them when do you just spend time doing nothing tv reading homework i cannot even imagine what you two would have to talk about when you see each other if youre texting all day long get a hobby tell her,Mentalcomposer
to get a hobby not the same one and start having your own life separate from your gf tell her you dont want to see her every day not because you dont like her but because its just too much and youre going to get sick of each other i was just going to type the same exact thing there is no reason why she shouldnt work after marriage until they buy a house and have kids she thinks they have so much money but shes taking about a wedding a house and a child and probably an engagement ring also and id bet she wants all these things pretty soon just so she doesnt have to work can her bf even afford to support all that probably not at 22 let him stay thats all you have to do go get his stuff from home that he wants to save and maybe store it for him once he leaves for the marines tell your bro hes an awful father for fighting with his,Mentalcomposer
child idc who they each think started it he is the one person who his son should never ever have to worry about getting violent with him and i know it happens in families but this reads like it was a first nta you at least were trying to find a compromise where you could be at both things she didnt want to hear anything if it wasnt you choosing her completely i dont have a problem with you yelling it happens to all of us has she never had anyone raise their voice to her you didnt scar her for life you werent disrespectful in what you yelled you didnt call her names you raised your voice to be heard understood and trying for a solution all of which she didnt want to hear her only solution is you skip the wedding not exactly a compromise as important as her grad was to her your cousins wedding was as important to you is it disappointing you couldnt make her ceremony and lunch sure,Mentalcomposer
but in life sometimes there are disappointments and we deal with them and move on as for the friends you know they didnt get the absolute truth of the story right maybe send one text to all of them laying out how it all went down and then block everyone she was afraid to see you but then expected you to show up even after you sent her back her stuff what planet is she on thinking you two were even together still and she was going to apologize but couldnt but she could give your number to all her friends to relay this message instead of using one of their phones count your lucky stars you got out a partnership is not choose me at all times no matter what else is happening its i know im your number one but others are important people in our individual lives and we cannot discount everyone and everything else nta shes being ridiculous she has got to see that your kids are just too big,Mentalcomposer
for their ages id get the pediatrician to explain to wife that your kids are unhealthy not just bigger id also have a chat with the kids themselves the 8 yo might not understand it fully but certainly the 11 and 9 yo are capable of recognizing that they are bigger than their peers and id bet theyre not happy about it explain the food rules at bils for when they will be staying there and ask them to try it out and see how they feel about it they might surprise you when you get back from your trip and want to begin a more healthy way of eating never mind the ones who have paid their loans how is this proposal supposed to go forward is the bigger issue fed loans are capped for each year of undergrad i think the amount is 37500 so youre not financing your whole degree with fed loans anyone who has more loan debt than that has taken out private loans those will never ever go,Mentalcomposer
away be lowered and i have absolutely no sympathy for anyone who took private loans sorry but you knew if nothing else the high interest rate of this loan do students who just graduated this may get the forgiveness they havent even started paying yet how about the students just starting college in sept do they take the loans for the next 4 years and they also get a reduction 4 yrs from now and where does the fed govt get the money to make these loans when the idea is that the repayment of loans go toward funding the new loans look it sounds great on paper its a great campaign promise but it just is not feasible in the real world i know college is expensive i put 3 thru and yes they all have these loans heres a better idea make it a law that every college and uni have to use a percentage portion of their endowment every year as scholarships in place of the 37500 loan students would have,Mentalcomposer
to take out some of these institutions have humongous endowment amounts the student will then be ineligible for the fed loans im just sick of hearing about this topic today its believing gays will go to hell and after you marry it will become cut off your brothers because they are sinners oh and then your oat ente because they support your brothers and then its your friends cause theyre not true believers soon youll find your life is him his crazy religious family and his church you havent experienced emotional abuse until you experience it at the hands of a religious husband run he will only get worse hes the worst kind of christian a hypocrite hes perfectly ok having sex with you because he repented sure he did he has no guilt over that act just normal teenage horniness if he really believes he would have held to his values but he didnt so hell pick and choose how and what he expects you to do that is an automatic good bye,Mentalcomposer
never mind hes been getting more aggressive as time went on if this was your d and her bf did this would you tell her to stay nah im sure your parents arent thrilled with picking you up understandingly but you also arent thrilled to have to rely on them which shows youre not really entitled which is good i know you said you tried to live on your own and couldnt do it but can you find a roommate in the city that might be a better idea or how about you drive yourself to work go out but dont drink youll still have fun with your friends i remember my mom watching nixon resign on the tv i was 9 all good that was quite the read he did do his own tests shows what the mom said only the boy is his nah she will always be taking care of her mom and if she really is an alcoholic she will end up moving in at some point its quite commendable,Mentalcomposer
for your gf but do you really want this in your future this isnt what you want and thats fine a lot of people wouldnt want it but for right now this is still your apt you were trying to be nice since her lease was up and i know shes living there but its not really hers to do as she pleases with you wouldnt let her redecorate without your input would you i dont have high hopes that this is gonna work out and you should decide now before you get more invested in this girl its only been 4 months give her time to find a place and part ways i think i understand the choices youre 16 you can go to college for two years and get credits for that and can you get a job with this amount of education 2 yrs of college is it equivalent to a bachelors degree we have or you can go to an american school do you mean 2 years of what we,Mentalcomposer
call high school and then youd take sats and apply to american colleges if thats the choices id probably say do the two years where you are if youve finished what is your hs you might be bored doing it again i could be wrong but in the us we require so many college classes that are irrelevant to your course of study so if you can cover all that in just 2 years id do that it stinks not having storage space do you have any space on the side of the refrigerator ive sired some pans there sorry cant be more help sorry im having trouble picturing this when they slide out onto the floor do you then have to take the drawer all the way out and then reach back to retrieve the pans are the pans above the top of the drawer and slide out over the top cant be that cause its too easy to suggest not stacking so many pans so the back panel of the drawer is,Mentalcomposer
gone there must have been one at some point so find a metal piece that will fit and use the existing holes to fasten it or see if you can find a replacement drawer so they already told you what your flights are for next march thats amazing in itself and do i understand that the cruise price automatically includes flights thats interesting what if you live close enough to the embark port that you dont need flights nta we were friends with another couple who got a dog and they named it my name this was years ago and i really hadnt heard of naming pets human names was i insulted no i laughed and joked that they liked me so much they had to have a my name in their home daisy is a bit too sensitive and aunt and uncle are so afraid their precious baby wont ever get another girl that everyone has to bend over backward to make her stay nta i guess they found a way to pay,Mentalcomposer
for the wedding without you id love to know any of their reasons as to why you should be paying for her wedding sept 25 thats a long way off to make that decision now but i def think you should be talking about this working out the logistics of it all maybe you go and come back for the holidays then he takes vacation time and you travel somewhere during spring break or when you dont have to teach try to see if there are some agreements you can work out together its only 10 months its long enough but not insurmountable nta im sorry there is no reason your wife cant cut her daily hours long phone call with her family short for one day she doesnt work and has no friends what the heck does she even have to talk to them about every day for hours and she sees them every 6 weeks this is all very weird to me thats some serious co dependency going on there and then,Mentalcomposer
to cancel with your sis for the next day was childish of her have you ever expressed that at some point youd want to live abroad before now its kind of a big thing to drop after 6 years can he work from abroad if not why would he give up his job that said if you think your relationship would survive the 10 months then maybe do it get it out of your system youll either be satisfied afterwards or youll realize you dont want to be tied down to one place there is no jr jr if bil is daniel jr his son would be titled daniel iii the third but only if the babys first middle if he has one and last name are exactly the same as his father if just the first and last name are the same if they drop or change the middle name then the baby becomes just danielmn or not last no jr no ii his son cant be daniel ii because he is the,Mentalcomposer
ii second even if he uses jr nta i think a bill for the materials and labor for the ruined garments are in order how petty is a grown woman that she thinks shes owed something from another person shes acting like a child and was told so no issue there id be commenting on that fb post and in addition making my own and id go as far as to text every family member of what was said what she did yta its just so stupid in the first place that you asked her to read to you thru the bathroom door just ask her to stop while you do what you need to and adding to this it was your idea to do this stupid except use in the first place the least you could do is give it your all attention i wont even get into how i feel about the idea of actively trying to strengthen a relationship but i have to ask is this a self help book or,Mentalcomposer
just a run of the mill novel im thinking its because he was the one driving the boat its not a recycle thing but instead of buying new bottles of anything soda or water juice there should be drink stations where you bring your own reusable cup and just fill up one button dispenses the amount you pay for sml if you dont have a cup you buy a paper compostable for a nominal amount yta she doesnt need you to set the record straight she should do it herself and she should start with a lovely text to your mom explaining how its your defect and does mom now think she should divorce you you better start getting the word out its gross that you would let your wife be looked down on be a better husband why would you immediately go to shes hiding something how low do you think of your wife that you would think she did anything in this scenario you dont deserve her and she deserves better than,Mentalcomposer
you she did nothing wrong again in case you still dont get it she did nothing wrong your friend is totally to blame and you sent a very nasty message but wait then you drag your wife to therapy to work thru it work thru what exactly she doesnt need therapy she needs a h who unwaveringly believes her when she tells him she was harassed and threatened by your friend id never look at you the same way ah ok well its a crappy conversation to have maybe something like this look theres no easy way to say this but im not comfortable with d coming to the christening you know she has some issues and lets not pretend that she is better when shes not and i cannot take the chance that she will act out at what should be a happy celebration for the family this is an important celebration for me and w and we just want a nice happy day of course i want you there youre my bro,Mentalcomposer
but i will completely understand if you dont want to leave d with her mother for the day but im sorry she is not invited bro wont be happy but when you have a child with serious issues you have to realize that there are places she wont be welcomed at how is he going to bring her if he doesnt have custody of her its your bro in law which means he is was married to whos sister if he married your sister you should be telling your sis to tell him not to bring her if he married your partners sister then your partner should be telling their sis its not a good idea youre an in law this needs to be done by a direct family member shes lived in this city before she met you so she knows how expensive it is how did she manage before i gotta be honest you work 2 jobs she works and you still cant save any money something has to change either you,Mentalcomposer
get one higher paying job she gets a higher paying job or you move you cant move with the job you have but does your company manage territories anywhere with a lower cost of living that you can switch to moving from everything you know is not ideal but a lot of people do it because they want to have a better life i can understand her frustration up to a point and it seems shes rushing this relationship a bit but the dramatics she is showing are unwarranted if you absolutely are 100 positive that you will not move anywhere and you are determined to make a life in this city you need to tell her that she can then decide if she wants to stay with you or go her own way this may be one thing that you are not compatible on you say you have 50 people but those 50 include presumably all of your and her extended families aunts uncles cousins but usually when people have a destination wedding,Mentalcomposer
the guest list gets cut way down to immediate families any very close to the b and g extended family and very close friends your 50 people might be able to be whittled down to maybe 25 or even less the people that would come would be the ones that really really care to be there for your wedding as opposed to aunt gertrude who you see at family weddings and funerals you wont miss her everyone shows up the day before the wedding then you can have one whole day of total wedding she walks down the aisle you marry and have a nice celebration afterwards the following morning can be a brunch and maybe find one activity that all can do maybe a vineyard next day everyone goes home just a thought stop texting with josh on anything unless you want karen to be spreading your business all over town if you need advice from him call him when hes not with karen oh and please do some research before asking another,Mentalcomposer
16 yo about important things like possible pregnancies i cannot see him being any more of an expert in this subject than you i agree immediate family should take care of them the boys immediate family as in mom and dad and yes theyre not safe in florida by themselves that is but with their immediate family ie mom and dad they will be perfectly fine i would never communicate with sil ever again literally block her everywhere your brother can get in touch if he needs you at least he seems like a rational adult seven months is a long time when youre 15 but not in the big scheme of things this is your first gf you have no idea what a good healthy relationship looks like going thru a rough patch by 7 months is not a good sign having other people who are more objective than yourself telling you she is controlling is a big red flag youve already have thoughts of breaking up that is your gut telling you,Mentalcomposer
something always listen to your gut doing everything for her is not an equal partnership her crying is emotional manipulation not a good thing if youre brutally honest with yourself you would see that you are not happy being with this girl you know what you want to do youre just too inexperienced to know that you will survive this break up you will meet another girl and itll be nice and then youll break up and youll meet another and on and on and on you are so young go have fun for the summer with your friends another gf will come along did you two meet in the city that you live in now how long are you together what do you realistically think your time frame for buying something is if youre basically paying a mortgage amount how do you ever think you could save up enough to buy something can you both work from a diff city that you are in now thank you i know child support does not,Mentalcomposer
hinge on him having visitation but is there any way she can get support but he does not get visitation otherwise i feel hell dip in and out on a whim and those kids will always be in flux or if she doesnt need the support and his name isnt on the birth certs can she just move away so he cant find her stability of one parent has to be better than what he does nta why was sean the only one home at that time where was your family did your h allow sean to wake you to make supper i would get out its not worth staying there to me im actually surprised sean allows his wife to stay out past supper cooking time nta that relationship is gross at this point really just uninvite them dont engage anyone about it ignore any texts from anyone in the family dont pick up any phone calls make a declaration and stick to it the topic is closed you do not need this,Mentalcomposer
aggravation she has to wear white because she got pregnant didnt get to have a wedding gtfoh this is the most asinine thing i have ever heard yta youve eaten the same meal since you were 5 which means someone else cooked it all those years who would that be im guessing your mom you said parts are complicated and you cant do them so just get your mom to help you with those parts if she cant do it then you muddle thru best you can adapt funnily enough ive been sailing carnival lately i havent seen any over the top crazy tho no fights at least and i think only one really drunk guy whose wife was trying to guide him out of the casino when she finally gave up and just left him in a chair at one of the machines and walked away but they def take top prize for outlandish outfits on their passengers its like they dont have a mirror i feel like the british seem to have,Mentalcomposer
a more almost jolly good fun crazy time tho i just took a look that trip sounds amazing i hope you have a fantastic time maybe you can pop on here and give us a few updates as you go i have a few qs purely out of curiosity if you dont mind im assuming you have cruised and probably long trips but are you a little nervous about being at see for so long i dont think i could do the whole thing did you get a veranda cabin i think id need that definitely are there any specific ports you are more looking forward to ooh i might be up for a crazy time thanks can you expand on the craziest please i never looked into marella so im curious youre going to be apart from each other for 23 years what kind of marriage will this be when youre not together and she wants to add kids into the mix hows that gonna work honestly you guys shouldnt even be together,Mentalcomposer
she has a romanticized version of marriage dont settle your spouse is the most important decision you will make in life if youre seeing problems with her now they will only get worse you two wont even be together to have the time to sort them out this is a recipe for disaster what exactly are your wifes limitations if you dont mind answering she has the capacity to disagree with the go fund me so is it that she has physical limitations is she getting therapy that she may improve and this is somewhat temporary if youre finding it so hard to move on after everything this girl put you through maybe you need to work on you for a bit it may help you to speak to someone to figure out why your self esteem is so low nurturing faithful and hardworking are good qualities but honest and respectful need to be there also manipulative and unforgiving cancel out all the good i realize you cant help who you fall in love,Mentalcomposer
with and i hope you truly find your match who treats you with the respect you deserve just know that with ncl you say you have 4 people if you are all not in the same cabin they can split you on diff flights you will be kept with your cabin mate but if for instance you book you and partner in one cabin and your 2 kids in another cabin your kids may end up on different flights with layovers in diff cities what did you do wrong 1 after you broke up for absolute legitimate reasons you went back for more abuse 2 you didnt work on any of the problems you had originally but just figured shed magically be better the second time around 3then you smartly broke up again but went back for even more abuse 4in the two mo the you were broke up the first time you should have moved on its like you were determined to make her a better person it never ever works what was,Mentalcomposer
so freakin good about this one person that you had to be with her please dont make a mistake number 5 find a woman not a girl and go slow so slow you might be going backward get to know them in and out before you commit yta for allowing someone to use you financially fo so long cut your losses dump the guy and find someone preferably where you live so you can have an actual relationship with go on dates with see how they act in real life with their friends and family can h ask for a gag order on the divorce proceedings that would work to shut her tf up i dont even remember the last award show ive watched ive been over them for a long while come on now she must have some wrinkled designer frock somewhere in her closet she can throw on first of all vision is not something to be ashamed of its not like you actively did something to cause it lets get that,Mentalcomposer
out of the way also your numbers arent really bad 2020 is so called normal who told you these were really bad numbers exactly theres zero overhead especially if shes recording from her house no transportation cost no wardrobe cause wtf is seeing her thank goodness no security to get to a studio shed need double that budget for the armor plated tanks with mounted mini guns guests just show up so you pay an editor maybe a music and sound person buy this is what spotify does its literally their business you telling me they dont have these people on staff a million dollar budget for each episode what could they possibly have needed to justify that budget i doubt they paid guests so how many people does it take to record one podcast id like one of those jobs please spotify is looking more and more stupid every day nta did you actually leave with your friend then she went somewhere other than home not your problem her husband figured shed be,Mentalcomposer
home at about the same time you got home and if i was him id think that also but when she didnt arrive he rightfully asked where shed been seems pretty normal that would happen even if he doesnt think she did something she shouldnt have he was probably worried what happened to her i always text when im leaving a place im usually driving but if im not home in a reasonable time and dont answer my phone at least someone would know approximately where to look for me with you youre in an uber with a stranger if you dont turn up at least theres some way to try to track you it was a box grid but when i copied it it didnt come out that way ill try to clean it up edited to make it clearer i found this it does seems kids are entitled did i interpret it wrong box titled if you die with spouse and descendants from you and someone other than that spouse box titled,Mentalcomposer
heres what happens spouse inherits the first 25 of your intestate property but not less than 50000 or more than 200000 plus 12 of the balance descendants inherit everything else your gf told you she was in love with someone else and wants to travel with this person thats not an open relationship that is her wanting you to sit on the sidelines while she has her fun you two have been long distance with occasional visits where you played house she came back earlier this month and is in love with another already let me guess this guy is from where she used to live and you dont think she was seeing him prior dont ever be someone elses back up plan so sorry for your loss losing a parent is hard sending hugs you seem to have an awful lot of empathy toward sandra and her grieving process this is a woman who alienated your dad from you ever since she met him its lovely in a sense but you and your,Mentalcomposer
sibs lost your dad she doesnt seem to care much about your grief thats not to say you should go after her but all you guys really want are sentimental things youre not trying to throw her out of the house that said and your sibs may be entitled to part of his whole estate and you shouldnt just ignore that this of course depends on where you live i did a search for my state and kids from a previous marriage are most def entitled add your name to the suit if the lawyer can show you what the laws for dying intestate in your state are and if you really dont care about any of his estate simply suing for the sentimental stuff you and your sibs want should go even easier sandra will hand it over if it means you wont be going after his money or property dont stress let your sibs handle the legal stuff but you should put on a united front the funny thing is weve all,Mentalcomposer
probably been the new one to the group at some point i have but it never bothered me i enjoyed hearing the stories about when my partner was young and dumb it had a great adventure whatever i just listened and took it all in it gave great insight to everyone in the group this behavior i cant even put the feeling g into words really which makes it all the more creepy maybe your bf is being petty and immature you are allowed to go away with a friend and not him that you planned it while you were broken up said to him that you arent sitting around pining away and hes pouting him then going to all your favorite places and making sure you know about it says he wants you to be upset that hes doing all these things without you but youre not taking the bait so he has to up the ante except hes out of ideas so he breaks up with you again dont you see youre,Mentalcomposer
not worshipping him youre not miserable without him you can actually be ok without him and he doesnt like any of that buy a ped egg use it after a shower then slather in moisturizer put socks and shoes on i also frequently just moisturize but always put socks on and shoes i feel like the heat from the socks and shoes helps i dont know anything about either of you but seriously you think a 23 yo single mom is in love with you shes in love with the fact that you will send her money cut your losses find a woman somewhere near your age this chickie will string you along until she cant get anymore from you nta honestly i would have assumed she was still loopy from the anesthesia and not really taken it seriously and if i said anything i would have caused a problem between them was the reason for her wanting to split because he wasnt able to be there any sooner because he was with his,Mentalcomposer
friend at chemo wait you share an apt and you pay for it on your own why are you still with him besides that youve been together for so long does he have any plans to actually get a job be an actual adult or whats his plan dinners with his mom isnt that odd but every week is obsessive but i guess he has nothing else to do nta the idea that she wants to feel included in your previous life is strange really really strange thats not how it works im not exactly sure if thats a reflection of anything really it just feels a little obsessive all consuming maybe idk just gives me bad vibes depends how young babysitting is the easiest thing you can do but if youre not old enough for that then a mothers helper is doable you basically watch the child while the mother is there doing other things in the house who says theyre ugly you one persons pretty is anothers ugly and vice versa well,Mentalcomposer
thats horrifying thank you for that visual lol so its your apt ask your lawyer if its legal to literally get him kicked out make sure he doesnt have tenant rights or something then call the cops have them escort him out and have a locksmith in standby to change the locks but you didnt you went back there are so many things that are concerning in your post you two just should not be together you need to separate get court ordered custody and child support so when its his time he has the baby find another place to live and seriously get on a birth control that you dont need to even think about implant iud not 100 but pretty damn close and no possibility of human error thats what i wondered im sure d would have said to her cousins that her parents need to know and that their mom had to let them know that they werent taking the cousins word for it or call the sil the night before,Mentalcomposer
final numbers had to be in and just ask its now or never yes or no whats the alternative everyone just sit around all day and be given the basic necessities what about wants maybe after a few years of just being handed your needs youll get to choose a want youre not special we all grow up and have to support ourselves there is no coping to be done where did this idea even come from it comes up on his site so often doesnt anyone elses family not say anything and then just talk about the person behind their back no just mine my sibs and i would have a field day with those names well just keep on keeping the peace over stupid stuff like this and you havent blocked this girl why you cant just not talk to jason tho you can either tell him you want nothing to do with him or that you want an actual bfgf thing and he needs to tell the girl l you seem,Mentalcomposer
to be taking jasons word that he was just talking to this girl she thought he was her bf theres a huge disconnect with those two statements one of them is lying my 20 somethings are still wearing mismatched socks its been years now its really not all that important is it me i dont do it but its not my feet and not my socks your so is making problems when there are none why ive never heard of that at all my understanding is that if your flight is 8 pm and have transport to the airport thru the cruise line you will be among the last group off the ship but every disembarking passenger has to be off the ship before any embarking can be done so you may be scheduled to debark somewhere between 9 and 10 am but you cant stay on all day and when embarking even if your flight is arranged thru the cruise line if your flight is delayed they will not wait for you they,Mentalcomposer
will wait if you are already on a cruise line arranged shuttle coming from the airport if delays are traffic or whatever so not hours long delay but not for a flight delay i heard you be able to fly into the first port but that is at your expense she can ask anything she wants realistically tho what organization is going to pay this amount or even what organization is even wanting her to speak and to speak about what she has nothing of any value to talk about and thats not being mean really she can speak in a generic term about any topic but we all can do that if im looking for a speaker for my org im looking for someone who has at the very least some expertise or personal experience about whatever my org represents and thats not her theyre waiting to debark bars wouldnt be open until the next group embarks hes been sleeping for 10 hours so he should be nice and rested to handle the,Mentalcomposer
baby for the next 810 hours while you sleep he has no excuse at all right now go get some sleep nta based on the info about the uncle alone never mind where shes going hashad cartel violence thats a def no from me why take even the slightest chance her aunt is coming to visit when the baby will actually be able to interact with her anyway you have to sign something for the baby to leave the country anyway dont sign because they dont really care about any of these groups they just think if they say they care people will fawn all over them its been said over and over they dont want to do any of the actual work involved to actually make a difference this website says it costs 8000 to build a well and its in africa harrys second home youre telling me their foundation cant part with some money for this project and they dont even have to do any of the work this took me 5,Mentalcomposer
seconds to find a charity that actually does the work and they have a staff that cant find not one thing they can support theyre actually disgusting people i think wed all like a more democratic liberal power for russia we can always hope you can eat chicken tho its a meat but its not red yes it gets boring i know but a salad with grilled chicken carrots celery tomato maybe throw in a hard boiled egg and a dressing was basically my go to meal when i diet you can make pulled chicken like pulled pork just eggs and toast french toast should be ok too quiche with veggies might be good too egg salad might be ok if you dont use too much mayo you can have a sandwich or just put that on a bunch of lettuce sorry im trying to help give suggestions thats what i wondered wasnt it reported that the russian soldiers sent to ukraine were giving but cause they didnt want to fight so i wondered,Mentalcomposer
if the russian military in russia would do the same thing if they do indeed allow wagner a pass do you think this is a good thing for your country what do the regular russian people think would be the best outcome so i did a quick search and didnt find any indication that losing weight releases purines everything i saw said losing weight helps with reducing gout flare ups dont despair just yet can you get in to see your doc or do telemedicine they can give you the med to help with the flare up and then once youre feeling better you can concentrate on losing some weight the people i know who have had gout have absolutely kept it at bay by diet they know which foods may cause a flare up and avoid them like the plague i hope you find some relief any chance you can call in sick to work at least for today well the obvious answer is to get your gout treated and then avoid whatever,Mentalcomposer
it is that causes the gout in the first place read these if just the thought of marriage id making you physically sick maybe thats your instinct telling you this is not the guy for you youve been together so long hes all you know but being insecure moody jealous and judge mental are not really traits you want in a partner id work on those issues first before you even think about a life with him honestly id be thinking if thats the traits id want in a bf those traits will absolutely stifle you in regards to what you want to do in your life yta so you admit you just want to be a degenerate for life if thats the best you hope to aspire to then leave why are you fighting to stay this is not normal im sorry why exactly would you even date anyone who has said this to you 2 relationships for 20 years means when you were in your 20s till now how did you manage,Mentalcomposer
to find a guy in his 20s who didnt want to jump anything with a pulse do not give up but seriously before you get past the first date you need to ask about his sex drive if hes not up for at least once a week dont continue to date him make this an absolute requirement for yourself cologne smells diff on everybody depending on how it reacts to your body chemistry so no one cologne is the one you should have you need to try them and see if you or your partner thinks it smells good on you i see the skinny and the muscle but wheres the fat the answer is no you are not skinny fat at all you are tall and lean and muscular why do you want to live up to a cheating ex has it occurred to you that all the ex ever had was maybe a different look and alternative lifestyle and thats what he thought was soooo attractive at the time because it certainly,Mentalcomposer
want her loyalty but where did that get him cheated on married and still cheated on again just saying that to compare yourself against the ex is pointless because he is choosing you choose him back with no reservations just go with it you have no idea where its gonna end up life is too short to spend it with someone youre not crazy about and besides youre both young been together a long time and may have outgrew each other but youre both sticking around just because of the time put in already if youre not feeling it youre not feeling it if you do break up if her parents dont know about her harming herself that might be the time to clue them in so they can be aware and get her the help she needs i had trouble following who did what when all of this is messed up tho your d was bullied but it really sounds like she gave it right back with the mom joke no the time,Mentalcomposer
for her to speak up was when she was paired with the bully then she did none of the work so why bother going to the competition wonder why the bully didnt tell the club leader that your d did no work if only 2 signed up im assuming she got to the competition and her bully said something to her again all i know is i wouldnt force my kid to go and do anything they didnt want to do shes 13 is model un or any club really that important shes got plenty of time to learn to stick to her commitments you know the ones that really matter are you on the lease i think if you are then youre stuck until the lease runs out someone else would know for sure i would remove my banking info from it let him deal with it worst that can happen is he takes you to court for the rent till the lease comes to an end but will he maybe its not,Mentalcomposer
even worth it to him and hell just pay the full rent aw thank you my response to op says maybe he wants to do it on his own for a sense of accomplishment idk i just dont want her to get too paranoid and borrow trouble where there is none so its possible he may not tell you where he is when he needs to calm down because he wants to handle his issue on his own he needs to feel he can become a less angry person on his own sense of accomplishment and all if you do notice a pattern of less aggression please mention it in a nice way not youre not as angry more whats got you in such a good mood lately i like it give him a few weeks then casually mention he seems more buff than usual see if he mentions going to the gym i dont think hes doing anything nefarious you guys are ok is it possible he is going to the gym and,Mentalcomposer
stopping off at the park before he comes home because he knows hes in a bad place and doesnt want to bring that anger home two hours in traffic can rile anyone up the gym would be a good place to work out his aggression and a park seems like a good place to calm himself down has he been coming home in a better frame of mind that you noticed are there any other places hes going that are sketchy and not places he could maybe just collect himself before coming home nta but how did it get to this point when you were dating did he have a job an apt support himself did he just suddenly get sick and quit his job after you married and you were ok with this and how do you not know if he has asthma or the much more serious copd id certainly need to know exactly what kind of medical issues my h was dealing with if he was supporting himself when you met,Mentalcomposer
and dated he can do that now i think something is missing what does your mom say about being limited to the amount of time she spends with her grandson what did your bro tell mom he thinks youre telling his son have you asked these other family members why you shouldnt be seeing bros ex wife even in the context of it being just to facilitate drop off to visit with nephew what possible reason could there be for that it makes no sense he is still your nephew you didnt divorce anyone he cheated she divorced him she is not the bad guy here your bro should be thankful that you and mom want to spend time with his son yeah thats a pretty big thing to leave out nope im out too he wasnt a close friend and you barely spoke prior to dating so go back to that dynamic i wouldnt actively snub him say hi to the group when you get there and say bye to the group as,Mentalcomposer
you leave if youre thinking of it as a win lose then you would lose if you cut off the friend group he will think he won just because he would look at it as she cared so much and cant get over me so she cant be around me dont give him that but def come to terms with him and the breakup or youre setting yourself up for misery when he starts to date and bring her around curiosity has me wondering i just want to know exactly what role the snake had at the wedding and why it was so important to be there edit due to knowing the real reason jen cant leave the baby with her partner i change my vote to yta its totally understandable why jen wouldnt feel comfortable leaving the baby with anyone make the exception for her she needs some happiness in her life right now and mom is nta anymore she obviously empathizes with jen at this time nta but id go as far,Mentalcomposer
to say mom is does jen not have a friend family who can watch the baby so her original plan fell through not your problem i never understood people who wont go anywhere without their child who wouldnt want a night out without child care duties your ss is going to literally sit at your wedding with an infant in her lap at 10 months even if this baby is walking your ss is just going to follow her around while she roams sounds like a great night huh jen can come to the ceremony go check on her d then spend a few hours at the reception if she wants to leave early she can your moms stance is ridiculous why is it so important to cater to jen shed rather skip her one daughters wedding to do what sit at home with her other d to make what statement exactly that she likes jen better that her grandchild is more important that its unfair to leave an infant out of a wedding,Mentalcomposer
that said infant is never even going to care about ill get downvoted but whatever its my take on the situation it will be helpful if you can get your husband to talk to someone all of this mess is ultimately his issue to come to terms with i wont say your h is homophobic he may be he may not he obviously had has a vision in his head of what he wanted for what his sons life would look like every idea he has had is now shattered and he has to find a way to come to terms that what he envisioned will not come to be lots of parents have this same realization but they are able to take a step back and say its not what i had envisioned but it is what it is and accept and go forward this goes back a long ways every time your son had trouble your h turned a blind eye his mom disappearing his cutting his lack per h of a,Mentalcomposer
gf and ultimately his coming out his dad has ignored the obvious simply because he didnt want it to be true that his son was suffering thus driving your son deeper into himself as good as you are as far as being there and understanding your son and as much as you tried to get your h to get on board so to speak you havent been able to so its time for professional intervention i am sure your son knows how much you love and care but your son needs his dad to accept him that is the part your h does not want to realize so work on h to get some help with basically letting go of what could have been and moving into this is what it is youre 18 youve been dating for 3 months youre going to be away for training and then stationed wherever tell me again why you would even want to be coupled up with anyone go do your thing as a single guy but,Mentalcomposer
be smart about the girls you will be meeting once youre stationed dont be a stereotypical young dumb enlisted guy who marries just to get off base date for sure if you meet someone you like but dont be in a rush to marry good luck in basic training and stay safe its been 1 date slow down what gives you the idea that she wants serious see if date 2 or 3 goes as well make plans to actually see each other once a week talk or text a few times during the week which incidentally is exactly how dating is done dont make it an every day thing right now i like just the basic details i dont need every single teeny tiny detail spelled out for me not even so much to form my own mental image just because unless its instrumental to the story its irrelevant so in your example basic description works heart monitor beeping not the big beige box to the left of the bed that is incessantly,Mentalcomposer
beeping telling me person is alive while i watch the line move up and down hoping praying it doesnt flatline its not all cash but pizza delivery makes cash tips thats an option if you have a car if youre ok with kids you can babysit or ive seen people offer to play teach their kids a sport or you can offer tutoring ive seen kids home for college offer to do basic yard work weeding mulching etc go on your towns website and post there whoever told you it was offensive probably has no idea who the people in the shirt are they say the words and went right to its a trump thing i wouldnt worry about it this is it exactly the vitriol shown to wealthy people on this site is unreal as if any of those people suddenly came into enormous wealth they wouldnt be doing exactly what the wealthy are doing they like to say theyd be solving poverty and world hunger but theyd be the first to flaunt,Mentalcomposer
it buy the mansion jet and of course since its reddit hookers and blow its gross really yes this sounds absolutely ridiculous to me how exactly does she want you to give her your undivided attention are you supposed to just stare at her give her non stop praise hug and kiss on her for hours on end what how is it that she can go out to dinner with you and a friend and thats ok when youre obviously not giving her your undivided attention how have you even lasted 6 months with her nta you should have just told him you did for fd exactly what he did for md he cant counter that because then hed have to come up with what he did which is nothing im married i dont think my bday is all that special but we take the fam out to dinner for all our bdays not just mine but there is always at least talk about it coming up how is this not even talked about,Mentalcomposer
by anyone including the kids thank you at first i wondered if maybe he was a bit overwhelmed with all that was going on in your fam but hes had all that info for a while so that shouldnt be why he now needs space he is showing you that he cant be there for you and everything in his life is his priority not exactly traits you want in a partner but you have been handling everything long before he came around and you can and will be able to handle it all if hes not around info please how new is this relationship is it just 4 weeks no idea how you got to the conclusion that i think parents can be abusive or yell at their kids i never even mentioned parents i spoke to how a kid can rebut a parent or elder if you look at his edit hes been taught to say yes every single time he is spoken to where most of us took it as normal,Mentalcomposer
parent child interactions where there is a dialogue idk how your parents spoke to you or others but parents most time dont go right to yelling or berating they ask the child to do something kid either does it if its a reasonable ask or question why do it why right this minute why cant it wait etc my response explained how to answer back in a respectful tone not something that includes sarcasm yelling or with attitude if you were trying to catch her listening to you you should have made up something you were talking to your husband so make you something about your house or car you chose to tell your unflattering opinions about coworkers of course those things would get around so if you really dont care if all your coworkers dont like you then n t a but if you want a drama free workplace then y t a but why would you want that it makes no sense not a moron sometimes it helps if you lay the,Mentalcomposer

fit you might not get your way but youll at least have gotten your say yta just for accepting the no contact clause when you divorced you might be ok with just 9 days a month sorry this is in no way a decent amount but i do wonder if you just got tired of fighting and gave in as far as asking to see kid when hes with mil is that actually illegal or just not right based on custody i wouldnt do anything to get myself in legal trouble wait the 6 mo and go back to court to revise custody child is old enough to recount what was happening at dads id be shocked if full custody is not awarded and just to be spiteful id see if there was any way to get gf charged for throwing kid out in those conditions dad can get sort of a pass because child not wanting to ever see them again is sweet poet justice to me or if gfs charges somehow get,Mentalcomposer
linked to dad he can deal with that too im not giving a judgement but i would highly suggest you separate the kids have each one sit opposite each other theres 4 of you one at each side of the table that will cut down on the boys being in each others face and being ha day to the other id also suggest redirecting any conversations when you think its not dinner topics ask about school hobbies tv shows anything to keep them involved and interested so they dont go off track this may mean you have to ask qs just to keep the convo going theyre just rambunctious young boys who are doing what young boys do i guarantee they will not be talking about pee poop or burping while on a date could be an excuse but why pick the one thing he knows would hurt you in that way its almost cruel you know he may not want marriage with anyone at this age while it seems thats where this would,Mentalcomposer
lead as you say its normal in your families he may just be thinking he hasnt dated around enough hasnt really sowed his oats as they say but thats a diff conversation that should have been had its hard for some people to think that the someone they met as a teenager is going to be the person they would spend their whole life with it scares them they panic please dont think of him as the only man you will ever have these feelings for we all think its the absolute worst thing that could happen at the time and when we look back after marrying we realize that person would not have been as great a match as we thought at least i did take some time for yourself let yourself grieve the life you imagined and then move forward cry it out rage it out whatever you need to do lets just say that what he says is true that he didnt find you attractive which is kind of hard to,Mentalcomposer
believe because at 15 thats usually the first thing that attracts you to a person its not their mind but anyway even if thats the case what usually happens is as you get to know a person their physical appearance doesnt really come into play you find the whole person attractive and their physical becomes a non issue its not a deciding factor so yeah i cant believe someone i spent 3 years with coming up with that of all things to use as a reason to break up you deal by realizing that this one relationship is a stepping stone to the man you ultimately will be with who loves you for all of you not just your pretty face you dont why would you their aftermath is not yours to deal with at all you block and move on and deal with your own feelings about the break up on your own youre long distance its not like youll see this person all over town listen to your therapist your guilt will,Mentalcomposer
guilt you right back into a coupling that you do not want anymore nta sam isnt smart enough to realize that shes in the easier classes really in hs the issue is sam feels inadequate to her sister she knows shes not as smart and has to make herself feel better by focusing on grades has emma never actually said to sam you only get as because youre in the stupid class come on emma knows whos the smarter one your wife was wrong why does she need to coddle sam im thinking mom knows sam isnt too bright you need to take emma out for pizza and ice cream now too the flags are only banned on city owned buildings individuals and businesses are free to fly pride flags and they should be painting that town in flags if you vote in a majority muslim city council whose religion doesnt support non heterosexuals and were voted in according to the article to combat anti muslim sentiment you had to think there would come,Mentalcomposer
a time they would vote according to their beliefs have we not come to the point where we know our elected officials are not voting and doing what their constituents want but what their own personal feelings on an issue is leave him alone you broke up with him in the heat of the moment take that as your gut telling you this is the right thing to do always always go with your gut you admit you were an emotional wreck and arguing all the time take this time to straighten yourself out hes probably ok breaking up as he was tired of navigating this unstable relationship sometimes things just run their course i have a diff take on this why is your partner crying to her parents that she needs support for gf seems to be doing ok long term bf bought a house what is the problem and you seem to know all the answers so why cant you handle her problem you say they were raised to be insecure but,Mentalcomposer
im thinking their hands off youre not a failure dont be daft answer to sis is akin to saying stop your whining and get on with your life should they have been dissecting every minor complaint theyve had growing up and solving all the girls problems for them i think you and possibly by your influence your gf is expecting coddling when the parents are more no nonsense people a handle your own stuff attitude you cannot stay with her just because youre afraid of hurting her that is literally the worst reason for staying together what good does that do for you or for her just rip the band aid off and break up with her the sooner you do it the sooner shell get over it it hasnt as shown in this article its from 2021 with a 70 approval this article from this year shows a 71 approval where was she going or she just walked around the block if the pap have her in their sights youre gonna tell me,Mentalcomposer
they didnt follow her to her destination everything is always fake esh you because as nice as it seems to spend the day with just your wife and kids you also have a father were you not planning on seeing him so i fault you for not realizing that you would want or at least should want to spend some time with him for fd before agreeing to your wifes plan even if you would have planned for seeing him on sat why didnt you suggest that when your bro called your wife because obviously talking about ending a relationship just because you invited your father and bro over for a few hours on fd is the most ridiculous thing ive heard in a long while and the fact that shes going to punish you by taking the kid to her cousins shows that maturity doesnt come with age its not like she planned some elaborate day where having visitors would upend the whole day there has to be more to this and im,Mentalcomposer
thinking it has to do with your wife not seeing her dad on fd civility seriously its as if after staying home for a year everyone turned into nasty self centered brats i also dont moan about anything teens do publicly that is but to my so ill comment when i see someone else moaning but only when it involves destroying someone elses property idc if kids are loud running up and down the block even fireworks normal kid and teen things but it bothers me at destruction but how could she not expect the gf to show up if nothing else it gives both of them a reason to come visit with family and ill bet the gf was the one who actually went out and bought the gift around here baby showers are for the women men are never invited and if they are they usually have a golf date that day anyway op planning her own shower after the baby is born just feels off somehow unless its a cultural thing,Mentalcomposer
as someone mentioned where showers are not a thing before the baby is born why didnt her mom throw one maybe moms not as thrilled with her d having this baby i hate to say this but it seems like a gift grab almost sort of like a come celebrate me ooh good luck to you also im hoping since we get to buy before the public we might actually have a chance thank you yeah i saw that which is what prompted my question because i never paid attention to the process before since i knew i wouldnt be there but im kind of excited now that we may be able to go keep your own space the idea that youre asking and arent sure means that you know thats what you really want to do why dont you just keep the apt that youve been given while the renovation is taking place this way you can have as much or as little time apart that you want youve only been together 9,Mentalcomposer
months and you are so young id be a little leery about giving up my newfound freedom too and if you move in totally i also think youll never be moving out until you break up how do you stop it you ask to see the last 3 or however many tax returns you ask for a pay stub from each of the previous 6 months you ask for any investment and bank account info and you ask this for anyone who will occupy the apt and then you follow this up every year you cant renew your lease until you produce all these docs in addition the city should be verifying all this info why are they taking someones word for it you want a cheaper apt its up to you to prove youre eligible oh im sure her very good best gf gwyneth was just dying to let meg in on all her secrets to building a successful empire which really means she has absolutely no idea what shes doing again they,Mentalcomposer
can market and ask whatever price they want doesnt mean anyone will actually book them i dont know why this isnt more understood because federal student loans the ones that were paused are capped at a total of not bothering to look again for exact number somewhere around 3540000 for undergrad slightly more if you are eligible due to being low income having a pell grant maybe the reason peoples debt is so large is because they took out massive private loans which were never ever going to be cancelled so its getting really tiresome to keep hearing about crippling student debt when the federal ones are not even the ones causing the problem it was just ok for me i just wanted the rest of the original top gun class to show up for ice man is there no income verification each year that allows you to stay like if you make too much money you cant rent that stabilized apt not sure if it has vocabulary so you might need to just,Mentalcomposer

problem with that is the reason you joined those subs in the first place is that you are interested in that topic subject whatever drew you there in the first place if you unfollow the subs you like based on this protest your feed will be full of things you dont care to see or are not interested in how is that fun i follow the things i like why would i want to only see the things that dont interest me i dont fully understand the whole protest ins and outs but i thought i saw where some subs wont be coming back and others are only dark for a few days ill wait it out and see what happens thanks sorry to cut into this thread but if its going to be read only what will there be to read posts that were made before the blackout and if theres no posts allowed will there even be any responses to the post thanks if you know nta she has no intention of,Mentalcomposer
getting a job why would she she gets benefits and does nothing seriously she cant go to the employment appt because she has to rearrange her room what else is she so busy doing this week and to boot she somehow has what appears to be a pretty decent bf who is willing to work oh and make and break all her appointments for her shes just waiting till you can support both of you do not let her move in with you even if she initially has a job she will quit that job and youll be stuck i really hope you get that job and move away nta is there some reason why your ex hates you so much that she wont let you see your kids more is this standard custody in japan if it is do you know the rationale for it you can ask her to swap fd for the baseball game but i doubt shes gonna give it to you take the game itll be a nice activity,Mentalcomposer
with your kids how old are your kids maybe they can mention to their mom that they want to see you more because this generation is lonely but also alone they want love but cant find it or keep it could you ask that one of her friends leave their car for you to use do you know these friends im not a big fan of using other peoples cars but the friend is getting their transportation provided for the trip and their car will just sit around for 2 weeks id also only use their car for work youll have access to one of your parents cars in the weekends thank you for taking the time for that explanation can you explain this please i thought the subs were only going dark for 2 days and then will be back up are you saying that some most subs wont come back at all and one more please does each sub pay to have moderator bots so if they raise the price the sub,Mentalcomposer
wont be able to afford them so people can just post anything in any sub sorry i just dont know much about all this oh and thank you in going to be brutally honest here and im sorry for that but you need to hear it loud clear and not sugar coated you do not owe that man not one more minute of your time you have been abused and manipulated for 15 years that is half of your life you got out that shows how strong you are now take that strength and cut him off he is no longer your concern hes a grown man and can figure out how to do life without you he wont starve and hell eventually figure out the rest its very telling that he has no friends and doesnt speak to his family anymore gee could it be that everyone who meets or knows him knows what kind of person he is please stop doing for him he will try to manipulate you back into his,Mentalcomposer
life and you will be right back to where you started the next thing to work on is selling the house why shouldnt you get your half to help you move forward i wish you nothing but the best but you need to stay away from him shes been alluding to a surrogate scandal forever if she knows something then just say it already or stop the baiting its getting old already idk what they had to do to squash any info coming out about the kids and her past activities but there has to be a loophole for it somehow its just gonna take one brave soul to spill it as far as her ambitions there is no way never not in a million years that wannabe celebrity is ever going to get anywhere near the oval office its a preposterous notion one i think lady c just made up she has neither the intellect or connections to even begin to think about this she cant form a coherent sentence never mind dialogue,Mentalcomposer
with other world leaders why would he be mad you complimented his gf if she is pretty you wont be the first or only guy to notice this is a no big deal thing if hes mad thats his insecurity dont contact her this isnt just all about you how selfish can you be if you could be totally honest with yourself the only reason you want her back is because you dont want to go thru all the steps to meet someone new you say youre willing to marry and have a baby with her now but those were things werent even on your radar after seven years and you were living together so youll do those things and find youre unhappy with your life anyway she deserves better she deserves someone who absolutely wants to build that life with her and that just isnt you dont waste anymore of her time nta you are legally adopting this baby in any other adoption scenario your cousin would not have any standing to make,Mentalcomposer
demands on a name just because she knows you its pretty bold of her to think she can i realize emma is only 15 but she is old enough to understand how adoptions work you need to reiterate that this child will be yours and your husbands and that emma or her mother will not be involved in any decision making in regards to this child now or in the future this is why family adoptions are messy the bio parent is always around hovering criticizing and the other family members are chiming in i really hope you dont live close to these folks because i def see trouble in the future nta she certainly expects a lot huh and i have to say it you are setting a really really bad precedent for any occasions going forward what gave her the idea that her bday should be an elaborate affair of surprises and planning and spending it is simply unsustainable sorry it seems like you need to be 21 in order to sail,Mentalcomposer
alone no parents or guardians with most of the major cruise lines im not sure what consent form you are seeing but the ones i know are if one parent is cruising with a child without the other parent or if someone is taking a child that is not theirs grandchild son or ds friend those type things you can request a new card online youve done what a lot of others havent done yet you lost the weight and kept it off good for you as far as lifting weights you just found out that type of exercise is not the one for you list 3 other types of exercise that you think you might enjoy try out the first for a couple months and see if it satisfies you if not move on to another youll find one that you will enjoy and it wont feel like a chore to do i think the seamstress is just saying come in for a fitting when youve lost whatever weight you wanted to shes,Mentalcomposer
not saying to lose more weight it makes no sense to come in have the seamstress take in the dress then lose more weight and take it in again and repeat this isnt a case of just taking in a seam wedding dresses can have some unique properties that take more time and more expertise to alter for instance if there is beadwork on the bodice the seam cant just be opened cut and resown oops i forgot about the dress thing ok so sis didnt know sis is in the clear now yta its really not that hard to make an excuse for not drinking or just say you dont want to that you dont like champagne not in the mood there were a million things you could have said other than to confirm or just take a sip one sip is not going to hurt anything or you could have announced a month earlier so by the wedding it would be old news but im guessing sis wanted you to wait until,Mentalcomposer
after her wedding which is selfish also in order for slim fit anything to look good the person wearing it has to have a slim body it wont look good or fit well if you have an average body type but can we talk about the awful trend of mens suit pants stopping above the ankle why i hate the look pants should meet shoes why are you trying to hang onto this guy he doesnt seem like such a catch if youre not happy with him then get rid of him its common sense better to be single and happy than paired up and unhappy just to point out this person who im sorry idk who she is other than obviously an actressis having numerous others testify on her behalf notice h had none thats the way you try to prove a case not with i felt must have been i dont remember possibly im speculating etc is there any way others can win their cases but hs is not won or is,Mentalcomposer
it all or nothing because id hate to think hell get a win judgement not based on the merits of his case but by piggybacking on others much stronger cases because we all saw he had absolutely zero evidence that his phone was ever hacked but i guess we have to see what the others present as evidence its very simple money equates to security that doesnt even mean you have to have a huge salary doesnt mean you have to live a grand life you can live a very minimalist lifestyle but you need to have some money saved somewhere so if theres an emergency or a crisis youre less likely to panic which is why we all should have an emergency fund her schooling actually makes you look worse you actively dissuaded her from going to college with a bribe and if there was no stipulation that she couldnt leave the house vacant you really have no legal leg to stand in for cutting her off from the house and the monthly,Mentalcomposer
payments do you even slightly like your child were taking a month long vacation i hope my adult kids dont take that as abandonment and change the locks think about everything you have done and put your daughter through if indeed you and your wife feel everything youve done is appropriate then you two def deserve each other now you can sit on your pile of money and assets as you grow into old age alone esh im not really sure i believe some of this your d was homeschooled but she was in a gifted program but she isnt educated which is it her telling anything to your niece that could have legal consequences was obviously wrong but what was your wife doing that she shouldnt have i actually hope the d and niece rat her out then you lied about it to make the situation for your d worse and force her to settle out as lawyers you sure did take a huge risk doing this then she dares take a trip,Mentalcomposer
and you decide that violates the terms of the settlement and kick her out and cut off payments was that even a stipulation i cannot imagine two more vindictive people and worse youre both vindictive against your own daughter im wondering if all that wealth youve built up was actually earned legitimately you two seem to have found every possible loophole to destroy your d and when there wasnt one you lied to make one id hate to be your client if your husband is falling asleep and waking up later than your 7 yo he might want to see a doctor that seems like an unusually high amount of hours of sleep for him to need how ever does he handle waking for work and getting thru the day its great he loves his job and all but it cant be to the detriment of every other single thing in his life time for a heart to heart he needs to be contributing more to this family than a paycheck you can do,Mentalcomposer
that alone i think i see where youre coming from i can of course state that phone hacking is of course an absolute horrific thing to happen to anyone and obviously illegal so if we assume he was hacked its awful but if we think about it harry really hasnt been caused any real quantifiable harm can anyone point out any real harm that has been done to him he jumped into this case just to rail against the press he doesnt like what they print about him and he wants someone to pay he didnt like how they covered his mom and in a sad twisted way he has to defend her too did anything come out that was so abhorrent that his life was irreparably damaged no he did what he did his relationships went where they went and all these things would have happened anyway and they would have been reported on he would have had the same exact things written about him anyway we would have known he broke his,Mentalcomposer
thumb that chelsy broke up with him that he had gotten a lap dance where he was staying that he met with flack all these things would have gotten out anyway nobody lives in a bubble again im not saying that the hacking isnt awful or illegal just that for him idk about the other defendants he hasnt proved it occurred he just wanted another wingefest how did you let it get to this point you do this mans laundry take care of his dog every day he doesnt clean you do all the planning and cooking and you pack his lunch is he a child does he not know how to make a sandwich and to boot he was unemployed when you met and you thought he was such a great catch that you supported him for the first 6 months that in itself should have given you an insight did you think he was just suddenly one day wake up and hed become a responsible partner and split the chores and now,Mentalcomposer
youre stuck you signed a lease with him can you get out of it and stay where you are id do that now lets move onto the way he spoke to you the first time a partner tells me to f off f myself etc would be the last time that person ever saw me never mind the disrespect if he doesnt have the skills at his age to have an argument without resulting to insults then he never will his insults will get worse think long and hard about if this is a person you want to have a life with you know the answer you just feel stuck because of the lease not a good enough reason instead of thinking that your bf is so much more accomplished than you and thats kind of a weird way of putting it start turning those thoughts around to how well you have brought yourself up since moving to this new school if you think about it hes had every advantage all through school whereas,Mentalcomposer
youve had to come from behind to get where you are who really is more accomplished in that scenario id say that would be you no sense worrying about what you think he would think nta you needed to eat it was dinner time his unusual eating habits are his own to deal with its nice you asked but i would have ordered anyway he could have gone out for a walk while you ate if it would bother him so much and calling names thats a big no happens once i might forgive as long as theres an understanding that it never ever happens again i dont name call and if my partner cant have a disagreement without name calling it shows me that they have no valid argument and has to result to hurting me on purpose nothing i said was overly rude every other comment has said youre making more of this than need be yta you seem to think of laura as a sil instead of a step daughter while,Mentalcomposer
technically that his true this little girl most certainly thinks of you by now as her dad figure shes been in your life since she was 5 and now at 12 she has to deal with and try to understand why this guy whose always been there is suddenly pushing her aside because he now has his own kids it seems as if your parents accepted laura as a grandchild and laura thinks of them as her grands which is really lovely when you think about it you should be thrilled your parents think that way to have a visit with the grandparents means all the grandkids you might need to rethink your mindset with regards to laura this is weird does she celebrate her friendships with anyone else no then why is this one person so special different important that she or they feel the need to mark the date so what did they do hook up one last time and then decide hey tomorrow were gonna start our friendship so no more,Mentalcomposer
sex one of them is still looking to either become fwb again or more this is probably the tiniest thing you or your wife should be getting annoyed about seriously does your wife really feel slighted over a meaningless affirmation on a holiday that has nothing to do with your fam they are neither her mother nor is she theirs you should wish your wife on behalf of your child and mother a hmd has your wife ever made an actual effort to get closer to your fam im gonna guess no she and you just think your fam should fawn all over her just because you married her it doesnt work that way did you call or see your mom for md did your wife extend a greeting to her even if she just shouted it while you were on the phone with mom ive been married a very long time so heres some advice these close relationships to your spouses family take time it starts small and grows my mil is now,Mentalcomposer
one of my favorite people i have no problem picking up the phone and chatting but in the beginning as in the first bunch of years no way stop looking for things to back up your claim that your mom and sis arent close with your wife accept the relationship and let it grow organically i thought i was the only person who just went with one other for my dress it was my mom she had 4 ds and that was her rule shes paying and its just us the only opinion she had was if the fabric was cheap cause i would have never known i also think your dress should be your decision it shouldnt be made by committee the bride shouldnt care if nobody else likes her dress as long as she does i thought the same thing no way any of their kids would have white blonde hair even did some google search to check the best they could do is strawberry blond from hs red gene and her,Mentalcomposer
if by some teeny tiny chance has a recessive blonde gene from her dads side thomas has dark hair as a younger man and im thinking samantha dyes hers blonde because she has dark eyebrows im confused tho you woke up he wasnt there so did he come home to take you to lunch and go back out are you sure hes actually working did you tell him you wanted to do xy and z on this day if you know he keeps taking these jobs on the weekend then you have to plan for him to block off that day you can always take the kids and go do something significant with them rent a car if you have to calling out means the person didnt show up for their scheduled shift they called to say they werent coming into work its so odd to us older people isnt it a signature had to be cursive somehow it always seemed at least to me that it made it more official or something we,Mentalcomposer
just had a discussion about this heres a thought and im sure im overlooking a lot of things so ai takes over some jobs ok its inevitable so now those people are out of jobs ok theyll find something else to do or retire or retire early because as it stands now weve got ss retirement accounts etc but these things are all based on at one time having a job and in most instances putting aside some of our income to fund these accounts except ss that comes out of our paychecks but then ai begins to take more and more jobs now we have i wont say millions but possibly 100s of thousands jobs being done by ai which means that same amount of people are unemployed how do they live do we institute ubi but where does that money come from and how much money is enough and even more importantly what do these people do all day do we really want this amount of people just sitting around all day,Mentalcomposer
long with nothing to do yeah hobbies travel etc but dont people innately want to have a purpose in life we can say raise taxes on companies because they no longer have to pay out as much in salaries but we all know companies arent going to want to do that why because their stock price is based off their earnings and the stock market is one of the leading indicators of the state of the economy so itll be an extremely hard fought battle to win we complain about not enough good paying jobs now whats it going to look like when there are literally no jobs left to be had and a ubi that allows only basic living if we think we have a great divide between wealth and poor it seems it would only get worse maybe i think there def needs to be some serious forethought to all this before we just replace anything with ai as i said im sure im missing a lot of the ins and outs,Mentalcomposer
but just looking ahead at possible pitfalls so basically if she never says or does anything to upset or annoy him all will be well shes got her head in the sand and thinks placating him will make it all ok but no one can placate forever there will always be another thing the kid finds fault with and lash out because of personally id leave i realize you love your wife but sometimes that is not enough you also need and want a partner one who will allow you to be an equal partner you can still have a relationship with your wife itll be more like dating again while you live apart if she wants you to stay out of it then stay way out as in separate households you dont say how long youve been together or ive missed it but it seems its been years what was he like when he was younger you say youve been to his sport events so im going to assume he hasnt been a,Mentalcomposer

so he then has to earn more to replace it or does he increase the amount he needs so he still cant pay his fair share you can do whatever youre comfortable with as far as your money but id never pay into a shared life unequally so my partner can hoard his cash do you ever feel like youll be subsidizing him forever why would i want to forget it every one of those events have made me who i am today if there are bad things you wish to forget that youve done or happened to you you make peace with it and move on you cant change them you dont have to rationalize them they just have to be a blip in your journey then why the heck are you contributing more he should be paying his fair half if for no other reason than to make up for his lack of companionship you need all your money to do things without him kidding but not really my sister would have,Mentalcomposer

take care of the baby because youre going to do that right but this is not going to turn into a living together and being a couple its not unheard of that a hookup gets pregnant and you both comparent but not have a relationship id have to ask him about it if he was that drunk its possible he doesnt even remember it and continues to hang out with these people who are clearly not his friends youve known him for 4 years does he look 20 or 16 do you recognize his clothes as what he wears now or in the past look for little clues as to a timeline or he knows it happened and it was a one off that his friends were just screwing with him because he got so drunk way way too far but idk these ppl either way it warrants a conversation he may be embarrassed but if he cant discuss it with you after 4 years together i wont say its a problem per say,Mentalcomposer
but you two should be able to talk about pretty much most things by now right now im kinda obsessed with married at first sight its a train wreck but i cant help myself does it not seem odd to anyone that you live outside of the country your godfather gets diagnosed decides to rewrite his will and the only person gf told he gave you your inheritance already was your brother the one who got everything im calling shenanigans on your brother hes gross taking advantage of a sick old man youre broken up stop obsessing over did she or didnt she cheat what diff would it make to know at this point anyway will you be more angry and what purpose will that serve being angry at your ex will do nothing for you except hinder your moving forward do you want to be an angry ex to any other girls you might meet cause thats a sure fire way to stay single nobody wants a bf who is stuck in the,Mentalcomposer

concern what did she do before you were around anyway what you need is some time to yourself stop picking her up every single day go back to your 3 dates a week you will have time for yourselves and will also have things to talk about when you get together maybe you should join a club or activity so you meet some people you need other things in your life besides her and tell her that you will not note will not entertain her ridiculous amount of texts throughout the day she can either stop sending them or be prepared for them to be ignored you are an adult you have a job you cant be watching tik toks all damn day you have to make your boundaries very clear to her or she will run over every one of them you need to have a talk with his mother is she as worried about him as you or is she ok with what hes doing if she is worried then you two,Mentalcomposer
need to decide what to do next if he has a therapist maybe it would be worthwhile to make sure they know what hes been saying maybe he needs in house mental health care im sorry youre going thru this its painful when your kids are struggling you are the teacher all teachers should aspire to be good job school dad if he had a draw id just throw them in but it feels odd to just throw them on a shelf all willy nilly idk now i feel like a weirdo im a woman and i do like your gf and it goes in a draw but i do the laundry and i fold my husbands underwear boxer briefs are bigger than my bikinis and have more structure to them his dresser is a tall one so he has shelves on the top where his underwear and socks go on the top shelf behind doors and deep drawers on the bottom so he stacks his undies so in order to stack they need,Mentalcomposer
to be folded makes perfect sense to me i agree the idea that shes more worried about talking to him is a problem she might find that after spending however long24 hrs with hubby she might actually enjoy alone time and she gets to hang with her gfs for her bday and talk about the wedding and honeymoon i realize tho that some people feel a certain way about their bday maybe shes one of them me ill celebrate whenever just wish me hb on the day and were good i dont even want a gift just take me to dinner i tripped coming down stairs and broke my tibia i sprain my ankles pretty easily so i thought it was just that hobbled on it the rest of the evening and until midday the next day i was on vacation at the time had a cast up to my knee and was told no weight on it at all got home a week later went to ortho and the break was stable so,Mentalcomposer

pm then she can both go do whatever and you can go to sleep when you need to also texting is ok too you dont have to have marathon calls every night of course they did have to keep it till the 11th our so both sides can tout their compromises and their thats what we were proposing all alongs this whole routine is getting old i think it doesnt matter that its a you feel as opposed to her feeling that way shes not going to admit shes just with you for the lifestyle you can afford her so it doesnt even make sense to ask add in that its difficult to talk to her about money why is that you think this relationship isnt an equal financial partnership in addition to not feeling this is a romantic pairing anymore shes a gf not a wife there is no reason you have to stay with her if you want to move and go back to school she supported her d before you came,Mentalcomposer
along and she can go back to doing just that youre going to work part time to basically help support her and her d why would you do that youll be gone 5 out of 7 days of the week its time you decide what you want not what you think is the right thing to do as far as gf is concerned nta i dont think theres anything wrong with that we do it frequently in my family and we all live about an hour away we just had a childs bday the day before mothers day and we all gave the moms their gifts then no sense driving on sat seeing everyone and then driving again on sunday just give your dad a heads up that since youre making the drive for the graduation its silly to do it again just a week later he shouldnt have a problem with it nta hes afraid youll expose him as the abuser he is to the gf i might accidentally on purpose run into,Mentalcomposer
gf at daycare one day if at least ask the daycare people about her does she seem like shes nice enough to your d doesnt the daycare realize that all of a sudden someone new is picking up d and using her dads pin to do it you would think they would want to know who she is give her her own pin and have a contact number stop trying to find your one and only that will lead you to settling just so you have someone which is why you maybe stayed in an emotionally challenging relationship for so long take this little break to analyze what it is you want in a partner and what you are not willing to put up with this is especially important for people who had less than easy relationships you dont want to get back in the same routine just because its what you know does that make sense wasnt sure how to put it when you feel you are at your strongest then you can,Mentalcomposer
put yourself out there and start dating again and maybe you can be the one to go after the person you want to be with iow ask out the guy you want to get to know instead of waiting for him to do the asking how many guys do we not date because they didnt ask itll happen maybe when you least expect it but is he in therapy its great that your bro adopted an older kid but he had to know this child would come with some issues its been years what are they doing to help him then thats what you should do move out to the country you two are never going to agree on lifestyle and be assured where you live will dictate your lifestyle youll stay in london and be unhappy and years from now youll realize you should have left years ago nta as long as when applying for this job your wife knew there would be travel i cant imagine you went thru the application interview,Mentalcomposer
process and accepted this job without talking to your wife about it but also its only 4 days with one almost 4 yo why cant she handle that i would tell her that instead of making excuses as to why she thinks hes still open to the idea she needs to just ask him its a simple do you want kids that is either a yes or a no question not a discussion although we all know he doesnt she needs to hear it point blank why in the world would you volunteer that info theres no reason for her to ask specifics of your where and what you did with a past gf and its kind of gross that you even told her maybe you should think about having some respect for the woman you date and not go blabbing a gentleman never tells reditt has a mix of everything i like seeing how diff generations deal with issues theres funny sad stupid weird crazy posts its amazing to see glimpses into how,Mentalcomposer

your dad may well be ready for a nh by the time hes 86 i think this will work if he can pay cash for 6 or more years he can transfer the house now then it wont be in the look back period make double sure what the look back period is i think it may be longer but im going with this time since it seems to be the consensus in the comments also when you move him in go see the social services office they should have one explain to them that your dad is private pay his house is not needing to be sold in order to pay his bill and no one from the facility should be talking to his dad about it at all have them put it in his admission record watch them do it explain that linda is pushing this and its not going to happen you might want to get a poa for your dad that way he cant be held if he signs anything,Mentalcomposer

id mention the fact that none of them contacted you when your bf of 4 yrs disappeared when you were pregnant and both him and his mother ignored repeated attempts at contact after that then mention the repeated attempts after the baby was born and passed then nicely mention they can all go to hell nta how old is this guy i wouldnt let him in either even if i heard him this is lower than even basic adulting he remembers to lock the door and that doesnt instantly make him realize he needs a key you can always tell him to wear his key on a string around his neck like the latchkey kids always did not going to be popular but oh well honestly i think your wife is just done with parenting altogether its easy to just say go out and play you bathed them took to urgent care went to pharmacy made breakfast and she hadnt even gotten out of bed yet then you still had to go fill the,Mentalcomposer
prescription and then she gives you attitude and decides she isnt talking to you im all for giving the sahp a day to sleep in and taking over the kids but when my spouse tells me its urgent care time you bet im up and seeing whats going on has she always been so irresponsible this relationship has run its course its extremely common when ppl start dating as teens but you are an adult and you have to know that cheating is not the way to get out of a relationship thats a cop out you knew on some level exactly what you were doing and you thought this would be a sure fire way for your gf to break up with you im shocked you were the one who had to tell her you havent said much about your gf reaction is she not upset how could she even want to still live with you are you planning on living together until sept thats a mistake doesnt your school break for summer,Mentalcomposer
go back home or find someone who has a graduating roommate and move in there me too just never liked her maybe its time to lay out everything sis has said and done to you to the kids if they dont know that way they will know to stay away from sis and not believe anything she says they are old enough to make a decision not to be around their aunt and id expect them to decline any invites where she will be your h can go alone he is the one who didnt put a stop to this nonsense from the very beginning i can understand partner worries about transitioning in that climate but what op is asking about has less to do with that the way i read it is that each one of them is asking for reassurance about the other still wanting to be a couple its their personal relationship they are worried about and in that case the transitioning one is not really reassuring op why shouldnt both,Mentalcomposer
of them be each others support ops life is drastically changing also she is going from having a male partner to having a female partner its a lot to handle and their concerns shouldnt be discounted just because shes not the one going thru the physical transition they need to know that during and after transition their partner is planning to still be there op you need to explain to your partner what youre feeling and thinking your partner should be doing everything in their power to reassure you when your insecurities creep in i dont think id want anyone in my home without me being there even if you know half this couple isnt it kind of understood that youd all be going back to your home together at the end of the night thats what i would expect if i was the friend maybe call your friend and ask her to thank her bf for the trinkets you should def acknowledge it i always wonder tho you spent a few hours with,Mentalcomposer
this new person did any of you actually try to talk to him get to know him its hard being the new one its natural to be the more quiet one in this setting if you did and he didnt really reciprocate or try to keep the convo going then great but usually its the group just doing their thing and expecting the newbie to just join right on in which if youre not an outgoing personality is hard to do if one wants kids then its not going to work ever if its a matter of spouse just wanting to sponge off the other then you have to decide if thats a dynamic you would be happy with if you can afford to live on one income and the stay home person is willing to look at doing all the domestic upkeep as their job and the other will be ok with that then maybe try it out but if one feels that no one should be a stay home person then again,Mentalcomposer
its not going to work someone will always be resentful ooh how good would it be if no photogs even bothered to take her pic she gets out of the car no flashes she walks to the door no flashes she walks out at the end no flashes that would be awesome conventional wisdom says dont quit until you have another job lined up so thats what you should be doing use your unhappiness about your job and homelife to give you that push to find another job id you quit with nothing lined up you will be home all day in a place that makes you miserable you have an education so you should be able to find something else and dont just take anything find something you think wont make you miserable but also that will allow you to move out even with a roommate or two dont just go thru life start taking a pro active stance with your life its the only one you got thats all well and good,Mentalcomposer
if you want to believe that but the second i walked in and saw everyone else i would have had some questions of my sister and i wouldnt have stayed after such a blatant disrespect of my relationship i believe your hopefully ex gf never mind fianc knew all along theres no way she hasnt been around or talked to anyone in the family or friends in the lead up to this marriage for it to not come out why you are still with this person is beyond me you obviously arent her number one and if im marrying someone thats the spot they should be in well id like to think a 4 year old knows the word beautiful one of mine was reading by then who do i call to get an article about them it still just blows my mind that any and i mean any publication would print obvious puff pieces that have anything to do with these two i cant be bothered to check cause i really dont care,Mentalcomposer
but did either of these two publications cover the chase non chase or do they just exist to go give platitudes oh did you think she was actually going to do something ive figured her out since shes a woman and self proclaimed activist she thinks that is enough to get otherpeople to do something she just collects awards while others do the work i can understand her wanting stability you have a child together and she wants to be married for all the protections that come with that for her and your child so give her a wedding maybe not the one she wants but one you can afford stability in a relationship is more about the innate knowledge that youre in a partnership that person is there for the long haul through it all its less about the stuff you have but stability also comes in another form and keeping even one of the properties will give you instant financial stability in the future if the need arises for an immediate need,Mentalcomposer
for a large amount of cash a luxury apt is nice if its well within your income level to purchase and upkeep it which it isnt because you have to sell off both your safety nets to afford it not to mention one is your childhood home or would stability come from owning an apt that is easily affordable and you can then save more for experiences you both may want in the future travel or hobbies or extra activities for your child or if you have another or two or more children kids are expensive im one who has always believed to live below your means without denying myself certain things that i want and save as much money as possible investments and building wealth will always trump biggerbetter or more expensive every time for me just something to think about nta its absolutely astonishing to me that your gf wants to sell property as part of financing a wedding and not just 1 property but both of them how big of a,Mentalcomposer
wedding does she want and how expensive of an apt i could maybe understand maybe selling the apt if its not a place you or her do not want to live maybe you cant live in the country while working in the city or for whatever reason but in that case proceeds from that sale should be used only to buy something where you want to live even if you have to finance the rest the country house would be a wonderful place to have as a respite from every day life in a city talk to her it seems theres more to this is she looking at expensive luxury apts when you normally wouldnt be able to afford and wants that as status you should have cancelled the weekend with your sister on wed or thursday when you realized you are not up to having visitors idk about the secondary stress but if you cant even get off the couch i really hope your sister isnt expecting you to entertain her and the,Mentalcomposer
kids why would she even want to come if you are so sick thats just risking her and or the kids getting sick also do yourself a favor and lock yourself in your bedroom until you feel well enough sis can use your home as a base and take the kids out to do whatever she wants and she can feed them on her own also i would never still visit if i knew my sister was so sick your sister is being selfish thank you for that it would take a bit of getting used to for sure nobody thinks how parents feel when the kids move away for their careers or just because they want to try living elsewhere and i think it really depends on how often you saw them were in the same state as our parents and sibs but they both live an hour away we see them a few times a year each holidays birthdays etc we def think about that when we talk of moving away like,Mentalcomposer
how often do we really see everyone and we can just travel back yeah the whole thing with the cab and go pro was odd were they originally stopped for a red light or did they just get into the cab either way you get in and take off why would the security guy in the cab get out to try to shoo away the one guy all that did was make the cab stay stopped for a longer time thus more photos and none of the three of them even tried to hide their faces if you want to make the pics unusable you dont give them a shot you give them the most unusable pose you can yeah the whole thing with the cab and go pro was odd were they originally stopped for a red light or did they just get into the cab either way you get in and take off why would the security guy in the cab get out to try to shoo away the one guy all,Mentalcomposer
that did was make the cab stay stopped for a longer time thus more photos and none of the three of them even tried to hide their faces if you want to make the pics unusable you dont give them a shot you give them the most unusable pose you can i had heard it was because in coed classes the boys were getting more attention from educators and the girls were kind of getting lost in the shuffle boys called on more for answers girls questions not being explained to satisfaction those sorts of things so having all girls would let them be more involved in the lessons or discussions the problem i see with sending the photos to the friend is that you have no idea who else hes sharing or showing them to at least when your h shared he was in control im assuming by just showing the friend his phone and i hate to say it but you shouldnt need any affirmation from other men to make you feel,Mentalcomposer
good i understand missing your h but that could lead to a slippery slope and you might not even notice it happening i would let h know and hope hed blast the friend and i would let the friend know what his gf said then id send a scathing text to gf then block her and the friend so wait was there even any paparazzi trying to follow them the article says they didnt want it known where they were staying so they were driven around for a over an hour overkill much but was there anyone actually even following them it doesnt actually say that so then what go to the police station to what wait for another car oh and they had to be escorted to the next block before they could get into them other car these two are only important in their own minds so much drama for absolutely nothing this chick lives for pictures of her was she afraid someone was gonna break into her hotel room gmafb dont,Mentalcomposer
be so quick to judge lots of younger kids gain a lot of weight right before they have a growth spurt where their weight evens out with their height but when i see older kids within a family and all of them are overly big then i wonder why the parents werent more conscious of the kids at least like they can be however big they want but wouldnt you want better for the kids sandals are even better than sneakers if you have a lightweight button down that looks great with shorts too roll up the sleeves the idea that you both have to see other people in order to know that you want to be with each other permanently makes no sense to me there will always be someone else that either of you could fall in love with and that person becomes the one the idea is that when you find a person you want to commit forever to you stop looking but you two are young have been together since,Mentalcomposer
youre teens so basically what youre both saying is you both want to play the field sleep around and see if theres someone better out there because you havent and you dont want to regret it and thats fine to want to most people do that in their teens until their mid 20s or longer just realize this be honest and verbalize this if you want to pretend that dating others will be the catalyst to losing weight and solidifying that your current partner is actually the one you might be surprised with the reality and are you both prepared for that i think it depends on what youre doing after the grad ceremony if youre going to a lunch at a decently nice restaurant then please dress accordingly if youre only going to the ceremony to be there for a friend and not going out afterward then i think its ok but actually i hate flip flops in public especially on men so i really think you should put sneakers on how about,Mentalcomposer
nicer shorts a polo and a pair of sneakers youre still comfy but look like you made an effort there are a lot of recipes that hide veggies in regular meals try to look up some of them at least hell be getting some nutrients that way one i know is shredding carrot into meatloaf so things like that is it just a case of him not used to these veggies maybe try to get some veggies that he would have from his home country so hes at least eating something healthy does he eat fruit its not a substitute but its good for him at least then you can try to introduce new ones be patient everything is new to him and hes only 10 info how long are you dating and is this your first serious relationship if you care for this woman at all you would let her go you want to go back to normal but verbal abuse has no place in a relationship you admit you have verbally abused,Mentalcomposer
her for all 4 yrs of this relationship you are not a good partner because of your anger issues you need to stay single get some help for your anger issues and only then should you try to have another relationship you cannot solve your issues on your own and asking this woman to be abused more from you is cruel late to this thread but ive heard this is a new thing ccl is doing its not so much an offer anyone can earn it i read something about it but i think it works this way as you gamble on the ship you accrue points you always had an option to convert these points to free play while on the same sailing points do not transfer to another sailing so it didnt make much sense not to convert them you did however earn some perks on the sailing ie at 1500 points you get free drinks in the casino you might get a steakhouse dinner or a spa service but idk how,Mentalcomposer
many points you needed for any of them now however the new plan is that if you do not convert your points you are supposed to be given a certificate for the above amounts depending on how many points you earn but i believe these certificates are used for a future cruise so is it worth it idk but i just play whatever i would normally play and whatever i get i get i wouldnt overspend my budget just to get to the next level of points im harsh because honestly im gonna take care of me first what he does after you break up with him is of no concern of yours at this point id send a text tell him its over youre done tell him to get some help then block him everywhere and all those friends who hate you now once you block him you can give them a heads up that its their turn to take care of him you know since they care so much then block them,Mentalcomposer
too you dont need these people in your life id rather have no friends nta its not your parents event idc who is paying for it your fsil said pants or a dress so you can wear the pantsuit and i dont know you but a pantsuit will look great on you go and have a great time and after the wedding try and keep in touch more with bro and sil i have found that once i really get to know a potential romantic partner their attractiveness or lack of becomes a non issue like their personality just meshes so well with me that they in turn become sort of better looking in my eyes if that makes any sense i know this person would not be on anyones top 10 good looking list but that one trait just isnt a dealbreaker compared to the immense feelings when im with this person but if youre talking about do i have to find my partner attractive all day every day no we all go,Mentalcomposer
thru periods when were not looking our best did we gain weight happen to get a horrible haircut that changes the way we look did we radically change the clothes we wear cause were in a weird fashion phase those types of things come and go take a good look at your partner when theyre all slack and sleeping probably not the best look but that is them in a raw sort of way im thinking it wasnt malicious more so that the two of you you and sil are the babys main caregivers not great wording by mil i love my mil but i would have laughed and said something sarcastically funny like wait im the mom i did the labor and have the body to prove it or said to sil ok you get her when she wont stop crying since were sharing anyway i cannot fathom why your h and bil were included unless the gift was a ticket for each of you to go out somewhere together are you gonna,Mentalcomposer
get a fathers day gift too honestly i usually dont care if the story itself is a bit disjointed ill see if it evens out or ill even reread a sentence that sounds odd to figure out what theyre trying to say but spelling errors are a non starter for me a random one here or there ok constantly nope i just stop reading you want to be a writer ffs learn to spell or get even a friend to read just for spelling errors i want to know why you want to do this are you gonna wake up and have a couple shots in the morning or wait before bed there is absolutely no good reason for you to do this are you making up for lost time do you think itll make you a grown up what this just seems like a weird ritual to start this is what i would and have told my daughter he can be frustrated and rant and rave about that thing but he has absolutely,Mentalcomposer
no right to take it out on you get up and leave you do not sit there and take it you need to draw a line with him tell him in no uncertain terms that you will not be treated in this way this is your first bf know your worth and what you are willing to put up with and what you are not and this is not one saying sorry does not negate the fact that he scares and hurts you there are other guys out there oh yes i watch a lot of news programs the one thing that always gets me talking back to the tv is when anyone usually politicians are on there telling me again what the problem is and blaming someone else usually the other party so ok we all know the problem so instead of blaming someone else tell me what you propose as a solution id rather listen to a ridiculous idea than no idea just give her back the money for her ticket and,Mentalcomposer
take someone else wow had no idea about any of that so thank you id be up for building a bigger building you dont have to have a high credit line but you could call your cc and ask them to increase it for a medical emergency it might be helpful to call before hand and ask if thats something they could do in the event of an emergency maybe explain that you have insurance and can prove that so they know you will have the means to repay my policy is a pay now and get reimbursed so if i have to go to the ships doctor i pay and then submit for reimbursement but for example medical evac i call the insurance and they make the arrangements im not expected to lay out half a million for that what form of govt do we move towards correct me if im wrong but the system we have now was laid out in the constitution so in order to change it to something else,Mentalcomposer
wed have to effectively dismantle the constitution keep the good parts and change the bad parts that will never happen our system should work there are adequate checks and balances to keep things on the up and up but individual interests are always going to take precedent over the greater good im certainly not educated enough to know where it all went wrong and i suspect its been a long time of small incremental changes that have got us where we are today but it would be an interesting discussion from what i read and see middletown township has a really great special needs program like people move here just for that the problem is there arent a lot of rentals around and home prices are high id suggest getting a list of school districts checking out col see if you can afford to live there and take into account what your commute would be and if you can find anything about their special needs programs dont know if its published but then join,Mentalcomposer
the facebook group for those towns or cities and ask there ive seen moms ask and the responses have been overwhelmingly positive those that have been thru it are the most knowledgeable of the ins and outs i think i remember it being this way hospitals were so wildly overcrowded that the idea was that anyone who came from a nursing home and was deemed stable or on the way to recovery could be sent back to finish their recovery in the nh but the caveat was that the nh was supposed to be able to segregate these patients away from the other residents until they were no longer able to infect others if youve ever visited a nh youd realize that this is impossible to do besides there being no empty rooms usually each resident has an assigned room and as is the case with older residents they know where they belong suddenly moving not sick patients out of their room in order to use that room for a recovering but sick resident,Mentalcomposer
will not go over well and vice versa moving sick out of their room so i think nhs took back recovering residents either thinking they could make it work or knowing they couldnt but were getting so much pressure to alleviate the hospitals burden or the nh only gets paid from medicare when the resident is actually in house that they didnt want to forgo that payment i have a relative in a nh and i will say there is no way to stop the spread of any communicable illness most of the residents dont even ever leave the home even just to be outside on the patio some more mobile residents can get themselves out there but most need assistance and the staff cant be bothered and there are never any windows opened luckily mine never caught covid during the major surge but we suspect she had it prior i get that she thinks shell get a payout but it comes up so often that kc will be the one who pays that,Mentalcomposer
it just gets on my last nerve again with kc paying her out i really dont understand what the rationale for this would be even if she has an nda shell never stop she will find a way to get whatever she wants to get out to get out another leaked letter to a friend anonymous friend source spilling info cryptic statements it is not kcs responsibility to get rid of her what could she really know at this point nothing so earth shattering damaging to anyone but harry and i have no problem if she drags him thru the mud its just karma coming back to him nta personally moms attitude is crappy you are supposed to fund a gift and a dinner for 4 people just make her lunch at home and be done with it shes taking this mothers day thing way too far considering she only has 1 kid who has a job shes never going to see your side of it she needs to be right more than she,Mentalcomposer
needs a relationship with you your partner needs to stop entertaining his mom he needs to tell her if she has something to say to you she should say it to you not him and hes ending any conversation that goes that way shell either get in touch with you or not but your h being the go between at this point is ridiculous it doesnt matter dont analyze someone you are not dating its exhausting move on nobody should have any patience for a constant on off relationship we either want to be together and resolve our issues or we go our separate ways nta you have two other kids in that house that you need to protect not that they need to know i say you have every right to ask hes living with you and you are caring for him through this tumultuous time in his life he should trust you enough with the information but dont say that and just accept if he wont share his diagnosis tablecloths because i,Mentalcomposer
hate to see the fold marks when its on the table nta for keeping the letters i would have also do you forgive him the problem with lying is that once they lie you dont know what if anything else is true only you can decide if your relationship is real with him or not what did he say about all of this why lie about having a gf whyd he keep the letters what did she mean to him i have an idea about why he lied but id like to know what he said so im a lot behind on this whole story so if someone could explain please phone hacking i agree would be something to sue over but paying for a pi to get info any him or anyone else just seems to me like its a normal course of events so for example if im a tabloid or even just a newspaper how else could i report on a celebs activities if i didnt know where they would be,Mentalcomposer
seems like to hire someone to follow them would be par for the course also the suspicious phone calls what made them suspicious were they hang ups were they asking for confirmation if the subject was going to be at a particular party ceremony etc sorry but other than the hacking is hiring a pi even if its to follow someone illegal walk the strip and go into each casino hotel its fun to see the diff theming nta for trying but i dont think its going to do any good you can try to occupy him when its usually her days but shell just change up her schedule the fact that he proposed a poly says that he isnt willing to stop seeing her and that is the real issue why hasnt he if he knows you are not happy with her specifically why isnt he putting your marriage first what did he say when you said no to a poly situation she sounds a bit unhinged youre getting in the way of,Mentalcomposer
true love and its gods will does he not think these missives are a problem he may well be miserable in the gloomy grey cold winter time its a thing but also some people dont need to see their so every day you guys see each other at work so theres no reason you need to be seeing each other every night also when do you see your friends do laundry grocery shop pick one week night and make that your night wed is good its right in the middle then you can decide if and what youre going to do on the weekend hes telling you its too much not that he never wants to see you again give him space so basically you just dont want him to show up on mothers day with a gift from your kids and then you all go to his moms like youve always done because you had a fight and are still not talking if you successfully dodge him on moms day and he gets,Mentalcomposer
in touch on monday what are you going to do it seems like youre trying to punish him by making him go to his moms alone as for the picture chances are his d is putting hers in front of yours find another spot you dont want to go on vacay with his parents bc of whatever happened last year fine but has that situation been resolved at all if not why would you ever entertain mothers day with his mom no key did you ask for it back or were you waiting for him to make a grand gesture over it theres a lot of passive aggressive going on here speak up use your words look its been 9 years it either works or it doesnt and it seems like it doesnt work maybe it did for a time but realize this both your and his kids are seeing this and im sure its not the first time this is the way this is all what he thinks theres not one iota of,Mentalcomposer
what he says that would show that he actually knows for a fact that the kids watched or that the non existent party happened or that h tucked anyone into bed that night so basically this is a non story its really easy for anyone to say what someone else would do or thought or felt but those ideas are based off of what we ourselves would think or do or feel why even give this guy any interviews have they not caught on that hes not reliable at this point did they actually say that do they really expect you to never have another partner that you should be alone and lonely while they go off and make their lives were not talking about children here who are still living home they should have some semblance of sharing a life with someone especially the 29 yo so if any of their marriages dont work out they are never going to look for another partner because they might be replacing the first one your,Mentalcomposer
kids are being selfish by denying you the happiness you deserve and im over here pushing my step dad to move on and its been over 10 years since my mom passed i want him to have someone to share his life with why should he be alone nta but your dad sure is the first person he should have told is his wife what does he hope to accomplish my telling you kids first is he hoping one of you will tell mom so he doesnt have to he makes no sense at all what if he tells you all and takes his sweet time telling mom do we all just pretend all is well mom might not see it coming but shes been as unhappy as him she might welcome the divorce i need to know how this person knows their partner did the partner move to nigeria after an in person relationship or is this an online thing if its online absolutely no way in hell should a parent leave their,Mentalcomposer
child to go meet someone they have never met and i dont care which country it is but doubly if the country could be dangerous if its a case of knowing this person and they had to live for a legit reason like a job then i might go but my partner would need to meet me at the airport and not leave me alone in an unfamiliar country doubly if its a dangerous country come on this is basic common sense even if i didnt have a child why would i put myself in a dangerous situation in a foreign country i have no idea if nigeria is dangerous to travel to i got the sense that you think its dangerous yeah and we have no idea if thats really what he said ive seen 3 or 4 diff interpretations of the lip readers i dont trust any of them i do find it hard to believe that h would talk about either his fam or m in this way so freely with,Mentalcomposer
jack unless they have been in regular contact like was jack asking how are you and h went into a litany of complaints or has jack been privy to any ongoing crap with m or the fam that theyve previously spoke about i didnt think they had that kind of relationship if they do it would be the only secret either harkle ever kept does your h understand that your dr has not cleared you to go back to work theres clearly a reason for this explain it to him again in plain english obviously his advanced degree isnt in english i will never be able to go back to my high paying job that i love that supports this family if i do not get myself mentally healthy in order to get healthy i need to rest and rest means not working a crappy job while you refuse to be a partner to me and a responsible dad to our children the answer to this is that you take over being the support,Mentalcomposer
of this family as i have been for the past 10 years if you cannot do that then you are not the man i thought i married that man would be worried that i had an actual mental breakdown at work that man would be doing everything in his power to support me until i am better and able to resume my career if that is not you then tell me now and ill figure out what my next steps should be because i cannot go on like this sorry but i cannot understand your husbands attitude at all i dont understand why anyone would change majors just because they arent getting straight as that was the first mistake your kid made straight bs gets the same diploma as as so they changed majors to something they didnt even like thats the second mistake so now theyre miserable just let the kid quit this job if they keep getting bad reviews they wont have a job and they wont have a god recommendation either,Mentalcomposer
let them come home get some therapy if they need it and let them figure it out from there this isnt a hard decision nta first off quit whatever job you have your health is more important does your h at least agree with the fact that the household needs an income that covers your bills and even more importantly has benefits that cover your medically fragile child this is a man who has a masters degree and is confused as to why he needs to get a job so what exactly does he think the solution should be too bad if its going to hurt her someone always is going to be upset in a breakup better her than you break up block her everywhere and move on youll be better for it no because in order for her kids to experience anything like this she would be forced to volunteer you know like an actual act of service and not get paid for doing it oh the horror youre missing the point,Mentalcomposer
here establishing paternity is in your childs best interest if he is the father then you can file for support thru the courts and he will have to pay that benefits your child but if you just want to keep going back and forth with him he will not just hand you money for the baby every month as he has proven split the cost of the test massive massive yta in the event this is actually true which i doubt strongly because no one can be this out of touch what exactly do you and your wife do in regards to your kids your bro has been doing literally everything for your kids between you and your wife you dont even bathe and put the kids to bed how exactly is him doing the kids laundry going to help you out so much seems to me you have an over abundance of free time after work and on the weekends since you dont do anything else you do realize he has a job,Mentalcomposer
and a life that doesnt revolve around your kids i really hope he just leaves in the middle of the night id love to see how that next morning goes so he asks if her robe is heavy whatever she said made him instantly uncomfortable maybe it was something like its a small sacrifice for the family crownfamily or service is a huge weight to bare or she really dug in with something like youd know if you stuck around no theres nothing to be embarrassed about this relationship isnt doing it for you anymore youre thinking is that there has to be a big reason to break up with someone but you can break up with someone for any or no reason dont stay with her or anyone you are not 100 invested in its not fair to you or them found this he needs to see a dentist and a doctor its possible that at 18 this ldr satisfied your emotional needs and even just seeing each other intermittently was doing it,Mentalcomposer
it may be tho that at 20 it isnt satisfying your needs and you need a partner in closer proximity or youre just really bored with this girl it happens have you tried redirecting the conversation or has your wife do the other men also add to these little anecdotes sex conversations will and have come up occasionally but they are short lived and not every time were with friends thats an odd topic to always come up maybe the other women keep bringing it up because your wife never has anything to share theyre trying to figure her out your issue is your frustration with your sex life not that your wife laughs along with the conversation its been 8 years you must have some idea what is holding your wife back is it something that can even be fixed with therapy if not all the therapy in the world will do no good maybe you as a couple should see an actual sex therapist gf is tah for not deleting the pic,Mentalcomposer
as soon as asked especially bc they know op doesnt want them to have those type of pics and op is tah for physically restraining the gf it should not have had to get to that point but gf did challenge op to come get it and they did so it seems as if your parents and his know each other do they speak often i ask because you said you argue with your parents over something and once they see they have no reasonable reason to say no they back down and you get your way i wonder if your parents can explain to his parents why they are ok with this trip and maybe that would help his parents get on board i understand its cultural but you both have the same cultural norms yet your parents are being more tolerable esh just the fact that she didnt delete it as soon as you asked is a problem for me especially that youve already had this conversation today its a picture what,Mentalcomposer
is tomorrow boundary break going to be i have to trust that my partner is going to respect me enough to not do things i specifically ask them not to ywbta if you say anything now this family is your uncles wifes no why would these people even be invited to your wedding i can understand being close to an uncle and his wife but her family other then saying hi and bye at occasions your uncle has you can absolutely not invite them plus youre no where close to even getting married so leave it for now i have no judgement because honestly i am not understanding this your friend wanted you to design her wedding invitations were you supposed to draw or write one invite and then shed what make photocopies and send them out were you supposed to hand write all the invites is there a reason she didnt just order invitations i would think he would be invited with a plus 1 and that would be you i wouldnt expect,Mentalcomposer
to receive my own invite to weddings of his friends or family you can always ask at least for his brother wont you have to make arrangements with work yes i am in the hopeless phase right now im in the having it all planned out in my head and just need to start phase dont give up just yet youre doing well with breakfast and lunch its just dinner thats messing you up so maybe try telling your wife thats a problem shes going to have to be supportive of what youre trying to do or this wont work you can go out to eat but watch what you order have a salad before your meal chicken or fish and a veg then when your meal comes half everything in the plate only eat that and ask for a take away box thats tomorrows dinner box it up and be done have a coffee after dinner and maybe a few bites of your wifes desert when youre going to eat at home youre,Mentalcomposer
going to have to plan for it grill up a bunch of chicken on sunday use that for a day or two add a salad or a veg its ok if you and wife dont eat the same things every night there were plenty of times i cooked for the fam and ate a salad and added a protein i almost always snack on nuts in the evening if i just need something to nosh on i find they satisfy that need with a small portion youre doing so well all day long dont let the one evening meal mess it all up this was your tipping point not the time you spent working while planning for and having a baby and he did nothing but tag along on vacation while you worked was that part of your plan you can have a year off with the baby so he gets one too im gonna guess that he isnt making the same money you did and thats why you need to have such a,Mentalcomposer
tight budget but did either of you think maybe he should have been working last year and you could have built up some savings you had a plan but it had some holes in it im afraid this is going to be a very long year for you youve been stuck for several years coincidently youve been with the bf for several years is it possible that part of your dissatisfaction is that you cut your traveling plan short to stay with your bf and youre wanderlust is creeping back in you have been working so its not as if hes been supporting you not everybody is going to be so career driven or always have another goal to reach a lot of people just fall into a career find its pretty ok and stay with it no one can tell you what you should do with your life but you like traveling and have had a passion for it so maybe try to find something in the travel planning sector or work for,Mentalcomposer
an airline to get the travel benefits theres also online teaching english which might be better than in class i think theres some kind of test you can take that shows what you have an aptitude for you might try that and see if it gives you any ideas otherwise just look at some job sites and see if anything sparks your interest you might get lucky and find something what has he tried to do to get his weight under control that after 2 years he hasnt been able to find something he can stick with we all know exactly what we have to do to lose weight and control our cravings and a lot of us just cant be bothered but when it becomes an actual medical issue thats when it shocks us into action is he not actually scared about this health issue why not you have to decide if you are ok with a relationship of no sex and a man 10 years older with health issues at 24 it,Mentalcomposer
would be a no from me you need to have a serious talk with your bf he wants to move and you dont have you discussed this at all have you told him why you want to stay your job daycare and family support what could he say to counter that you live together but are on and off how does that work when youre off does one of you stay somewhere else or do you just ignore each other on the regular while still living in the same place look this relationship doesnt sound very stable its good that you are conscious of stability for not just you but also your child but buying a house on your own with no discussion will not go over well at all and i could absolutely understand that from his point of view have the tough conversations now nobody wants to have them but you need to figure out what is going on with your relationship because honestly it seems like neither one of you are,Mentalcomposer
all that committed to the other once you figure that out a plan going forward will quickly emerge youll either both want to stay together and youll buy a house together or youll go your separate ways and figure out visitation and child support whichever way it goes at least youre both not in limbo thats the only way i like them firm and crunchy or dried is really good too but i like all my fruit like that theres something so gross to bite into a fruit and the juice goes everywhere we only do it for final jeopardy if we need time to decipher the clue during the game we just yell out the answers your art is stunning you are very talented so he keeps saying he wants someone on the same level as him in regards to some very specific things has it occurred to you that he threatens divorce just so you will bend to his every whim do you find yourself changing things you do after he threatens,Mentalcomposer
you shouldnt have to put up with a looming threat over your head every single the day from the person who is supposed to love you the most id tell him the next time he brings up divorce is the day i will be finding a lawyer he needs to find a better way of communicating the old heshe loves me so much they want to spend all their time with me excuse no its weird and controlling 5 pm for preschool yikes i still wouldnt do it its not your job and frankly you went to school to be a teacher not a bus monitor i cant believe the other teachers dont feel the exact same way this is an assistant problem they can figure it out id remove myself from the situation give the assistants the number to call for a sub bus monitor and be done if they cant get a sub one day then one of them does it you know because its their job nah so greeting guests means,Mentalcomposer
what after church when we walked out we stayed by the church doors and as the guests filed out we greeted them thanked them for coming and they have their congrats but this was both sets of parents then leading up to us if this is what youre doing why would you not have stepmom standing right next to dad while receiving guests if greeting guests is a mob thing then id think its a fob thing also are your new inlaws in this receiving line also and its really not all that much trouble to have her in the room where youre getting ready im assuming your bridesmaids will be there also this one seems petty to me like theres not really a reason for it other than exclusion and lastly ive never seen anyone but the best man give any kind of speech at a wedding but that could just be the norm where im from if your dad is making a speech then sm can stand up there with him she,Mentalcomposer
doesnt have to talk but its the acknowledgement that they are together and shes a part of your life and his speech should reflect on that nta i wouldnt do bus duty either if its not part of my job as a lead im sure you have other teacher duties that you need to do after school or at home thats the stuff you do and assistants do the bus you have 4 assistants its their job so they can take an extra day each week i would just tell all of them not my job i get car sick and im not doing it they are free to do whatever they want what time does school end that you get back at 6 pm this is really odd to me tho where i live the bus company hires drivers and aides for the bus any change in how they see him is only gonna change if they see him so if he wants any relationship with your fam he needs to start showing,Mentalcomposer
up thats really all there is to it so now im curious does she print her signature on everything like im thinking a drivers license or bank acct application my youngest is 26 and they were taught cursive the ex is certainly taking up a lot of space in your head why is that are you not secure enough with your bf how does she ever come up in conversation and what did he say when he told you she misses him but if you just want to break up to save yourself some drama then thats perfectly ok also it may be your intuition telling you that this isnt a forever thing not that hes cheating or anything more a feeling of shes always gonna be lurking somewhere and you just dont want to deal with it and honestly it doesnt seem like youd be all that hurt if you do break up so maybe youre not as invested which is good ill tell you this tho if you decide to stay make,Mentalcomposer
sure you go to every family function make yourself seen shes thinking she intimidated you into not going and shes right treat her like shes any other of sisters friend thats not really an ultimatum tho he hasnt really given you any indication hes into you but you keep trying anyway why im sure hes a great guy but theres not much coming from him his indifference is telling you all you need to know hes not the last guy in the world find someone who actually wants to be with you and stop wasting your time do you really want to be with someone that you have to chase until he just gives in then youll be here all sad because you chased and chased finally got him but it isnt the grand love affair you envisioned so its not really about having an independent life its all about having a partner well to attract a partner you need to be a good partner your mh is bad but you arent getting help,Mentalcomposer
for it you had a job but they cut your hours so you just stopped showing up instead of getting a part time job since you had extra time to work take a second and just stop and think what you need to do to get where you want to be ask for help if you need but no one else can just give you a life you have to make one just like every other person yta hes 6 hes not a man and you shouldnt be trying to teach him to be a man at his age honestly you sound terrible you can disagree with a book he reads or any other issue but you have a normal rational conversation with his mother and come to a mutual decision she left over this even if its for a night shes got enough sense to leave when you show how absolutely unreasonable you can be next time she may not come back i mean no offense but is there something about your autism,Mentalcomposer
that makes you not able to live independently and if you dont mind how old are you you need 2 things a job and an apartment do you have a job if yes then stay where you are for now and save as much as you can if no then figure out what you can or want to do and start looking for that work if you cant find what youre looking for right now take any job the idea is to just start having an income after you save enough money then you can begin to look for an apt and a room mate or two then come back here and ask how much you can afford to pay in rent based on your income and well help you figure that out also i think you over reacted to this situation she was with her bf who i assume you trust since he stays at your home sometimes i can track all my adult kids and only 2 still live at home but,Mentalcomposer
i rarely do because they tell me whats going on just like your d did we just always had it since they were teens why would you check that she made it to work what if she just up and decides one day she wants to skip work and go to a park are you gonna go to the park and make sure shes ok leave her alone shes an adult and doesnt need you constantly on top of her tracking is for when they up and disappears and i can tell the police where the last location was but even then the cops can get more info than i can anyway its not just rich people who want more money its pretty much all people there are exceptions of course some people are very content with what they have and arent always looking for more esh im just sitting here baffled that the h is actually complaining to his wife that he has to find a new job because wife told gfs husband,Mentalcomposer
about the affair like how is this even a regular conversation between them what should you do you turn to her and tell her cut the crap stop your crying like a baby because i saw an a on tv if you cannot get your insecurity under control this isnt gonna work go see someone if you need to ive been more than patient over the last 4 years but my patience is wearing thin and im tired of it now were here to have a good time and im not putting up with this you can go back home if youre going to be miserable for the next 4 days over something that literally literally does not affect either one of us and then you stuck to that stop giving in to her this might be the most absolutely ridiculous thing ive ever read on reditt and we all know the ridiculousness that is on this site keep in mind that while you would be ok with not having any contact with your,Mentalcomposer
family she isnt you and when faced with that choice i think a lot of people wouldnt so she cuts off her whole family and then what she has you and only you you cannot possibly no matter how hard you try replace a motherfather and siblings those are unique relationships that for most people cannot be replaced take some time to get over her and try to let go of some of the anger you have thinking that you were so easily discarded this was probably extremely hard for her to do life goes on and this too shall pass im sorry youre dealing with this you tell your parents what you told us here that theyre lovely people you love them and severing them from your life will be hard but if thats what they choose then youll abide by it but add that you refuse to be verbally abused by anyone at any time so they can call off the dogs you can add that you are absolutely positive in the,Mentalcomposer
fact that somewhere in their minds they know they have to know that being gay isnt a choice its the way whatever their deity is that they believe in has made you then you go live an absolutely wonderful life and surround yourself with people who love you being you please do yourself a favor and download a news app even if you dont read any full articles you will at least read the headlines and have a very vague idea of whats going on in the world nta what exactly does she want an apology for your wife is allowed to still be pissed and take some time she offered to drop the kids off what more does dad and wife want has the wife taken responsibility that what she said was done in such a way to make you and your wife look bad and why would she even want that because until she ponies up that admittance and apologizes for it theres no way id want to see her this whole,Mentalcomposer
fight was her doing no way is anyone holding my kids hostage like that grandpa will just have to get used to not seeing the kids then depending on the ages if the kids ask just say that grandpa is being a brat and hes in time out nta but your first mistake was not having your own acct have a joint for bills thats your 7030 a joint for savings decide on an amount and each have their own ideally each of your paychecks should be deposited in your individual accts and each person transfers what they need to by you leaving your extra money in a joint acct you are essentially giving her free reign in that acct since she can access it but you cannot access her own acct how did you even agree to this i would say just use your new thought process of understanding to slowly work through to the next step dont look at the next big picture slowly work through the concepts one at a time,Mentalcomposer
until you have absolute command of that step then move to the next eventually the bigger picture makes sense abstract concepts are hard to understand is there really something to be learned in a sense if theres no definitive way of proving what the end is so maybe the point of your paper is to apply what you think believe to be the end result based on your individual thoughts im not sure this applies to you and what youre studying tho just to be clear hes a male 32 your post says 32f hes pushing way too hard i wouldnt even keep talking to him youre under no real pressure from your parents to get married right now but it seems that he as a 32 yo man who has up until this point hasnt found a match for himself is trying to push you into a marriage before you have even met i suspect being pressured by his parents stick to what you want a marriage where you are in love that,Mentalcomposer
means no more meeting people who do not live within a realistic amount of distance that you can actually date dont shortchange yourself on this picking a spouse is literally the most important decision you can make it is the one decision that can make your like a living hell if you get it wrong or can give you a lifetime of happiness if you choose right move to the other place take the manager spot there hire a nanny i dont know why you think you cant raise your child by yourself millions of women do it every day with a lot less resources than you seem to have youre an adult but you dont seem to want to do a lot of adulting time to step up here leave him to his deal with his child hell probably end up hiring a nanny too he cheated with your sister is this a man you even want to be involved with even if he didnt know it was your sister hes an older,Mentalcomposer
man with a very young wife who still cheated on her what more is this guy looking for whatever it is he has proved it is not a monogamous marriage i usually try to explain how im understanding it and the other person will then point out where my flawed thinking is so id say so x does this and y does this so when x does its thing how does y know how to do their thing this way the other person is seeing where im getting confused and explain just that part of it so i can make the connection so instead of hearing the explanation that still doesnt make sense they explain just the part thats tripping me up and thats why neither of them should be running after the last 2 elections we should not still have to choose between the lesser of two old horrible candidates im kind of hoping there are a slew of people just throwing their hat in for both parties someone new might just rise,Mentalcomposer
to the top yta do you even like your mom she wanted one thing and even paid for it tell work you cant make it you should have told work before you changed shifts that you have plans that day and needed it off ill bet you would have done that if you had plans for an outing with a bf or friend you wouldnt forget about those plans you wouldnt cancel on those people but this is just your mom and you dont even like the event so she doesnt get the same priority i would absolutely rat out sil to the company this woman is making fun of you for not being able to get a job while gloating about hers which really could have been yours if she didnt lie as for your sister being mean to you think about this her wife doesnt help her with any bills even tho they should be partners she was mean to you until you cut her off so where do you think sil,Mentalcomposer
put all that snark id bet on your sister your sister probably is not standing up to her wife so shes taking out her annoyance on you getting mad at you over little things could be because she feels she cant get mad at wife id get sister away from wife for an afternoon and have this very needed chat is she even still happy with her wife what is really going on there with any luck sil will be gone and you can get your sister back this is not your fight dont use a relationship with your kids and their aunt as an excuse your kids have other aunts and uncles they wont be scarred for life if they dont see this one aunt as long as they are told that mom and aunt are fighting and thats why they dont talk no biggie happens to a lot of families your sil is finding it hard that in her mind she did everything right and just how the parents wanted got a,Mentalcomposer
great job and yet her sister gets all the praise and praised for something sil probably doesnt think is such an accomplishment but thats whatever let your sil come around on her own time or not the new baby doesnt care if they meet auntie you cant afford decent groceries but theres money for weed priorities man if you cant afford your bills then every single non essential expense goes away thats weed cable eating out etc if she doesnt like it she can get a job and pay for those things nta why would you clean more than once without being paid its 45 hours that youre over there after 1 or 2 times she could have told him at this point shes using you shes using your labor to fund her vacation gtfoh please stop cleaning for her if shes so bothered by his messiness she can clean his apt id youre at the stage of a proposal you should be at the point where you can flat out ask her if,Mentalcomposer
she wants to give you an idea of what she likes if she wants to give you a few pictures of exactly what she wants and youll choose from that or if she wants you to just pick out the ring on your own the proposal will be a surprise as far as when and how its a phone call he has the time this is important to you you need to see him supporting you in this tell him that since your dad thinks the teacher was out of line he should call her and if your mom thinks shes out of line she should also call let them tell the teacher that your behavior isnt out of line or worrisome and that he doesnt appreciate her telling you it is or separating you from the class and to cut it out or hell be speaking with the admin of the school the very first time a partner hits me is the last time i would ever see them idc if its a,Mentalcomposer
man or woman doing the hitting it will not stop it will get worse get out now why would you want to be with someone who resorts to hitting when youre having an argument i want to know what she says the reason is that she wont get a job does she not realize you two cannot afford to live on your income id also stop buying her any special food wine and nicotine im not saying not to buy vegetarian food just not any specialty stuff that is not your responsibility honestly youve only been married 2 years id cut my losses split up and let her make her own way she is not adding anything to your life at this point i thought the same thing like what interviewer would even ask that question out of the blue why m of all the women out there it makes no sense the absolute only way id believe it is if the discussion somehow went to who would be a good model spokesperson for,Mentalcomposer
the line and since it is dm based in the uk they asked about m to somehow tie the article to the uk through h the prince and then of course flip flop the quotes so it seemed as if the m question was asked first of course tw takes this as a win that a rockefeller even knows who she is she should have answered with who how long are you together and how old are you all if its not very long maybe he just doesnt think its that big of a deal its a lot to meet the whole fam at once so going to the baby birthday is his out im not so sure that because his friend is a girl is as big a deal as youre thinking it is this girl is with the father of her child i doubt shes looking to make moves on your bf your friend has im sure tried to talk to her friend about this guy and it fell on deaf ears,Mentalcomposer
there arent some magical words that are going to make her see the light now so julie can go be witness at this mess of a marriage or she tells friend she wants nothing to do with it but if she needs help getting away shell be there for her and have julie start saving money for that plane ticket what kind of guy doesnt know how to cook a hamburger or a steak grilled chicken is stupid easy how about a salad i refuse to believe he only knows how to cook those three things i wouldnt order out just because of the expense but when its your day to cook make enough extra just for you to have it the next night or take a sunday and make yourself 3 or 4 portioned meals that you can heat up for when he slaves away in the kitchen and makes pancakes again oh no youve misunderstood his concern worrying about security to the spare means hes really worried that hell be swept for,Mentalcomposer
recording devices and or shadowed everywhere he goes to keep him in line he has no fear for his personal safety he knows no one cares enough to do him harm so what at least hell have something to eat at home and she shouldnt be as stressed if shes working so she wont stress eat ill repeat what others have said do not buy a house with someone who is not your spouse your gf wants to buy a house get engaged and have a wedding all within the next few years oh and go on 1 or 2 big trips and youre supposed to fund the majority of those endeavors must be nice to be her you need to decide what you want what is your priority is it a house then you buy it on your own if its getting engaged and marrying then you buy a ring and ask if its travel then you plan that but you have to tell your gf that her pressuring you is only going,Mentalcomposer
to make you rethink being with her this isnt the way partners go about things see how she responds but if she is reluctant then you know shes looking at what she can get out of it not so much looking toward a life together there will be other perfect houses skip this one well they shouldnt have been wasting time trying to clear up a stream of errors as it relates to m its a ridiculous notion that above all else they felt the need to devote their time to that just let it go not every freakin little blip needs to or needed to be contradicted that was the problem they wanted so badly to make it look as if m was this perfect person that wasnt real then and it isnt real now i like the idea that both of you on your journeys together great thought he wont feel so alone then youve got this one step at a time and you and him will get there ok so nta,Mentalcomposer
for not wanting to take total responsibility for your brother your parents tho total ahs they cannot just decide they are done being parents that aside you dont say what mental capacity your bro has so you need to explain to your bro that you are not equipped to handle being his caretaker and he needs to find whatever is going to make his life the best he can make it but its going to mean he has to work at it no one else can do it for him he is an adult now and a if a group home is the best place for him thats where he should be the idea is to get him as self sufficient as possible mom must have some contacts that she has used in the past contact them get bro evaluated to see exactly what his strengths and weaknesses are autism is a huge range but he at the very least will need mh therapy after that he may need some basic vocation training so,Mentalcomposer
he can get a basic job best of luck its not easy youll be overwhelmed at first but once all the pieces are in place you and your bro will be better off im so glad im not the only one who found the idea of him peeing too loud to be bizarre couldnt really care about any of the rest of it i was just stuck on that no not just anyone can go vote you have to register to vote then you get or at least i did but it was lots of years ago a voter registration card in the mail depending on where you live you are assigned a specific place where you vote you can only vote at that place because you will be on their voter roll the list of ppl registered to vote at that spot so when you go to vote you give them your name they look you up in a book you sign the book and they are supposed to make sure your signature,Mentalcomposer
matches what you signed when you first registered and then you can vote info i need to know how old your brother is so sit by your dad even if hes not conscious idk his state and just talk say whatever comes to mind ramble he will hear you and youll have no regrets you will have told him everything you havent been able to say in the past hugs to you from your comment i think it matters what he did during this fight that made you feel you had to leave if you felt threatened its completely diff than if you were just done fighting he wouldnt stop and wanted to just get some space in any case hes just embarrassed and even if some of your friends have reached out he thinks others will hold this incident against him so you tell him he either comes on thursday or he doesnt but he cant be sad if you go seems he wants you to avoid these friends so he doesnt look,Mentalcomposer
like the bad guy also i feel pretty strongly that you need at least one friend you can vent your problems to thats what theyre for its ridiculous that you would never talk about him or your relationship with your friends we all do it and dont hold it over the partner its a way to get an objective opinion on whats going on very sorry for what youre going through i think the answer is very different for everyone it will depend on what you already know so for instance was your dad military and never talked about it do you want to know that did dad have a first wife and youre curious why is he fighting with or do you just want to hear that you turned out alright in your parents eyes are you doing ok do they like your partner or kids maybe you want to make amends over an issue figure out what it is that you need or want to know and have those conversations maybe your,Mentalcomposer
dad should tell your sister that not that i think it would do any good she knew it was wrong and thats why she never said anything to anyone even if she was having a reveal youd think shed have spoken to your mom about names even just in passing conversation look you need to have a talk with pam explain to her that you actually love this guy and even tho you married im not even sure why for a lark a joke just for the trope of a vegas marriage that over the last year you guys realized you had more and are happy but let her know you arent going to divorce just because shes not happy you two are together ask why she is so upset is it because its her friend or did she want him or what because she seems to be upset for no actual reason something else is going on with her during peri i had bleeding that lasted weeks also that was pretty much my,Mentalcomposer
only symptom but it lasted years on and off my doc prescribed micronized i think thats it progesterone it stopped it then normal periods for a while and when it didnt stop i was able to just call her and shed call in another rx maybe ask if that might work for you i think youre in the wrong subreddit but i found this and its from jan of this year so its up to date i am not familiar with the diff between a lpr and a green card but you may be also found this i dont want c to pony up one red cent this is harrys burden to bear she can have half of whatever he has and he can pay his own damn lawyers and he can fight for custody on his own if he gets full or half or visitation or none oh well he had those kids with her c doesnt have to worry about those kids being in the los it is practically guaranteed they are,Mentalcomposer
never going to be anywhere near taking the throne and if she wants to go and spill all his dirty little secrets so be it he deserves everything he gets is this her first year in school maybe she is really stressed just getting used to it how long are you together maybe shes just over this relationship but the insults yeah id let her know she can think youre joke isnt funny but she cant insult you but by your own admission youre clingy she may have been ok with it in the past but as you both matured she might feel its too much youre both adults you should be ok without constant contact all day long talk to her tell her you feel shes pulling away or not being as receptive and would appreciate it if she just owned up to what shes thinking and feeling rather than you having to guess nta what is wrong with your bf even if this person likes you they did nothing odd or creepy,Mentalcomposer
to you so why does he care i would tell the person what bf did and that it wasnt you tho just to clear up the situation so this person doesnt go on thinking you like them go ahead and end this these games will never stop and your bf will never take accountability for anything he does mainly because my whole family is here parents are getting older my kids are here and i would never leave them i dont want to be hours and a flight away if there is an emergency plus my life here is good slight yta why is the bf not going to be in school if they would both be home all day then no i wouldnt let her i would have told her she can stay home on friday and have a nice 3 day weekend please be aware that just as adults need a mental health day so do kids my kids were always allowed to stay home just because because sometimes they just need,Mentalcomposer
a break especially by hs it can be mentally draining seriously its a month 30 measly days you are not in love you are not sexually satisfied and you dont want to wait so do what any one would break up and find someone whos not a virgin and date them amazing that at 30 yo you need to be told this it doesnt matter if one of you is home for him now this marriage may not last thats the problem how old are you guys she seems immature your wife needs to figure out what it is she wants either her marriage or affirmation from others because she cannot have both put a hold on the foster and have a heart to heart with your wife shes still talking to this guy which means shes getting something from him that she isnt fri you and thats not necessarily your fault no one can be absolutely everything for another person the last few cruises i went on they lined up the boarding group,Mentalcomposer
we had to put our bags on the floor and the sniffer dogs came by so be careful idk what vacuum sealing does but just saying and why does that not immediately scream that this guy is just looking for a wife anyone will do you are just way too naive to realize it hasnt he been in trouble previously how does he keep getting elected or how has no watchdog group been keeping a close eye on him i agree i hate the way it looks even tho i currently have this look haha i dont have very big roots showing but theyre there and i see it a lot more than anyone in my family notices brown to blonde isnt hard to upkeep but it has to be done very often and im due but i just got home from vacay so i scheduled it but its gonna be a few days also depending on what process i have the brown can be made to almost blend into the blonde so its,Mentalcomposer
not all flat blonde but highlighted blonde with still some brown so it isnt as obvious youre only 25 theres no shame in living at home if not now then when in your life would you ever be able to save as much as you can youre lucky that your salary affords you a chance to get yourself financially ahead why spend money unnecessarily your gf cares more about what your money can do for her she has said you two should have a lavish lifestyle and travel but the thing is she cant afford to do that only you can afford to finance her lavish lifestyle id break up with her honestly but you need to think about if you want a partner who has goals closer to your own and she doesnt she thinks youre boring unless you can lavish luxuries on her and its only going to get worse as you make more money shell want bigger and better by your own chart it takes 95000 just to start up a,Mentalcomposer
daycare less if the contingency and working capital is lower so lets say you magically find a benefactor for that money im not sure i understand how youre going to lower the cost even if its not for profit it needs to self sustain at some point being transparent in how the money is spent is all well and good but it doesnt make up for the fact that running a business takes money you could run the tightest budget but there is an absolute bottom line needed to run teacher costs need to be in line with teacher salaries especially that pre school is in a sense a specialty i proposed the admin being paid at the same rate of a teacher so no excess bloat there and at a modest 45000 year for each of those positions were at 9000year per child ok so we take a loss for a year or two weve only got about 40000 contingency and capital how long will that last we add in older kids for,Mentalcomposer
a smaller ratio and increased income thats another teacher but we have to get them to the center after school do we need a van or a bus maybe we add night or weekend baby sitting service for a small fee we still have to pay an adult for that we can ask for volunteers older folks who are retired or moms that have their kids enrolled they dont add to the payroll but they need to be bonded maybe you dont have your own building maybe utilize empty classrooms in a school or community center of the town im sorry i feel like im missing something but am very intrigued to see a way for your idea to work so i think your idea sounds great in theory but a quick search brought me to the staff child ratio for kids 2 124 is 1t for every 10 ks so lets assume a teacher salary of 45000year conservatively that divides to 4500year per child just to pay for a teacher add to that,Mentalcomposer
at least one administratorrent insurance supplies and idk what else lets say we pay the admin the same as the teacher so were looking at 9000 per child before factoring in any other expenses the average cost of daycare in nj is between 1012000 a year so based on these numbers i cant see how you can run a childcare center for less than most parents are paying now and even if you dont take a salary to start at some point youre going to want or need to draw a salary now i dont know if the state has any programs that help with daycare costs if so then maybe its doable you might be better off getting a home based daycare license and having less children while also incorporating a learning atmosphere maybe your friend is the boring one and he needs drunk you to make his party a success or youre just really fun at parties drunk or not and he just thinks youre drunk because you are such fun and,Mentalcomposer
hes too drunk to tell the difference i would be slightly insulted by someone saying that so go to the party have a few but dont get drunk and be your fun self nah you havent actually explained why you dont want your h to take this job has it occurred to you that he has been out of sorts for 3 years and maybe your h feels like he needs to work a lot of people get their self worth from working and contributing to the family plus you mention insurance which if you dont have is kind of important how is his health now can he even handle this job why exactly do you not want him working is it his health or do you need him home with the child so you can grow your business or do you just not want him gone for 2 weeks at a time because then you have to do it all does your business cover all of your bills or are you dipping into,Mentalcomposer
savings every month its always better to have more savings than less you need to find out why he wants this job at this time if he has legitimate reasons then maybe you should try to support him in this if you need to you can put your child in daycare while you work on your business will it be hard while hes gone absolutely but supporting our partners is part of the deal he supported i dont mean just monetarily you when you wanted to start your business ok i have to ask what exactly is he doing for work hes in an awful rush for someone who is a spender why is he in such a rush its been 6 years he can wait another 2 youre both still so young you say you have money saved for a house down payment i cant help but wonder if he sees you as his cash cow has he saved any money since he dropped out of school sit down and reiterate to him,Mentalcomposer
that you have always said you will not be married until you have completed your schooling and have a stable job let him know this is what you want and him constantly bothering you when you are still in school is useless because even if you wanted to marry right now you wouldnt im sure hes a great guy but think long and hard if you who from all youve said sets a goal and works towards them and achieves them while he seems more like flitting from one to another thing based on his whims you need to see how comparable you two are when youre both out in the real world rent bills chores etc you may find you want a guy who is more on your wavelength nta who believes that youre a fool if you learn from your own mistakes isnt that the point make mistake learn from it dont do it again does she keep making the same mistake over and over again in this case her saying she,Mentalcomposer
knows shes right and youll continue it at another time just means she will harp on this until you agree with her and she can then gloat about it yta how has this conversation not come up in 3 years stop brow beating the poor kid his mother has told you how she feels maybe you should try listening to her it is quite possible that you arent as all knowing as you think you are i will say tho one way to get kids in the habit of please and thank you is to just always say it yourself they hear it and model it it almost becomes rote to say it kind of like amen at church thats my experience anyway its 3 months youre not officially bfgf and hes asking telling strongly encouraging you to get rid of something youve had from your childhood nope not happening adults are allowed to have comfort things him saying hes there to comfort you is weird to me like only he can do that,Mentalcomposer
for you you keep that bear forever and take him out when you need to you got this now hope hes a good kisser okay i can better see why you wouldnt want her there but she really wont be able to outshine you at your own wedding as long as she doesnt get the dance which is easily done what else could she do you let the photographer know to put her in her place you get the band to ignore her requests and you warn her shell be tossed if she gets out of hand if you might want things to get better then ask sis if shes be willing to go to therapy with you maybe an outside person explaining to her why her attitude is harmful to you may just make her take a back seat at your wedding or just dont invite her but that plays into her idea that you know shes better than you and thats why you dont want her there good luck dont stress too,Mentalcomposer
much you have a year to figure it out how about at the end of the night when he drops you off at home you can just flirtingly say something like what no good night kiss it will only be a teeny tiny moment of fear but i guarantee you he will kiss you good night ywnbta im struggling to understand what is wrong between you and your sister i understand sm being nicer to sis but thats not her doing anything wrong she was a child at the time too so i can understand you not having anything to do with dad and sm but you got along well enough with sis to be a bridesmaid for her just so i understand tho you dont want her there because you think shes going to somehow have a fd dance with step dad at your wedding easily fixed you tell the band they cannot under any circumstances take song requests and you also let sd know what shes thinking and ask him to not,Mentalcomposer
dance with sis at all if he understands the whole dynamic and realizes the place he has in your life he should be willing to do that thats what i was talking about put that on your tik tok your insta anywhere you use social media and ill add the florida law has a rape exception also but it has to reported you may be toxic but that comment was not how about compiling a list of birth control resources put it on tik tok instagram twitter places younger women might frequent and fb for the older women take a diff approach and try to prevent an unwanted pregnancy instead of having to deal with it after the fact and have a connection resources that connects women willing to fund bc for women who cant afford it well the easy hard answer is to find a job in london and move there you have a roommate now so get one there or find a job in london and live in a suburb close enough,Mentalcomposer
to enjoy the city but less expensive what kind of engineer are you this is what i always thought also just let me get up and walk off then the rest can deal with getting their bags and while were revamping debark can we just board the plane by rows starting at the back please ill even let first or business board before me theyre not the problem find a boy scout troop in your area they would be happy to have it they do lots of camping and might have kids that dont own gear elementary schools have cub scout troops but boy scout troops usually arent run through a school but if you can get in touch with a cub troop they can put you in touch with a boy scout troop that they usually feed into tomatoes i could not stand the texture of the seeds even now i wont eat the seeds in the big tomatoes i cut them out but can handle the small cherry tomatoes i love the,Mentalcomposer
way he says itll never happen with you two because you arent going to have kids as if thats where he draws a line pretty convenient for a guy who doesnt want kids but what happens if he for whatever reason decides hes not sexually attractive to you or what if you get sick and cant have sex for a while is it ok then for him to cheat because you know he just cant go without i feel like you are going to be doing anything you can to keep him from cheating probably to your own detriment and it wont make a diff anyway im thinking hes already cheating when youre not there he cant possibly be expected to go without his sex needs being met for a whole month gasp if i was you id slow this relationship way down if he wants to move to canada ok but hed be getting his own place but im not you so id get rid of this guy i want my partner to,Mentalcomposer
go into a relationship with the absolute idea that he has found the person he wants to be with and not having pre conceived ideas of circumstances of when hed cheat 11 hours non stop to hawaii in economy this was the smallest seat ive ever been in i dropped my ear bud right in front of my seat and had to contort my body to reach for it im not a large person either made it 7 hours ok but the last 4 were really really tough and then had to do it again to get home the whole family agrees that well never do that again im not in texas but im not so sure there are specific parking lot laws drive slowly thru the lot i think my shopping center has a 10 mph speed sign yes please stop for pedestrians crossing in front of your car the lane directly in front of the stores near me have stop signs usually close to each of the stores entrances exits you dont,Mentalcomposer
have to stop as soon as you see a person but it really depends on how far away they are from you if theyre like 2 stores away you slow down and or stop until they cross id wait until the person was pretty close to the other side of the road before scooching past especially if theyre older or have children with them just so they feel safer better to be safer and drive slow or stop if youre not sure nta i would not apologize for any of it substance or tone your tone needed to be what it was to get the message across that he is no longer welcome to stay too bad if it upset him you basically said what your mother has been unable to do on her own he needs to get out your mom said she needs a break from him so now she has it wouldnt the line be drawn by what are natural genetic advantages to a person if one is just as is,Mentalcomposer
said naturally gifted in a sport should they be not allowed to participate because its not fair to the other participants their genetic make up is basically what is making them what we would call naturally gifted but with trans women athletes they have an unnatural advantage over women due to their genetic make up as being born as men hormones may counteract some of this but it is never going to completely reverse the effects of the genetic processes of male puberty on things like strength and muscle mass are we talking during a marriage or a dating situation why would you think that just because one person cheated you will never find another who wont cheat,Mentalcomposer
if you were looking for someone who is eager to have children and be a stay at home parent and therefore needed a provider then sure lead with your salary if what you want is a partner who is also independent and driven lead with that shitty behaviour on that first date sounds like dating just the risk of dating and not really a political leaning issue maybe you want to enforce a bit more chatting before agreeing to meet 14 years ago i sucked it up and met his ex i was nervous and threatened but she was good people i didnt always like their dynamic but it was a friendship no doubt 6 years ago she was the only one who asked me if i was okay she was concerned about how she saw me being treated that relationship 4 years ago when he and i broke up she was the second person i called after my own mother since these shes been one of the first ive called for every major,MLeek
life event weve flown across the county 5 times for long visits i know its not everyones experience but its hard when i see these sorts of questions not to imagine how much poorer my life would be without her in love didnt last forever but our shitty ex boyfriend had excellent taste in women its not your fault that this adult person doesnt make good choices to care for himself or kind choices when it comes to how he treats you no matter what your flaws were what he did texting you a year later and then blocking you was unkind dont feel guilty be slightly pissed with him he lobbed an emotional grenade at you either because he didnt realize he wasnt actually capable of speaking with you or because he just wanted the drama even if it wasnt completely intentional attentionseeking and shitdisturbing it still was unkind you already had this figured out hes not sad because of you hes sad because he has a toxic and untrue story he tells,MLeek
himself about you hes cast you as a character in his personal pity play its not really about you youre not doing anything to him hes doing it to himself and then making bad choices that make you seem complicit but youre not its a character he likes to make you play but youre not person he is making you out to be give yourself a break and let it go if you dont trust her judgment dont date her its okay to be uncomfortable but thats a problem you solve by leaving a relationship that doesnt work for you not by insisting her ignore her own judgements about someone shes known for years they are barely in contact at this point youre being absurdly insecure you should be waiting for the other shoe to drop maybe it wont but the odds arent good and you shouldnt be putting you faith in this change right now you are performing service a lot of a highly feminized and necessary sort of service for him hes,MLeek
comfortable with you in that role he likely feel grateful but also he is under no work stress or financial stress and hes probably a bit dependent on you still as he becomes more independent and needs to return to work it is likely he will return to past behaviours you are right to be skeptical and you should speak with him about your concerns that he will change back as soon as hes placed under stress or his need of you is less im pretending to have valid criticism of social media and how many men engage with it but really im just shaming and insulting women who dont arouse me personally ditto my 30s have brought me more attention from men than my 20s ever did and a little bit of it is even gracious and positive in ways it never ways in my 20s a man on the street yesterday eyed me over and i was ready for the hit but he said those shoes that hair those sunnies youre pure,MLeek
joy today and then he just kept walking no demand for further attention or time he actually just complimented me it is mindblowing to remember it is possible to say something to a woman you dont know that was only meant to lift them up and not to disempower them or remind them that they are a sexual option for you the quick trick that often helps is to not say what youre doing wont get you what you want but to say are you sure that is what you want because it doesnt seem to me that what youre doing right now is moving you towards that i dont want her to doubt herself its okay for people to doubt themselves if their current choices arent lining up with what say they want to achieve its okay to ask questions and point out that what they say they want isnt lining up with what they are doing that is exactly the moment you need to doubt yourself a bit and reconsider either what,MLeek
youre doing or what it is you actually want im not sure what youre looking for youve described a person who knows why she is dating for fun experience and status not a serious partnership and is choosing this for herself on balance she sounds content thats fine the only real problem here is that you think the younger person easily mistakes the appearance of maturity in an older person for actually being mature thats not unique to young women dating older men we all do make that mistake from like 5 years old to 50 years old with our teachers and bosses and parents everyone older than us we have to be constantly remembering and relearning that isnt the case and most of us struggle with that lesson in our teens and 20s im not sure what elaboration youre looking for im talking about misogynistic comments about women over 30 and youre talking about your one friends personal pretty selfaware dating choices at this moment in her own life i think you might,MLeek
be at risk of being overinvested in this one persons dating life and looking to draw more connections that actually exist because 30 often actually equals sufficient life experience and a wide enough list of her own responsibilities already to be fully over your crap i watched nearly all of the women in my peer group get into thier 30s and realize they have been lied to men arent overgrown eightyearolds with sex drives but competent human beings who can manage their own shit and be expected to treat us as human beings the incels like to frame this realization as a hatred for men but honestly im not sure i really loved any of the men in my life until i realize this was true for all of them they can do it many choose not to i also watched my twin brother go through the realization that women are not stupid dependants and decide he wanted a partner who saw him as a person first and not a stoic provider it does,MLeek
cut both ways but like most misogyny it cuts more women deeper and in a more deadly way so we react more strongly itll be much easier for you to not have contact with her mother when shes not locking herself in a hotel room and refusing to communicate with you and others i understand how you are feeling but we are teenagers and you were in crisis i was scared your mother involved me and i needed support and communication from the adults involved in that moment those adults included your mom expecting me to ghost your mother during that situation when i was scared your mother was scared and you were refusing to communicate with either of us is not fair to me you were not doing what her ex did and sharing her secrets she had created a highstress situation where no one could have thought clearly about her boundaries because they were addressing her behaviour if she wants to be angry with her mother for involving you she needs to,MLeek
take that up with her mother once you were involved expecting you to ghost her mother during that situation is ridiculous if she wants things handled differently she has a lot of power in the future to behave differently herself and bring the panic and drama down like nine notches dont grovel acknowledge her feelings but be clear you behaved reasonably in an unreasonable situation and if she doesnt like it she needs to not put other people in that situation i mean we make fun of men for not knowing how much work goes into the no makeupnatural look but selfgratifying little liars like this arent helping anyone these asshats all men are inherently violent and sexstarved animals not be trusted around the women i have assigned value to also these asshats i dont understand why the woman wont give me the benefit of the doubt im actually a nice guy who just believeswhenitsconvientforhim that all men are violent sexstarved animals these women must be worthless sluts who only want violent sexstarved animals,MLeek
you need to let the blame go for good before you talk to her this should not be you picking a fight and behaving like she did a bad bad thing to you this should you be letting her know you didnt like how you left the subject and letting her know what your beliefs and insecurities are and then listening to hers sincerely and with the assumption shes a decent person who isnt out to get you but actually wants mutual understanding as well if she wants an exact talley or your number is too high for her then youre just not compatible no one is wrong or evil youre just wrong for each other youre absolutely overthinking and ascribing malice where there may only be understanding between longterm friends the look was just as likely if not more likely to be about your gf being chronically late than about you telling and yes a couple bickering in a group setting is awkward or can be charming or even annoying that is a,MLeek
thing you should try not today do but these level of sensitivity is excessive you cannot share your own frustrations like her being late and bicker like that in front of them and then be frustrated when people feel they have insight recognize you have helped to create this dynamic and that you are probably misreading it and assuming there is way more negativity in it than there is you need to get your own brain in order your friends didnt do anything to you what she is telling you now is that from the beginning she was manipulative gameplaying and testing you she downloaded tinder only because she wanted you to respond a certain way and now shes calling it cheating that you treated her like she was an honest person who said what she meant now she is either for a excuse to blame you and keep you insecure in this relationship or an excuse to break up with you either way this woman has told you that shes the one who,MLeek
from the beginning was being unkind and reasonable and plans on continuing that way dont be in that relationship if its a break up great thats the right outcome here for you so you believe she was wrong to ask and your answer was perfect and you are still twisting yourself into knots because of the ways you are assuming she might have interpreted your ideal answer give your head a shake this is not about her right now her asking isnt the issue youre working through right there your partner isnt responsible for addressing every passing bad feeling youre having and certainly not for reading your mind she didnt do you wrong she just did something that didnt work for you but if you want to build something real with her you need to actually talk to her about your beliefs and insecurities this id be so frustrated by his cowardice and avoidance right now its been fives days he had said nothing that bodes really poorly for his ability to be accountable,MLeek
and make change my ex did this hed blow up over a game or us running late over a miscommunication or at a uber driver or waiter and withdraw for days then hed suddenly become cuddly and affectionseeking i mistook this for an apology for the longest time but he never apologized he was just self soothing taking a time out and pressuring me into providing him with validation when he was done seething about it definitely talk to him about maybe including your disappointment at needing to broach the subject and do the emotional heavy lifting here when he was the one who behaved poorly nope probably not gonna work out might anything might but the odds are bad relationships can go through periods of reduced contact by mutual agreement that is tough but can be workable if both people know what theyve actually agreed to specifically like how many callstexts in a week are expected and visits if any but if you and she cannot agree what a committed girlfriendboyfriend relationship looks,MLeek
like during these next six months then its a breakup and attempts to stay in contract without those sorts of very clear agreements on what that contact looks like exactly are just gonna cause drama and hurt feelings if you cant have those tough conversations about your needs and how much contacttime is needed to maintain this connection then its a breakup and its more likely than not to remain one in six months time why stay in a relationship with someone who you need to ignore in order to maintain really basic selfesteem why do you have to show him these comments dont impact you what does that achieve they do impact you because of course they do youre human you pretending better that they dont hurt isnt going to stop the comments or improve anything you cant keep drinking position every day and only wonder how to feel better or pretend to feel better about drinking poison every day drinking poison every day is gonna cause pain if your man is posioning,MLeek
you every day get rid of him yeah thats not a blip thats a selfabsorbed jerk who isnt just rejecting you or giving you pointers hes outright insulting you i have never called someone i love a horny mess except as a compliment you tell your friends you dont particularly want to hang out with him in a group setting and ask them if its something that is a priority for them during the trip youre not selfish for not exposing yourself to a situation you reasonably believe you will not find pleasant or enjoyable if you actually want to have a coffee with him say so but you dont do you not really thats fine give yourself permission to close this door and if your friend would really like to grab a drink with him take yourself to a show or something everyone will be fine they are grownups and can make choices about how they spend their energy just like you can everything that he used to say he likes i do,MLeek
and now hes telling me he hates it and its killed the mood is this what hes actually saying have you told him this is how youre experiencing his behaviorrejection of you because a person who cares about you and wants to have mutually enjoyable sex with you should be appalled if my partner said this to me id be devasted and willing to walk through fire to correct that and work with them on our sex life he should not want to say things that leave you with this impression is it possible this isnt a blip and youre boyfriend is behaving like a real piece of shit right now in more ways than just boundarybusting texts this is unlikely to work if youre broken up then youre broken up and six months is a long time to be broken up if she has limited time youd both be better of discussing what the relationship needs to look and behave like within those limits it you break up then youre broken up and,MLeek
those regular calls and texts are more likely to hurt than anything else because the expectations will be completely unclear hun i say this with love but ya aint teenagers some dry list from cosmo in the 90s aint gonna feel very validating you need think first about what makes you feel sexy odds are very very good that anything that makes you feel good about yourself even just a bit will work for him just dandy also the dumbass is a 34yearold man he needs to be able to tell you what really gets his engine running and you need to consider what on that list overlaps with the kinds of things that might make you feel confident if something on his list is revolting to you ignore it easy focus on what piques your curiosity or makes you feel sexy or even just pleasantly silly this is disrespectful and bullying behavior dont try to make him understand you are right require him to acknowledge he is harming his very new relationship with,MLeek
you when he refuses to listen to you and treat your opinions with the respect they deserve red flag hes 32 even if this is a thing he wants he should know that a it is objectively fast and b that he shouldnt be using his past or his hurt to pressure you dont try to read his mind speak for yourself today youre not doing that its too soon for you he doesnt need to understand he needs to show he can respect a simple reasonable boundary youre not ready to discuss moving in together dont do it the truth wont help you much if at all far more likely this will delay your healing and cause a spiral not knowing is the hardest part ill never ask my ex though i enjoy him not being part of my life too much and there would be no reason to believe any answer he gave hed lie either to protect himself or to wound me real closure comes when you just let go of,MLeek
what you can never know for sure and accept they have nothing for you nothing you either want or need youre off limits do not do this you have every reason to believe this contact would be unwelcome your motivations are purely selfserving this is not just a geunie thank you it it an attempt to reengage someone who has made it very very clear they do not want contact with you no matter how much you claim its not an attempt to get her attention and validation and renew contact with her it is exactly that and everyone involved knows it she has no obligation to address your experiences or your personal growth also its been two damn months your selfreported change is just not believable i am sorry but as an outsider looking in the idea that you have made significant lasting changes in two months is an absurdity no reasonable person would extend you the kind of benefit of the doubt youre looking for do not do this end it hes,MLeek
holding a gun to the head of the relationship because he doesnt like how you engage with your parents thats lunacy and not fixable maybe you do need new strategies for dealing with your parents but youll get those in therapy not from an overbearing bf no shes not wrong for asking it was a disagreement a moment of imperfect compatibility between your views it wasnt a violation to ask its okay for her to have questions that make you feel momentarily uncomfortable its also okay to not answer its okay for a couple to disagree on subjects like this you feel icky about it because you didnt express your disagreement you feel like shit because your own actions didnt line up with your own beliefs that doesnt mean she was wrong for asking it means you didnt recognize and honour your own beliefs and boundaries when she did and that is a shitty feeling but its not once she forced on you she just asked you didnt handle the question the way you,MLeek
would have liked to that doesnt make her the bad guy for asking its dealt with your fianc has told her that her behaviour changes nothing she gets to have her little pity party and you and your fianc get to ignore her there is nothing to deal with right now let her sulk as things progress your fianc can inform her of what his expectations of her are in terms of her behaviour and you can discuss what the next steps are if she continues to make inappropriate comments you cant prove to her that you dont hate his family because it wasnt a reality to begin with she wont respond to evidence or argument so the answer from your fiance is simply i dont agree and that and if you are going to keep saying it i am going to stop speaking with you i its not a problem you have to solve that she feels badly she gets to go off and sit in the corner and feel as shitty as,MLeek
she wants to she just doesnt get to throw her verbal shit at either of you i do not like women who are not quiet and slightly fearful of me hah the too blunt makes me laugh like you want us to be gentler and more subtle about the fact were fully human i hope people who say that really mean the satire wasnt always on point and sometimes fell a bit flat or got cluttered in so many unresolved plot lines id agree with that but even without sharing your thoughts perspective entirely blunt sounds like tone policing to me immediately skeptical abusive people can weaponize anything so sure possible but when i listen to men who have been abused i dont hear this phrasing this phrase belongs to men who have been dumped by someone who didnt want to have sex with them or who choose to stay in a relationship where there was obvious sexual incompatibility not struck with a weapon thats certainly how i took it i thought those last,MLeek
two mins or so were some of the best satire in the movie i also thought it was a great way to make the viewer confront their own sense of injustice for the kens they only got a bit of token representation ok what do you want immediate parity regardless of qualification or experience affirmative action reparations or redistribution tell me exactly how equity should have been immediately achieved for the kens and then tell me why it wouldnt be appropriate in the real world no poor man is going to complain when people start liking them for his wealth basically every study on lotto winners would directly dispute this i know you dont want to hear this but you do need reevaluate how other people may experience your words because it really doesnt take much you got piled on here and that sucks but the take away could be that when youre honest about your beliefs about other women it really turns a lot of other women off so you either need to,MLeek
change how you speak about other women or how you think about other women or both or youll continue to struggle to connect i believe you when you say you dont think youre doing it but i doubt its true i doubt based on how you choose to speak here that youve just been unlucky 100 of the time possible but at 29 not super likely that it is entirely everyone else who is the problem with men you can reflect these sorts of passive negative attitudes about other women being jealous or belittling and theyll pretty much never call you on it they tend to agree and be open to that framing of women and their friendships and these comments can be super subtle your version of speaking normally may include assumptions and biases youre not able to see right now you really should keep an open mind on this one with women you havent built a secure connection with and a foundation of trust the words youve used here are only going,MLeek
to inform them that you are exactly that kind of woman that you are trying to avoid adult women who dont like those mean girl vibes are really hypersensitive to them and will withdraw their emotional effort incredibly quickly if they get a whiff of it the judgement might not be fair or snap or shallow but its also strong and in selfdefence much the same way youre sensitive to feeling belittled or competed with if you find you are only encountering women who hand over those sorts of bad vibes and arent ever connecting with ones who dont youre doing yourself a disservice by not looking inward at this point or just decide not to pursue female friendships at all which is a choice i think is totally valid opting out is always an option opting out actively and without resentment can even sometimes even be a good way to release irrational assumptions that are impacting you it sounds like you may have experienced that when it comes to dating men yes the,MLeek
movie took several well aimed swings at wokeness i dont know what they are about either i literally saw a random guy this morning posting and getting a lot agreement that the barbie movie was proof no one cared about mens mental health and im baffled because a barbie did a way better job addressing men dealing some valid big feels than average and b it would never have occurred to me to whine that misson impossible didnt adequately address abortion rights i mean the legitimate thing you need to do with that sort of feedback is go okay youre not able to reflect in a helpful way on this or were just not compatible either way okay byeeee most people you ask for this sort of feedback arent gonna be able to reflect on it very well its why i rarely bother its tough to find someone who a doesnt like you much and b is able to reflect thoughtfully and generously enough to explain why in a way that is helpful this,MLeek
might be a good example of a selffulfilling prophecy you can justifiably disagree with this take but this assumption of extreme malice and intensity of response is going to continue exactly the dynamic you want to avoid any woman who is not into this energy giving or receiving it is gonna do exactly what uwinnimae said and probably just quietly stay away from you you think youre defending yourself but all youre doing is making it clear youre not safe to engage with the women who are gonna continue to engage with you after being on the receiving end of this sort of response would only be assholes who like the drama i disagree that you need to speak to the women who feel wronged by you some if not most of them probably were assholes lots of people are but you do need to refine your assholedetection both by not overapplying the belittle and jealous labels and also by just not engaging when you feeling those labels do apply because choosing to respond,MLeek
to this and respond in this way was a misfire and the kind of thing that is gonna reinforce your existing patterns and keep you feeling isolated unfortunately it creates a selffulfilling prophecy because you end up attracting exactly the kind of people who will mistreat you as a matter of course exactly cause the only woman who is going to say oh totally women are always jealous of me too teehee are the women who are gonna pull exactly the sort of shit op wants to be avoiding personal reflection not medical advice most of my cycles are fine but every once and a while i have a rough one and a muscle relaxant like robax gets me through it doesnt actually stop the cramping it doesnt impact those muscles it just stops it from impacting your skeletal muscles as much so your back and shoulders and hips all the other places where you feel it or get tight with the stress of it thats what i really need not the cramping itself,MLeek
but the way the bad cramping causes the rest of my body to seize and sort of echos through since you said the walk is stressing you out it might be a thing to give a try but if youve never taken them before i wouldnt take em until youre safely at home they might zonk you out a bit id call it if you can you might even find the walk helps honestly the only reason to see it right now is to best appreciate them losing their shit over it my two cents its a good movie a few laughoutloud moments but it was also kind of all over the place it was at least 25 minutes too long with too many plotlines that didnt quite come together in the end the way these guys are twisting themselves in tantrums though thats the real show this week yes she very clearly validated his feelings apologized for her wrongdoings clarified her feelings for him broke up with him and gave him some really,MLeek
good advice on finding his worth as an individual this is like a b break up at least which this man can clearly see is not barbie just being a decent person to another person but is actually barbie abandoning ken to ride the cock carousel and refusing to fulfill her assigned feminine role as kens personal therapist and sex object hes not misleading you or trying to tell you halftruths hes told you the exact truth and drawn a clear reasonable boundary i really dont know what you dont understand he is ashamed its dirty he doesnt want it to reflect on himself and how you see him youve gotten the message more clearly than most people would offer it and it makes total sense it is a reasonable feeling you cannot cure him of or declare yourself magically exempt from its a boundary you need to respect even if you cannot perfectly comprehend everything that is true for him its time to accept this as true for him and lay the hell,MLeek
off of it i really dont know why you think it would need any further explanation or any challenging at all it doesnt youre 22 his parents home shouldnt be central to his selfidentity even if hes stuck living in it for a while longer if you are worried about his comfort in your parents home ask him if he is worried about anything about the visit dont micromanage or assume ask tell him if something does comes up tell him you hope hell share it with you so you can support him and help him figure out any normsexpectations that are unique to your family all families are unique meeting them is stressful its not just a classwealth thing i think the third possibility is a bit of bad luck with some poor boundaries with asshole women which has been turned itself into a selffulfilling narrative ucroftygirl by the time i hit my late 20s women who told me they had no female friends or that said things like women have always been,MLeek
horrible to me for no apparent reason were huge red flags and reason enough in themselves to avoid friendship with that woman like honestly if you told me what you said above over coffee id be cooling it with you big time i know its not fair but ive also been burned by women in friendships we all have and a lot of us have been burned by people who talk like that about other women if you are ever giving new potential women friends in your life the vibe or the narrative that you suspect all women of jealousy and drama and betrayal then the mature and secure women who are not inclined to that behaviour are more likely to avoid you not step up to prove you wrong about themselves id suggest you reconsider and maybe reframe this as an issue of your own peoplepleasing urges and struggle to select your friends well instead of an issue of other women always do x if we had coffee and you said ive made,MLeek
some bad choices with female friends in the past and accepted treatment i shouldnt have itd be taken 100 differently than women are always jealous of me no no no it is stated that someday the kens will enjoy the same equity that women do in the real world which is the finest shade in the whole film barbie is gonna keep this sub lively for a while besides the obvious i cannot imagine what an idiot you have to be to believe that barbie was still individually responsible for kens wellbeing at the end of that movie youre unhappy youre disconnected being grateful for someone who cooks isnt gonna sustain a relationship youre allowed to be not okay with cocaine use even just a little he doesnt get to declare it doesnt impact you that is your call go to therapy alone first decide if you actually want to work on this relationship or not they dont estrus is part of many female mammal cycles but not in humans or the great apes,MLeek
were kind of an exception as mammals with placentas go but we are the exception some women do experience changes in their level of arousal or sexual interests at different points in their cycles and not always coinciding with ovulation but we do not experience heat like cats or horses its not a thing human bodies do fun theory the reason we dont need estrus is because weve used sex for bonding and pleasure for several hundreds of thousands of years what he calls the a bonus is likely why the biological function was not a necessary use of energy for the females of these species but dont get at these types with any real evolutionary science especially not the kind that says human women actually do like sex i honestly thought that was one of the things they got right and presidentsnarrators responses were perfect cause otherwise were talking about affirmative action edi initiatives and possibly even reparations brilliant way to force the viewer to address their feelings of injustice when the kens,MLeek
only get thrown a bonetoken representation and in a world where they were by systemic design utterly incapable and locked out of any leadership roles the patriachy looked fun and appealing i mean yes in the world of barbieland it was funny but it also immediately dissolved into war and the complete breakdown of responsible governance the moment the kens experienced some uncomfortable feels so yeah lets pass on that in a world with actual nukes i actually do agree that ken had a wonderful beginning of an arc of realizing that neither barbie nor the patriarchy was a replacement for basic selfesteem autonomy and personal purpose i dont feel like they totally hit the mark but it was a great note for women at the beginning of their own feminist journeys the man you love wont save you and feminism doesnt fix your life either you save you inside a fucked up and flawed system i honestly didnt love the movie it was solid fun but not brilliant but one of the best,MLeek
things was how they tried to let ken be a pickme who began just began to see the error of that but also didnt make barbie solely responsible for fixing him or supporting him in this next stage it was pretty meta but most of that flew right over this mans head i guess cause he still seems to think feminism is braburning and power suits and cannot be not pink and sparkles its been two years hes not new to this hes making an active choice to keep his relationship and his friend group entirely separate he made that choice during a fight with you and then he kept it up for months afterwards and that is a valid choice a person can make but that it doesnt mean you need to be okay with it you need to put your fomo aside you say youre not entitled but you are still talking about your sense of entitlement to being included on occasion and thats not the issue and not something you get,MLeek
to control you dont even actually want to be friends with these people the only issue here is the way your bfs choices undermine your trust in him and dont help to create the kind of relationship you want to be in these people these individuals do not want to be your friends and frankly it doesnt sound like scapegoating they dont like you they dont want contact with you as much as you dont want it to be relevant to your question it is sounds like a few of them have good reason to simply not like you and thats fine they dont have to like you the question is how your bf balances that its not a question of forcing them to include you on occasion if someone is scapegoating you here its your bf hes not just leaving the shit hes the one who took the dump the group didnt do it it didnt just happen he did it the group isnt doing this to you your bf is they dont,MLeek
have to like you them not liking you much can be totally fair but isnt even the core of the problem here sometimes we dont vibe with our partners group and thats okay youre not entitled to being one of the crew they dont owe you any reply its not on them to do the work to be on friendly terms with you if they dont want to reaching out to them directly because your bf is treating you poorly was a mistake but that isnt all of what happened here and your relationship is absolutely not perfect if your bf is only able to maintain his close friendships by throwing you under the bus with them it is reasonable to fear that is what he has done you need to stop scapegoating the group or feeling entitled to inclusion with them youre not what do need to stand up for is your need to be respected and secure in your relationship with your bf hes the one who has lost your trust and,MLeek
hurt you feelings because of how hes chosen to engage with these other people this is 100 a choice your bf has made and is keeping on making to spend his time with people who you very reasonably fear blame you for all of his choices because that is exactly the dynamic your bf has encouraged from them hes playing them and you off one another to keep his life comfy and his game is threatened if you actually encounter one another or treat one another with basic humanity i heard some of the same comments from men they were baffled that the good guys didnt immediately make full space at the top for the kens with total equity so you mean affirmative action with maybe some reparations redistribution of the dream homes perhaps that penny dropping yet ken got more than a lot of women or poc ever gets when he got one apology and the external recognition there might be more to him as a person telling someone not to eat poison,MLeek
is not the same as telling them you personally refuse to respect them as an individual human being based on their choice of clothing and threatening that those other people who you are constantly empowering and educating to also not respect them might do them harm those are concerning things to like about oppenheimer not the human innovation collaboration and achievement not complex moral questions and big mistakes and scientists struggling with how truth is used by power nope men just like the big bang and blood bath eh they think so little of their own bullshit she didnt know until she was told he was sparing only himself he didnt tell her so he didnt have to do the work and face the risks and consequences of his actions no 90 of men struck by lightning were fishing golfing or playing another sport at time as per usual it their own fucking machismo that gets em i think the relationships that never quite happen are the hardest to get over you stay stuck,MLeek
in the honeymoon phase the whatif phase you dont know their shitty habits and bad choices yet so probably a bit yeah but realistic less than you are whats important now is you figuring out why youre having trouble letting your fantasy of this woman go because you barely knew her its the fantasy the hope the whatif of it all youre hung up on not the person ask yourself why red flag might be a bit much for that comment other things are def red flags here but it was one sign among many this guy is going to be ongoing problem in any healthy transparent relationship agreement not surprised but wouldnt want to picture it isnt a healthy place for a man who is already messing around behind your back id expect a comment more like id be happy for you if you were also getting off while i was gone even if im nervousfearful of hearing about it overall youre just not dealing with a man who is anything like a,MLeek
good headspace to be your partner in nonmonogamy even if nonmonogamy doesnt bother you or even works for you this is as big a deal to you as it is to you i dont think anyone else could make that call some artists really like having a clear separation between their partner and their work others couldnt bear that youll have to figure out which one you are you could also speak to him about his boundaries and limits in storytelling if you think of his as your audience some of the time you may find it rewarding to learn what he prefers and where he draws the line for some it can be a good challenge to write within guidelines very good practice if you want to write professionally youll often have guidelines for context i have been in ethically nonmonogamous relationships and i would dump this man you had a reasonable understanding you were monogamous trust doesnt work on technicalities you both knew he what he was implying was different than what,MLeek
he was doing and he made you do the work of catching and confronting him coward as well as liar and hes already warming up to the argument its okay if i do it but not if you do it its okay to have a nonmonogamous agreement and when you choose not to tell him what you were pretty sure was up you were kind of beginning that kind of agreement however since that he has shown you hes not actually capable of it not in a respectful or healthy way he made you take on the tough emotional work of his breaking the exclusivity agreement when you do become upset and at some point you will because that is all relationships monogamous ones and otherwise he will turn around and tell you its your own fault this is not a man who is taking an accountability hes just fearful of you making him take any i would expect right now youre not upset because youd already accepted his cowardice and his dishonesty but,MLeek
i think need to realize now how much worse not just if he keeps sleeping with others clearly he is going to do that but it gets if he continues to shove off all the work of addresses his betrayal onto you its one thing to have low expectations of someone its another to be cool with nonmonogamy but its a third entirely to be tied to be a person who cannot actually address and take account for their own choices im not calling you a woman hater im calling you flawed im saying you made a mistake and misogyny was a part of your error what makes you dumb in this specific case is your refusal to even entertain it or be intellectually curious about it you may be very smart man in other cases but here you are being that i keep on telling you there were other appropriate and respectful ways to end the conversations you were not finding pleasant or acceptable but your just keep telling me why you dont,MLeek
have to believe your sister what discussion do you want to have the real one where you were hurt and tired and lashed out in anger at your sister in way that was not productive kind or even half as truthful as you tell yourself or the misogynistic discussion one where you keep telling us you were just being reasonable and she was too emotional and not to be believed cause if you want to talk about how you were tried and fed up and hurt and did something stupid and damaging to your relationship im here for it with nothing but support cause weve all been there but if youre only here to discuss how your sister wasnt even abused and youre the one magical person on this planet who totally immune from misogyny and were only being logical go ahead and block me i cant offer you anything for that if you cannot acknowledge wrongdoing here what advicediscussion is even possible youve committed exactly the crime you accused your sister of you,MLeek
need an airbnb or friends couch for a few weeks or a safe place to park overnight its really that simple isnt it and you need legal advice it gets confusing here which house is the subject here who owns what and where the children are fulltime but if the house is yours that josh is currently in then you need legal support to get him out if its both yours and josh then you really need legal advice if your husband is still in the home you two shared with the children you may have a legal right to be there but morally youd be a nutcase to try to enforce that in this context neither of you should want any risk of josh targeting the home the children are in so airbnb couch or car is what ya got youre not going to convince your stxhb this is okay nothing about this is okay you can take the first tiny steps start therapy even if its just over text message or zoom,MLeek
take some leave and visit family or friends without her its not your fault youre being abused abuse works because it is easy to feel beaten down and trapped and it is hard to leave that is how abusers get away with it youre suffering because anyone in your position would be suffering abuse hurts youre reacting like a perfectly normal person may react to extreme emotional abuse try to take some small little steps to crave out a separate space for yourself with therapy as a mentalemotional space or by visiting friendsfamily without her the small steps lead to bigger ones and the direction you need right now is just away from her so you can build up a bit more strength and get away for good me too you should definitely ask me out or that sounds great what are we gonna do on our date next time you can probably afford to be a bit cheeky here when you put it on him to make the next plansuggestion while also reinforcing,MLeek
your interest in him mostly its not legal where i live so i wore steeltoed boots for a long while when i worked the late shift and walked home i have a knife but honestly ive never considered it really for selfdefence its just a tool i carry like a pencil and tap measure but in a pinch i guess id reach for it i feel like most weapons are more likely to be turned on me but the boots i used em twice would recommend if they suit your lifestyle just a little bit of practice and the element of surprise becomes yours i dont know what happened to the first guy but the second guy i got pretty good in the shin and then flat of the palm to the face he was still lying in the parking lot a half hour later so my buddy called an ambulance for him because you wont shut up about it you seem to think its really really important that she left a marriage where,MLeek
by your standards and your report there was absolutely no abuse or mistreatment youve made sure to tell everyone that repeatedly you seem to think this is a very important justification for your behaviour you literally say that fact is why youre skeptical of her narrative skeptical of what exactly not sure why do you think that is such an important fact to undermine her and justify you that she wasnt beaten and why do you continue to ignore the fact that this conflict about you being tired of her venting should have been addressed by admitting your own limits and preferences and making some boundaries on those conversations that would have been the actual reasonable response to your actual problem instead you declared yourself an authority on her marriage and attacked her character you were hurt by some of what she said i get it but you dont seem to realize you were not beacon of logic here thats not what happened you didnt address your hurt you made some shitty hurtful and,MLeek
ignorant remarks lashing out at her while angry and hurt yourself i agree thats the point op only blames his sister only has awful things to say about her without offering much evidence and really appears to think she wasnt entitled to a divorce or pain and anger for anything less than abuse that rose to the level he had determined to be sufficient thats misogyny it just is she may also be a shitty person some women are but op tried to enforced standards on her due to her gender and went on a character attack about a subject he had limited information and a whole heap of bias about and she was rightly having none of that shit the fact that an unkind gendered attack on her was the only tool he had to deal with conversations he didnt want to be a part of followed by a totally insincere apology a year later is really sad damn adult man needs some better interpersonal skills ive read everything youve repeatedly doubled down,MLeek
on your misogyny including the belief she was too emotional to understand her own divorce and that you naturally as a rational man understood better plus the empty threats of physical violence if she had been abused in way a you considered worthy its such standard sexist scripting im embarrassed for you the thing is we are all prone to some amount of misogyny it doesnt make you a monster it makes you a human being who was wrong repeatedly wrong then and here the fact you cant accept that and didnt even bother to address my constructive advice about boundaries suggests you will go on being misogynistic your lack of belief or even basic consideration of reality dont protect you from that it indicts you its good you apologized even if you didnt mean it its kind of ironic that youre actually guilty of the exact thing you accused her of an inability to acknowledge your own wrong doing and the limitations of your own perspective in your shoes i absolutely would bring,MLeek
it up with her directly and in the framing of i know its not a thing eitherof us can solve but joe is clearly all up in feelings about bf planning to propose im sorry hes stressing and i wish men werent such drama llamas how are you doing with it this achieves a few things one it puts the reality out there on the table but paired with the assumptions that you and she both know joe is the one who is having big feels and behaving not so great two it gives her a chance to share her own feelings if she has any those feelings could be yes i wish wed be engaged first or those feelings could be i cannot believe joe is making this about you and your bf your bf really should also tell joe that no actually on second thought he wont be giving him a heads up because hes clearly a bit upset about it and that is not fair to anyone involved this is not,MLeek
about him or about mary he can find out as the rest of the friends do afterwards it sounds like you think he was blameless because he didnt beat her and she was only entitled to abandon him if he hurt her badly enough according to your standards that is misogynistic do you really think your culture is free of misogyny and you are also personally immune because you are clearly demonstrating you are not its good you apologized by your own description you were the egocentric difficult and misogynistic that doesnt make her perfect in her marriage you dont know that and never will that just makes you specifically wrong in this conversation you should have spoken up for your own limits and boundaries if you were finding these conversations draining not gone on the attack its okay to not be available to someone for endless venting but your attack on her character was informed by misogyny pretending it wasnt makes you sound like an idiot if youre invited youre invited if you,MLeek
want to ask him hey you sure you didnt want this to be a guys thing then ask him but he invited you so probably not i have no difficulty seeing the difference between someone being objectively attractive someone i might enjoy having sex with and someone being someone i would want to pursue any sort of sexual relationship with most of my longterm friends arent gonna fall into the middle of the venn diagram but a few might and we may still just be good friends with the sexual attraction being a nonissue maybe its being bisexual but this just doesnt confuse me any and im always shocked when it confuses others like not having a crush can be tricky at times but not having sex with someone for any reason isnt difficult at all its really not and friendship is a series of chosen actions and mutual agreeements not a passing thought call the bluff if he needs to make you the very very bad guy in every fight address it headon,MLeek
and tell him that if that is honestly what he believes about you he has no business dating you if that is who he really thinks you are someone who really intends to hurt him in that way then one of you needs to leave this that is toxic for you both its toxic if its true and its toxic if its not if he cannot believe you or extend any trust to you when you speak about your own thoughts but instead tries to force you to respond to his accusations and assumptions about your intentions and character then he really just thinks youre a shit human being he thinks he knows your mind better than you do and that he has figured you out youre shit doesnt matter what you say or feel he knows that youre shit and an adult man knows what hes doing with these attacks on some level hes going to keep doing it because the kind of relationship he wants to be in includes calling his partner,MLeek
a shit human being whenever he doesnt get everything he wants also pregnancy emotionally i think my risk feels about the same or may even have gone down physically my risk has gone way up but not because im afraid of assault it does suck but hopefully in a little while itll just become further validation for leaving a role where you werent really considered or met with much empathy beyond oh gee i wonder what this means for her relationship and lets start jostling for her position right under her nose just sounds to me like you had correctly understood this wasnt a place to make more meaningful connections give yourself a pat on the back coast through it and focus on your own plans im sorry this happened to you i get the desire but please realize that now that the reason you mishandled is cause your basically decent and reasonable you cannot outasshole him hes a bigger asshole than youll ever be with more natural skill nothing you will do can,MLeek
hurt and frightening him the way hes hurt and frightened you you dont have that power over him you probably cannot shame him or make him recognize wrong doing dont try itll only hurt you my advice text him back that you felt pressured to take his number but have found his comments about your age and your body inappropriate and unwelcome and do not want to speak further no im sorry no thank you just do not speak to me again text or in person then when he blows up your phone with awfulness send it to the gym and let them know why you either expect a full refund or a promise that there is no risk of you ever encountering him on their property again on the off chance he does the right thing and leaves you alone forever then rest assured youve shamed him as much as was humanly possible youre only power is in being reasonable and letting other people see it because men like this will not be,MLeek
he is probably not a pedophile it doesnt help your cause to exaggerate youre not prepubescent but he is aggressively targeting very young women at someone business and if they dont care plenty of women on yelp will yeah shes broken up with him a few times but mostly in comics that were published after margot started playing her i havent done a deep dive but i can only think of one break up that actually stuck and took place before margots version of harleen in 2016 and i just dont think the comics have the same impact on the culture the movies do in the 2010s and beyond not to take anything from the writers who were already contributing to the characters shift but they dont make the same impact on the broad public after suicide squad that robbie version was harley quinn and even suicide squad has a bit of a hint of where they were going with her while i agree that people are going to become more skeptical that is,MLeek
actually why the crime has to be the same whether the images are real or not because the shame the attack is the point not the truth the people who dont want to attack women wont even when the image is real the people who do want to attack and offend and shame will even when the image is fake the abuser is not disempowered as long as they find a welcoming audience and when it comes to sexually degrading a woman they will be able to find that still it may be extremely difficult to enforce but that doesnt mean we dont acknowledge that it is a crime changing the tools doesnt make any other sort of crime okay we wouldnt say oh we have deep fake voices now so identity fraud over the phone is cool your fault if you recorded your voice too much or didnt let the bank know not to give you access that way wild i was just watching secret invasion and thinking wow she still reads hella,MLeek
young for her age i never would have typecast gosling as ken but on the interview circuit hes clearly having the time of his damn life yeah i had liked harley well enough in the cartoon as a little girl but the early comics turned me off of the character and off of dc entirely for a while no she was a producer i kind of skimmed over op mentioning a role because i knew she was a producer did some press for it and that film uniquely pissed people off honestly she has a producer credit on so much awesome stuff dollface and maid jump to mind really hope she gets to take a crack at tank girl havent heard much on that for a while margots version is far far less sexualized than nearly all of the comic books or video game versions of the character making your comparison only to the 1992 childrens version is a bit disingenuous and doesnt really speak to the fact that that version was still subjected,MLeek
to some transparently terrible physical and emotional abuse the relationship wasnt healthier because her flesh was covered in a skintight suit nonrevealing usually wouldnt make one think skintight by the by its perfectly accurate to say she desexualized the character pretty significantly at this point sexualization isnt all about how much of a womans middrift is showing yeah it would totally be unwatchably cringe probably even for a lot of those guys who are now deep into their 30s and 40s and who never thought about what they were actually looking at before abuse really transparent abuse i almost wish it was done so these men could see it through adult eyes and some of them would be able to reconsider like when he tossed her out of the window because she had almost beat batman and his ego couldnt take it or the time she disappeared for a year and he didnt notice or the time she started to get a bit too independent for his tastes so he showed her all the,MLeek
corpses of the women hed loved before who were dressed just like her the carton was bad enough the comics were insanely bad i think this was even promising young women started before that margot robbie reclaimed harley quinn from the manicpixie who worshiped jokers cruelty toxicity and emotional terrorism of her and hypersexualized nympho and there are a huge number of millennial men who will never forgive her for hq becoming a full supercool human being independent of her abuser plus there is this huge group of bitter men online that dont like that women like things have full vivid internal lives with formative experiences and fandoms from childhood to adulthood and have real economic and cultural power now they used to be able to gatekeep us out of their real fandoms but that is getting a bit less effective lately so they need to burn down anything that sniffs of serious fandom or nostalgia and doesnt service them and only them im glad you have a good care team and connected with,MLeek
someone right away on this for your ed im exactly your height and weight and have the same bmi if someone wrote that i appear at a visual observation to be my stated age and moderately obese id just think yeah as a visual observation as something that appears to be true to an observer that checks out im not saying what the doctor did was okay but i really dont know it certainly seems careless and like there should be better standards for noting those sorts of observations about a persons body but i think your disordered thinking is also trying to have it both ways although i dont have an ed my anxiety does this to me a lot tries to make the bad thing simultaneously true as the real thing to absolutely maximize my unhappiness if bmi is bullshit and there is no clinical definition of obese that im aware of that isnt rooted in bmi so its bullshit its not a clinical fact and im not really certain it was,MLeek
being presented as one fatphobic yes problematic yes but documented clinically false statement i think that might be the ed really getting its claws into you and twisting you up and you might want to challenge the idea that that anything clinically true could have been documented regarding bmi in my mind observation and appears is actually where that sort of thing belongs not presented as as some sort of objective fact you talk about sex and partying with a tenyearold but putting that aside these men dont seem to realize this is a really good way to only attract profoundly immature women who do act out and who cannot carry on adult conversations because if you dont believe any other kind of woman exists you will not recognize them and they will quickly decide to stay the fuck away from you i always enjoy the ones who run in and say body count is correlated to cheating when the strongest predictor of infidelity is being male followed closely by having cheated in the,MLeek
past and having come from a family of origin where the adults cheated if youre arguing men shouldnt date women with 20 partners because that risk of cheating is unacceptably high youre also arguing women shouldnt date men at all if were accepting those deeply flawed studies that is how the pure maths actually breakdown thats the comparable risk hes just an asshole when he doesnt have you anymore hell blame it on the weather or the economy or his friends partners youre his emotional punching bag because he doesnt want to take accountability for his own life if youre not ready to break up at least start inviting others to these activities with you and start living your own life again regardless of the validity of her fears id never recommend anyone marry someone who expresses their concerns through emotional manipulation and insults against cultureupbringingcharacter there is no way this ends well if that is what she thinks or how she fights all that work just to try to rob you of the,MLeek
delight youre taking in your ignorance and failing anyways because your position has little basis in reality to begin with nah i can see how youre treating others so ill pass on that offer yes that was my vibe as well feels scammy and not like there was anyway for op to bring up it up without exactly this response someone who doesnt want a prenup is fine thats not the marriage they want i get it but what was said here was exceptionally manipulative and designed to silence op even making some allowances for english as a second language this was an extremely emotionally manipulative and insulting response sponsoring someone can be very expensive and very complicated legally a prenup could protect them both and allow her more confidence in planningbuilding in her own life even if the marriage doesnt work out a prenup cannot go below the legal minimums op would owe and it might actually give her more protection if she choose to leave the country after a separation found the,MLeek
person who had no idea what a prenup actually is beyond what they read on page 6 thats not just someone saying no to a prenup that is someone who is gonna blame the culture anytime something comes up in this relationship she doesnt like she basically said you dont have thoughts or values or feelings of your own just a american culture she has contempt for shes not just wrong but she actually cannot be worked with to find a middle ground once shes behaving that way im a bit concerned how this ldr even began do you mean like globally cause yes if youre including women in developing nations you are unusual in some mba programs you will also appear to be the minority but 62 of master students in the us in 2022 were women so no youre not that special and lots of complete morons making way less than 100k have mbas i dont think i missed it at all i would just skip right to the walking away part,MLeek
because arguing is pointless getting a big emotional reaction from you probably validating experience for them and might even prolong or escalate the engagement once your trying to get the last word with a a crazy asshat youve already lost as far as i can tell so i avoid making any reply at all and if absolutely have to i dont address their point just label my own situation i think thats also okay to say something like i dont really have the bandwidth right now to support you in your dating journey can we change the subject or even and observation like it seems like were retracing the same ground and i dont have anything new to offer at some point the impact of the behaviour on you is the same regardless of what she intends its okay to have some boundaries and to admit when youre not gonna be the best person to offer any support i think all you can is let her know her boundaries and standards are a bit,MLeek
outside of the norm and she needs to speak up early on the first date if she wants verbal consent to any sort of touching at all she absolutely must communicate clearly before she chooses to drink if she refuses to do that then id said shes deliberately setting up a test even most decent men will fail because they have been trained to make the first move and that these are acceptable moves to take nonverbal cues on youre a better friend than me honestly my eyes would be rolling out of my head and id be telling her she clearly doesnt want to date men right now and to stop putting herself and others through it honey to nearly every adult woman over 20 you just look like a kitten on their hind legs adorkable not sexy i feel ya but i suspect most of the men engaging in this behaviour would find that kind of response very validating and a good start to a debate i dont choose to do this,MLeek
there is no reason to try reason youre just giving them a new line of attack absolutely if you suspect they might be in an open marriage that is only more reason to reach out my partner and i are openish and one women he made out with at party reached out to me and i was delighted to chat with her and absolve her of any bad feels she might have had id rather he always be explicit with someone but spur of the moment stuff happens and he was still perfectly within our boundaries and had already told me about her while its good to skeptical this even is a woman but how very sad for her is she really gonna off herself at 40 decide there is literally nothing else she wants to do anymore doesnt want to see how her own kids turn out even or see the pyramids or eat a nice meal ever again nothing just nothing because you dont believe you have an immediate value to a,MLeek
man or infant this i think in your shoes op id feel a moral obligation to tell her and provide any textscreenshots i had however id also very very much expect not to be believed and would not want to expose myself to harassment or risk id block him completely before i did it yes ive experienced this before mostly from men of asian decent simply because there are more of them where i live there is no countermove and they know it that is why they do it there is nothing you could have done to defend yourself against this attack or handle it better any more than you could defend yourself if he started saying you were a reptlian invader in disguise you cannot disprove it anything you say in your own defence will just be ammunition because they dont want to understand you they want attention and attack just keep walking head up eyes forward if i must speak in these cases ive found the best thing to do is look,MLeek
them square in the eye and say loudly loudly enough for others to hear that i dont know you this is not a conversation then withdraw your attention because its not a conversation its not an exchange between two people its a verbal attack from a stranger hes not having a sincere conversation about race and even if he was he doesnt get to decide that your walk home from work is the moment you must do that social justice work for and with him and it feels like shit because it feels like youre playing right into their uptight selfrighteous white women narrative but ive never found another path to safety except to make myself into a less interesting plaything they know the attack is irrational and therefore impossible to defend against you have to prioritize your safety nothing else to do it does exactly what its supposed to do its just an expression of dominance over the public space it belongs to men women just move through it and a violation of,MLeek
womens dignity and freedom to exist they are not seeking a connection with another person they are performing for themselves and for other men at womens expense and they all know it any man who says its a compliment knows knows perfectly well he is lying to you or hes never actually offered anyone a sincere compliment in his whole life they are feeling gratified by exercising their power over a public space and are getting off on the violation of a woman the rage and powerlessness you experienced were the whole of the point so yes it totally works it does make them feel powerful it does reinforce a general sense of danger and unwelcomeness in public spaces for women and it does get a response they find gratifying the only countermove ive found halfway effective is to live my life with headphones in but not on that way i can be prepared to be perfectly nonreactive to it they can get their jollies off of performing for others but they will never,MLeek
ever receive any feedback of any kind from me wealthy men hoarding women as objects stretches back in history to the very concept of ownership of over objects what is delusional and that all these men assume that they would absolutely be in the extremely small minority of men born into sufficient wealth and status to horde said women like pokemon like somehow they would deserve to be the 1 of the 1 who got a haram if only women hadnt become human under the law i would suspect shed get the best direction from a domestic abuse hotline or charity or shelter in the area or even any advocacy groups for stalking victims somewhere with a network of women who have had to pursue this locally i have an interesting theory that if you actually did any of the stuff tom cruise does in the mi movies it would hurt a lot and not even look that cool and then youd die in the first 20 minutes of the film yeah real life,MLeek
is weird i dont think historically or culturally there is much evidence of real concern for womens pregnancy risks being the core case for its approval but yes that is the actual reason it needs to be accessible to women their bodies their lives thier health choices much like miss pearl i wish her all the luck in finding a conservative man to live up to her values and force her to end her lucrative career preaching to the choir and presenting herself as an authority before men also i really enjoy that shes basically ungoogleable because an extra n in her name doesnt adequately distinguish her from a scottish drag queen its one of thier highervalue invidiaul possession which they connect to masculity and status the more you thnk about it the worst it gets really yes there are the baseline risks of having multiple partners but the risk of supporting human trafficking with money is pretty low for a straight woman on a bar chatting up a random guy you need to,MLeek
try to let go of your rage your sister has made a very clear choice and i promise you that she realizes that someone might pass away without her knowledge its very possible shes not bitter or angry shes just made that clean break it feels very personal but it may not be dont waste this precious time chasing someone who doesnt want to be caught also i dont know why you think the police will tell her thats not a service they provide for people who died of cancer in the hospital youre right about the risks when hiring sex workers but youre wrong and more than a bit disrespectful to imagine that those risks cannot be minimized and that no consenting women would be delighted to have your bf as a client and hes right men in open relationship tend to struggle more than woman and add is a physical disability and the relationship becomes functionally only open for you totally valid for him not to want to open up under terms,MLeek
he reasonably believes will be that lopsided also please look up some basic terms because im not convinced that you and your bf are on the same page about what these causal relationships will look like and what emotionalfriendship sort of connections are permissible and thats not what polygamy means you might be getting your wires crossed with polyamory but youre also not really describing practicing polyamory either do you know the world is literally on fire old lady your jewels wont be worth shit in the future water wars ok like all bodies are different and all but that seems extremely unlikely thats the thing here ive never heard anyone argue that paternity tests arent allowed what they really seem to be bent out of shape about is that a they often have to pay for it themselves and b the mother of the child gets to have feelings about it like who is actually stopping fathers especially custodial fathers from getting dna tests maybe there is something but i feel like if,MLeek
a court ever denied one is a support case wed never stop hear about that it seems like what they really want is not to face any consequences interpersonally for accusing the mother of cheating and fraud they want to feel what they feel and get what they want without anyone else involved being entitled to any feelings on the subject any woman who knows exactly who the father is and is asked for a dna test can go get a swab and then a separation order both people get what they need to feel secure and respected in the relationship i dont see the problem thats not great but it seems clear your sibling understood that your mother was not telling the truth there is a genetic component to anxiety that doesnt excuse your mother but it does mean that you as her teenage child might not be able to do anything to make her behave better which is awful and stressful and sad at 17 your goal should be to get out,MLeek
of this living situation as quickly and safely as possible i mean you know you didnt slap her im not sure why you think those are the only two options it would seem most likely to me that your mother is mentally unwell and seeking attention what do your other siblings say about this are they believing her or are they trying to keep you safe from her behaviour it drives me nuts when swingers do this but its really a really common framing they use to distinguish themselves from enm or poly i agree its careless and sometimes disingenuous but within that community the common definition of monogamy does mean sex always includes my partner not sex never includes anyone besides my partner i know you dont care but he probably wasnt lying about how he viewed monogamy and he didnt it make that up himself he was just shit for waiting so long to clarify his position and his interests i just have zero desire to sleep with anyone im not in,MLeek
love with look as a woman who has swappedplayed in the past please never do it there is nothing that worries me more and makes me feel worse than knowing a lot of women feel like you do and are not genuinely excited for themselves to experience this or fool around and selfishly its really not fair to me im also a person and i dont want have sex with you or watch or anything unless you also really want to it doesnt make you closeminded not to do it it would make you unkind to everyone to try and force yourself and i agree with you it is the signing up for the site a site whose primary purpose is to chat with other real people about having sex with other real people that really crosses what he should have reasonably understood to be a boundary that was a violation of your trust and a big problem and not something he was free to do within the current relationship agreement you should check,MLeek
out ops post history man needs to be fully dismissed and badgering someone for years about a sex act they clearly dont like isnt a concern please to god stop this this isnt healthy please call a therapist immediately and sort whatever shit youve got going on or get a hobby but gtfo of here its absurd even if any of that had validity its not the big brothers place to preparing his little sister by lowkey threatening her with his sexual discomfort and objectification of her manners youre a fucking joke you clearly wouldnt know appropriate if it bit a chunk of you off she was very dry with her responses but wasnt dismissing my comments she just thanked me for my words yes she was that is exactly what a civil dismissal sounds like anything that isnt hell yes is a fuck no this woman is saying fuck no to you and youll twisting yourself into knots trying to not accept that message it is extremely unlikely she wants to reconcile the,MLeek
most likely explanation for her behaviour is she doesnt want to talk to you at all and definitely not in person and she knows this is less about the stuff and more about your trying to generate a conversation if you really need the stuff ask her to get the stuff back to you in a neutral way by dropping it off with a friend or shipping it to you dont try to use the stuff to leverage further contact or any inperson conversation she knows that ploy she is actively avoiding that situation or just forget about it because its been two months and you seem to be living without it fine its completely valid to just let it go because she doesnt want to talk to you youre advocating telling a 14 year old girl she is in danger of being treated like a sex object inside her family home and by an older brother no less that isnt even about growing up that is just a fucking horrifying and toxic and,MLeek
dangerous message to get from an older brother are you really advocating op tell this child that he might do her harm if she doesnt cover herself more inside the home what the fuck is wrong with you no a relationship isnt a hostage situation youre allowed to leave it for any reason you can be happy for him that he has made genuine changes but that doesnt mean you owe him a lifelong relationship what you owe him is honesty if you dont want to be with him admit it let you both be free its totally normal to feel badly when you disappoint someone only monsters truly dont care that their choices or actions make someone else sad you just have to admit to that both of you deserve better than a relationship that you want out of lord i thought this guy was a troll but no this looks like its just who he is hes really the sort who think kids dont really cost much or take any time and,MLeek
he thinks that because hes not around much what a prize remind him this is an absolute dealbreaker for you and if he has realized it is something he needs in his life then you are not the right partners for one another ask him to be honest with you now about the life he wants to live because it is not a fair or healthy cycle for either of you if he is gonna reconsider sexual monogamy every year or two it was wrong of him to start engaging at that level without speaking to you first about renewed or recurring interest but it was naive to assume youd never have to speak about this subject again that isnt longterm relationships work things come back up but it also doesnt mean your sex life isnt great just because i have great homemade pie at home doesnt mean i never ever want to order a piece of pie outside of the house what is important here is agreements if you and he have an,MLeek
agreement that he can look at the other pie swingers porn but not engage with eventsgroupscommunities about all the other pies he might want a bite of and certainly never eat or expect you to eat random other pies that is a valid boundary and he either needs to reconfirm his agreement to it or leave i dont deal with adults who dont understand the difference between fantasyporn and actually engaging with others making profiles for the purpose of engaging with others or researching events these are very very very different activities and tis fine to be okay with the first one and not the rest she wishes she wasnt discriminated against and bullied for no reason agree with her validate her that is a very sane and reasonable wish to not be exposed to harassmnet and even sexual harassment due to her race you cannot fix the world you cant and should try to conntrol her relationship with her heritage but the best thing you can do is probably agree with her on,MLeek
the part of this you can relate with racism is bad you just remind yourself that not everything is about sex and what exists in your brain doesnt define the bodies or lives of others peoples bodies exist in space for themselves their visual impact on you is your job to manage shes not punching you this isnt an act against you shes not doing anything wilful or even inconsiderate towards you this is just someone who exists in space and has a human body you really need to let that body exist without drawing comparisons to it as a sex object not just because shes your sister but because shes a person wandering around her own home id say the exact thing to you if she was roommate if you need to step away because youre not comfortable with how your own mind behaves do that really cannot answer that for you totally depends on the individuals in that family and your level of desperation id love if my mother lived a bit,MLeek
closer but if i lived closer to her that would mean all my cousins and aunties would be around as well and on balance nope glad to raise a child not enmeshed daily in that drama or going into a class of 20 kids where at least 3 of them are related its got its upsides but nope if your family isnt close i think its important to connect with a few new parent groups locally or even online and just make sure you have a network of support even if its not one that can babysit his current job requires long shifts during the day and then in call during the night he does get more rest days because of this but he needs those days to recover yeah if he wants to be a fully present parent and you dont want to be a sahm that isnt a great working situation he may make more money but it doesnt actually align with your other goals as a couple no matter what happens,MLeek
its scary and its a big leap of trust from you both thats okay if he says hes prepared to be the one who moved id tell him frankly youre gonna trust him on that because yes you think youre wellpositioned where you are for the next steps in your life as a family together and you dont actually think where he is now is as aligned with how both of you would like your family to operate in the context of these sorts of career choices and moves 3 years or so is quite soon itll take almost a year for either of you to adjust and become stable after the move at least 3 years is not far away at all if you dont want to be a stam then it doesnt matter if his current job would empower you to that have you spoken with him about how he views his role as a parent would he call out to sit at home with a sick kid or is that a,MLeek
mothers job or does he think it should be the job of the person who makes less i dont have a dog in this fight but you both need to be looking at this from a total compensation pov including housingcar etc as well as a lifestyle and parenting time pov as a prospective mother i wouldnt rate a place to live a car a good mat leave contract with the ability to wfh andor bring the kiddos is quite so lowly when put against his current paycheque all of those things add up to a hell of a lot in terms of total compensation and happiness outside of work i think thats a much much closer decision than you realize and while there is more to discuss there is a really good case for him coming to you if children are a goal in the next 35 years your gf has been pretty damn clear about the choices she is gonna make for herself she doesnt have a problem with vaping and shes,MLeek
gonna keep doing it if you dont want to be in a relationship with someone who makes those choices that is totally and entirely on you at this point youre not her saviour or her keeper or her parent and the rest of the people arent demons in her lie tempting her to the evils of vaping shes gonna choose exactly what she wants you need to leave this relationship and seriously recognize the dynamic youre looking for playing daddy isnt as satisfying as youd imagined stop offering it as if its some sort of giftfavor to her and tell her isnt something youd value because you would be more comfortable and less stressed if the bathrooms and floors were cleaned thoroughly tell her you intend to hire someone for x and ask her how to best fit that into the weekly schedule of course shes defensive and hurt if youre treating her like a failure instead of just acknowledging your own preferences and capacity like the capacity to pay for what you want,MLeek
dude invest in counselling now or you will invest in a lawyer later i have said you may have some valid concerns but nothing about your behaviour here suggests you are operating from a place of partnership or mutual respect your current approach is shit your current expectations and how you are expressing them are shit if youve become so upset that you cannot behave better than this then you need outside support youre not being reasonable maybe you were once but not anymore and not the way youre communicating here unless a marital breakdown is your goal youre either a troll or an asshole who is choosing to be on a oneway trip towards alimony child support and weekend dad duties while also paying a maid yeah her ft job is supervising those children and given your attitude i suspect that is a job she does more or less alone on the evenings and weekends as well your standards arent reasonable you need to fold the damn laundry and dump out the kitchen,MLeek
stoppers as if you were a competent adult person you are also responsible for the bare minimum in the home you can still seek counselling if you want but youre the asshole here if you think two children at that age are not already a fulltime job with very limited breaks and think your wife can easily be mopping or scrubbing toilets during the day with a threeyearold running around you asked if you were being reasonable youre not you may have some valid frustrations and concerns but you are not overall being reasonable about how much time her primary job of supervising small children actually takes its concerning that you do not mention the ages of the children in the home there is a big difference between what one stap can achieve regularly with one or two 13yearolds in the house and what the same stap can achieve with 2 young ones under the age of 5 it is a struggle to have different standards than your partner when it comes to comfortableacceptable,MLeek
living situations if youre stuck having this conversation over and over again you may benefit from some counselling where you can talk about it in terms of solutions and needs instead of it being experienced reasonably as nitpicking and you may need to reevaluate the agreement it may not still be working for either of you agreements in marriages do something need to change or evolve you cannot declare you are just the provider and shes just the maid forever marriage is an ongoing partnership not a prison sentence shes not stuck with you or with doing it your way because she picked you once years ago and the same goes for you you need to be ready to do some growing together honestly im not quite seeing how it is so much better for you to move to him if your car and housing are currently covered where you are if hes able to move into a home where he pays nothing that takes a pretty significant chunk out of his pay decrease,MLeek
you really need to not just look at his takehome pay and tell yourself well he makes more so obviously that is the priority look at both of your full compensation that includes what youd have to pay for housing and a car if these were provided and any retirementinsurance pieces too youre also leaving out a major part of this puzzle which is children and parental leave who is entitled to how much for how long and who wants to take what if you want kids that is a huge part of your financial lives for the next few years it sounds like the 75k job might not be the right job to move to but you really really need to bring pregnancy and paternal leavebenefits into the equation here if you intend to have children and that might put his current government job over the top if you want to stah for a long while or it may put your job over the top if he wants greater flexibility to be home,MLeek
and your company is generous in their accommodations for new parents its been three months you burned red hot and then exploded i think youre old enough to recognize that isnt the foundation of a healthy connection and youre both way too old to be having drunken andor 4 am fights block her close that door and realize the things you liked about her did not in any way out weigh the things about her that were intolerable in any remotely healthy relationship with my ex i just told him i was staying out of his relationship with food i would do what he clearly asked of me for support buy certain things modify certain dishes but otherwise i stayed out of it and made it clear he was the expert on his diet honestly this often pissed him off as well because it put a huge amount of mental labour on him he hadnt been doing for a decade to actually feed himself it took him a long time to realize what me,MLeek
not being responsible for feeding him according to his diet unless he communicate it actually required of him but it wasnt worth the effort trying to figure out how to support him better only to get snapped at and met with character assassination if i didnt do it exactly right withdrawal sucks and i dont think brining the sandwich up twice was a good idea and i suspect your in for a bumpy ride no matter what you do but those texts would still cross a major line for me the point of taking a walk is to cool down and reconsider if youre blowing up my phone with that bs while youre doing it then youre doing it wrong for the both of us he is asking for too much if he thinks he can treat people with indifference and contempt and theyll stick around hes not just playing by his own rules hes ripping down anything else that brings you happiness and yes its your choice if you choose not to focus,MLeek
on the parts of the relationship where hes isnt being contemptuous and emotional abusive and its a smart choice nothing else he can do excuses that your partner has told you that its a vital central part of his character and his concept of self to hurt you that is who he is he cannot see himself as anything else this isnt about adjusting this is about someone who thinks deliberately lacking empathy and consideration even in his closest relationships is something to be proud of and that his internal world is the only things that counts he should be dating a cardboard cutout mmm sexpositivity seems to have drifted into a hyperfocuss and centring of the right kind of sex im a very sexually active person and pursuing new sexual experiences is a value for me and my eyebrows still raised a bit reading your op because no sex is a biological drive many of experience it is not a universal need like food or water for all my crazy experiences with others,MLeek
i have no difficulty fathoming there might be a time in my life where i am fully satisfied with a steamy audio book and a bit of a pillow hump i think you might have a mismatch with your therapist at least on this subject thats the bare minimum but that doesnt mean its has to be good enough for you its a risk to continue with him i dont think anyone else can make that call for you sometimes people need to really really fuck up before they can get back on track sometimes more often the issues will be ongoing be honest with yourself if you want to take this risk on him its okay if you just dont went too or youd like too but simply cannot hes your ex its really tempting to psychoanalyze him but its probably not the best use of your own energy probably way more helpful to consider the current behaviours during the relationship with you that you should have noticed as red flags or concerns,MLeek
then to try to figure out too much about the relationships he had in his early 20s or teens what are all the right thingshes saying is he acknowledging he threatened both your safety and possible also your basic rights has he stopped drinking to excess immediately does he understand he cannot use name calling no matter how upset even legitimately upset he is i wouldnt feel safe with a partner after that but for me all the right things would need to be very specific and followed up with clear actions like minimizing alcohol intake if hes just saying vague bullshit like hes sorry or ashamed or making excuses for himself and not changing anything else that would not help reestablish trust for me i never talked about infidelity i havent seen his post i only know what youve said i talked about the risk of sexual violence theres not burn here you said you didnt want to break up and im not saying you have to consider his fears but i am,MLeek
saying if you dont youre probably going to break up if you need him to be happy about this youre probably gonna break up and maybe you should if your bfs big concern here is you cheating then hes trash and you should break up but you said you really didnt want to hear that breaking up removes him for a situation he cannot tolerate and when he cant support you the way you need him too and ir sucks but it actually does solve his problem just not any of yours and yes the reason hes upset is because hes male that is also the reason i am concerned for your safety again thats not insane you got to make the safest choice for yourself not argument and not shame there but you cannot hold someone else hostage in a relationship they want to leave no matter how desperate your own situation is if you want to maintain this relationship stop arguing with him and start agreeing with him and validating this is,MLeek
scary and awful you are making the least scary and awful choice for yourself and youre asking for his trust not his happiness just his trust in your judgement in a really objectively weird and awful situation she asked how to not break up thats the advice she wanted being her cheerleader is nice but it doesnt help her much with keeping the relationship and the answer is dont expect him to be feel okay about this hes not going too if you make that the fight that he has to accept this and feel good about it an fully support you when you live with a total stranger you met on the street for next to nothing youre gonna loose that fight and hes probably gonna break up with you the way through to acknowledge this is fucking insane and not okay and of course he doesnt feel okay about it and of course reasonable people are telling him he should opt out and reasonable people are worried there is or will be,MLeek
an exchange of sex for rent those arent crazy that concerns deserve to be taken seriously people trust you more when youre honest and reasonable pretending he shouldnt be nervous about this isnt honest or reasonable and just will drive a deeper wedge she needs start agreeing with him this is bonkers this is a lot of trust to ask for from him in a really bad situation people who care for him will be skeptical of her shes asking for a big lift when it comes to trust and to him managing his own feelings about this he might not be able to do that but thats whats being asked for youre not a bad person but youre not being a kind or reasonable if your expectation from your bf is he feel okay about this hes gonna feel not okay about this he might even feel not okay enough to break up with you that sucks but its also not insane as much as you have no other choice and are youre,MLeek
doing best that doesnt mean hes required to feel okay in this relationship he might not and you probably cant fix that when it comes to being in this relationship or not he actually isnt required to suck it up he could say no cant handle this thems the breaks boyfriend aside any 30something year old man who is letting a homeless 19 year old stay with him for basically nothing is gonna raise some concerns in the rational persons mind that he has some expectations its great you feel safe where you are but your bf gets to have his feels too and you need to realize that where you are is still a not great options among many bad options you have put in him a position to question your loyalty and your safety admit it acknowledge that this looks bad and feels bad for him too and that youre gonna do it anyways hes not gonna be a happy camper about it only a total moron who didnt care much about,MLeek
you would be you cannot really calm his nerves because this is a totally reasonable living situation to be really nervous about youre at a very real risk of coercive rape i really hope that doesnt happen but only an idiot could pretend there isnt a rather large risk here what you can do is admit the reality and not pretend this good or even okay its not but its whats gonna happen right now just is its up to him if he wants to stay in the relationship with that reality the reality sucks its sucks more for you but it still sucks for him too both as your bf and just as someone who cares for you nah no confrontation no telling him what to do just be a neutral honeys observer yeah that sucks i wouldnt want to be treated that way that sounds like no fun there are plenty of ways to tell him the situation is shitty without telling him what to do give up stop investing you understood,MLeek
this correctly he wasnt brave enough or selfaware enough or selfless enough to just end the connection with you he probably does think youre a great person he probably didnt want it to be a one time thing but he wasnt able to step up and make it anything but that cut the leash i want to call him a jerk and maybe he is also a jerk but sesh a whole lot of this sounds like the speech someone gives at a kindergarten graduation im with him this was pretty cringeworthy if you do this in the future keep it short and be specific like 3 paragraphs maximum and dont try to hype him up like you would a child on their first day of 3rd grade recognize his actual competencies and if you want to compliment him be very specific about things he has done or achieved or characteristics he displays that you admire because after reading this i dont know anything about him as a person his actual strengths or passions,MLeek
i just know you have a whole lot of vague warm feels and thats nice but totally about you and it belongs in a journal there is nothing here that reflects you actually seeing or understanding him as a unique individual appreciating and supporting him sure but knowing him no there is nothing that says that you need to reflect on the difference between journaling your feelings and really working to express something communicative to someone else and seeing and understanding him may mean not doing this against all why why are you fixating on the word you went to her your ex to stir up some more shit needlessly and she tossed out a weakass excuse and lie hurtful sure gaslighting not a good example no thats is not good evidence of the very serious act of abuse that is gaslighting but its great evidence for you being confident in your choice to break up with her not speaking with her any more and learning when confrontation only harms yourself right now she,MLeek
is running the show because youre all up in you feelings and you were very easily baited if youre worried about her walking all over you you need to realize your current approach is laying out a welcome mat and signalling to her youll be a lot of fun to fuck with this was your first visit you have learned she runs her mouth and is inconsistent you cannot trust what she says about the future she could change mind entirely tomorrow and then again on tuesday you cant let yourself ride that roller coaster with her you have to stand back and look on and say to yourself oh big dip right now i understand its easier said than done do it anyways cause if you dont i promise you itll hurt you more than it hurts her when dealing with the kind of person youve described inconsistent quick to judge quick to change their judgement making big promises and then pulling them back when the wind changes and prone to gradeschoollevel pettiness,MLeek
you are doomed until you learn to laugh if she chooses to feel badly because you or your partner arent traditional you cannot control that and she probably will choose it sometimes so the article in that first link is misrepresenting a lit review it actually didnt even link the full article but i was able it find it that is recommending against that kind of simplistic approach when researching predicting infidelity and argues for a temporal multivariate approach and includes the rather telling quote there are probably more scientifically worthless facts on extramarital relations than any other facet of human behavior id keep going because when you start with misrepresenting and failing to link to an article that isnt even original research and doesnt say what you want it too to support your point i do get curious just how intellectually dishonest that whole list is but its late and im tired and you dont car anyways youre doomed if you dont learn to laugh at her and dont better manage your sensitivities,MLeek
about your own clothing choices your partner doesnt take her seriously she lives half a world away youre handing her a hell of a lot of power over your happiness when you could be laughing and frankly you sound like youre pretty eager to feel snubbed there is nothing shocking about a parent being hesitant to talk about marriage with the gf she just met she doesnt need to like you sure it would be nice but some snide comments arent going to break you are they you buck a bunch of other traditions time to question that one as well you dont need her approval you need to learn to peaceable survive when she says silly things half of what you described here would have just made me laugh and say well that is one perspective this was a toxic relationship and its good its over you shouldnt be reacting that way not to her face because you shouldnt be speaking with her at all when you break up with someone because you,MLeek
think they are cheating or planning to cheat why would you ever speak with them again youre not friends id really recommend you not let it fester any deeper is it possible she never thought of raya till after the breakup yeah its possible not likely at all but possible and it changes nothing you dont need to round this up to gaslighting you dont need to confront her you just need to end contact you hire a divorce lawyer be prepared to meet your obligation to her as your ex and coparent and you focus on building a respectful relationship as coparents no one deserves to be married to someone who thinks of them the way you now think of her she shouldnt have lied not just because its wrong but lying is part of how she ended up married to someone who would call her a community giver ew new one to me mature and appropriate is recognizing your own limits ending the relationship you dont want to be in and figuring,MLeek
out to treat this person with dignity regardlessif only because you have a child together i mean thats fine be honest about your intentions while dating we cool dont project dont make it a womans job to change your mind her goodness shouldnt be your primary motivation for a relationship youre not a challenge youre not a beast that needs taming youre just a dude who had some bad experiences by 30 most women could tell you about some real doozies too if you cant date without being dishonest or projecting your trauma on to others please dont date its reasonable not to invest too much into meeting new people when youre not happy with where you live and are planning to move shortly but no in the longrun onlineonly relationships are not a full replacement for connections with the people who are actually around you doesnt mean longdistance or online friendships dont have value they do but for all the health benefits from friendships and community you need to maintain some inperson connections,MLeek
too youre 32 its way harder to get into nyc than it is to get out dont be stalling get out thats exceptionally different than a 30 something woman objecting to a civil conversation of a few minutes over a conflict she had already decided wasnt worth her pursuing herself and had been adequately resolved by moving out and where she apparently felt unable to even shout from the door hey all packed and ready to go im really sorry you went though that but i truly do not see any connection besides someone doing a thing we can all agree was wrong the severity and the impacts where 1000 different a simple hey bf im ready to go or even hey sorry i really got to get going would have worked too from her to solve her own problem and advocate for her needs instead of sitting and pouting in the living room youre giving her way more credit than i am willing too she was looking for him to confront her because,MLeek
that is what she claims she would have done in his place that is what she actually believes would be correct in that moment it wasnt enough he agreed with her and was helping her she wanted to watch some bridges burn there is absolutely something more going on here with keeping this relationship private even in the places where they legally and ethically can purchase this service consent is required in advance and the cost of the women services is significantly higher than just her medical bills and lost wages this sounds like indentured surrogacy as punishment for consensual sex no kidding i cannot imagine a much better way to codify and empower reproductive coercion not to mention the terrible health outcomes for women and babies the guys who think buying a 20 dollar salad entitled them to a blow job are not gonna be paying for prenatal vitamins after being told their one night stand is obligated to provide them with progeny with pricing to be discussed after the obligation is already,MLeek
in place no forcing unwilling women to be surrogates isnt acceptable either this doesnt fix anything they are just suggesting another legal framing for the denial of womans autonomy if that was required it would just means sleeping with a man would be considered legal consent to shortterm service contract to bare him a child no one else should be getting first right of refusal when it comes to the use of someone elses body the persons whose body it is decides if another person gets to grow inside of them not complicated your time would be better spent understanding the assholes since there is more accurate information on them im going to borrow this if dont mind this is beautiful and applicable to many well i think they have undiagnosed x and that is why they regularly do the thing ive told them repeatedly hurts me i genuinely believe he has autism or adhd and is truly time blind but the net effect on her and me is the same hes late or,MLeek
absent preech autism or adhd or any sort of mental illness are explanations for challenges not blankey excuses for choices that youve been told clearly are hurtful hes not experiencing a challenge hes making a choice youre making it ops job to get him to do something he is declining to do she spoke up they had the fight that is where her power ends its not on her she cannot fix this its not always a communication issue where if she just found the magic words hed do the right thing there isnt anything op can do to change him into a competent parent with her words and can we stop pretending every person with one shitty parent is broken or hopelessly doomed yes it sucks realizing your parent is a shitty person or just a shitty parent is difficult and painful yes its something op will need to guide and support her daughter though for years most of her life probably sooner that starts in age appropriate ways the better that little,MLeek
girl will be at avoiding that pattern in her own life its not the end of the world in fact as childhood pain goes id put one shitty parent one solid one on lighter side of the spectrum poor time management and mismatched priorities is exactly what i look for in a man s seriously though poverty sucks and is hard on relationships but men married to women who work long hard hours outside of the home arent likely to be called strong if that woman falls asleep before the kids or leaves the dishes overnight poverty and exhaustion are one thing choices to not prioritize anything except your role as provider and martyr is another moving out was totally reasonable getting your knickers in a twist over this is not he supported you appropriately and he probably kept acting normal in large part because your relationship is a secret expecting him to confront her at that time is absurd i had to doublecheck your ages thats such an immature idea this was not,MLeek
his battle to fight and even if he wanted to speak to her about it this was not the time so he shot the shit with his friend for a bit you need to get a grip it was an uncomfortable 5 mins not some sort of betrayal you said no you were invited you said no thank you last minute didnt want to pull it together that quick this seems like a pretty reasonable misunderstanding to me its not your fault for saying no but its also not his fault for not triplechecking you hadnt changed your mind ya go to use your words he had a totally reasonable belief that you didnt want to go also make some plans to do something for yourself for the rest of the weekend dont sit and pout thatll make it worse for everyone be wholly dependant on and subservient to me but also dont dare replace me if i die should she just be buried alongside you dude throw herself on the pyre totally within,MLeek
normal i think the important thing to realize especially if you enter a longterm relationship is that having attraction resurface for others doesnt necessarily mean there is something wrong in your relationship you already know its not permission to cheat i used to be worried when i was with someone for a long time and my attraction to others reasserted itself but im not anymore its a fun stage where im crazy in love and choosing my partner actively not just being blind to everyone else who exists i think youre right but in the shortterm i might just go with you will not make it on time and this plan requires two adults so i will be inviting other adult in your place to drive and make sure everything runs smoothly well see when we get home sort out the birthday then the lawyer he should respond in some way but this kind of reply is going to make op feel worse people who are behaving unkindly or ghosting dont need to be,MLeek
taken care of and provided with additional emotional support its not even kind to them to try better to respect and accept the silence as a message all its own id skip right the mute part if hes confused or worried op is mad those are things he is capable of addressing with communication no reason for op to jump up and try to take care of him right now i feel like i hit the sweet spot because i got my first cell phone at like 16 and my first smart phone at 20 meaning i was young enough to be stupid and hyper connected and full of drama but old enough to be a little self aware about how i used it its way harder to talk to a 12 or 13 year old or even an 8 year old about how you use this and how it impacts you who are you arguing with my first sentence is telling her to dump him if this a violation of her boundaries her,MLeek
personal boundaries for herself about what she wants in her life sesh respecting that someone sincerely disagrees doesnt mean you are obligated to keep dating them but we need to stop pretending that there is only acceptable way for an adult relationship to look and that anyone who sincerely disagrees and wants to go to strip clubs or grab coffee with an ex or follow some models on ig is some sort of monster its really not a generational thing lots of people in their 20 and 30s have lived their whole lives with location tracking but reject it as invasive and problematic in adult relationships my partner and i only turn it on sparingly like if were at a theme park or a mall and going separate ways for a bit we dont love our lives with it on i wouldnt date someone who expected me too id find that desire deeply concerning about their character and emotional fragility frankly youre 23 you gonna find as you get towards 30 a lot of,MLeek
your peers will have very different and evolving boundaries on this or and hear me out on this revenge porn is morally wrong no matter what tools you use again fun thought not an okay action instead shell learn that some people are idiots and adults fail in love sometimes and that mom is the one to emulate and turn to for mutual support and joy its not perfect but its okay shes gonna be okay chin up if you do not want to date men who go to strip clubs then dont thats 100 valid and something you need to be accountable to yourself for by breaking up with him your bf told you that he thinks this is an acceptable thing for him to do and that he believes he should be trusted to make responsible decisions even while at a strip club he wasnt taking any steps to hide it from you or lie to you he behaved as if he felt this was a choice that he was free to,MLeek
make for himself he disagreed with you he probably still does disagree with you regardless of how sorry he is to have upset you you can break up with him over this disagreement but check yourself its a valid disagreement he has a valid perspective on what is acceptable and permissible in a relationship it may mean youre incompatible but its still a disagreement between two people who are both rational and worthy of respect absolutely you dont know what you dont know and it is often so much easier to show love and compassion for others than for ourselves definitely been there its always very telling when im listening to my friends when there get to the place with someone where the narrative becomes ive accepted they treat me this way but im appalled theyd also do it to others im sorry youre going through this i hope your kiddo has a magical day sounds like a great outing more fun as a thought than as an actual activity more likely to hurt,MLeek
yourself than him enjoy the petty thought experiments as they float through but use your actual energy someplace better the first thing you do is mute him andor hide alerts from him so youre not worried each chimealert is him there is nothing to be gained by knowing the very second he responds your brain needs a break then you take a walkrideswimdrive whatever without your phone leave it alone completely for an hour or two watch a movie bake a cake workout something that keeps your brain and body busy is best shove your phone in a drawer in another room take a few hours take the afternoon no one is going to die the constant checking because a selfreinforcing habit and you just need to break the habit its a vicious circle but the more you check the more youll need to check the less you check the less youll feel the need keep him muted and hidden and check two times a day maximum id suggest once after you wake up,MLeek
and once after dinner beyond that live your life they are legitimate enough reasons from a person who feels confident that when push to comes to shove the responsibility for these totally dependant little persons will not fall to him my ex was similar and all his reasons broke down to it would feel good to me i would find it validating id feel id done somethingachieved something which okay fine thats a personal reason but also a totally shit deal for me and for those kids so im not doing that solidarity in my 30s i finally gave myself permission to admit i have some sensory issues and that a lot of clothing feels awful i do wear a lot more tight clothing to work now because i recognize close fitting stretch is often least bad for me ill wear leggings or very dark tights under things that are on the short side and it seems to be fine in terms of looking put together heres my bare minimum shaped eyebrows and tidy,MLeek
nails not even painted necessarily just cleaned and filed if i do those two things i can basically pass for put together if you really need pants go into some more expensive stores and try some on ive found i gotta spend a 100 on pants i wont hate wearing so i try not to have to wear them much finally if you dont figure out anything else about your clothing preferences figure out where you like your waist i like mine high just above my natural waist i started feeling better more days when i banished everything from my wardrobe that didnt hit me at my high waist fuck trends if it doesnt sithit me at my high waist i dont wear it wow i have now rambled and your milage may vary but thats me and i wished id started honouring this shit about myself at 22 instead of deep into my 30s so solidarity and good luck nearly all human interpersonal relationships have transactional components both healthy ones and unhealthy ones,MLeek
but the healthy ones have to include the fact that both people in the transaction are people fully recognized as such basically empowered fundamentally respected this is a thing women still often struggle with when it comes to men especially when it comes to assumptions about labor and childcare and this is a sub that is intentionally full of woman speaking to their experiences so yeah its very sad that for men who are truly willing to do the work of being a parent the doors that are open to women are closed to them single men adopting is possible i know one who did it in c canada actually but definitely more difficult and costly file under another actual mens rights issue that mra wont spend a hot second on amen legacy crazy ive been calling it legacy crazy its way more dangerous and toxic than baby crazy the women i know who hit their 30s and went baby crazy literally changed their lives their jobs and homes to accommodate being a parent,MLeek
they worked 510 years plans to adopt or work with a sperm bank and make sure they had a home and job that supported this next step they went hardcore baby sane the men ive seen go legacy crazy often in their 40s just try to find someone else to do all the work they dont want to be a parent they arent dreaming of taking their full pat leave or being the one who cancels work meetings to drive kiddo to the doctor they want a kid like a steam achievement a badge to show their buddies they dont want to be a parent obviously not all men but these men are out there and they are dangerous and when ive suggested to the few i know they look to the single moms we know for a path or advice they are appalled they dont want to do that kind of work to make it happen tired isnt an attitude when our bodies need sleep especially if we dont get enough sleep or,MLeek
we stay awake for too our brain sends us signals to rest if we dont listen the brain makes them louder and more unpleasant your bf was being ass but you should try this anyways instead is saying youre so tried so no no thank you i dont want icecream i really need to go home and be early to bed or whatever else it is you need to say i have energy for a bit more then to bed if youre constantly fatigued still tired even after lots of sleep and rest thats a different issue you want to talk to your doctor about but in this case just sounds like you needed to sleep your bf was the one with the attitude there is no magic trick to selfrespect and selfcontrol if you truly cannot manage this speak to a therapist and smoke less weed this woman is not a romantic option for you any longer shes been very clear and very kind about that its on you now control yourself behave,MLeek
with respect behave in a way that doesnt make you miserable when possible these people arent you friends when not make them explain it huh what was that repeats joke oh i dont get it whys it funny because youre short yes im shorter than her still dont get it the fact you keep repeatedly posting this suggests you are not in any sort of healthy headspace to remain friends not now means no always shes not interested move on instead of asking them why you know they have valid reasons its not a debate id tell them straight up that youd like to include him at times and what upcoming events plans would make sense or could we plan some smallerchiller events that could include him stop making suggestions and ask to make specific plans and if they say no they arent interested in being friends with him that is something you need to respect its sad but they dont have to like him or include him and they also might not trust,MLeek
your judgement thats not necessarily completely unreasonable you may want to include an apology to them for being dramatic or involving them too deeply in negativity before especially if you leaned on them when both of you were cheating and acknowledging you maybe didnt always build the healthiest dynamic with them either in the past admit your wrongdoing and ask for a second chance for yourself and your chosen relationship because when it comes to stupid drama they arent just taking a chance on him what youre really asking for is them to rely on your judgement even above their own experiences well it totally wont do that he doesnt have that kind of power just a dumb boy but if you dont think talking with him is enjoyable and enriching for you dont do it youre not his therapist or his rehab youre a person who gets to choose her own friends and maybe he doesnt get picked dear god go find a therapist of corse youre right to be cautious the kindest,MLeek
thing you can think about this guy is maybe he doesnt realize that he is using you as a placeholder of female support postbreakup and actually believes his own bs the best case scenario is guy doesnt know himself what the fuck hes up too but just because hes willfully stupid doesnt mean you have to be do what you want but i wouldnt advise you put much energy into this friendship youre not obligated to be anyones friend all men are mindless disloyal predators incapable of sincere friendships and remember its the feminists who hate all men if you really want to connect with your oldest sister find another way visits arent the way i understand why you felt unwelcome especially with the history of favouritism but they might believe in their own minds that they genuinely want you to not to take on what they would judge to be an irrational amount of effort and stress i wouldnt want my sister driving like that in the rain with a small screaming child,MLeek
and then camping like even if she was willing i would not want that for her id be appalled if that was her plan maybe it is time to stop trying but you seem really fixated on your selfidentity as the the one who shows up and that might not actually be the best way to build a meaningful connection with your sister at this stage in your lives you sound like 18yearolds not 28yearolds but the simple fact is this she asked for a boundary she valued if you want to ask for a similar boundary that you value you can do so if you havent its not fair to decide shes a bad person for not just automatically giving it to you and it is absolutely not the same to remain in contact with people you have established friendships with as it is to entertain unknowns sliding into your dms those are different activities and boundaries you can discuss both or either but they are absolutely not the same if youre uncomfortable,MLeek
with some of her choices you have to say so and take it from there you need to sit back and seriously reflect on what answers youre looking for here youve got plenty of reasonable advice you need to look inward and figure out what those answers are not satisfying to you and why you havent spoken to him about your concerns andor your boundaries yet if you really dont want to talk to him about this then it is definitely time to end this fwb agreement you dont need to understand everything you never will but you can understand that much your discomfort and confusion means this should end you need to get a damn grip youre nursing a grudge beyond all reason and the story you tell her makes you sound at least as insufferable as she could possibly be you dont have to like her but if youre going to visit her home and family bring a bit of respect and positivity and stop looking for insults at every turn oh,MLeek
she gave you a dirty look about lemons shes intimated by the price of the chocolates come on are you successful a adult women or an insecure 12 year old looking for a cat fight let the lady have her own feels putting your personal expectations and values onto her and into his brothers doesnt make you an authority it makes you an asshole if youre compatible with the man and he agrees with your values and priorities then that works they dont need to this attitude youre stewing up in regards to his mother serves nothing except to make you miserable if you need boundaries on the amount of time you spend with her make those put the rest of this aside no youre not that would have triggered me too totally different if hes asked during the next call or meetup hey saw the post what ya get up too but the 30 mins delay with a direct accusatory question thatd be a big old nope from me is the fight now,MLeek
that hes saying he deserves to know and you should want to tell him or is the fight that hes telling you that youre accusing himjudging him as a bad guy or something because if its the first you have a very real problem and id run for the hills you just should want to do x for me is a manipulation technique i have a very hard time seeing past if its the second he needs to be told clearly that not every boundary or preference is a personal attack on his character and not to personalize what is a very very healthy standard youre setting about information sharing this i think its a power and compliance thing in most cases ive never had a good experience with a man who demands even selfies there are lots of current full body photos in my profile i used to send one or two but now i just say no and move on i agree the outcomes in parental behaviour wont change certainly not overnight,MLeek
but the outcome for children and the families that actually do exist will change drastically they would be much less likely to be born into situations where they cannot be adequately cared for more men who had no intention to pay would be honest about it and women would be more empowered to choose and plan and a health care guarantee is probably worth more to the average working single american parent than child support it wouldnt change the interpersonal issues there will always be a percentage of bad actors but it shifting the financial burden off of individuals especially low income parents both custodial and noncustodial is the right thing to do if you actually care about single parents and the kids of single parents it telling how they dont seem to think its possible to not want the same thing someone else wants for you and still be kind and appreciative if this man was otherwise kind and respectful of me id find this really sweet even tho i do not want,MLeek
to get married and do not enjoy risotto ditch the friend who said that hes either dangerous or just dangerously stupid thats just an opinion the way hilter has a few good ideas is just an opinion asshole cheating is always an act of betrayal you didnt betray your agreements to someone to be exclusive if i agree not to get my shoes wet and then someone grabs me and throws me in the pool i didnt break my agreement i was assaulted and thrown in a pool put the judgement of her and her parents agreements with her and just own your truth your truth is that youre being crushed under these financial pressures and you cannot see the relationship as its currently operating surviving admit to her you are fantazing about escape and leaving her because youre that unhappy with the situation she may need help and support but you also have needs your needs cannot continue to go completely unmet and have everything be okay you are also overwhelmed you cannot,MLeek
stop being overwhelmed just because she is overwhelmed too thats like saying you should learn to fly because she cant walk that isnt how people work there are limits youve already pushed way past your limits youre not going to grow wings because she gets pissed with you be honest that something has got to change you think a reasonable and plausible shortterm change would be her at least applying for disability so you both as a household can stop going into debt also get a new credit card and disconnect yours from any food delivery apps you need to stop that bleeding people who are in debt need to cook noodles and treat themselves only occasionally to take out if she cannot moderate herself on your dime you need to limit her access to your dime if nothing at all changes this relationship is going to die it just will just as surely as you cannot fly this cannot continue like this you tell him pointblank you do not intend to live your,MLeek
life this way and he can begin to behave like an adult partner who actually respects you as a partner too or he will end up behaving like a single separated dad maybe not tomorrow but someday someday you will leave him over this anyone would that is what happens people leave when they are made responsible for all the household work in addition to their work outside of the home and then punished and manipulated with silence and insults people leave you will leave him eventually that is what will happen if he continues to behave this way you can send him the basic reading list you should have asked by emma and she divorced me because i left dishes by the sink by mathew fray and ask him to read them and think about what youve been saying to him or you can skip all that and get a lawyer and a therapist for yourself because the odds of his recognizing and correcting his behaviour are low not zero but low gaston,MLeek
being a veteran is pretty supported during his first appearance hes wearing a military uniform and in the tavern during gaston you can see a portrait of him standing over fallen soldiers disney animators have spoken about a backstory for him that includes time as captain during the 7 years war oerthwise is totally with you hes a great villain complex and believably motivated not an idiot by any stretch just someone driven to idiocy by toxic beliefs about himself and the world and how it should opperate i dont think its an insult to call him a veteran and that concern is probably why disney left it very subtextual veterans arent universally fantastic human beings any more than doctors or priests are most veterans i know will be the first to admit the service also attracts plenty of assholes including fucked up and powermad hes a chad who they both somehow simultaneously resent and blame for thier suffering and also believe is the only rightful recipient of womans attention and that any nonchad,MLeek
receiving said attention is a betabux or simp that women use for resources and could never actually care for or be attracted to its beautiful in its simplicity if you just remember that the incel is always the victim mostly of women but also of any other men who dont agree with him and that any man with access to a womens friendship affection or intimacy is either an asshole who will abuse her or a victim of her there are no happy relationships of any kind between men and women except sometimes one where the woman is kept ignorantinexperienced and functionally in servitude by her male relatives and then by the male they have been assigned to which the incel naturally assumes he would be if only fathers were informed and empowered to place their daughters under the authority of the men they choose thats why there isnt a very comparable wgtow movement they have book clubs or running clubs or volunteer gigs and regular brunches by and large they arent hating men,MLeek
for not giving them someone they feel they are entitled too they are not constantly yelling into the void thats it im going or im this close to giving up they have given up they are gone id be really curious to find the article on communication a quick google didnt give me much it takes a pretty unique human being to be excited to tie themselves onto a rocket and hurdle themselves into an environment as hostile to staying alive as space is there are lots of examples of male astronauts downplaying issues and minimizing risks or just communicating them in a way that didnt convey the situations urgency because so many of them are just made of different stuff when it comes to fear and risk assessment than us normies so youve got a selfselected group of people who perceive things rather differently than the average person and i could see women astronauts experiencing even more pressure to tough it out or take risks but having it called poor communication instead of,MLeek
bravery when they do it but without the article who even knows he just taught his son its impossible to have a friendship with women he told him not to partner with them professionally and not to hire or promote them in the future its totally possible to give young people advice against bullying or manipulation or onesided friendships without telling your son that women in particular inherently lazy grasping and untrustworthy and the dude has no idea he didnt actually teach his son boundaries and left him entirely at the mercy of bullies or users who arent attractive women which is actually the larger risk in a maledominated major and only trained him up in very specific sort of bigotry that is gonna make it harder for him to date anyone or make productive connections with some classmates women who can think are dangerous they reject bigoted assholes who pick losing battles with magic castles and get their own community maimed and beaten by anthropomorphized household objects roddlyspecific not necessarily equal doesnt always,MLeek
mean the same my partner and i have extremely different personal boundaries when it comes to contact with our respective families but there is nothing unfair about the fact that one family is far more involved in our daytoday life than the other those boundaries exist for good reason are actively chosen by the person whose family it is we are making choices about how to manage our other relationships and as partners we respect and abide by one another boundaries like id never call up his mom he wouldnt want his partner to have that sort of relationship with his mom its not a rule on how i behave its his boundary in his relationship and i also honour it as his partner so no boundaries dont have to be the same and sometimes they shouldnt be rules almost always should be equally applied like banning himself from posting photos of him in a swimsuit or from surfing is obviously inequitably applied he doesnt want to do those things the rule has no,MLeek
real impact on his life but a major disruption to her hobby job and friendships by design thats because they arent boundaries they are rules hes making rules where his judgement applies universally and absolutely to her life its a common baitandswitch that isnt restricted to men or romantic relationships but you can certainly find lots of examples just like this one its so normalized a lot of people genuinely do not see the problem with it or recognize these arent boundaries just because you call em that if they were boundaries it would be his job to acknowledge they are not compatible as romantic partners he would say this isnt what i can accept and trust is damaged youre a great person but not my person no hard feelings instead hes issuing rules and saying if she will not obey its her job to end the relationship with a sideoffering of if you end the relationship it is because youre a badslutty woman without empathy and respect for my feelings dont do your,MLeek
hobby dont do your job when choosing and maintaining your friendships my standards and judgments apply not yours dont post photos of yourself wearing the appropriate clothing everyone wears while doing your hobby or your job dont post anything else that i might find uncomfortable or reserved for me definitions of this to vary at my whim dont spend too much time with women who will point out the absurdity of the above the saddest part of this is that is so painfully standard a thousand men a day write out this sort of shit and call it boundaries when they are really just blameshifting and making it the womans job to dump them when they become controlling i hate that my first reaction to the texts was thats all thats not actually that bad it is bad its just commonplace bad im glad she called it out specifically as weaponizing therapyspeak because if these were actually personal boundaries he would have been acknowledging they are not the right romantic partners for one another,MLeek
and actually saying so without any of the transparently very hard feelings about it sounds like you hit the wall in your 30s man i swear that is what these guys are actually talking about when they discuss the wall its that women in their 30s are discouraged and sick of trying to gently offer the perspective that they are in fact rational human beings and men are also rational human beings who can manage basic household tasks and interpersonal relationships just fine if they tried and have run out of fucks to give with the people who dont know that ive met very very few feminists who hold as negative demeaning and downright misandrist views of men as mens rights and incels often do somehow those men think that they and other men are disloyal and animalistic and incapable of reason or discipline when it comes to sexual arousal and nearly any sort of rejection or disappointment in life but are also smarter and less ruled by emotions than women and naturally entitled,MLeek
to leadership and dominance over women if you and men in general are as brutal simplistic and animalistic as you claim to be when it comes to anything much less when it comes to women you sure as shit do not get to be in charge of them i mean it is true but its just as true for men men who are considered objectively good looking also get better service better loan terms more promotions etc beauty bias is 100 a thing but it impacts literally everyone as individuals we try to be fair and open minded but as a species we are helplessly shallow and we associate good looks with other good qualities like smarts and even honesty we try but we cannot perfectly correct for it exactly this is a man who would never actually pay market rate for the service hes demanding he wants the illusion of being a big man whose caring for her and attracted her but hes actually just a cheap sake with a saviour complex youre,MLeek
fixating on this part of this that is not a problem arm touching while standing near is a thing that happens at parties its a weird detail to get hung up on and men have told me i dont give off taken vibes when im literally showing them my wedding band so take what the fuckboi says with a grain of salt the issue here is her maturity and her ability to maintain boundaries while drunksocializing with others its a very real issue but for that you just need to make a choice about whether or not you believe her when she says she made an error she will not repeat it in her slight defence she does appear to have recognized pretty quickly that she made a mistake and exactly what that mistake was but continuing with her is certainly a gamble so hes holding you hostage in the relationship by threatening to shift a massive financial burden onto you and run out on his obligations to the lease if you dont agree,MLeek
to date him still thats abusive and possibly even coercive rape if he expects you to continue to have sex with him in this situation you dont want to be in this relationship but hes using external money and legal threats to keep you in it youre not safe with this person you should call a domestic abuse hotline in your area and ask for help leaving a relationship where you are not safe you say this isnt a competition and youre not a prize never ever speak to me again and block him everywhere im not saying i have the answers to the financial situation i really dont you may need local legal advice or even financial advice on how to access safe loans but you need to realize that your plan right now is to be miserable and try to fake the relationship until the lease is up thats a really bad plan that doesnt keep you safe and it probably wont work even if you try i get it i really,MLeek
do but you need to consider the idea of good debt and make a plan to escape it cost me a bit more than that to leave my ex probably around 5k when all was said and done and i was lucky to have just enough saved at the time but while it stung it and it was disappointing it was money properly spent on my safety and sanity maybe it isnt for you but trying to make yourself trust him isnt actually a solution at all and moving is probably cheaper in the long wrong than getting syphilis or herpes would be i understand why that lease is a pressure on you but its a bad reason to stay in a relationship that is unsafe and you cant just magically will yourself into trusting someone you shouldnt just because its really expensive not too youre gonna have to have a bigger look at your options its not a requirement if you stay what youve actually taught him is the requirement is him listening,MLeek
to you whine about it it is hard but you should be clear that you need some space and time and that you expect him to leave with his family when they go why would you want to move past this why do you believe he wont do the same thing again and again he tried to hire a sexworker and each time hes caught hes tried to cover his tracks and lie to you about it why do you think you should trust him has he magically transformed into a new person was he possessed by a demon or alien at the time did he experience a knock on the head that fundamentally changed his character why do you think he will behave differently in the future why do you think he wont just work harder at not getting caught trust issues do not get resolved if you dont have a realistic answer to that question i got a friend who said once im not the prize but im a 10 bonus to,MLeek
all happiness stats with a 12 to happy pets and yummy food as long as you keep me in good repair eh and most of them wouldnt actually anyways or not for long theyd find out exactly what most women do unfilling sex with people you dont like much isnt all the interesting you can look honestly at gay guys and see this sure a lot of them go through a phase where they behave that way but for most it doesnt actually last all that long because work and friends and pissing away the time on smaller enjoyments is pretty solid i think you dont realize you keep shifting and offering nitpicking definitions for what the words mean in order to justify your negative feelings and the thing you want to do thats the trap that is why asking a question with the there is only one acceptable answer attitude is a trap that is gonna keep you miserable and i said it all hinges on him immediately and correctly understand what each,MLeek
of the words means to you in that particular moment and context i sincerely hope your bf realizes what game you are playing and passes your test but it is a game and its not the best way to make yourself feel secure or for you and your partner to actually understand one another if you actually wanted to understand one another youd start by sharing where youre head is at and what errors you think youre making inside your own brain youd talk about what words mean and what you both think acceptable friendships look like before you issued a vocab quiz thats how you share what you are struggling with and build actual understanding finally no i accept that my partner may still be attracted to people hes friends with and still be able to be friends hes not gonna slip and fall into them dick first just cause he thinks they are cute and if he does need to draw boundaries with someone i trust he will its not nearly as,MLeek
hard as youre making out to be no youre racing slow your roll your next conversation with your therapist should be about discussing your diagnosis and treatment with your new partner if and when youre ready to disclose and to simply ask your therapist if they are even open to speaking with you both as a pair some therapists will not invite others into ongoing individual therapy but youre not there yet and that is a huge ask slow the fuck down it is a valid boundary i said explicitly above it was and that you shouldnt date if you dont get what you need boundaries can be valid while also being immature or unkind or unclear or even petty but his words here still arent the core problem your brain is i know you dont like that advice but there is no other reasonable advice here for you youre fixating on his words the same way youre fixating on her pictures that is not healthy and it means this probably doesnt get fixed,MLeek
you can pick a fight with him over his word choice and maybe that even work out for you he may realize what it is you need to hear to manage your irrationality but you are choosing ongoing misery until you address the your brain problems thats deeply immature attitude towards attraction id be sad for my partner if he never felt attracted to anyone else hes not with me because no one else on the planet is hot to him that is silly youre gonna have some rough going if your expectations are that absolute and you refuse to share what those expectations are until after you issue your test questions but youre right in the end if he wont immediately give you the answer youre looking for you two shouldnt be dating if he was my guy friend describing this situation the way you are id tell him to run because this woman isnt taking any accountability is testing you and is gonna make you both miserable you just defined a trap,MLeek
youre setting him a traptest wheee if he doesnt understand your exact meaning and the answer youre looking for this gets worse inside your own head hope it works out for you not what id do bringing up a feeling youre having can and should be an entirely different than making it your partners job to fix that feeling then why not just accept that he did mean that like that is a rational interpretation way more rational than the interpretation youre choosing the spin yourself up into a snit about also realize that other people can be attractive without being a threat if you dont know that you will always be miserable in most relationships youre setting up a situation where if your partner misspeaks if he isnt perfect if he doesnt read your needsexpectations correctly immediately and doesnt give you exactly what you need youre probably gonna dive off the deep end im not saying dont talk to him but do recognize this isnt on him to address and solve its on,MLeek
you if you do ask him for support you should be very very clear about what that support looks and sounds like dont set a test for him to fail ask for very clear assistance with your problem yup i can have a peaceful and amazing time once i have sufficiently terrorized you into silent acquiescence hard pass my bf is 5 inches taller than me and honestly thats already a stretch literally just thinking of dating a 7 foot guy makes my neck hurt i would strongly suggest you manage this shit yourself and stop comparing yourself to other women there is nothing he says to explain this that isnt going to further trigger you because youre not having a rational response to his words to begin with his words arent the core problem here you were gonna find something to put these anxieties on sooner or later and youll do it again if you dont stop yourself this overthinking is a personal issue you need to manage this woman is not any,MLeek
sort of threat to you shes barely present in his life right now if you try to make it your bfs job to manage these feelings for you youll probably just end up feeding the beast it doesnt mean you cannot share with him what youre going through but its not his job to fix this one is on you that is what confuses me too but then you just have to remember that op is the victim and everyone else who seems to be just living their own lives is actually out to get him and their supposedly personal choices are actually directed attacks against op its an incel term for making moneycareer success and becoming a beta provider to a women who will certainly cheat with a genetically superior chad because women are incapable of either loyalty or of being genuinely sexually attracted to men under six feet in their narrative anyways its strange how incelsredpilled both hate betas and woman for this but also think its terrible whenever this doesnt seem,MLeek
to be the case op appears to believe its wrong for the brothers wife to allow him to breed and pass on his inferior read slightly below average height genetics he cannot even imagine that their marriage might be the exception to his miserable rules its a phrase they pull out when met with a woman with utterly reasonable standards and expectations oh you expect me not to loose my ever loving shit like a toddler when you dont immediately submit to my authority what do you think you are some kind of prize im sorry you had such a shitty date and a fake friend there isnt much to learn here sometimes you just bump into a real piece of shit person what you need to remember in the future is no is not a negotiation you said no to this date you were attracted but you knew on some level that is where this needed to stop you need to make sure youre standing up for those instincts youre feeling regret now,MLeek
for not standing up for yourself earlier and that is understandable but let it go forgive yourself and just let it go no one is perfect youre just a decent sane person who got caught out for a little while by someone who wasnt it happens resist the urge to confront him hes not connected to reality so nothing you say will do anything but further frustrate you you wont get your power back that way you maintain your power by never ever speaking with him again his delusions about why the friendship is over are not a problem you can solve for him but on some level he likely knows what he did enough people have told him a lot of words for how dare someone else be happy how can i make him miserable like me youre describing abuse not just immaturity or inexperience abuse he has no right to punish you and hes dangerously unhinged id be deeply concerned when he decides he needs a more effective punishment this guy isnt,MLeek
just insecure he wields his own unhappiness like a weapon against you hes not gonna stop you need to get out of his line of fire he needs help but more importantly you need to be safely away from him he keeps on talking about confronting the other guy but says he has no issue with his wife that is idiotic that is toxic dramaseeking machismo bullshit i never said throw away his marriage i said dont be a fucking idiot and talk to your damn wife thats just dating youll never know it doesnt mean you did anything wrong it just means she knew and she didnt want to waste your time or hers be like her if youre not feeling it do exactly what she did this sounds less like your flaws and more like him projecting his limitations and struggles be wary of men who jump to youre just being emotional when you have valid concerns or issues with their behaviour its a silencing tactic you wont be able to change,MLeek
his perspective if he finds it convenient to think this of you and not have to listen generally speaking human beings dont like change give yourself a break and let it play out youll get used to it and shes likely to keep evolving it anyways relax its been a few months you can just opt out obnoxious isnt a word that should be coming to mind this isnt the guy for you just tell him it isnt working because its not wouldnt be the guy for me either although i can sympathize with the grief and anger of leaving your faith i couldnt be with someone who was still in the rage stage hes probably right these feelings are not relatable for you and you cant understand them youre right its unpleasant behaviour and you cant tolerate it id set my hair on fire before id let my partner take our dog someplace unsafe if he struggles setting boundaries with his mom that means you need to be brutally clear about your boundaries,MLeek
with him if once the grades are in you are just peers and have no reason to believe youll ever be anything but peers again academically then go for it after the grades are inputted its unlikely the school has any policies against this but you might want to check into how the exact policies are written and whether your role as an instructor means you follow different rules than in your role as a doctoral student of course you can say no of course you should be clear about your comfort and how you will be choosing to interact with others he gets to be disappointed with your rejection of his preferred communication tool but its just that a tool saying its the only mandatory one you must use to have a conversation with another person isnt a boundary its a rule so disappointed is all he gets he doesnt get to review the paperwork he gets to decide what his comfort level is with you as a partner and your relationship agreement,MLeek
with him micromanaging your relationship agreements and even conversations with other partners is not healthy and that is a completely separate issue from your relationship together dont get the two confused and intermingled when he is not present you will establish consent between you and another party in the way that works for you and that other party when he is involved he does get to make those sorts of boundaries for himself and you can choose to engage or not with him frankly though id have some serious concerns about opening up to any degree with someone with these requirements even inside a consensual relationship starting with their ability to handle the stress and risks associated with nonmonogamy you may get better help over at rnonmonogamy and yet you keep dropping the dog off someplace where you know what to expect the second time it happens its on you not them youre responsible for your pet dont leave it with people who dont provide adequate care not complicated you need to pay for,MLeek
a dog sitter this entire issue arose because you feel entitled to free dog sitting its not that complicated and its not taking an l its the cost of having a dog and taking a vacation the inlaws are doing you a favour if you dont like how they do it then find someone else or pay someone else if they cannot be trusted during visits keep the dog on a leash inside their home or pay for a sitter during your visits with them i had to do that for years because my dog has serious allergies and my wellmeaning grampa had dementia when grampa was awake the dog was on a leashbeing closely supervised because grampa would feed him whatever was in reach and couldnt understand why not to do that the dogs health in your responsibility stop leaving the dog with people who harm them just because it saves you a few bucks no rent control no dice i dont understand how anyone can accept this risk in life i really,MLeek
dont your constant attempts to prove yourself worthy are a pretty damn good deal for him and are you saying he cheated on his previous partners regardless a break is almost always a slowmotion breakup its not a tool or a threat its just a cowards last ditch effort to not have to break up youve already seen that hes not going to put the effort in why do you imagine a break would change anything sweetie wake up this man isnt offering you a relationship you can feel secure in and its very unlikely anything you do will change that its not in your power yes men are less likely to seek child support or alimony from women even when they are entitled to it but when they do they get it oddly they often average much more in alimony because men so rarely seek it at all unless the woman is an extremely high earner anyways that appears to be a social pressure and selfperception thing among men not a deliberate outcome,MLeek
of the system the courts arent conspiring against men quite the opposite just like with custody and child support many men are disinclined to pursue what they view as a feminine entitlement your bf needs to contact a family lawyer thats all thats the first step and probably the next few steps they all have to do with a family lawyer this mother isnt someone he should be engaging with in a personal level right now whatever is done it all needs to be done with legal advice he is studying for the bar he knows this almost almost as if rich men didnt want to be taxed sufficiently to feed and educate the children that poor men didnt want to or couldnt afford to parent and somehow convinced those poor men it was all the womens fault that the children existed cost money and cost times that meant thier primary custodial parent couldnt make a living wage even when permitted to and that the legal system built up almost entirely by affluent men,MLeek
determined that individual men should pay personally to the parent who did do the work so the taxpayer aka said affluent men didnt have to pay then youre an idiot if you dont like her boundaries say so trying to control him is gonna make everyone else invoked know that youre an idiot if you trust your wife and are accepting of her ability to manage this friendship as you should be then butt out its also really strange in the canon because snape is very fully and consciously accepting the consequences and more of his past mistakes actually one of the very very few adultscharacters who are held accountable for their choices ok im overthinking this you know youre not at fault he made his own choices and then blamed you for his own choices he misled you and then he blamed you for believing his lies you understand that is what happened it wasnt your job to read his mind better it was his job to be honest with you and being,MLeek
honest with you should have included being honest about his need to budget he dug himself this hole dont let him throw you into it i understand why that was hurtful to read but the real question is what about now does he realize he was completely wrong does he recognize that of course youre hurt and scared by those terrible lies he put online is he committed to be honest with you and controlling his spending does he still think he has anyone to blame for his own choices besides himself can he apologize for the position he put you in when he was too much of a resentful coward to take responsibility for his own actions he is going to have to show you that his feelings have truly changed and that he understands what he did wrong he is going to have to understand that he deeply and profoundly damaged your trust in him and that you are right and reasonable to doubt him and be hurt by him he doesnt,MLeek
get to blame you now for feeling badly or scared by something he did wrong in the past that would make anyone feel badly and scared youre a human being a human being would be frightened and hurt by what he did its valid and he is going to have to spend a long time showing you evidence that he has changed his mind and understands what actually happened here and how much he betrayed you by lying to you and blaming you for believing his lies im not sure what advice youre looking for a reasonable person is going to read what you wrote and say this man is confused about respectful boundaries and maybe not a great fwb for you to have since he wants more commitment or illusion of commitment from you than he ever intends to offer anyone you seem unhappy with this response but its a perfectly rational one beyond that we cant read his mind any better than you can if you have concerns firstly youre going to,MLeek
have do is figure out what your concerns actually are and then ask him to address them supporting your son here means validating his own concerns and empathizing with the difficult position he finds himself in it doesnt mean inserting yourself in the situation with her or her family advise your son he is no immediate legal danger he is having a tough relationship issue where hes gonna need to stand up for his own timelines and beliefs and comfort your job as a parent is to be patient and empowering while he does that work it might take him a while but hell hes got a while to figure it out no one is giving him a lease or marriage license for a while back off dont overreact and blow this out of proportion there is no immediate danger if your son actually wants this relationship to continue and be longterm hes gonna have to figure out how to speak up on this tell him your trust him that he will speak up,MLeek
for himself and his own needs and that youre here to support him you may not like her parents but they were right this on the two of them to figure out your job is to guide and support him right now not pick a fight with a pushy 10thgrade girlfriend for him a rational human being operating in the world has to make some assumptions if you really dont know what yours are youre not gonna have an easy time having any further conversations with him about this maybe dont keep such an open mind that your brain falls right out whatever his reasons him telling you he doesnt like to share and to not date were not appropriate or respectful or even internally consistent things for him to say thats not a stable or sensible adult expressing a wellthoughtout position on casual sex thats a guy who doesnt know what he actually wants projecting it onto his fwb yes of course nofault divorces benefit both genders it prevents a lot of sucides,MLeek
as well and an early argument for nofault divorces actually came from men who wanted to remarry quickly after a previous wife walked away from them rather than having to wait several years to prove abandonment i know i say this over and over again but this whole narrative from the right about women initiate divorce cause they are ficklelazyout to get rich really just points out that a miserable marriage is still a good deal for a lot of men these men are receiving net benefits from remaining married even while unhappy they coast food probably shows up interpersonal needs get met kids or pets or homes are more likely to be cared for there is a lot less work for most men when they live with a woman the vast vast majority of women who divorce are choosing financial hardship over a partnership with that man because they are not receiving enough of those other benefits to make staying worth it the walkaway wife isnt fickle shes making a reasonable choice because,MLeek
shes not benefiting from the unhappy partnership in the way the man is involved frequently still is its means youre sleeping with a 30yearold man who doesnt actually know what he wants and says kind of shitty and controlling things to you because he hasnt handled his own shit it means hes not emotionally stable and hasnt really thought through what the fuck hes doing and you should reconsider if he is a good casual sexual partner keep dating others be clear with this fwb that youre not exclusive with him sexually or otherwise dont offer any more information about your dating life to your fwb if he cannot handle in ways that are kind and respectful i have a lot of experience with fwb and casual relationships and frankly i wouldnt have a fwb agreement with a guy who was being a little shit about the fact i dated others of course im dating others thats the explicit agreement we have as fwbs unless we had said we are exclusive in some ways,MLeek
were not if he doesnt like it its his job to walk away from what doesnt work for him he doesnt get to just shit on you and tell you dont date when hes having some icky feels about the situation hes agreed too and has chosen for himself the one thing you dont do is assume this means he wants to build a deeper committed relationship with you he has pretty clearly said he is not offering that he almost certainly doesnt want to offer you more than he is he just wants to pressure you into giving him more than hed offer in return dont let him play you and dont play yourself you talk to your wife not to him never to him everything besides talking to your wife will only make you look like an asshole andor a fool dont have a lot of context here but if im honest with you the fact he is was inquiring about your anniversary trip would be a green flag in my book,MLeek
that this is a genuine friendship when people are up to shady shit they ignore anything even remotely positive in the persons relationship one of the ways i know a guy is actually my friend is if he acknowledges im in a relationship unprompted and says nice things about my male partner if tries to pretend my bf doesnt exist or is only interested in the negative thats the problem regardless hes not the problem here your wife is you need to speak with her about your discomfort and needed boundaries the person who ought to have mentioned this friendship to you was your wife not him she was the one who left this unbeknownst no he doesnt value these things double no hes got you to do them you can hold yourself responsible for how youve played into the dynamic but you didnt create it he and his parents likely created it you were temporarily entrapped by it its up to you if you stay trapped its almost like there is a centuries,MLeek
old narrative of men being told they are charming and funny when they are incompetent and unkind and women being met with disgust demands to better or told they deserve what they got when they do something stupid funny is largely recognizing patterns if you dont think any women are funny that tells me about the narrowness of your life not about women the fact there is more money between the two legally responsible parents means the child is entitled to more youre making the mistake of framing this as mom was doing fine on less so shes wrong to ask for more when its child support isnt her entitlement but the childs id argue a custodial parent who doesnt advocate for their minor childs rights is probably doing that child a disservice and seriously what do you think an acceptable standard is because raising a minor child out of poverty in 2023 costs at least 10k a year and you just represented the average noncustodial parent as paying a third of that the,MLeek
things hes on is describing how hes trained the algorithm to hold his own attention and from that he can see men who also engage with social media that way is it many menwomen sure all menwomen no not by a long shot youre talking about individually curated online attention marketplaces for profit and calling it all the time and natural it would be extremely easy to retrain his ig or fb to show him people cooking or parenting super easy so much content there are no men on the bench or writing child support legislation at all s the crazy part is a sensible person who thinks the burden is applied unfairly might argue for more daycare spots so single mothers can return to the workforce and better after school programs and free school lunches could argue that custodial parents should be compensated for the important labour of raising children instead of that cost being shifted onto a biological parent who doesnt wish to do that work thatd be a rational genderneutral argument,MLeek
that one might make if one actually cared about the family and mens rights to not pay for kids they dont wanna pay for but almost never hear that argument because that argument would also benefit women and children like they deserve to survive or something direct result of women not being slaves or household appliances especially when half the instructions are be purposefully unkind and demeaning you walk away from someone who isnt offering you a relationship you can feel secure and appreciated in this is different then someone struggling with low sexual interest or a dip in libido or any other sort of situation that reduces sexual interest generally that you can work though but hes already told you its personal so of course your trust and selfesteem is wounded itll start to heal when you stop accepting crumbs of affection from someone who told you straight up they dont want you you dont like this person you dont feel respected and think its time to stop dating them so dont date,MLeek
them anymore is there some gaslighting or other abuse here maybe doesnt actually matter youre done you get to be done youre allowed to break up with someone even if they arent abusing you its time to leave and to leave safely even if this wasnt abusive and it is you should still end a relationship once youre frightened given there has been pretend choking here which is a major risk factor for seriously escalating violence i wouldnt even recommend you break up in person a phone call or even text is totally acceptable when you fear for your safety dont try to explain why its not a debate or a discussion just say its not working and that you want to end contact this is not a person you should ever be alone in a room with again they are not safe i suspect youre fixating on the dogs so you dont have to do the unpleasant work of actually dealing with a break up regardless you know this is crazy get a,MLeek
grip and do what you need to do there is nothing you can do you cannot debate with someone who has decided youre a liar to begin with this is entirely on your bf he needs to be prepared to tell his father what comments are unacceptable and to have clear boundaries if your bf still lives with his father that will be very difficult but there is nothing else dont pick a fight youve already lost you cant change what his father thinks but your bf can make it clear what is not acceptable to say out loud youre right that doesnt sound rational or mentally healthy pets can make it harder or sadder but they shouldnt make doing the right thing impossible there is probably more going on here than being an animal lover talk to a therapist if you cant sort it out on your own if animal services needs to be involved call them too you move on you do what it takes to let go of any illusions about,MLeek
the future this guy wasnt offering you anything and told you straight up he probably never would dont kid yourself its just a break up its sucks but let it be a break up it doesnt matter what you believe honestly if michelle needs to reevaluate or end her friendships with you or your wife because youve kept in contact with steve michelle can do that regardless of abuse that is valid that is a thing she gets to choose for herself michelle phrased this badly because the conversation you need to have is about boundaries if michelle truly needs a boundary of steve not being in her life at all even as a friends of a friend then she needs to tell you what that means for her friendship with the two of you that youve decided to maintain some level of friendship its perfectly fair for michelle to ask for what she feels she sincerely needs if youre not willing to end contact with steve be honest about it and find out,MLeek
if there is any space for different boundaries for example promising to never speak about her with steve this is the boundary i accepted with some friends who kept contact with my ex but in the end if this is a dealbreaker for her shes entitled to break the deal just tell him the truth he hurt your feelings he said he was going to make time to be with you and he didnt then he didnt even bring it up for days leaving you very reasonably feeling rejected and worse forgotten adults who game have to moderate themselves and communicate honestly their gaming time and expectations its not sexy to have to be someones mommy and tell them its time to stop and its probably not sexy to feel you need to beg or demand his attention either so tell him he hurt you and dont let him bs you out of it being hurt is reasonable and its a problem tell him you expect better from him and that being really into,MLeek
it isnt a good excuse for being that hurtful and dismissive if he doesnt want to stop then the very least he needs to be self aware enough to say that you still sometimes have to acknowledge and consider your partner while gaming and its not that hard once you respect that fact of being in relationships you dated someone for a few months and you two ran into a dealbreaker so the deal broke you didnt do anything terrible here you recognized your limits and left but youre not describing abuse either youre describing someone you shouldnt date because they have requirements of you that you will not meet doesnt even really matter if this requirements were reasonable ones or not even if they were totally reasonable you could still say no it sucks it normal to feel like shit after a breakup but its just a breakup let it be a breakup and dont try to round it up needlessly to a trauma it probably doesnt need to be that im general,MLeek
though you need to stop trying to exercise so much control over other people especially while youre drunk i understand i really do the friend i did loose years ago over this i actually didnt loose because of the affair itself i drew my boundaries like above when it came to discussing him and hoped for the best but she just kept on shitting on the other woman his fianc is so controlling shes so mean i gotta send you this photo of what she was wearing that was actually what broke me and the boundary she refused to honour i know it wont be the general tone here but at the time could accept the fact she was cheating and it was gonna end poorly for everyone not sure id accept it now but at 22 i did it was the need to rip down the other woman that ended our friendship for good i know its hard to cut off a friend i had to end it with a very dear one,MLeek
over similar behaviour i think if youre not ready to end it that first thing you say is im not your source of support on this dont speak to me about it im not into that drama and i cannot help you on this one i will not hold your hand through it if you bring it up again the only thing im going troll you is stop stop doing it stop talking to me about it i had one friend mess up this way for a few weeks and that seemed to work best no debate just absolute if you do this you do it 100 alone no one is gonna debate you or validate you and if you keep on doing it you might meet with escalating boundaries in this friendship im 100 with you but i take the opposite approach now i tell them i dont think that question is appropriate or productive but that i will tell them then i tell them if it ever comes out of their mouth,MLeek
in the negative as an insult or a dig its an automatic dealbreaker i will walk i will walk out in the middle of their parents 40th anniversary dinner if they even joke about it and then i do walk did it at least twice to otherwise decentseeming guys and all that internalized bs in my own head started to melt away when i just decided i wouldnt allow them in my life anymore no matter how many other boxes they checked i like my sex life i had mostly lovely partners and fun experiences i would prefer to date a man who i can discuss that with at least a little bit if hes not that kind of man the quicker i smoke him out the better so i hand him a gun loaded with bullets that cannot hurt me any longer and i see if hes the sort to try to take aim you are absolutely a hero keep yourself safe and get rid of anyone who doesnt respect and appreciate the,MLeek
whole you however you do it just keep doing that im convinced its the only way to retrain your brain no never again i would never again stand the room with someone who spoke to me that way for any reason youre not overeacting this is abuse it was not an accident it will not be an accident next time this is not within normal or acceptable behavior hes meanspirited this is not the first or only time youve been concerned he has contempt for you it was just the first time you realized his contempt would become physical the other people who have had this problem with him arent around either get out and stay out the only person you should have an contact with in the future is his coparent if she needs help building a case to protect the minor child from him first wave hey were human second wave dudes we meant fully human third wave all of us were all fucking human how is this still a a thing,MLeek
hope she gets picked by someone who actually shares her values so shell have to quit her attention seeking opinionated moneymaking ways and focus on her home and children sucks for her kids but net win for the world dont date someone who thinks you are selling sex to a stranger for 50 bucks a month look i wouldnt feel comfortable accepting on an ongoing gift like this so i would sympathize with your bf if he was just saying its weird and seems wrong but your bfs issue is clearly that he thinks you owe this guy something in exchange and that is dumb and insulting no healthy parents recognize how central and important friendships are to teenagers and young adults and dont see their childrens personal lives as a competition or threat the way youre answering here im a bit surprised your daughter still speaks to you at all if you dont do some serious reevaluation once her brother is out of the house i doubt youll hear much at all from,MLeek
her youre not describing yourself bringing anything to her life but obligation and disrespect youre being a passive aggressive judgmental asshat i wouldnt want to talk to my dad either if he was resentful and whining about the fact i had a healthy friendship with my sibling in her shoes id also be establishing distance from your toxic behaviour and unspoken expectations the phone does work both ways so do invitations there is also this magical thing adults do in their relationships with other adults called scheduling we do it because we respect one anothers time and independence and understand that life gets busy and we need to make plans if we want to connect instead of modelling to your adult daughter transparent and respectful communication between fellow adult family members your passive aggressively issuing her tests for her fail and holding her to standards youre magically exempt from she may not be perfect but your the one who needs to grow up shes not your buddy and she doesnt exist to emotionally service,MLeek
you establishing some distance is an age appropriate behaviour and instead of celebrating that and asking for what you value and need form her your shoving her further away i can only imagine it totally sucks but its also transparently not about you its about your cousin deciding this was easier than the truth and some people deciding to go along with her they are trying to make you a sacrificial lamb to her shitty marriage and familial harmony make them know there is a cost for abusing you this is not their easy way out of the mess this man made the cost is youre going to say no the cheater cheats and if youre gonna treat me like a homewreaker than im going to have nothing to do with you because i dont let people who hate me and excuse abusive creeps like him to have access to me whats so tough about just accepting and respecting her preferences why does this need to be a thing much less a thing to,MLeek
take personally shes not closeted shes not hiding you or rejecting you she just clearly ask for not that my partner doesnt like to be called babe in front of his family i didnt ask for insight into that i just stopped calling him babe in that context easy thats how id word it it is tough to do and no one is born knowing how so give yourself a break no matter how perfectly you do it he may still choose to react badly you cant control that so dont try just remember its not a debate its not a negotiation its not a fight youre telling him the sky is blue after you do that wish him well and block him everywhere you owe him nothing more than a clear final no dont even owe him that really but its a way for you to remove further excuses for any bad behaviour from him you werent overacting at all that was physical abuse and it was escalating physical abuse im sorry you,MLeek
went through that good on you for getting out safely and ending all contact if she ever had keys change your locks ignore all contact from her document any bad behavior abusers often give you a bit of a bumpy ride postbreak up stick it out and stay staff benefit of the doubt for 8 years of not knowing sure maybe it would be a carelessness that would concern me but i could get past that but op would be a damn fool to remove the deadline if she has any desire for marriage andor children with this man in the future it was a legitimate dealbreaker for her with a perfectly reasonable timeline for him to take some sort of action including just the action of initiating the deeper conversation youre suggesting instead of making it constantly her job and her fault for bringing up what he has been told clearly is a dealbreaker level problem for op he has done nothing in six months those six months have murdered the benefit of,MLeek
the doubt argument op was honest about the dealbreaker and hes watching the clock tick down this deal is probably gonna break you cant someone can choose not to be your friend when you dont want to date them and they usually will choose that its healthy also you shouldnt this isnt a friendly person he has made it very clear repeatedly that he is refusing to be your friend youre not going to break him hes a bully and an asshole he knows you dont want to be mean because most people dont want to be mean and hes weaponizing that against you this person isnt a friend worth having be pissed with him that is the healthy and reasonable reaction to someone trying to bully you and not giving a shit about how you actually feel and who is very mean to you because they know youre a decent person who doesnt want to mean right back tell him that you two clearly want very different things from one another and since,MLeek
that is only going to cause conflict and hurt feelings youre cutting off all contact with him 40 year olds dont date people in their 20s because they prioritize equity and mutual respect he didnt pick you because he thought hed really have to respect you as an equal not at 24 this isnt just a friend you know it he knows it he doesnt care youre both being played hes getting what he wants from both of you even if he truly doesnt want to fuck her hes enjoying her girlfriendlike level of service and support its been over a year hes not gonna stop edit this guy recently told you hes not attracted you straight up that isnt how a 40yearold person should be dealing with a dip in sexual arousal at 40 he either knows better than to handle it that way or knows he doesnt have to do better with you and that he benefits from you feeling insecure and unwanted in the relationship these are bullshit games hes playing,MLeek
that woman his own age would be far far more likely to see through quickly and not waste time on way to go doing this calmly without missing a beat is such an invaluable skill ha telling on himself a bit eh one my coworkers said the same thing about my zoom he assumed i must have a delay cause i wasnt letting him jump in i was presenting and the executive had just directed us to hold questions until the end but whatever you need to tell yourself kiddo i wished theyd actually gtow already the women i know when went their own way and decided against any further dating or relationship with men seem to have more interesting things to talk about no clearly your deadline is going to be ignored that is just a reasonable assumption at this point you told your bf what you very reasonably required him to do to show you that he prioritized your shared future he hasnt done it and lets be honest if he refiles,MLeek
it a day before your deadline just to keep you on the hook that isnt really in the spirit of what youve asked of him thats not forward movement thats minimal compliance thats him saying if youre gonna force me to do this ill do it as badly and lazily as possible to just to keep getting what i want from you tell him youre giving up hope that he will address your dealbreaker and are beginning to look at what breaking the deal will look like for you since you cannot continue to move forward with a man who is married to someone else its impossible to make a flat map of the whole spherical world accurate most world maps you look at are still full of bias and hugely inaccurate mercators map is still the visual standard for laymans use and its warped as hell but it did its job in the past which was to allow ships to maintain a consistent heading maps are really just stories told from one perspective,MLeek
or one approach to representing a huge sphere on a flat plan in the way we think of accuracy in 2023 they just arent accurate so basically id say most old maps were about as accurate as a person who knew how to interpret that particular maps perspective and limitations was a huge part of why global navigation satellite systems are more accurate is because they dont rely on representing the world as if it were flat do nothing reach out to no one except a family lawyer and a therapist the relationship is over the only contact you should have right now is with someone who can support and advise you on how to ensure his legal obligations to the child are met and how to protect yourself from any ongoing abuse or manipulation its tough i know but you need to exercise complete selfcontrol and even when he reaches back out and once you stop he will try to reengage because he cannot abuse you if you actually end contact firmly he,MLeek
can only effectively keep on abusing and manipulating you as long as youre in contact with him you need to stand your ground and refuse to speak to him except over email or text and only about the pregnancychild ignore any contact that is not specifically about absolutely necessary things like leases or legal issues do not pick up the phone do not open the door do not meet with him all conversations now happen on the record and you dont instigate any contact unless your lawyer advises you too im sorry to say this but if your family is willing to blame the teenage cousin instead of holding the married father responsible there is nothing you can do to convince them they have made their choice and it has nothing to do with you really people who want to blame the other woman when a man behaves like a creep and a cheater they just will evidence be damned and those texts they are dead and gone you have nothing except basic reality,MLeek
on your side and some people dont like reality your cousin has made up a vicious lie about your to protect herself from the consequences of her remaining with a man who treated her reprehensibly there is little you can do except be clear with anyone who asks that you refuse to be blamed for something nasty that someone else did to you and remind them that it is well known that he cheats its absurd basically insane to blame you for the crimes everyone knows he regularly commits you know who you are hold your head high and be clear about what happened youre glad they are happy but youre not to blame for him having been a creep towards you or towards any of the other women hes tried or succeeded in cheating on her with decline to speak to your cousin or her husband block any contact they try to make they are dead to you if they are going to make up stories to avoid accountability no she didnt owe,MLeek
it to him she wasnt required but she brought it up she opened up the topic of this person and then she misled him about the situation that wasnt okay he sounds like a wellintentioned but immatureinexperienced boss asking her to prioritize the retreat is totally normal as is her pushing back and saying no donuts are standard expressing support for an employee who is putting in extra time is an important thing for a new boss including understanding why their workload is requiring extra time i wouldnt be concerned your wife is a working adult this is probably not her first or last new boss experience you need to take a look inside and ask where these feelings in you are coming from because they arent rationally based on the information youve shared here the relationship shouldnt be salvaged if he doesnt end it she should gfs made an understandable human mistake in not disclosing and outing herself when she first brought up the fact she didnt want to contact this person a,MLeek
totally breakupworthy mistake if op chooses that and i am 100 in support of him ending this relationship but that what her second mistake her first mistake was dating a person who she couldnt trust with this reality about herself maybe she wasnt ready to trust anyone but nevertheless that first mistake is the one that is really costing her dearly right now shes got the appointment on the books for next week that is the important thing i think the best thing you can do in the meantime is just focus on managing you may also what shes hoping will be the shortterm outcome from her first appointment or even if she feels shes able to come back from that appointment with one or two next steps dont try to come to any big conclusions right now shes in acute crisis and probably not in a good place for building a workable plan and youre not the authority let the doctor do what doctors are supposed to do and ask your wife to,MLeek
include you in any decisions or advice on the next step she gains there as long as shes able to function see yourself as an assistant a collaborator not a leader she needs to be leading when it comes to managing this trigger and with the advice of her care team patience i know its hard but patience is probably your best tool for the next few weeks while your wife kicks her advanced support team into gear make sure youre also taking moments to care for yourself and decompress but recognize that youre not really in control or in charge of the next steps and its probably best you not try to exert any control or make any big asks until there is a basic treatment plan in place a 21yearold feeling frightened to out themselves about a dramatic high school samesex situationship is pretty understandable even if its an error to withhold from your bf of a few months gf made mistakes but that doesnt justify all of ops reactions here or,MLeek
how extreme they are hes trying to round this up to cheating on the basis of her being transparent that she doesnt want to have further contact with this woman they should break up op lacks the skills to address this error in way that is respectful its four months just walk away call this an incompatibility and just end it shes telling you that just how she is is really really unpleasant and unkind i always consider it a dealbreaker when someone says this is just how i am when they are referring to behaving badly dont just keep working away at something when there is this level of hostility and lack of respect itll only be more anger and drama dont give yourself that baggage just optout agree with her your expectations for how a relationship should look and sound like are completely different and incompatible wish her well break up this isnt something to fight for no being imperfect isnt fault and its not a twist calling it cheating in any,MLeek
way was the massive twist involved here a lot of ops reaction here is accusatory and unwarranted and shows a lack of basic understanding and empathy things he should be expected to show others even if he wants to break up getting up in your own head instead of showing reasonable empathy is a human risk it doesnt make you an inherently terrible person being influenced by homophobia is a human risk it doesnt make you an inherently terrible person i didnt call op a monster but he is making some serious errors as well your wilful refusal to recognize nuance and embrace empathy with the gfs errors doesnt make gf a monster either while it was wrong of her to withhold this her reasons are not difficult to understand the situation was strained and probably a bit unclear to her how to describe it she was afraid of homophobia it was a reasonable fear biphobic men are emotionally unsafe and can even be physically dangerous to young bisexual women even women who may,MLeek
not identify as bisexual will recognize the risk of discussing samesex attraction or relationships with men she handled that fear incorrectly but her fear is not confusing or even irrational and the fact she is framing your negative response as homophonic also isnt crazy even if you dont feel its fair shes not inside your head shes drawing reasonable conclusions about the world and how she expects to be treated in it based on how she sees others like her treated you can break up with her if you want to and since you want to you probably should but you are showing a real lack of understanding and empathy here towards an understandable error that she has taken steps to correct and the intensity of your reaction to this error probably does contain some homophobic attitudes and fears what she did in high school with her female friend wasnt cheating on you by any reasonable definition of the word im not sure why that word even came here or what you mean by,MLeek
implicit understanding but that sure set off some alarm bells that you are framing this inaccurately and in an accusatory way that is not warranted a certain level of privacy about past relationships especially strained early situtionships during the first months of dating might be hurtful but rounding it up to this massive betrayal seems really immature and extreme to me however if this is dealbreaking error for you and im not saying she didnt make an error then break the deal respectfully and cleanly right they seem to forget their own mothers were probably not born into a nation where they could have a credit card or a mortgage so yes when i pay my mortgage i think of my nana whose addict husband walked out on her and who paid his bills to keep her home but with the constant unnecessary risk to herself and her children just because she was female she was the warrior she shouldnt have had to be still a big mark against her if her response to,MLeek
shit is frustrating sometimes is to blameshift and manipulate and expect her bf to spend money he doesnt have or drive a car he doesnt own what op said was unkind and unproductive but it wasnt a misunderstanding she didnt make plans for herself she expected to be taken care of by someone else she said so explicitly when the plans she didnt make ended poorly he accurately understood she was looking to make the situation someone elses fault and was being manipulative insisting someone should offer something they cannot afford just so you could feel good turning it down is grossly immature behaviour and a pretty obvious attempt to further excuse her own totally unjustified anger with him during that call she was manipulative and she was blameshifting it may have been unkind or unprotective to say but it was not inaccurate she made no plans for her own basic needs but pressured her friends to take care of her she got pissed with you because when her further lack of planning made,MLeek
her life difficult you didnt immediately give in to the pressure to take care of her in ways that werent feasible for you being on the phone with her was feasible paying for her cab wasnt and coming and getting her wasnt its understandable for her to be upset or even hurt it was an unlucky and unpleasant situation one she probably could have managed better but nevertheless bad things do just happen sometimes its a problem when an adult cannot roll with moderately bad things that just happening sometimes its the blameshifting and manipulation that are the problem core problem here and that fact she is still doubledown on her demands that you treat her like your irresponsible 13yearold who got themselves into a scrap and not your 33yearold adult partner who made a series of poor choices for herself this is gross behaviour from an adult your language may have been careless but everything about her lack of planning and blameshifting was just gross two years is already far far too long,MLeek
to be waiting its understandable while youre still in shock and grieving to hope hell come back but it was never likely its damn near impossible at this point you need to let go of the delusion and the grief for the marriage that is now long over you seem to be stuck in the space of feeling dumb and hoping for reconciliation and you really should have been able to move past that by now speak to a therapist if youre still plagued by these fantasies and regrets in any type of relationship there is a possibility of someone starting to treat you a bit like a therapist or pseudopartner instead of just a friend there are just people out there who make these sorts of mistakes and push boundaries like this especially straight men who are a bit less likely to be skilled at building these sorts of important friendships with people who arent also the women they are having sex with sadly a lot of our culture encourages men to view,MLeek
the women they are sleeping with as a default emotional support animal ive experienced this with a few fwbs and you just have tell them that isnt the kind of friendship youre looking to build with them just like you might have to tell a work friend that youre really happy to grab a drink with them sometimes but dont really want to text daily or all weekend if youre not comfortable with the friends part of this with benefits arrangement you can and should speak up and redraw the boundaries tell him you enjoy the connection you have for that for you a fwb doesnt include these sorts of deep soulsearching conversations if that is what he needs he needs to look elsewhere therapy is a good idea you cannot control how he takes it he probably will be hurt he may end the fwb arrangement thats okay but you can only build relationships that work for the both of you if youre honest about what you want that relationship to look like,MLeek
nope there are respectful transparent ways to try to reconnect but none of them apply here in this context it would be foolish and disrespectful shes not a toy to pick for a few weeks and then discard she declined that role last time no reason to believe shes changed her mind does that mean abortion is ethical if i didnt orgasm if yes follow up my exes mother once said she had never orgasmed with his father can i kill him or would that still be murder this happened to my aunt as well she turned around and paid off her young adults childrens student loans thier estranged father reached out the older son expecting theyd be so grateful to him they must be willing to reconenct with him now was shocked to find that the money that a court had finally forced him to pay didnt buy his childrens love the reasoning behind the 6month was that at the time she was a waitress judge said she probably made a lot more,MLeek
than bd on just tips alone so he was just randomly accusing her of and immediately acting as if she is guilty of tax fraud thats madness if a judge thinks someone is committing tax fraud how is the correct course of action to arbitrarily deny that persons minor child their entitlements the system doesnt protect against one or both parents being lousy human beings only criminal ones my bf has a similar history to yours but what strikes me about his story and the little bit i know about yours is that never missing a payment seems to be assumed to be sufficient for the father my brother didnt let that be sufficient he decided that because his coparent was just sorta shitty at being a parent and selfish and neglecting and treated their kid more like a buddy or therapist that hed shift his entire life to do the important labour that needed doing even though it left him poorer as an individual took a new job that let him be more,MLeek
available after school fought for more custody then fought down his support payments only after he was already paying more for the kid in his own home it sucked and he did it cause being a parent meant more to him than making full payments on time too often i think male parents dont realize that is a choice albeit a difficult one that may be available to them most mothers i know are very very well aware that they made that choice and put the work of parenting even parenting alone over their personal income potential im really proud of my brother for recognizing the best way for him to meet his kids needs was not merely by paying what the court said he owed but by totally changing his life to be a fully present parent the problem is money is fungible and a custodial parents life is deeply vitally intermingled with their child youre not keeping separate grocery bills or calculating how much of the space in your apartment the child,MLeek
is the primary user of that would be absurd there are far too many supportpayers and dodgers who think because they are contributing x amount to the childs care that means the custodial parent should never buy a new pair of shoes for themselves or have a night out basically that they dont deserve anything but complete and abject poverty my best friends coparent pulls this shit constantly the child support payments he actually makes only just barely cover the groceries the kid consumes in the month but he flips the hell out if she shows up with her nails done or even with a starbucks cup in her hand no idea what is actually costs to raise a kid but he knows he wants her to be suffering absolutely guy is looking through tates followers and not realizing those women are a largely bots and b largely there be viewed by the target market they are selling too they arent there because they want to bang tate they are there because they correctly,MLeek
understand that men who follow tate will pay for sex online about 40 of custodial parents with child support orders get some of that ordered support paid this doesnt account for the custodial parents who dont have an order or never seek one and there are lots of good reasons as well as plenty of bad ones to not seek it its okay to not like sarah a person who bragged about not replying to friends would be someone i dont much like either a person who asks for pics and then doesnt post them would make me suspicious and irritable as well if my bf had this sort of friend id 100 tell him that i dont like em they might be nice and friendly to him but i dont find them generally nice and positive to others and they say and do some shit i find immature and attentionseeking id also tell him if i suspected theyd be willing to fuck him behind my back if they thought for a second hed,MLeek
go for it i know he wont go for it so thats fine and if his opinion is different and he values his friendship with her thats okay by me its his call to make but shes not gonna be my buddy he gets to like her and i get to not like her i dont think highly of her and id hope hell take my judgment under advisement because im not a jealous person but im also not an idiot right now she doesnt want to create the kind of relationship youd prefer to have you see her living with you but she appears to see herself as living at home and visiting you this doesnt sound like disrespect it sounds like one of you need to end the relationship that isnt working you need to face that honestly and ask yourself if this is a relationship you want to be in and end it if its not you cannot make someone respect you you cannot force them to live with you and,MLeek
you cannot make them want the same kind of relationship that you want it was foolish of you both to move in together during such a highstress week for her however if shes willing to pull the plug after only a week i would suggest you should let her that isnt the behaviour or someone who was ready to do the hard work of actually living with another person and it is hard work maybe you should have put forth more of an effort as well but she just declared that her solution to the issues youve been having in these few days is she will not be doing that work at all anymore thats just kind of the end of that its difficult to move forward with someone who deals with disagreements or upsets even reasonable ones like that you drew an appropriate boundary your bf response started off as unfairly nitpicky and escalated to controlling and flat out aggressive he didnt treat you like an equal if he says he knows you,MLeek
are then his behaviour should reflect that it didnt here he failed him having some bad feels or concerns doesnt excuse him treating you that way hes not a toddler hes expected to handle big feelings without behaving like one how you bf expressed himself and his feelings was not acceptable he can feel insecure or threatened and even disappointed with your choice without being condescending accusatory or aggressive is this the really the first time hes treated you like a naughty foolish child for not obeying him precisely is this the first time hes decided your judgement in your own life is unworthy of any respect is this the first time hes made utterly baseless accusations about your character and intent your boundary with r was completely appropriate response to rs action and your existing level of friendship the way your bf decided to respond to not getting his way 100 is deeply concerning if it waits a year hell have nine years of payments instead of 10 hes done nothing wrong but,MLeek
because this is worrying him he should absolutely express that you need to tell her asap its not that complicated a conversation it shouldnt be embarrassing but you do need to tell her asap otherwise its a landmine defusing it is the kindest thing you can do for both of you and it makes future honest conversations possible she has expressed she thought it was better to wait a year and you can and should respect that what you need to express is the stress and confusion that agreement has created for you waiting a year to share this piece of information with her is stressing you out what you say now is simply im feeling really stressed not having this part of the money conversation i have a significant amount of student debt its under control at a very low interest rate and i am making regular payments but i will still have a significant amount of stupid debt in a year when we do have a more indepth conversation this is the,MLeek
kind of debt that i will be servicing for quite a few years more and im not comfortable with that being a complete surprise to you at the end of this lease do you have any questions or anything else youd like to know about that given what she knows of you so far there is a fair chance shell say nope thats enough youre paying it and you got a plan good to go but so very far from understanding that most human individuals depression doesnt manifest as lets update my tinder bio and go on some fun dates tehe and that many human individuals still struggle with depression and other mental illness while in a longterm relationship even a stable and healthy one i sexually assaulted a stranger cause i was sad it made me feel good to make a total stranger frightened and distressed i intend to exercise this power to abuse in the future and expect it will continue to go well for me but please remind me again how,MLeek
men live in constant fear of accusations that might be embarrassing this man is profoundly unfun in bed she told you she truly wants to be alone she said it was over she said she is not discussing her reasons with you that is what she told you and that is all you get to know accept it youve been hung up on this woman for ages but shes never been your partner youre not a team and you never were you had a few months of intensity that were not a very good foundation for a serious longterm connection and she knew it you should have reasonably known it its time to do what you should have done ages ago and end contact stop showing up at her house stop calling shes been clear this is just a break up and in a break up you do not get to know everything going through the other persons mind whatever she needs to do for safety and sanity in her own life she has,MLeek
decided you are not part of that that is her call to make and you need to make peace with it without demanding she address your issues with her choice that is a break up i dont think its weird but if your core intention is to apologize then you need to focus on that and just apologize it shouldnt take more than a few sentences to say youre sorry for how you treated her dont go on about what you learned or praise yourself for your growth of course youve learned and grown so has she duh an apology isnt an opportunity to give yourself a gold star or make yourself feel better just acknowledge past wrongdoing and wish her well this is a hell of a lot of your emotional energy to give to someone who doesnt come to events they dont want to go to and has inconsistent patterns of sharing their opinion if you dont want to be his friend dont be if you dont want to share information take,MLeek
a page from his book and simply dont but writing manifestos about your buddy who is simply different than you and maybe a bit inconsistent in his boundaries is really absurd behaviour and probably not a great use of your brain space the amount of clarity and correlation youre seeking is bizarre you can ask him but he can also choose not to tell you or he may honestly not know this whole question suggest you havent got your own shit figured out when it comes to what kind of boundaries you want to have and friendships you want to participate in be thoughtful about the amount of energy you put into a connection give advice where its asked for find some damn chill live and let live and victims of their own shit head friends too every logical person who cares for your safety and sanity in life is going to tell you to end this romantic connection the fact her challenges in life are understandable doesnt mean you can save her or,MLeek
that you should try to save her on your terms and for fucks sake use protection unless you want to be a father and bound to someone as a coparent for a two decades youre single when you tell him youre single and thats its over or he tells you the same but your friends are giving you good advice the reasonable response to this situation is ok this is clearly over were broken up im living my life as a single person now lets figure out why you get the rest of your stuff i dont think a reasonable person could look at this situation the lack of communication and partnership in it and not say that this coward of an adult man is just trying to make you do the hard work of actually dumping him hes just coasting alone enjoying the perks of your attention until it happens doing it in person would be respectful but its really not more complicated than that imagining you may get engaged this year to,MLeek
a man who is making these sorts of choices seems like a pure delusion to me right i mean if i just look at them objectively and how they choose to present themselves you can see tate is deeply insecure and trying to perform machiscmo fraser looks relaxed friendly and just fun if you told me i absolutely had to go on a date with one of these men based on just a few photos alone itd be fraser hands down i know youre making a rape joke and i wish we generally wouldnt do that but the guy will likely do just fine in prison they come down hard on cannibals and pedophiles but a huge percentage of the men there have bet their wivesgirlfriends at some point and living off of the proceeds of someones elses sex work is just bragging rights and tate should remember how to throw a punch hell be fine in prison which says a super sad thing about both him and prison in prison dude you do,MLeek
understand that even in this bullshit ruling that is not what was said right im genuinely concerned that some gas stations and corner stores might not realize they are not protected not yet by this ruling but of course that is the real point of inventing the inquiry from a gay couple to a woman who doesnt make wedding websites to make the world more hostile and hateful for the people they loathe the red flag isnt that he didnt like it or even that he didnt eat it the red flag is he didnt talk to you about it kindly acknowledge the effort and make an alternate suggestion for dinner any sane adult man knew what he was doing was hurtful and he did nothing to address that or repair it they are not as stupid as they like to pretend to be when it means they can avoid accountability stop protecting this man from the reasonable consequences of his actions of course youre upset any normal human being would be he knows,MLeek
that you know that youre both agreeing to pretend its not true to protect his feelings at the direct expense of yours its likely that at this point in your life the best thing you can do is walk away from your father and refuse to engage my go to was often if you dont think men should treat women like people im not going to argue with you im just going to keep my distance from you because that is hurtful and frightening also a big fan of wow you must really hate men to think they are all such mindless animals who cant possible do better then disengage walk away never try to answer his questions or engage in an argument do not ask questions make dull statements like well that is an ugly world youre living in you cant have a productive conversation with someone who has decided you are subhuman they will just keep on treating you like youre a dog trying to convince them to eat cat poop you,MLeek
cant save your brother but you can show him that he wont have happy relationships with women if he treats them poorly gaslighting requires malice and usually a pattern of it you can make mistakes and have misunderstandings but you cannot gaslight someone by accident but this was a bit careless and not kind even if you didnt intend to manipulate her you were careless with your words and your choices hurt her thats real that you did do and its reasonable for her to be upset with your actions you had left her with a very clear idea that you were all in and on a shared path you ripped that away when you said in effect that you were never really in love with her yet she may have overreacted or been unkind as well but her accusation held water you need to find ways to flirt and offer praise without implying more than you mean too or offering false promises before you are ready to make real ones you were totally,MLeek
unclear about what your vision of being serious with her actually looked like and you used words that she rather reasonably interpreted very differently than you apparently meant them you may not be a monster but you done messed up also this kind of lovebomby and careless language is a damn good way to end up in a relationship with someone who has intense or unrealistic expectations like she did because youll attract them with that kind of shit and youll repel people who are more levelheaded and thoughtful about their partnerships yet another reason for you to not continue this behaviour apparently now the kind of required information you want to include is that you graduated from a conservative christian liberal arts college with a nearly 90 acceptance rate so weird when cheaters fill out additional biographical details its absolutely is unfair if your regularly as a matter of habit being more grace effort patience and benefit of the doubt to interactions with people who arent your partner it sounds like you both,MLeek
have an issue right now where you are assuming the worst of one another and are unable to bring in those positive qualities that make relationships between people actually function its a pretty normal thing to struggle with when youre under stress but this is going to keep getting worse until you both decide to focus on being kind instead of on facts and unfair and who started it youre both deep in the shit either you climb out together or everything keeps on stinking but of course its not unfair to choose where and when to be assertive about your own needs him nitpicking your other relationships in your life because he doesnt like that feedback hes receiving about this relationship is not unfair to him its annoying maybe but not unfair couples counselling might help here if you are both focused on relearning to be kind to one another and stop assuming the worst be worthy of wifingup but willing to be the side piece of this curmudgeon her response was extremely,MLeek
poor but assuming you dont want the advice break up with the insensitive cow ill suggest you might making a rather common beginers error asking for what you want doesnt mean you get it asking is an important first step not a garuntunee its a pretty common for people in your position to think hey i learned and i asked nicely now give me what i want and thats not actually how it works there can be lots of reasons our partner might not be able or willing to meet our exact need in the way we want it met at the exact moment we want it met your gfs responses mean one of two things shes a monster you should dump or shes burnt out on being a source of validation for you and she needs you to do more selfregulation and own your own shit she doesnt want to solve this problem for you she wants you to solve this damn problem and stop putting at her feet its not okay how,MLeek
she expressed it she also needs to ask for what she needs if she needs you to shove off and figure out how to cope without being constantly managed and pet by her she also needs to say that maybe nicer but that youre not being petty shes not being nice you have been fixating and probably ignoring how heavy the emotional burden youve been asking your partner to meet is getting either that or shes a vicious harpy you should break up with take your pick so you sulked for days and refused to communicate with him which became insufferable for him to be around without saying anything and then got mad when he keep his commitment to his friend get a grip seriously the resolution here was good the root of the problem was the sulking and withholding you needed to take a time out to manage your own feels and it was probably for the best you ended up with one just because you are having a big feel doesnt always,MLeek
mean you partner drops everything to address it sometimes you have to cry and out and manage your shit i would just decline your relationship is with her not him there is nothing for you to gain from this hes asking you to serve his needs even though you have no foundation of friendship to base that on you can and should be friendly and civil ifwhen they decide to socialize together but youre allowed to be tense both of them need to understand that as a reasonable consequence of his behaviour and her choice to remain with him but you do not owe him any of this emotional labour for this sort of conversation the odds of you having any success at holding him accountable are slim to nil it is far more likely he will continue his pattern of making his feelings and his behaviours the fault of others in this case of you tell him you will welcome him in any social situation he joins as your friends chosen partner that,MLeek
is that the extent of your relationship he is her choice and you respect and honour her choice but you are not his friend and you are not interested in putting in the work to become his friend at this point you are not available to him that way those would be my boundaries and id expect them both to respect them its not my job to hold some asshats hand through his sobriety after he abused my friends for years its his job to show up at events be less of an asshat and recognize no one else owes him a damn thing more than that hes either not interested or lacking in really basic skills and consideration when it come sit planning dates either way waste of your time they are actually totally cool with sex work they want this to be a transaction where they buy emotional support and sex they just arent cool with woman setting the price they need to go to a place where they imagine the woman,MLeek
are poor enough that they can purchase it at a pittance and shell be grateful for the job you also wont find many vegans at a pig roast youve got a movement that on the gentler side thinks woman should stay at home and make babies and on the not so gentle side thinks women who dont stay at home should know what they are signing up for and deserve what they get so 10 of 11 of these women are not drama seeking asshats and 0 outta of these 11 men have any integrity at all is this really the first time hes been controlling and hypocritical or threatened to end the relationship because you didnt perform in ladylike ways because it appears he thinks there are one set of rules for him in life and a completely different set for you its handle you told her no and to keep her opinions to herself if she tries to speak to you or your husband again you repeat it a hit more strongly,MLeek
weve heard your opinion we disagree this conversation is closed we expect you to behave with kindness and respect from here on out you can speak again when shes done pouting that she didnt get her way and get free reign to shame you if she never gets over it thats also a win talk to your husband about the boundaries but this is a pretty clear case of if she cant say anything kind she is invited to say nothing if she cant even do that you wont be speaking yes this is very much a case of you needing to put your own oxygen mask on first you are trapped and the goal post for what getting help looks like will probably keep moving keeping you trapped if its not safe to be legally bound to him then its not safe and you need to act on that reality now start taking steps towards safety im not proud of it but its been validating over the years to find out how many,MLeek
my exes friends dumped him or ghosted him in the months after our break up i didnt realize at the time how much id been running interference and smoothing ruffled feathers without me around his ability to maintain other relationships seems to have suffered as well this it was what dawned on me too realizing that if my ex treated anyone else the way he treated me hed be fired and friendless 100x over it wasnt that he couldnt do it he just wouldnt do it when it came to me she didnt know what she meant you did exactly what you needed to do asking her what the difference was and what would qualify under plus that wouldnt appear in a bfgf relationship the fact she couldnt give you an answer and that you had to puzzle it out yourself was a red flag and i dont think the issue was about language proficiency the only thing to learn here is not to try to force an agreement where there isnt one can,MLeek
you make agreements about office time during the summer specific fixed times when you will go to the office or be working and only working all the more better if you can reinforce this schedule by actually leaving the house during this time playing it by ear obviously isnt suiting either of you and it makes sense that she and kids are playing it by ear over the summer months you are still working you either have hours or tasks that need to be completed you need more structure and clear expectations oh yeah and youll resell it easily enough easier even if you hold on to it for a year and sell it in june if you have a bedroom door that closes even a really small one will be fine just dont try to make a small one cool 4x the area its meant to ha yeah no way to know if it were just you id say roll the dice and find out but if you can swing a second hand,MLeek
or sale one for the doggo even if it only does one room thatd be my call i wouldnt chance it with a dog were all but guaranteed a few 28 afternoons coming our way soon and you wont know what that is like in your place till you know i dont use my air conditioner very often north facing and little direct light but for 1520 days of the year its necessary for me to function in the late afternoon and id say about half those days it gets me a better sleep as well add another week or two of me just not having to be concerned for the pupper are misogynists made or revealed she cheated she gets left and exposed during divorce proceedings she looses friends and ends up with a hostile coparenting relationship all totally fair to her although maybe not all fair to their children those are the consequences if hes out in the world treating other women like shit or worse that is on him if his,MLeek
daughters are aware of him doing this and they will be if they arent already thats on him and it makes me suspect he was always looking for excuse to do so she just handed him the perfect story to justify himself with you made a reasonable choice to address a problem that existed solely inside your own brain by limiting the amount of uselessyetanxietyprovoking information your brain received dont see a problem here managing input is a totally valid strategy i live my entire life with read receipts off for this very reason needlessly anxiety provoking not sure why anyone would want to use them in a healthy interpersonal relationship to be brutally honest be specific touchy is vague and accusatory you gotta be specific and clear and dont shift the blame on to your new girlfriend y no handholding okay thats not a friendship thing for me dont say anything about your girlfriend tell y what you like and dont like in your friendship if hugs hello or goodbye are cool say,MLeek
so if often helpful to shift to what is welcome and not fixate on what isnt also consider this though if you drastically change how you treat friends when youre in a relationship youre kind of telling your friends that when youre single you see them as an option and youre making it easy for them to blame your partner for choices that are actually totally yours healthy boundaries with people you value as friends should stay pretty consistent whether youre single or not you cant control how y is gonna respond but you also cant have a happy and healthy friendship with her if you cant tell her what your own feelings and boundaries are dont try to parent your siblings i know it sucks but that bigsister fix it role is toxic and wont save anyone instead just sent them fucking memes im serious send them funny videos you think they might like make small talk about the damn weather or a new game release if youre on a trip or outta,MLeek

on free child care from the inlaws if they do thats not a footnote that is a key consideration you are over thinking this shes rude taking it personally is not going to help the situation shes not your bestie just keep your distance and learn to shrug it off odds are good the rest of the family has id say youre shamelessly naive at best and disingenuous at worst if you genuinely believe that shameless was the only thing included above that was a gendered insult and or an thinly veiled attack and manipulation of his female partner i sincerely hope youre not a woman youd lack some really key skills needed to keep yourself safe and choose respectful relationships of the only problem above you can identify is that and ill assume youre not since you seem to be blissfully unaware that you might have a bias that blinds you or keeps valid information from you good luck in life seriously though i dont think so i mean i love mine but,MLeek
in zero gravity i think id go back to tampons i think now im curious really yes if you do not want to live with his mother andor you are not comfortable in a relationship with someone who is finically supporting their parent for the rest of their lives then this isnt the relationship for you your bf has not shown hes capable of saying no you need to protect your own sanity and future dont let this woman trap you into a life you dont want to live you can give you bf a warning about this dealbreaker but you need to be ready to break this deal he shouldnt propose no one has suggested he should he should have the integrity and intellectual constancy to leave the relationship instead of just creating a relationship so hostile to her values and her gender that he can blame her when she does what she should and leaves he should stop talking shit about the evil women of the world who are out to get,MLeek
him and harm the children and end a relationship where their goals are incompatible instead of just pontificating about how terrible women are and then how terrible this one woman is for not sticking around and working through the small issue of his open contempt for her and dont give me this disingenuous shit that he was pulling that 80 stat out as some sort of neutral mathematical fact that is not the context and we both know it if you think the only problematic thing here is the shameless comment then your mind is so open im shocked it hasnt fallen out of skull men many have lots of things working against them in life but this one is acting like shit youre responding to a post that is literally full of a man expressing to his gf of eight years how truly and deeply awful women are you see that right that is what he is doing he is all womaning his partner of eight years in the most demeaning possible way,MLeek
while connecting those demeaning attitudes towards her entire gender to why he is not willing to consider certain kinds of life commitments to her as an individual what i did was point out why his behaviour as an individual was utter fucking bullshit and a loselose for the op thats not all men just him hes bad based on what we have here he is a bad person for a woman to continue in a serious relationship with you can expect an adult man not to throw little temper tantrums every time he is mildly inconvenienced by daytoday life hes not just expressing his feelings he is failing to manage his bad attitude and making everyone around him suffer for it he is weaponizing his grumpiness and his incompetence in order to bully you into leaving him alone its shitty when a teenager does it its utterly unacceptable in a damn adult raise your expectations expect him to do it expect him take notice without being instructed like a lazy employee expect him to,MLeek
not act like a shit about it tell him these are now the expectations tell him a marriage will not survive not forever if he truly cannot meet them because it wont eventually you will get fed up almost all women in your position do you know he can do things he doesnt love without acting like a whiney toddler because if he couldnt hed constantly be getting fired he can do this he just doesnt think you deserve the effort your parents are shit even if they had anything like a point about you struggling with your boards or to find employment you and your bf are nearly 30 if youre dating seriously his family should get to know you warts and all the odds are good his parents wont be as shitty as yours and well make sure to send 10 billion tampons tell your gf exactly what youd like to do over those days and ask her which activities shed like to join you and which ones dont interest her suggest,MLeek
a romantic dinner in town invite her to take one of the trails then build your plan and it would probably be practical and kind for that plan to include an afternoon on the beach with her or a massage or any other number of relaxing periods together its okay to have different needs and interests on vacation and your gf has told you that your proposal doesnt include enough together time over those three days thats not insane its just different so reconsider id especially advise you to make sure your last full day of the vacation is a positive one for you both together its not rocket science both of you are digging in rather obnoxiously and assuming the worst of one another instead of actually talking about what matters to you both you have things you want to do she values relaxation and time together offer some plans and some reassurance and sort it out you do nothing this is your bf to handle its on him to tell you what,MLeek
he plans to do and to tell his father what is going to happen that includes facing the consequences for making choices if there was no explicit household rule against you two hooking up then dont apologize there is nothing to apologize for you existed as his gf in a space where you both reasonably believed you were welcome your bf needs to figure out how to navigate this for now youre not welcome in that home accept it with some grace and make alternative plans the first thing you do is agree with him if she is sick she is unwelcome if she feels unwelcome its because she has violated this boundary in the past and he has failed to communicate to her what is really expected of her which is to not come of she is ill thats not you putting ideas in anyones head that is literally the reality sick visitors are unwelcome including her if shes sick then your husband needs to stop asking and start telling you and he,MLeek
need to come to an agreement about the boundary and what will happen if she doesnt honour it and he needs to tell her what that boundary is and what your response will be if its violated for example if you are unhealthy do not come if you come and you develop a flu or cold were going to have you isolate from the rest of the family and change your flights you cannot control what she does and neither can he but the problem you could solve is getting rid of this tiptoeing fauxpolite language and just say what you mean its not are you sick its if you have any symptoms youre not welcome in our home no one who is symptomatic is welcome in our home at this time this is what you need to expect if you become symptomatic while visiting us if you are not happy with these terms do not visit at this time at some point it has to stop mattering if he can help it or,MLeek
not the outcome is the same he is manipulative and insulting and abusive that is what happened since the start and is happening now you can feel sorry for him if you think he genuinely cannot do any better but you cant date him and expect to be happy and healthy with him he is manipulative and insulting and abusive thats the reality and youre being naive this is intentional even if he knows its wrong the vast vast majority of this is intentional these are tactics hes learned and are practicing to make himself feel okay and get what he wants there is no should if you dont like it say so personally when my partner is clearly fishing for validation i try to make sure im a generous source i never actually met someone over the age of 14 who has expressed this but its one of those funny turns of phrase that can absolutely feel exclusionary in some contexts if youre talking to a room of 20 people and its a,MLeek
good mix guys is more obviously inclusive if youre talking to a room of 20 people and there are only one or two women it can hit differently the thing about arguing its neutral cause thats how we use it is youre arguing for a non literal meaning and relationship between the word and a concept and im here for it but if youre gonna argue for a nonliteral relationship between the word and a concept then you need to also know its fuzzy the conceptual framework is not necessarily always the same you cant and thats not a boundary a boundary would be im not going to go out with you if youre wearing those or im not comfortable daring someone who makes this choice a boundary is about what you do when you decide you cannot accept or tolerate something another person chooses youve expressed your preference and hes said no that is where this ends its not a debate or a negotiation im sorry you gender flipping narrative isnt going to,MLeek
go the way you hoped here but hes not a sex tourist these dumb women cant tell the difference between him and an entitled western sex tourist who would act exactly like he is acting i realize you probably dont mean to be sincere but yes that would be a comparable trap and a similar sort of emotional terrorism especially if she paired with it occasional hollow promises that she might agree to some of what the man wanted in the future relationship like kids or marriage or mortgage if he just stuck it out and tried to prove he wasnt like other men by suppressing his own wishes or needs in the relationship for some undefined length of time changing his mind is not the trap making up your mind that womenmen are to blame if you dont get what you want or shit doesnt work out for you and using that belief to attack the one individual womanman youve been with for nearly a decade is the trap hes told her if,MLeek
she leaves him for not wanting what she wants then shes just the rest of those evil women who dont stay loyal and if she stays because she puts faith in the little crumbs of a baby future he occasionally drops shell be one of those awful woman who wants to baby trap a good guy thats the trap that is laid for her to protect his ego at her expense leaving her the hard work of recognizing they are actually incompatible because he doesnt say we might not want the same thing he is saying give me what i want or youre a bad woman and the work ending this relationship and of being blamed for ending this relationship it has nothing to do with a person just changing their mind i think you have some serious thinking to do about what his role in the business actually is are you a team or is this your business is he your unpaid helper with this new job of yours or your employee is,MLeek
he investing in this with his time or any risk or is he just your partner you make life plans and have obligations with if this your business and youll be using it to meet your financial agreements in the relationship on your own then sure tell him to shove it and be supportive but if youd want to be a team and have his unpaid help for the new company or have him share in the risks of being an entrepreneur then you cannot tell him to just grin and bare it if you want him to share the risks then you cant always pull rank and silence him you have a dream he doesnt share and that can still work as long as you both understand his role and maintain boundaries you need to realize that if you want him to be your teammate and takes this risk with you then you need to listen to him and accept if he feels strongly or differently than you if hes just your partner,MLeek
and this is your job then you can tell him not to say anything if he has nothing nice to say im far more concerned that youre only allowed to walk around the room for exercise you do seem hypersensitive to anything food related they also seem rude both things can be true all of that pales in comparison to the fact you seem to have accepted your partner imprisoning you stick with the therapy you have way bigger issues than his sister not accurately observing how many tacos you ate the first thing you do is give yourself permission to be upset not furious with him just hurt and upset you had a reasonable belief and a basis in trust and that got pulled away from you thats sad thats painful the second thing you do is trust him to do the work he needs to do you cannot do it for him you can examine and address your response but you cant aid him in managing his own shit he needs to,MLeek
manage it you need to trust and expect that he will do so and he will communicate what assistance he needs running around trying to read his mind on how to help him is not going to improve the issue here thats just more of the same problem as before a relationship where you cant rely on your partner to be honest with isnt going to survive that actually isnt something you can fix for him thats something he needs to recognize he must fix if he wants a healthy relationship how dare those females not want to talk to someone on a dating app that they didnt actually indicate they wanted to talk to on that dating app s yeah i can believe he did and all those women he thought were furious were actually quite uncomfortable and using the very wise stay perfectly still dont attract the crazy persons attention strategy for public transit i cant believe i had to scroll this far this was a deliberate planned act of abuse with,MLeek
a little bit of public shaming thrown in and bonus points for isolating gf from any immediate support network nothing she could have done justified that act its fucking madness people are talking about couples privilege and boundaries instead of just praying that this woman runs for the damn hills before op feels entitled to further escalate his tactics to make his point youre describing her being inconsiderate and you being abusive that wasnt an asshole move that was abuse if she was asking for advice id be telling her to pack her bags because shes currently living with a man who used gifts as weapons and used her flaws however real they are to justify his deliberate malicious abuse you really think its wise or productive to assigned your introverted partner who is working hard to engage with others a new task she must do at the same time or youll be upset with her do you really think this is going to result in anything except her withdrawing further from everyone dont,MLeek
let your pride turn into her burden the first thing you do is seriously reconsider if this needs to be discussed at all or if you just need to manage your own responses and stop stewing if you decide you need to talk about it start by actually recognizing the work shes already doing before you start giving notes give praise and validation for how she focuses on others and ask questions like if she notices or even agrees with what you think youve noticed then ask her for the favour do not accuse do not declare your experiences to be objective reality acknowledge you are probably being oversensitive and fixating do not assign her more work while she socializes manage your own shit trust that she doing the work ask for favoursawareness but dont make your shit her job your ex has the emotional maturity of a toddler it would be dangerous to rely on such an unstable and disloyal person for your financial security its really no more complicated than that trusting,MLeek
him is a stupid risk to take its okay to admit this relationship doesnt serve your needs its okay to admit it doesnt serve your needs even if he cant help it you dont have to understand perfectly what his thoughts or experiences are you can look at your thoughts and experiences and make a decision based solely on that in fact that is always the way you should make this sort of decision when it comes to dating just dating someone not by trying to read someone elses mind or dreaming of the couldbes of the future but by asking if this relationship actually works for you today as it is does this relationship meet your needs do you feel happy secure and respected the perfect trap no matter what happens in this relationship as long as she stays itll be her fault when she leaves itll be her fault hes a 30 year old man who is not responsible for any of his own choices because the evil womens are making him,MLeek
do shit or worse leaving him when he maybewouldhavereallysoon had done some shit how dare she judge him on his actual actions and not his vague promises dude if the porn is making you uncomfortable you could just not watch it thats okay too the porn made for men and consumed by men has very little to do with any individual woman youre at risk of meeting in real life its exactly that often when a heavy dose of she wanteddeserved it good on him for getting what he wanted from the hot young piece i always say the same thing im not questioning her judgement im questioning his talking about autonomy and selfdetermination is just moving the goalposts were actually talking about judgment and risk not consent there can be consent there is still a valid question of the older persons judgment and the youngers risk i am sure the 22yearold is quite mature and competent probably above average for their age that is part of why an older person with ill intent,MLeek
would target them the outward appearance of maturity is a great mask for the behaviour they wish to actually engage in im sure the 22yearold is making reasonable choices on the basis of the information they have and they have limited information what the fuck is wrong with the 40yearold who thinks this is a reasonable choice for an equitable and respectful relationship i know whys a 22yearold might think that about dating a 40yearold but i do not know a sane and balanced 40yearold who would agree we dont need to judge the 22yearold as anything except a person who objectively has only 22 years of life experience 22 years of bullshitdetecting or really about 4 or so useful years compared to the decades of experience of the older someone with poor judgment and likely will ill intent who has learned to mask their bullshit its advice i imagine op comprehends just fine that one of the randos online whose opinion she sought out is not an omnipotent supreme master to whom she,MLeek
is by inexplicable force required to obey but hey maybe they were confused so good on you youre assume he knows what there is to confess he may very well may not what you know is that he kissed someone else that can be enough straight people can cheat gay people can cheat bi people can cheat its all the same really they can all also choose to be monogamous there is nothing you could do to save yourself and really he may still honestly be straight you cant really know but that isnt actually the core problem here ah yes the old i am incapable of building actual friendships with female persons and perceiving them as anything other than sex objects therefore all men as just as trash me always a nice and tidy its reasonable to give the younger person advice that this is risky and can be harmful we dont have to keep such an open mind that our brains fall right out we can balance respect for individuals with basic,MLeek
reason and valid concerns but if its legal there is not much besides giving advice that most other people can do to force the younger person to stop dating this adult i understand your feelings but you need to remember the adults involved here are going to want to make sure the young person has safe places to turn when this goes badly and that they are not isolated from everyone else in their life who actually cares for them abusers like to isolate victims this can be especially easy for an abuser to achieve in this sort of agegap relationship if everyone takes an absolutist position you can be right to judge the 22 year old person is doing a very bad thing and making a bad judgment that raises serious concerns about their intentions and motivations but attacking them directly may not be the best way to support the 15yearold person and keep the risks as low as possible for them there is a balance block him stop feeling badly for him,MLeek
and start getting mad at him for how badly hes treating everyone else especially you he doesnt love you not as a person he doesnt give a shit about you hes just cast you in a role in his personal little drama and hes trying to force you to play it whenever he gets bored with his real life this is his little script and he just playing it out its nonconsensual roleplay its gross its childish its mean hes actively manipulating you and hurting you for his own amusement whenever he cant think of anything more fun to do its not love its nothing like love block him everywhere that is the only way youll break free of being a side character in his story and start being able to really live your own while its painful it doesnt really matter the outcome of this situation is you have to end the relationship he cheated he broke the agreement he lied to you about it he doesnt appear to understand what he did,MLeek
was wrong it was wrong if he is straight and its wrong if he is not straight it doesnt matter what the truth is inside his own head about his own sexuality he may well be straight youll probably never know he might not even know and not be able to tell you the truth dont debate him just say you made out with someone else youre not telling me he forced you youre not even seeming to say its a drunken mistake and youre sorry youre just telling me you played along and choose to make out with someone else if i cant trust you not to make out with someone else anyone else then we shouldnt be together its not right for either of us to continue in that case youre wrong for staying in a marriage with someone you are trying to exert an absurd amount of control over and who simply does not agree with you and who is an adult human being and entitled to not agree with you,MLeek
and frankly didnt agree with you before marriage either you need to have some damn boundaries for yourself not try to make rules you imagine you can force your wife to follow boundaries are for you agreements are for the two of you together when you try to say things like you cant be friends with him youre trying to make a rule like you would for a toddler it doesnt work that marriage work on agreements not rules if you no longer have an agreement that works walk away from this before you further demean yourself thats the boundary the boundary is you walking away from something you have said you cannot tolerate why misogyny well that is clearly a coordinated attack against us for being exactly the cesspool anyone would have expected when it comes to a successful woman comic forced to give birth and very likely die in the process they are literally crowing for the death of women and children and calling the rest of ghouls the stoic provider is,MLeek
such a shit deal for men too ive seen so many men made miserable by it especially since its basically a myth for most families in 2023 i dont see why anyone would cling to it except that it codifies their dominance over women there is basically no other perk except that you get to tell yourself youre the boss and ignore a lot of the housework i guess for some guys thats a biggie its not okay to make your partner the one who failed to get you there its not okay when women do that to men its not okay that youre describing doing it to others id never tell a partner they didnt get me to orgasm id tell them what i experienced did i orgasm how good was it how it could be better and what i like or dont like but would never ever make my orgasm their sole responsibility with that kind of terrible language there are lots of reasons i may not reach an orgasm that have,MLeek
nothing to do with them and i can ask for what i want without telling or even implying to them that they failed to get me there if youre telling people they didnt get you there thats not a critique you may intend to follow up that comment with a critique but thats criticism and blame for something they were not in full control of its not okay when women do that to men its not okay that youre describing doing it to others especially not someone else who is making an effort to prioritize your pleasure as well or who reasonably did not have information you didnt give them that is how you crush an inexperienced partner by assigning blame for something they could not know without being told and implying ownership of something they do not own and make an experienced one reconsider you whereas men never ever lie about their age or weight only height and only height because women are shallow and unfair to everyone under 66 and not because,MLeek
they have unmanaged personal insecurities or a deeply warped sense of how to perform masculinity mostly from and for other men s the perspective i have in my 30s is why i caution young people against this that isnt a projection that is a valid kind of information calling it projection is just a common way to dismiss women with shes just old and jealous that is hardearned information i didnt have available to me a decade ago have all of the older individuals in large agegap relationships actively chosen that relationship due to the power imbalances inherent in it no of course not i dont know any reasonable human being who has made that argument we all know the exceptions weve all met them but the generalization exists because most of us have met fare more of those are a hell of a lot of those older partners with illintent andr bad behavior yes absolutely if the experience gap wasnt part of the attraction to this dynamic the agegap relationship would be much,MLeek
less likely to appear as a compatible match to the older person if someone comes online for advice from random strangers about their experiences in a relationship as a much younger partner you cant be giving very good advice if you ignore that dynamic keeping an open mind doesnt mean letting your brain fall right out of your head being respectful of individual choice doesnt mean never expressing an informed reasonable opinion about the risks associated with that choice anyone in their 20s man or woman should be advised that a large age gap relationship carries a different set of risks and that they should be aware of those risks and keep their eyes wide open for them because 100 of us think we are the expectation to the rule and the vast majority of us are going to be wrong not a dude but id expect this guy is talking about the distinction between a prostate orgasm and a penile orgasm but lacks the sexual education to describe it very accurately hell he,MLeek
might be appalled to realize the real orgasm hes describing is perfectly well understood by many gay men while some men can experience both simultaneously for a lot of men a prostate orgasm is not associated with ejaculation itself whereas a penile one pretty much always is associated with ejaculation unless youre engaging in some pretty particular practices i wont get into here not everyone requires anal penetration in order to stimulate the prostate but most seems too in my direct experience its sometimes called the pspot analogous to gspot but obviously different anatomically speaking because its also full of nerve endings and the orgasm associated with it are described as a more fullbody experience more similar to what women describe from gspot orgasms but again not a guy just answering because i feel like youre unlikely to get an answer from a man or amab person here and one willing to be open about anal play just a queer woman with some decent sex education and a strapon that is pretty different i,MLeek
was a young adult with a job and an apartment i could consent and i did i was inexperienced but not powerless that is straightup criminal what youre describing even if you could legally consent to sex in the country where you live and you probably couldnt at 14 that would still be abuse and criminal it would still be abuse and criminal if youd be 20 years older when it happened im sorry you went through that i hope youre doing well these days thats it this whole argument about the younger person ie the woman is just classic blame women for mens bad behaviour i absolutely consented to my relationships with men in thier 30s and 40s when i was 20 i was also gaslighted and manipulated very deliberately by most of those men because while i did sort of accidentally end up dating them i didnt have any big thing for older men they did not accidentally end up dating me they selected me for my inexperience and my appearance of,MLeek
maturity the first is why they got away with their shit and the second is why it was even somewhat socially acceptable for them to date me because well she so mature for her age i never question the maturity or intelligence of the 20something with the 40something i know shes mature and intelligent probably more so than most that is why is part of why she is a desirable target for this behaviour a 20yearold who acts like a teenager isnt what these men want they want someone who passes and whose positive personal qualities can be used to excuse and justify their predation hah i have so much firsthand experience with this delusion men say oh youre catching feelings when i say shit like i like hooking up with you but you need to stop trying to sext with me during my workday and then pouting about it when i dont engage im busy or dude i like hooking up with you but im not paying 50 for an uber both ways,MLeek
every single time we can share the expense or you can come my way sometimes or even if you booty call me at 1045 for an 11 pm meet on a tuesday im probably already asleep and also no dont blow up my phone in almost every single case where i expressed boundaries or needs in a transparent casual sexfwb situation that the man didnt like or couldnt meet he declared that i had caught feelings and was trying to make it a relationship its so predictable now i just laugh and end contact she caught feels it the goto cope for men who dont want to treat casual sex partners with any respect is he talking about prostate orgasms does he realize hes talking about the prostate if you wanna get pegged dude you have to be able to say so like weve been encouraging women for a little while now to explore their own pleasure know what works for them and speak up about what gets them off guys can and should,MLeek
do the same absolutely im here for it but that isnt about anyone else getting better at sex thats about you getting better at talking about sex and honestly ive never heard people rank other peoples orgasms before rank thier own sure but other peoples thats just fucking weird i think you might need to buy a butt plug dude cause her reasons are totally emotional and predictable flaws in her weak female character my reasons for breaking my agreements are just natural and rational the mind boggles at this shit it really does im glad other people piled on here cause i read through this and i just couldnt i didnt have to bandwidth to deal with an adult man jumping in and telling this exhausted woman she wasnt entitled to her anger or to express it clearly that she had to hold her grown ass husbands hand through the basics of human decency and empathy that while dealing with a farm a small child and fucking cancer she had to further set,MLeek
herself aflame to make sure her poor little hubby didnt have to have to face the reasonable consequences for his bad behaviour her anger and a very serious fight being a perfectly reasonable and foreseeable consequence of his bad behavior who doesnt understand that some fights are necessary and valid and that a fight doesnt mean cussing and insults a fight means saying youre wrong and you done fucked this up this is not a debate this me telling you that your behaviour is unacceptable thats a fight and a fight worth having a 42yearold marine doesnt need to be petted or begged to behave like his wife is a human being he needs to be told he is the wrong and he done fucked up he needs be told to shape up or ship out this guy just put a masterclass on why more and more women are forgoing marriage entirely men are just dumb animals you have to respect and accept us as dumb animals incapable of leaving relationships that arent meeting,MLeek
our needs acting with integrity before impulse or communicating with our female partners as if they were full human beings ive never met a feminist who thinks so little of men as these sorts of men think of other men and he also probably thinks men are the dumb animals who cant behave ethically without regularly getting their rocks off with a hopefully consenting woman who should be basically in charge of everything or whats really going on is hes turned off by the constant accusations the refusal to believe him when he speaks and lack of emotional regulation op displayed here lots of men also need to feel safe and respected to be aroused he was right to break up with you you didnt believe him about his sexual interest there are lots of things you can in a healthy relationship when youre having doubts or concerns but accusing your partner over and over of lying to you is not one of them that was already a huge problem i dont know about,MLeek
the laughing but in your own report here you had already created a really toxic situation by repeating your accusations over and over again and refusing to accept any answer you should have left if you werent satisfied but you didnt leave feb you did have a violent outburst i wont tolerate people who throw things in anger either hes made up his mind and been clear its sad but its just a break up all you can do is be better in the future with someone else you know thats not cute he knows its not cute cute is not what hes trying to achieve with that thats cringey and controlling and hes manipulating you thats right everyone and everyones family dynamic is different shes told you what she sees the risks as for her family and her relationships and shes not willing to take them its not really fair to decide not to believe her just because it wouldnt work out the same way in your family it is discouraging and sad,MLeek
dale was an abusive piece of shit but anna isnt you and anna have a disagreement a serious and painful one but still just a disagreement its up to you what that means for the friendship some friendships can survive those sorts of painful disagreements and some dont you said youre shocked and confused by annas response but her response is not shocking or confusing shes not prioritizing him over you shes prioritizing what she feels is the peace and security of her family dynamic for decades to come it may be hurtful or disappointing or wrong but her response is totally understandable its okay to take distance from the friendship or even end it but shes not a monster shes a flawed human being who was pretty honest with your about her own fears and those fears where some of the real biggies youre not overreacting to dale you and your husband need to block him everywhere and stop engaging document dont engage but you are being a bit naive when it comes,MLeek
to anna she was pretty transparent about her fears and its not shocking she feels unwilling or able to confront or police her father you certainly dont have to continue to be annas friend in light of her choice but dont pretend its so confusing its fucking terrifying for her confronting him could cost her a lot with her entire family for years if not the rest of her life shes scarred she doesnt want it take that risk she also likely feels rather powerless to stop him so why would she set her own life on fire trying to control something she cant we can call her wrong or cowardly you can choose to end contact with her but lets not pretend her choices are irrational or insane they might be wrong but they arent that stop this and seek help hes done plenty of shit wrong technically and otherwise youre keeping a friend who youd literally need to warn other friends to keep a careful distance from itd be easier to make,MLeek
decent friends if you dont keep shitty ones around you know you have a pattern you know youre repeating it stop that his prespective is selfish and unkind youre dealing with cancer a small child and a farm his job might be difficult and stressful but youre the one in a fucking war right now youre not having trouble understanding his perspective it just sucked it actually sucked just as badly as you know it sucked youre not wrong youre not confused he really really fucking failed you the fact he was disappointed is understandable the fact he was angry and pouting like a toddler who didnt get his cookie was not understandable it was gross it was literally insane a sane person would have said something like im not mad but i was hoping to have sex last night and that didnt happen i get why it didnt but it was disappointing and left me feeling disconnected that was a conversation you could have actually had but that isnt what he said so,MLeek
get mad with him have the fight tell him youre hurt and angry and exhausted and you dont appreciate being punished for being human and needing to sleep youre allowed to be mad with him when he doesnt meet the bare standard required of a sane person supporting their spouse he didnt clear the bar tell him so you need to stop this isnt healthy this isnt you needing any advice this is something else take it up with a therapist embrace the advice you find beneficial but i wouldnt advise you level up a relationship with a man who sees you as a project and doesnt believe youre worthy of that yet because he hasnt had enough time to work on your appearance thats a bit too shallow and condescending to be anything like a healthy foundation hes treating you like an accessory not a partner he may be a great fwb for a while but this behaviour isnt what id look for or accept in a serious partner if hes stuck in,MLeek
the role of coach or mentor with you then his support is conditional on you accepting his authority meeting his expectations for change and keeping up with the jones while that might be beneficial enough and lovely in a friendship where you can keep some boundaries and take some distance as needed that is not what id want in a partner you are right to recognize that is probably not a good thing long term for your confidence to put too much stock in his judgment of you this sounds like a person with some great advice and knowledge a person who can you can value and have fun with but maybe not a person you should put any personal fragility or vulnerability into the hands of dating is hard work and its mostly disappointing that is what it is youre not doomed youve had slightly below average luck recently if you let that become a story where you tell yourself are doomed then you will be your chosen narrative will doom you you,MLeek
need to improve your screening and your resilience to disappointment and rejection the goal should be to get rejected or do the rejecting quickly a month is too long to be chatting online with someone without meeting when it lingers like that the risk of disappointment and crossed wires increases drastically if finding a healthy relationship is something you are ready for and looking for make it your parttime job use all your channels and apps and let your friends know youre open to being set up if youre talking to someone and they arent open to planning a date after a week or so of chatting then that means they arent interested or arent available and you move on you cannot control other peoples shit and they have a lot it you can only control yours there are no promises in life but there is more or less unhappiness dont choose more unhappiness for yourself will bullshit stories like everyone is hung up and i will never find someone these are lies that,MLeek
are going to drag you down the truth is its really rough out there and i might not find what i want but im excited to try in a way that keeps me healthy and happy exactly this there isnt a male brain and a female brain just a lot of human brains on a big old spectrum the brain is getting different inputs and genetic sex and gender are just one part of that and the more we look the more sex seems to be a pretty small part of it the neurotypical human brain is pretty adaptable organ which also means it tries to adapt to environmental and societal expectations the differences that have been sometimes noted which have often been overstated by a whole ton of motivated reasoning in the past really cannot be reliably attributed to genetic sex welp shes incapable of treating you in a loving way as long as you stay this is how youll be treated this continues until you end it and learn not to mistake,MLeek
intense drama for love if there is nothing wrong with it why do you have the take it on the chin the phrase as its actually used isnt neutral an offer of friendship is usually a good thing and something anyone could just accept or reject its not a zone its an offer of a kind of relationship you say yes or no to it the phrase friendzoned is only used by people trying to imply they have been treated unjustly or are being punished by not being offered something more than friendship lets not try to rehabilitate the word adults should just not use it at all because an offer of friendship isnt something you take on the chin rejection is youre talking about rejection lets call it what it is and expect people to learn to deal with it im saying we agreed is not helpful or any sort of argument against the situation im not saying it easy its the hardest thing in the world and the quicker you do it,MLeek
the better off youll be and im encouraging you to look at his behaviour today with a clear eye and not with the hopes and expectations you built up over 8 years those past hopes will cloud your judgement and all the fear and embarrassment you feel about the wedding are exactly the weapons hes trying to use to threaten you hes turned every deposit and invite to your marriage into a knife he can stick in you while he tried to renegotiate the relationship contract those arent fair terms and that isnt kind thats todays reality its nurture not nature women are praised for multitasking but it usually just means continuing to work until all necessary lifesustaining tasks are completed most of what is called multitasking is just tasking if youre used to doing many tasks youre used to it if youre far doing too many tasks youre probably doing some poorly being used to it often means youre a better judge of which ones you can do poorly and still lifesustain there,MLeek
is nothing about human brains that magically make women better at it only that if its more expected of person a than b a will tend to get better at it and b may not even be recognized when they do it well this problem persists until you send his packing thats the conversation now its done youre breaking up with him because he has shown you no respect or consideration for years of course his mommy says be nice to you she knows damn well shell have to bail him out once you stop she might not know just how bad it is but she knows figure out the practicallegal matters like the lease and let him know when he is expected to be out by if you dont want to have any more children he seems to be prepared to leave this relationship thats the reality admit it out loud to one another accept it start working towards it i dont like how hes behaved here but you need to acknowledge that,MLeek
he is serious and that this partnership has reached a dealbreaker it is something you do need to discuss and you need to stop saying we agreed because thats not an argument he changed his mind hes allowed to that a risk we take in partnerships deal with todays reality stop trying to enforce yesterdays its gone then dont date her this is not complicated she is not kind you have all the evidence of that you could possible need what is wrong with you that you keep in dating her trust your instincts its nice to hope that hes not up to anything shady but that conversation a year ago was a pretty massive red flag that this is not a stable and mature guy looking for genuine adult friendship its totally okay to enjoy the past memories for what they are and close the door on the person today this man was considering cheating on his partner with you a year ago and is again derek isnt being kind that was inappropriate,MLeek
conversation for him to have with you while in a relationship you shot him down but hes ready to try again proceed with extreme caution it is reasonable to be concerned his apology was selfserving this man has not signalled he values you as a friend but as an escapist fantasy and a possible affair partner the odds on this going well for you are pretty slim it seems far more likely that she was trying to include you as her friend and as someone outside the department and not suspicious to her supervisor than that she knew of remembered or understood your sensory aversion come on man you know people who dont have experiences like this rarely remember that others do its really pretty unlikely she was trying to hurt you if she even knew which is already kinda unlikely i enjoy pegging my bf im going to tell him from now hes forbidden from eating at his favourite burrito place because he must always be freely available to me will report back,MLeek
if you dont want to be in a relationship with a bisexual man dont be dont make it more complicated than that you want to break up thats fine do that if youre going to stay in this relationship i think you need to take a hard look at what youre so damn afraid of while i can agree that if he was out among his friends he ought to have shared this and i understand your sense of betrayal you trying to frame this in the language of consent is misleading and concerning way to look at your partners sexual orientation after a year if you never asked him about his past partners his porn use or internal life then hes got a bit of a point learn to ask people about themselves i mean he rather correctly judged that you wouldnt be okay with it given your response here one of you needs to end this clearly he knew you wouldnt take this well and now you really really havent your sense,MLeek
of betrayal is reasonable a hell of a lot of the rest of what youre saying here is not stop spinning just dont be in a relationship you dont want to be in dont keep making the same mistake wish him well in his mental health journey and keep moving forward without him this seems like a lot of work to maintain secrecy not just privacy but some serious hardcore secrecy in order to avoid having to set boundaries with one asshole cousin how are you gonna silence your fiancs family at the wedding are you going to expect your children to lie to their grandparents about their experiences i have trouble believing a person who achieved this level of success would be this incapable of handled interpersonal conflict you obviously need to tell your family in the sense that hiding your life from them is unsustainable if you intend to maintain any contact with any of them some truths will nee to come out just in the course of normal human conversation so,MLeek
start having normal human conversations with the family members you value and see how it goes however you must realize that your harsh judgement of their character is a large part of what some of them are going to be legitimately angry about i think you need to grow up and learn to handle rejection with some grace and maturity this woman picked up on your interest and has given you a clear no shes not an object to do things too she a person who you must reasonably assume is not interested in you dont be a creep respect it it wasnt weird to begin with at this point its absurd inviting her over for some brand name handmedowns was just absurd of course op got what she always got but its not at all weird that the daughter is asking for more of what she always gets why wouldnt she this is clearly the price of admission to being jims wife op can accept that and minimize her own contact with haley,MLeek
or she can leave this marriage because the third option of either haley or jim changing their behaviour is exceedingly unlikely and totally out of her control hey if youd just choose to be my sex toy thats totally the same as having agency youre shit bag for every second you continue doing what is comfortable and easy for you instead of what is honest and respectful of her you cant undo your past shitbaggery but you could stop being a shit bag at any second in the future you choose shes not required to like you it is weird you keep trying to force a relationship with her when it is clear she is not interested in your friendship you also cant force your husband to be a more skilled parent than he is he bought an apology from a 21 year old thats who ya married hes not a great father not as your describe it here hes a weak willed idiot who appear to have failed to build a real interpersonal,MLeek
relationship with her beyond his role as piggy bank and doesnt have healthy boundaries with her you need to politely decline to speak to haley take yourself out when she visits expect your adult husband to manage his own relationship and give him the time and space to do with minimal impact on you if she is she not willing or able to be civil and jim wont enforce boundaries or consequences for poor behaviour then dont expose yourself to her whether or she is a good person is sort of beside the point you two dont have to be buddies stop trying if she wants to cut off contact or if her father wants to pay her off thats between them opt out let jim handle his own shit and this is very much his shit 40 min walk little less than 20 min bike transit options are sorta indirect and poor so 2030 mins when i do use them 70 mins is my personal cut off time for commute i know can,MLeek
tolerate a reliable 70 mins but an hour and half by ttc probably means two hours on most days if you work a standard day that would drive me insane ugh yeah my eyes just about rolled out my head when i read that ya almost feel badly for them when they fall under the spell of some influencer with a get rich quick scheme to sell to depressed men almost but it doesnt matter here what matters is to stop knowingly doing harm to this woman because it easier than dealing with your own shit alone i cant believe these guys are whining about fable none of them were gonna play fable except to whine about bad and unplayable it is besides shell have have demons horns and glowing red eyes by half way though because its fucking fable its been two month hun this is who he is this is his character you just hadnt seen it yet this is the person he is and you didnt like it you shouldnt it,MLeek
was gross he failed the friend part of fwb and made it clear he is unsafe to continue with that is why you kicked him out because he was unsafe to be with the pounding on your door with a mix of insults and begging should be a dealbreaker even if nothing else was that should be unacceptable in any relationship end it block him move on the person you thought you knew has been lost because they werent real two months in and the mask fell this is the real person you saw what this man looks like when hes not getting his way and it wasnt just ugly it was bordering on dangerous dont be an idiot get rid of him its not that complicated at all you need to speak to a family lawyer so you know what your obligations are if any to him as a coparent you need to pursuing a custody agreement so you know what you actually have to speak to him about thats how you protect,MLeek
your rights and your childs besides those obligations everything else is harassment you tell him to stop contacting you about anything except necessary contact regarding your child and that if he doesnt do that the police can explain to him that he needs to stop harassing you you stop saying please and you start saying i am i documenting this to share with law enforcement then you do just that ignore every call and document the behaviour for law enforcement and the courts its baffling to me that you can read what he says about the woman he claims to love but take exception to me accurately labelling the behaviour op exhibits right here and already knows is pretty shitty himself op is being unkind and delusional he doesnt need to be kindly pet he needs to be honest with himself and her about his opinions the opinions he just plainly told us and claims to have held for a long while and act accordingly being at work together is absolutely not enough thats,MLeek
not an unfair thing to say its a very true and important thing to acknowledge youre not 13 year olds you cannot just hang out at lunch and expect a healthy relationship to develop a serious adult relationship does require time and effort and planning and yes some money on transit without any of that your relationship will die out thats not mean of her to say thats just her telling you water is wet ive never owned a car when im dating i know its a expense ubers meals tickets its part of my budget i dont make a hell of a lot and when you date someone seriously and exclusively you should talk about budgets and expenses and frequency of meetingdate night its unclear here if youre the one who is interpreting this to mean have a car but if you dont have a car you still have to put thought and effort and some money into how you spend time together outside of work its been gentrifying for the last two,MLeek
decades like any downtown areas you need to practice some situational awareness and youll the one or two corners or parks to avoid but its really no more unsafe now that comparably dense downtown areas you dont respect her at all you dont think shes loyal and your approach to dating and chatting with women generally sounds like that of a teenager not a grown ass man of almost 30 drop this connection behave like an adult who has some standards and self respect and date adults who you also respect shes never going to thank you for this selfish selfabsorbed waffling bullshit if you dont want a lifetime monogamous relationship with her its high time to gtfo you have bad case of main character syndrome here but youre not the hero youre just a indecisive jerk chasing a dragon he is unlikely to ever catch you sound like dissatisfaction may be your drug of choice and thats fine lots of people live full and fascinating lives exactly that way its totally wonderful way,MLeek
to live and some of dearest friends live that way just stop being dishonest with her about it shes a person not a discardable side character in your personal adventure who will text you in a few years to validate you dear god man 631 per cent of the vote thats what got her third place last time impressive hell yes but a win this time yeah thats a hell of a stretch youre living in lala land if youre bringing this to events and just hope it works out you know most venues wont allow this and youre not doing due diligence and checking in advance if youre going to events with him you need to make a real effort to be informed and considerate if you only want to buy tickets to venues that dont check or dont prohibit it then you need to do that thats fine i 100 get that and think its a totally valid personal choice but your current approach of just buying tickets making the plan and,MLeek
then rolling dem dice is deeply rude to anyone out with you if you were my female friend and did this more then once id be royally pissed off with you and would stop going to shows with you he may also be an asshat who said some mean things but hes not wrong about leaving this at home when youre going to venues you can reasonably assume prohibit it the entire pua marketing department would disagree they are literally selling men on the concept of fat ugly studs a post mortem distress birth is a bad nonmedical term referring to the delivery of a baby who has already passed away either in utero or during labor which should be painfully obvious to anyone who actually reads this with two brain cells firing the order of the words mean the birth is taking place after the death if it was what he said it was it would be something like postnatal stressinduced filicide a vaguely medical sounding phrase i also just made the fuck,MLeek
up its also the dangerous and traumatic thing that prolifers are trying to force on pregnant people and their families who overwhelmingly want to bring home a living infant i know four women in my extended circle who hit 30 and were disappointed they didnt have kids they did not make youtube channels they changed jobs moved to lower cost of living areas two choose sperm donors and two adopted when women want to be parents they seem more likely to do the work even alone i think a lot of the men whinging online dont really want to be a parent they want a child like a trophy like a steam achievement like a box they checked men say baby crazy but the women i know were all pretty baby sane the men i know who have turned 40 and gone legacy crazy are the toxic ones you gotta watch out for they dont even seem to notice that the age which women are guaranteed to be miserable keeps getting later and later,MLeek
when i first started reading this bullshit it was 28 then 30 then 35 and now definitely sometime in our 40s these guys look around every few years and begrudgingly admit that the women dont seem miserable yet but its coming they tell themselves we were promised they would become so much more unhappy then i have been all these years figure it out for yourselves is where the benefit of the doubt would die for me and id be polishing off my cv they may not be bad people but they are consciously doing a bad thing to the staff by rewarding this type of competition your vp and immediate director have already shown you how they are empowered too and willing too act you dont have the power to stop this you can advise the other woman against playing the game but you may be asking for a herculean feat from them you can keep pointing out to any leadership who will listen that this is counterproductive and that this sort of,MLeek
competition or resource allocation via canabalism doesnt improve outcomes it wastes time and resources and could loose them talent you shouldnt do anything unless she asks you too that doesnt mean you should do anything she asks but this is temporary if she just needs to vent in your direction but keep her head down and keep the peace at work thats not an unreasonable choice for her stop trying to run interference and manage all these people they are both conflict avoidant your girlfriend needs your sympathy and your support but dont charge in with sword drawn she may need to feel a lot of distress before she is willing to express her own boundaries with him support her when she does but dont try to hard to minimize her unhappiness its trying to teach her something ask your girlfriend if she needs anything more than a safe space to vent ask her if she is confident her choice to keep the peace and placate him is the best one just agreeing out,MLeek
loud that yes shes thought about it and that is her decision may really help her to recognize she is making a choice here its not just a shitty thing happening to her shes considered the pros and cons and decided how to handle it personally i would recommend she adopt a strict i dont drive rule with him and enforce it mercilessly but thats just me if you need too tell her you also might at times need a safe space from the venting and ask to figure out a signal you can give if you just dont have the emotional bandwidth to listen to her in that exact moment make sure the two of you are enjoying time outside of the house go a damn farmers market or a museum do an activity itll give you something else to talk about and share in beside your work and your roommate has low iron levels your expectations do seem to be very high given you are both employed adults and live separately you,MLeek
sound like you need to build a fuller life for yourself to be honest take a class join a book club make a friend if youre sitting on your butt alone the 34 night a week he isnt sleeping over and you dont like that then ya need to change it but that doesnt mean this relationship is a good one for you or something you should stick out you have very high expectations for together time and this guy doesnt even have a place you can visit let alone stay and you seem honestly confused about his living situation that is bizarre for seven months in stick with the therapist and ditch the girlfriend you know you are repeating your past patterns you know you shouldnt buy your gf of less than four months a damn car you know shes moving quickly to financially tie you to her because she has lifestyle goals and financial goals she cannot meet wifi if you you know shes with your primarily for the financial stability because,MLeek
shes told you as much she might also care for you on some level but if you lost your job tomorrow or got seriously ill shed be gone you know this what you lack right now is the courage to act on what you know to be true oh im so glad you clarified you didnt mean it in a gay way s ffs it seems he is currently or at least is setting himself up to be practicing polygamy again i think a reasonable person would say thats what he seems to be up to if you think he is not violent and is serious about holding you to this marriage unless you are not religious regular trips to the bar might be your best solution your boyfriend is manipulative tell him you dont issue gold medals for not being abusive and that your need for more consistent contact is valid youre not victim and neither is he you have a clear reasonable request and hes just insulting you instead of working with,MLeek
you to maintain contact and connection in some way even if that way isnt ft seriously though the first time a man told me i was just playing the victim to try and shut me up would conveniently for him be last time ever spoke to him this guy has told you he doesnt take you seriously and that he feels entitled to punish you by withholding contact thats how shitty parents treat screaming toddlers these should be dealbreakers yeah most westen people not knowing your legalreligious context would conclude he is in fact abusive im not trying to tell you how you have to label your own marriage but lets not keep such an open mind that our brain falls right out there is more meant by the word abusive than just someone who hits you someone who leaves you in danger because they dont fulfil legal or financial obligations to you may also be engaging in abusive behaviour he is either your soontobe exhusband or he is a bigamist or hes cheating,MLeek
on you or you are in a plural marriage or he s abusive one of those things is true and if you dont want to be in a plural marriage then its also the last one if there is nothing you can do to initiate a divorce you should be telling him that he absolutely owes you one you told them your husband is abusive and that you are in a dangerous position that is what most reasonable people listening to these facts would conclude thats likely gonna be awkward because youve shared a bunch of information that suggests you are unsafe legally financially and maybe even physically bit more than awkward really realistically you need to realize its extremely likely your husband will hear about you going to a bar its good tea someones gonna spill you need to have a safety plan in place both when that happens and just generally speaking you can choose to keep your life story to yourself in the future but you cannot make it not awkward,MLeek
that you told them you are at risk and that your husband is a real piece of shit that cat is out of the bag stay safe the median number of sex partners for women aged 2549 in the us is 43 and thats the median so it doesnt include those who have never had sex lets assume that most women a redpilld idiot is speaking to are below 25 years old 78 of those will have fewer than 10lifetime partners the standart method of killing women to prevent nercophilia this is a truly under appreciated historical fact there is nothing biblical about burning witches the clearest instruction is to stone them and burn their books most american woman accused of witchcraft were hung the fact that burning is associated with witchesstraying wivessex workersfemale execution is pretty well documented in a few parts of the world as local authorities trying to prevent men from abusing female corpses thats right you can be murdered for serving satan and the local boys will still have strong,MLeek
opinions about your bodys fuckability see also tom brady and gisele bundchen being unclear is the surest way to be unkind people get hurt while dating you cant protect everyone but the best thing you can do to minimize it is have your own struggles well handled absolutely but as women we are targeted by wellness gurus and mlms like doterra or arbonne whenever my female friends have down on their luck the mlm huns seem to start circling i think in many ways its the same basic behaviour were being sold community and selfesteem for women its more connected to personal achievement and independence whereas for men its more commonly connected to accessing sex and relationships with women add that to the fact that women were generally a bit better equipped to deal with the whole life just isnt fair and you wont get the job just because your dad did reality of the new millennium than men were with their lingering generational entitlement to a certain kind of life its up to,MLeek
you and up to what boundaries you figure out with her during that time if youve seen someone a few times and youre still going to date other people as well its best to say so clearly dating is even harder work when you dont know what the fuck you are willing to offer or what you need to ask for figuring your own shit out and then expressing it to another person you like is hard work all of your responses here boil down to you havent figured your own shit out about boundaries and your needs about sex and what a relationship can look like at various stages and youre whinging that its hard to figure out your own shit and then say it out loud it is it just is you want to be happy do it anyways figure your shit out say it out loud and then see if it works for the individual person or people that you like to date they are comfortable rather practical shoes which are,MLeek
somehow damaging her like does he think kitten heels and wedges are healthier for us its not crazy but it can be confusing and you need to be more clear about what you mean the answer to that kind of argument is that you are in a kind of relationship it includes sexual exclusivity but maybe it doesnt include things like meeting parents yet or making plans more than a month in advance dont say its not a relationship because dude it is if you are sexually exclusive youre in some kind of relationship just be clear about what sort of relationship it is at that stage if you dont want to have sex without being exclusive just say so that is not an uncommon boundary at all you just want to avoid being on a 3rd date with someone who doesnt share it so you have to speak up dating is stressful most human beings feel this way at least some of the time your real problem here is your own lack of,MLeek
clarity you dont have be actively dating to find a wife but if you want to be married in your 30 you likely should be dating only people who make sense for that longterm goal my advice date who is fun to date for 34 months then decide if they have any longterm potential before that time period think of it as just who you want to spend time with next week your girlfriend is trying to tell you she doesnt want to date you shes not doing it well or clearly but odds are very good shes trying to break up with you if shes not giving you concrete things you can do to make her feel appreciated as an individual and secure in the relationship its very likely that she cant tell you what those things are its been three months this is the youre cool but its not working time frame it doesnt mean there is anything wrong or unhealthy about you sometimes there is nothing broken to fix this just,MLeek
means youre both 19 and compatibility is weird and difficult thing if youre absolutely no fun in bed and will only fuck in one position while she fakes porn noises for you you could just say that nah hes complaining that other people are permitting her to feel good about her body which is not of sexual interest to him personally and therefore cant be the source of any happiness or pride men dont have support groups like that which is somehow the fault of this one woman getting supporting from what im going to assume is predominantly other women because random men usually dont show up in quite the same numbers when its not sexy for them who has a totally genderneutral and lifesaving medical treatment and had the audacity to put something shiny on her medical device got it male answer syndrome mas describes a subjects exaggerated willingness to answer or inability to resist the impulse to answer factual questions regardless of the subjects lack of knowledge of the relevant phenomena or,MLeek
circumstances it always makes me think of the great snl skit man park i do feel for the guys that they arent raised in a way that encourages the building of these interpersonal skills and connections but im deep into my 30s now and im done picking up the slack if im your only friend there is a problem here and its not mine to fix the truth is only very naive or damaged women with low selfworth allow themselves to be manipulated with game treated poorly for very long lets amend this to for very long because i think we risking supporting the manospheres victimblaming narratives about toxic relationships when we dont acknowledge that a skilled scam artist is gonna scam even a smart secure person for at least a little while even an otherwise confident and mature people can find themselves temporarily vulnerable to a purposeful predator who his the right notes we shouldnt be shaming people for being normal healthy people who dont assume someone else is a narcissistic ass right,MLeek
outta the gate the goal has got to be dont get conned for long because never get conned isnt a fair standard honestly i think its men without healthy friendships with other men even i live in a dense urban core and years ago before the mall banned them i used to run into these men and their coaches on the regular they were unpleasant or even a bit frightening to interact with as a young woman but they were fascinating to listen to if they were sitting down postgaming afterwards in a bar or coffee shop just talking to each other the coaches were basically paid friends it was like 20 terrible misogyny and horrible advice and 80 just being a buddy validating emotions and struggles and being a bit of a hype man like a good friend would strip away the pseudoscience and sexism and the fact they were being paid and really wasnt that different than a pair of girls hyping someone after a breakup or a shitty date made me,MLeek
wonder if these guys just really really lacked the relationships and connections that made normal life disappointments like rejections breakups whatever actually bearable damaged girls dont respond to game okay people who have experienced a number of other men like you using the tactics you use to access sex and service are less likely to respond positively to you that makes enough sense damaged girls are great for fwb but how do you know they dont respond to game you just told us that a feature of your system is that the damaged girls wont respond to it girls love assholes being an asshole works on all women except for damaged girls who have experienced assholes in the past you told us that upfront the only logical conclusion here is that the damaged girls are in fact smarter than you that is actually the only defining characteristic youve provided for them being damaged that they dont respond in the desired way to your manipulation and cruely this should be a breakup she doesnt want,MLeek
to be in relationship with you shes tried to tell you that in a few ways and youve argued with her and refused to take the message it seems youre not going to accept that is what is happening until she is backed into a corner and snaps and like screams blood murder at you or something what you do now is confirm that breakup and then respect that breakup you stop making it so difficult for her to dump you because that is turning you into a rather stubborn and condescending asshat stop demanding good enough reasons dont make her argue with you dont confront dont keep pushing her until she behaves badly enough or crazy enough for you to feel like you dumped her if youre unclear with what happened confirm with her whether or not you have broken up express your sadness and then wish her well if you make it this hard for someone to leave a relationship with you youll end up stuck in unfulfilling and toxic relationships when,MLeek
someone wants to break up they dont need your agreement just your respect that is probably the next best step just remember that real fairness and equity accepts that people have different circumstances and needs it doesnt mean everyones needs are weighed exactly equally fairness is a thing you two come to agree on together but i think you need to start by being really brutally honest with yourself and him about the weight of your current circumstances and needs youre not going to get to an equitable outcome if youre not totally transparent about how serious of a need this is for you it sounds like you need to tell him plainly that moving is quickly becoming a requirement for your longterm health and happiness its not a need like i think need a new pair of boots this winter its a need like i need to breathe stop invalidating yourself by pretending the situation is any less than what it is you fear cannot survive as a healthy person or as a,MLeek

are no longer exposed to his cruelty or his stupidity im sorry really i am but youre 16 and you dont deserve this shit the longer you keep this person in your life the longer it will take to heal give yourself the gift of leaning to survive a break up youll be fine soon better than fine well at least by know he knows a bit further yeah its not about his need just challenge that headon its about what he deserves and being able to offer others in his own life what they actually need he deserves support and a place for thoughtful reflection about difficult choices and boundaries just bottling it up means hes not giving himself the care and compassion he is worthy of and not prepared to take steps in a conscious way and that he may someday burst under that pressure and not be able to offer someone else like you or his own child what they actually do need from him if my relationship needed that sort,MLeek
of protection i would choose not to be in it yes and for jason i think this really is a sign he needs some personal support through this its great that you support him but youre biased and you should be and youre not a pro id really hope hed consider therapy for himself especially as he transitions to fatherhood himself you and jason are in agreement about your own child and theresa so between the two of you this is settled so really this decision should sit with him when it comes to what he says in court about his biological mother that really belongs to him if hes unsure id suggest he speak to a family therapist and get a safe supportive place to think this through and get support for the fallout from whatever he chooses however in your position i would strongly encourage him to put olives needs first and testify against theresa having access to the child and to stop pressuring anne to have any relationship with theresa he,MLeek
may not be ready to cut contact and that is his choice for his relationship but he should respect annes if she is and he should assist in the protection of olive who cannot choose for herself no more suggestion of the three of us will discuss it instead his reply to his mother should be this is annes decision for her relationship with you i am sorry to hear her choice hurts you but whatever she chooses she has my support and respect if you dont want to date him dont date him if he doesnt want to be on socials thats fine hes not required to be if you only want to date someone who isnt dont date him you really gonna get bent out of shape cause he wasnt confrontational and mean to the people you wanted him to be if you are dont date him cant respect someone who is that nonconfrontational okay dont date him if you think hes lying to you and sweetie he is almost certainly lying,MLeek
to you about deleting his socials definitely dont date him you need to stop watching youre never going to really know what is going on in her life or her head you are only going to make yourself miserable by continuing to follow her little drama the world isnt fair there are lots of assholes out there who get what they want outta life if you spend your time focusing on the unanswerable questions and unfairness of it all you will stay miserable forever if she had any actual intellectual consistency she would refuse to marry a man who didnt require her to stop her attentionseeking and argumentative online behaviour i really dont know how you square that circle to be honest how would any man she deems masculine enough not require her to drastically change her online persona and activity but shes just in it for the money and any man she marries would be sure to cash those cheques as readily as she does and theyd make up a reason for why,MLeek
it was okay or theyd just claim privacy on the subject and try to continue on without addressing it at all little known fact when flushing pepper spray out of your eyes dont rub it or use soap just move to a wellventilated area and rinse your eyes with clean water over and over again soap is good for your hands but for your eyes apply a cloth soaked in milk with as much fat content as possible to dull the pain i dont think any sort of labourexchange or powerexchange dynamic in your relationship is the issue here the problem here is suggesting that women in particular are only happy and loved as a women via their submission i imagine op is inexperienced and expressing herself poorly but still the traditional kind of submission isnt something a woman can revoke and still buy food tomorrow i dont think its the same kind of submission if you leave the house for a job and the money is your own i like a partner who,MLeek
is decisive and takes on their share of the mental load as well but im not submissive to them i appreciate their work and in some contexts that includes their leadership or thier dominance over a certain subject or task or decision that doesnt make them inherently dominant over me and i could revoke my agreement to that leadership at any time on any subject without being unable to provide for myself i know shell keep getting posted here but wed all be better off ignoring pearl shes a troll i doubt she believes half of what she says she found a niche as the token female who will validate these men and parrot their messages and her support for tate has gotten her more views and followers than anything else shes done she has a very real ceiling in the manosphere in terms of income potential and shell leave it as soon as she cant make a living there because its still a valid strategy in many communities to access power wealth and,MLeek
security through a man and to believe you can access more power wealth and security through that man than you can alone as a woman and if that is the strategy you want to use you traditionally pay for that with submission and service and you become very very defensive of mens general power in society because your survival strategy depends on them maintaining their special role and privileges over unmarried women and to an extent unmarried men its totally reasonable its just a strategy most women have rejected as far too risky its got major dangers baked in its a transaction that can fall apart very easily because submission and service dont actually buy you anything except someone elses dominance and usually more work to do it doesnt guarantee you will be provided for all your life thats a hope not a reality we teach our daughters independence because when one of them often through no fault of their own places their bet on the wrong man as a partner as a provider,MLeek
we want the damage to be minimized to her and any dependant children who will most likely be her default responsibility the kernel of truth in here is that lots of people men and women can have difficulty accepting affection being vulnerable and feeling worthy of love you should date someone else you can talk about this you can ask her what he boundaries are when it comes to dancing or dancing with men at the club but shes likely going to tell you this is a choice she is comfortable with for herself and an activity she enjoys and that she is comfortable with her boundaries with other men in the club she is likely to feel your discomfort with her dancing especially her simply being looked at while dancing is an accusation of wrongdoing and she is not likely to agree she is doing anything wrong you can ask for more information from her about her opinions and activities but if its a dealbreaker for you then its on you to break,MLeek
the deal if you cant get over this and this is something she enjoys and believes is acceptable in a relationship then this is probably just not someone youre compatible with its possible she would be willing to stop going to clubs to address your discomfort with men looking at her but its unlikely and as long as she goes youre going to reasonably believe she is being looked at by other men while she dances and men are still gonna look at her that is something you need to learn to handle dont set yourself up to be an insecure asshole if you cant hack it opt out now the first thing you do is locate your important documents and give them to a reliable friend or family member to hold for you your safety first your safety includes access to all important personal or financial documents you should encourage your mother to do same with copies at the very least if she doesnt feel safe moving the originals you may want to,MLeek
consider a lockable file cabinet for your own room if you intend to stay in this home with him which ideally you shouldnt you should be looking for somewhere else safe to stay and telling your mother in no uncertain terms you do not feel safe in her home so long as he is in it im sorry youre going through this and i understand you want to help and support your mom but likely the best thing you can do is get yourself safe so that you arent an additional weapon of control he can use against her one of the hardest parts of being an adult is putting your own oxygen mask on first youre overthinking shes told you shes busy youre not teenagers adult people can get busy for a week on the weekend suggest a date with a time and a place if she doesnt say yes or suggest an alternative time and place then you move on form this connection because she either isnt that into you or she,MLeek
just doesnt have the time to act on it and you stop waiting for her i only have 1 but im past the wall so im probably safe so heres the thing i believe him but hes wrong about what is happening and why men who actually show up for their wives while shes in hospital are treated like princes most men dont drop by for a few minutes every few days whereas wives often visit everyday for extended periods so sure the nurses were probably cheering and smiling at him because they mistakenly thought he wasnt an a self absorbed asshole we know exactly what this type of guy would call her if she had let two men into her apartment in exchange for some 2 fast food cone she saw there was no gray zone for her that night between unwelcoming and asking for it so she went with unwelcoming like any sane person would and his buddy knows he lost a cool friend because he tried to coerce her into a,MLeek
situation she judged to be an unsafe one with his creepy buddy notice how women disproportionately also need to do the difficult emotional and practical labour of ending a relationship that is not working and is not fixable i think i heard an angry man say so online and it felt better than imagining women may also be people and that dating is really hard work and will be disappointing most of the time ive met toddlers who know better when to stop saying their lies out loud and just keep quiet peoples beliefs and ideologies especially younger peoples are heavily influenced by those closest to them you dont say shocked i am shocked s seriously all you guys are telling me is that a you frame it as an entirely different thing when your guy friends adapt to their gfs b you probably arent dating any women over 25 and c you cannot maintain a relationship for more than a few months with someone who has differing beliefs than you this isnt a,MLeek
reflection on all women its a reflection on your selection and the one guy almost manages that logical conclusion but still slips outta his fingers please block me always makes me laugh its a surefire way to make sure i just ignoremute you and never ever block you cause im an adult and its really not that hard to not message someone you dont want to let me show you how its done kiddo while i also maintain a record of your bad behaviour should i ever need an authority to respond to your escalations like you need to take steps to take care of my needs while im actively being total shit to you because i cannot possibly be expected to exercise any selfcontrol or emotional regulation even without all the evidence as if it will ever be enough for the cultists its not a difficult indictment to read they have seven alleged victims they have records of the misleading promises of marriage and what they claimed the womans lives would look like,MLeek
they have the location in ilfov and evidence of surveillance and financial coercion they probably have more wiretaps then the public have heard of yet they have the porn itself and they can probably get the financial records from selling that porn these activities left a trail this is not a thin indictment do we need to wonder really all the defences will boil down to the woman wanted it they agreed to it they just regret it now and playing the victim card if youre still a tate fanboy at this point youve already made peace with the wiretaps about his trafficking and coercion and admitted criminal behavior thats baked in you have to already not care that he said he i dont think many of them are gonna draw the line at an actual rape charge all of a sudden tate has told them to blame the woman they are going to blame the women dont take it personally could be a thousand reasons and many of them not really about you,MLeek
the only advice id give is that unless you are opposed to a conversation with someones other partners i might keep the questions about what that looks like until youve established more rapport and personal connection and are talking about the howwhen of meeting the person in your position i would have asked at what point do those conversations take place so i had a sense of the boundaries and timeline and then probably shifted back into the getting to know each other chatting beyond that dont waste your feels on this interaction its still just online dating its a mess i continue to find it strange the only lesson they can learn from that stat is woman bad and not that a bad marriage is still generally a better deal for a man the person who is more uncomfortable is the person doing the practical work end it the majority of woman who leave choose financial insecurity or outright poverty over the partnership the stats show you that clearly but these sorts of,MLeek

i know its hard but try not to feel too ashamed shame usually backfires because it makes you feel bad and you just end up indulging in your habit more to escape the bad feeling try to be proud of yourself for every minute hour or day you spend doing other things and focus on the good that will come from doing it less positive reinforcement is a lot more effective than negative exactly my ex boyfriend was rarely direct and analyzed the hell out of things people said and i dont know if itll ever stop bothering me knowing that half the stuff i said he probably assumed i actually meant some whole other thing does it make you crazy when you sense that people are analyzing your words looking for hidden meanings and insinuations because almost nothing makes me more crazy than saying exactly wtf i mean and knowing someone is going to try and figure out what i really mean by it theres nothing to figure out yessss omg when someone,YourFriendMaryGrace
says something multiple different ways to make a single point i struggle so hard not to be like i got it the first time and im currently on my eleventh train of thought just waiting for you to wrap it up lmao its a shame we cant 2x speed conversations the way we can videos your aries mercury interpretation resonates with me i cant stand when people try and talk with a lot of layers and undertones and hidden meanings just give it to me straight gatdammit my brain doesnt want to have to analyze peoples words and i dont want my words to be analyzed i love talking to other aries mercury people because i know were both just saying what we mean and the conversation moves lightning fast which matches my brains usual speed and yes i have to make a very conscious effort not to dominate the conversation when im talking to less fiery people lol thats probably why every single person ive ever dated has been a triple fire sign,YourFriendMaryGrace
guy no one else can keep up with me its making me crazy i cant imagine that thousands and thousands of redditors are organically interested in coming here and rufos just to shit on everything lol most people in real life are either interested and curious or theyre not even thinking about it oh im happy to hear that can i ask the gist of what they said im rooting for ya i have similar placements pisces sun and capricorn moon for me i will forgive and give second chances for as long as i can often at the expense of my own wellbeing but theres a certain amount of hurt that i just cant move past even if i want to its not that i dont forgive them i do but im deeply sensitive and if ive opened my heart to someone and given them my trust only to end up being betrayed its like my heart just cant go back to feeling safe with them again no matter how much i miss,YourFriendMaryGrace
them we love deeply whether we want to or not so were too open and vulnerable with those we love to only let someone in halfway thats why pisces tend to be allornothing in their intimate connections but i would imagine they appreciate that you apologized and acknowledged your mistakes even if they havent responded we pisces tend to withdraw when were hurting and sometimes it just takes a long time for us to come back out of our solitude so its possible they just need some time good luck buddy its the weirdest feeling when it happens i had something similar but i think i remember the whole thing i was taking my kids on a road trip and i set my gps to our destination 3 hours away we only took one quick bathroom stop and we didnt cross any time zones or make any wrong turns it was just a straight shot on the interstate and yet somehow when we arrived i realized that it had taken us almost 6 hours,YourFriendMaryGrace
to get there the weirdest part was that i didnt notice any signs of the time being off until we arrived how did i lose 3 hours when i was conscious and checking the clock regularly it messed with my brain so bad lol well it means a lot to me that you took the time this project is important to me and i listened to those specific parts so many times but my brain just tapped out lol so thank you again fellow interpreter of drawls thank you im glad my rural upbringing came in handy for something haha i craved salt and vinegar chips like crazy when i was pregnant with my daughter id never liked them before and suddenly couldnt get enough and ever since shes started eating big kid food shes been obsessed with anything vinegar based olives pickles chips i feel like she was sending me the cravings lol oh damn thats right i forgot about that story poor lady i read a transcript of a past life hypnosis,YourFriendMaryGrace
session one time where the woman under hypnosis said she intentionally incarnates in areas where a disaster will occur specifically so that when the disaster occurs she can help souls cross over because when it happens so quickly and in a scary way like that some souls just have a hard time letting go really interesting to think about really interesting you say that i feel like theres a lot of different species and they have different intentions and approaches i wrote this comment yesterday about something similar but from a benevolent species that i saw last month oh wow thats really interesting that makes sense my late grandfather was a pilot in the korean war wish i could ask him more about his experiences thank you for sharing this i hadnt seen this before silverback gorillas can lift over 4000 pounds isnt that love and light the best feeling ever if it was a drug id never stop taking it lol ahhh this is awesome thank you so so much at 120 i,YourFriendMaryGrace
was thinking he said assholes too but i wasnt sure your translation makes sense especially since there were other people on the river that night are you from the deep south too i thought more people would be able to help but i guess the accent is more of a barrier than i thought lol im from mississippi thanks again i think it would be tricky for a lot of native speakers to understand as well so no worries i grew up not too far from where this occurred so its a very familiar dialect to me ahhhh i think youre right thank you so much true ive had my own experiences but thankfully theyve all been overwhelmingly positive in nature my heart goes out to people who have been through something like this the older guy hickson actually said quite a bit more in his testimony than the younger man if you scroll to the bottom of this article youll find a longer recording where hickson gives his full testimony parker was in,YourFriendMaryGrace
a panicked state and had difficulty remaining calm enough to be interviewed understandably this brief moment where hes alone with his friend in private is the bulk of his communication that night these recordings werent released until 2020 and parker has said that listening to them made him regret that he wasnt able to say more at that time that line makes me really sad too and the way they keep saying that no one will believe them i cant imagine going through something so traumatizing and then have to worry about being mocked and treated like i was crazy or lying for attention dang thats annoying thanks for letting me know its just the website for the state newspaper so idk why its doing that it does work on a computer though fwiw just a heads up the video of the conversation doesnt seem to work well on mobile people say something like that in every post about these two makes me crazy i bet they were gay like okay and even if,YourFriendMaryGrace
they were doesnt change the fact that they shared an extremely strange and traumatizing event juvenile they worked together and hickson owned land in parkers hometown not sure what youre implying but it isnt unusual for people of different ages to share a hobby whatever happened it wasnt good parker was so distressed he literally started trying to climb the walls during part of their interview hickson said repeatedly that he knew hed become a laughingstock for sharing his story but he felt it was important i guess he was right considering 50 years later the first thing you do is suggest that them being abducted would be better than them having an affair i understand the dialect but i dont have any audio tools if you want to try and help me decipher that would be amazing heres a transcript i made im from mississippi so its easy for me lol heres my transcript yeah hicksons final comment is quite chilling i feel so bad for them its in the second link in,YourFriendMaryGrace
my post or you can click here for some reason it doesnt seem to work well on mobile though at 220 i think he says something about setting a new medical record that was a common joke people would make about any unusual physical condition when i was growing up in mississippi but i left it blank because im not sure the most common themes ive heard are that we should be nicer to each other and take better care of our planet as for mass communication i had a really vivid astral experience about a month ago that was along those lines but more subtle i saw a lot of different types of alien beings communicating subconsciously with millions of people on earth individually they would reveal a bit of information or visualization of themselves and then ask do you feel calm if the individual was still calm theyd reveal a little more repeat and repeat its been interesting over the last month to see soooo many people posting that theyre suddenly having,YourFriendMaryGrace

can always do some basic cleansing rituals sprinkle a little salt in the corners of your rooms burn incense sage or cedar be sure to get the corners and closets and say something like i bless my home and i allow only the highest and purest energies of love and light within these walls that should do it it could be one of two things you have anxiety about your hobby and how it might affect you if spirits become attached to you and that anxiety transferred into your sleep and gave you this dream or you actually did attract some spirits to you and they are now using your dream state to ask you for help i would take a break from this hobby for a bit if i were you some people are just more open in terms of being able to receive contact from the other side and you may be one of them which means that any time you do this youre opening yourself up to a lot of new,YourFriendMaryGrace
energies who may be needy or clingy remember that youre allowed to have boundaries with spirits you can try to encourage them to go homecross over on their own or you can just ask them to leave and not come back if youre feeling generous you can look into ways to help spirits cross over but thats not foolproof as many of them dont actually want to cross over and may just be wanting your attention very much so when i was a child id have very intense waves of a memorylike feeling from the 1960s come over me i was born in 1985 but this feeling would get triggered randomly and id think this is exactly what it felt like in the 60s i was always taught that reincarnation isnt real so i never knew what to make of those feelings but it sure felt real fast forward to a few years ago and i started doing past life regressions one of the 4 lifetimes ive seen ended with me dying in the,YourFriendMaryGrace

think that they sound really smart by saying things like this arent possible despite the fact that its becoming quite clear that they are indeed possible the people who are genuinely curious will consider your perspective and appreciate your input and those of us who have had our own experiences already know that your story makes a lot of sense i love u tooo bb if hed given a lot of exciting information youd say it was too fantastic to be real i think the boring aspect lends credibility youre complaining that hes not using acronyms but why should he when he knows hes talking to civilians and the compartmentalization of information is critical to understanding part of why people dont speak up more often they only know little bits of the story obviously youre free to believe whatever you want i just dont think the reasons you stated alone are enough to discredit him wow i love that thank you for telling me the fact that they were actually climbing one when it,YourFriendMaryGrace
happened is really cool ive seen two different versions that ultimately reflected the same thing the more detailed one i talked about in the fourth paragraph of this post the best answer i can give you based on my own experiences is that theres no hell like we think of in religious and cultural traditions dark and light are two sides of the same coin if youre holding onto a great deal of darkness then when you pass you may be too dark to be able to be taken up by the light its not the light punishing you or pushing you away youre pushing yourself away this isnt a permanent condition at most its a momentary experience of deep darkness that makes the light finally seem much more attractive to you so you let go of the darkness youre holding onto and are then able to move into the the absolute unconditional love and acceptance of the light again this is just my experience i too have stepped on rogue metal mini minecraft,YourFriendMaryGrace
figures they make lego feel like stepping on a cloud yeah i was hopeful about that one too but i did make a lot of new friends with jupiter in aries well with the north node in our 7th houses its a very opportune time for us libra risings to meet someone special or get married good luck i feel so bad for people like this imagine having a completely disorienting terrifying experience and then being mocked and accused of lying for attention when you seek help i read a story recently about a rancher who experienced sightings and mutilations of his cattle and he turned into a running joke in his town because everybody thought he was a loony he died homeless its a shame how many people have probably been through this and died without ever being believed wow this is so interesting i might make a post just for this phenomena because it seems like theres a correlation there for sure do you happen to have any video a friend of,YourFriendMaryGrace

collecting data out of curiosity same i saw 3 uap traveling together one time and 3 other sightings of a single uap those are my favorite were you near any pine trees by chance its only unthinkable because its hard to imagine something we know nothing about they might not even need foodairsunlight the way we do they might source all their basic needs from the depths of the ocean or from another planet entirely so many possibilities ughghhh i understand mine are 6 and 9 so theyre older but at all ages once they start socializing it is so hard to see them deal with any kind of rejection we see their hopes and expectations for interacting with others and we just want it to work out perfectly for them every time and of course thats not always possible but know that by giving her space to talk about it even if she cant say much you are showing her that youre there to support her socially and emotionally i did the same,YourFriendMaryGrace
with my littles at that age and they still want to talk to me about everything they have going on friends bullies etc because they know we can process and problem solve together you sound like a wonderful mama yes the debunked comments are everywhere and you can tell half the time they arent even reading or watching the thing theyre claiming is debunked i saw someone post a compilation video of dozens and dozens of uap sightings someone responded that sighting is debunked and had a ton of upvotes my parents made this discovery about grapes theyd both been buying red grapes for decades thinking the other preferred red they both prefer green i believe so too amazing post and thanks for making it those of us who have already experienced things and are used to the idea that were not alone will be very much needed in helping others stay calm and adjust feel free to message me if youd like someone to talk to 3 this story started out so sad,YourFriendMaryGrace

something in complete honesty that if he was projecting his dishonesty onto me he would have incorrectly decided i was lying or meant something else entirely i noticed he did this a lot when he was talking about something someone else said to him like oh she said xyz but she was probably just trying to make me think abc and i wondered why he always assumed deceptionulterior motive until i realized that he does that a lot himself lol not saying youre exactly like him or anything and no judgement from me either way im just wanting to understand how this trait plays out in your relationships and expectations of others ooo thats such a good point strikes are very aries energy and theyre fighting for fairness and justice both libra things will definitely be interesting to see how else this dichotomy will show up over the next year and a half ope its fixed now thank you mine too we get a double dose of these energies with our houses there last,YourFriendMaryGrace

a turnoff for you to ask first if someone doesnt appreciate that youre being respectful of their boundaries then theyre immature and not worth your effort thats so sweet i understand that feeling i hope you two find your way back to each other soon im sorry it didnt work out i know how much it hurts to feel that deep passion and connection but end up apart i believe we are destined to meet certain people at certain points in our lives some people we meet lifetime after lifetime its possible youll end up together again in this life or the next the most important thing is that youre continuing to grow and evolve through each life ifwhen you two meeting up and being together can contribute to your growth then it will happen i just went to look for it and inadvertently discovered youre in austin me too we have an austin experiencers meetup every other week and its really fun to sharehear peoples stories if youre ever interested in joining especially,YourFriendMaryGrace
if its a highfalutin rigamarole thanks for sharing your story rexperiencers is a really supportive community that might interest you youre definitely not alone ive experienced this in my own way isnt it incredible ive often thought that if everyone on earth could just experience that feeling of infinite love and how it really is the answer to everything the world would never be the same once youve experienced it you can never forget the infinite power of love thank you for sharing 3 maybe so ive already had 3 of those via psychedelics and meditation so id like to think ive learned enough from those experiences but hey why not go for another round theres always more to learn that does help honestly i wouldnt even mind dying young if it wasnt for my children i just dont want them to go through that i really appreciate your comment and im happy youre still here 3 for a long time ive had a feeling that i would die at age 42 which will,YourFriendMaryGrace
be in 2027 so seeing all these predictions that something massive will happen that year has been kinda freaking me out lol im hoping that ive just been sensing that it will be a lifechanging year and my brain interpreted that as im gonna die hey we have 2 of the same big 3 i feel like people are naturally drawn to libra risings because we tend to have a friendly welcoming vibe we also have good social skills and were usually pretty to look at i have a flirty energy with almost everybody without meaning to its just how i am so i have to be careful or ill accidentally make people think im super into them when im just trying to be fun and friendly i feel bad for him bc hes clearly highly anxious but its also kind of hilarious were not saying what they are or what theyre not its like he was told he has to say something but hes in big trouble if he says too much so,YourFriendMaryGrace
hes just stuttering and waving them long fingers around with one hand while gripping the podium for dear life with the other i wondered that as well could the dangerous looking planet they were trying to escape to second to last paragraph on the last page be earth though maybe the atmosphere flora and fauna of earth a million years ago just looked so different that the remote viewer didnt recognize it the political aspect would make sense as well thank you for sharing this im so fascinated by the history of mars ive read accounts from so so many people via dreams remote viewing past life regressions etc that tell of a time when the atmosphere of mars became corrupted and everyone had to leave have you ever seen this document from the cia where they had a remote viewer go to mars if not i think youd enjoy it i want that myself sometimes i was super enthusiastic about being dominated and even encouraged him to go all out with it for,YourFriendMaryGrace
quite a while but we were 3 years into our relationship at that point and i really wanted to experience more intimacy and to feel special and loved in bed he was very clearly upset so i tried to ask why and he said liked the way we were already doing it too much and didnt want to stop i said we could still do that sometimes too i just wanted to feel special and loved at least some of the times nothing changed yeah porn in general is a well its a whole can of worms and you covered a of a lot of my issues with it already i used to try and be cool with it but the more i learned about it the more horrified i became theres ways to create content ethically but that seems to be a low priority for the vast majority of the people running the industry and the psychological impact of having young guys grow up watching these videos where women being treated like garbage,YourFriendMaryGrace
is normal really does scare me them growing up to be bad in bed is probably on the milder side of the negative effects that can have its actually kind of comically delusional these guys that think its totally cool of them to be selfish in bed for real and not just for role play i actually do enjoy role playing and experimenting with dynamics but it has to be consensual and agreed upon beforehand and if you are going to balk and act all disappointed because id like you to be as enthusiastic about my pleasure as i have been about yours then okay then bye and as you mentioned i also feel bad that porn makes guys feel less than for not having gigantic schlong it really and truly makes no difference to me about size if anything i prefer smaller bc im small i feel like most men these days wouldnt even believe its possible for a woman to prefer smaller which makes me sad for them i feel like the,YourFriendMaryGrace
absence of actual intimacy in porn is affecting some peoples behaviorexpectations in bed very badly i asked my last partner if he would slow down and stop acting dominant and aggressive every single time so we could like you know be more romantic sensual really connect as equal partners by the way he reacted to this request youd think id asked him to do advanced calculus in bed like he was turned off confused and disappointed when i was literally just asking for more sensual reciprocal sex she does have trouble sleeping she likes games and shes very creative the biggest challenge for her is sticking with something even if it doesnt work out perfectly right away like yesterday she had an idea for a weirdcore image she wanted to create the instant the photo editing app didnt do what she wanted it to do she was like this is impossible im done and i never know how much i should push her to see things through or just let it go definitely possible,YourFriendMaryGrace
for now i think we just have to focus on growth and healing thats the surest way to have a healthy relationship in the future whether its with her or someone else good luck friend im sorry it didnt work out i know it hurts yes i definitely know that feeling have you ever considered hypnosis or a regression mediation a little over 3 years what about yours my daughter is a gemini sunmoon too shes 9 years old any parenting advice that happened to me in reverse my ex boyfriend and i had a lifechanging connection i heard his voice while i was meditating one day and then met him about 6 months later when i first heard him speak i recognized him as the mystery voice and it blew my mind we were deeply in love but he pushed me away and hurt me in so many different ways like he just couldnt let go of his old mindsets and his single bro lifestyle to have a true partnership of love and,YourFriendMaryGrace
trust with me i dont know why either i think theres certain people were destined to meet at a certain time but if one person in the connection isnt ready it just doesnt work out but either way youll both grow as a result of coming together for a time and thats whats most important that fits with a lot of peoples experiences very well thank you for sharing memory wipes are so common do you have any feelings when you think back on the experience good or bad awww man thats such a cute lil interaction i totally get it i get the happiest giggles when i see them its such a thrill like the feeling of being a little kid again and making a new bestie very good point between advancing ai nukes and climate crisis we are at quite the critical tipping point for humanity we could really use some assistance from our more advanced and evolved space homies yes indeed i think that might be one of the biggest ontological,YourFriendMaryGrace
shock factors of disclosure that theyre not just coming down from the sky theyve also been right there in our oceans for who knows how long ohh my goshhh thats so cool i cant sleep tonight either so im happy you shared this right away and i get to be excited with you was there a color or shape tell them hi from me pls im so intrigued that exact timeframe was one of the most significant turning points in my life leading up to that time id been quite depressed in large part because my marriage was so difficult in october i got a completely unexpected job opportunity to go work on a netflix show so i went to la for 3 weeks this gave me alone time that id not had in years to reflect on my true feelings and realize just how unhappy i was then i got to experience dmt for the first time and i met aliens who told me how to find my own happiness in life it,YourFriendMaryGrace
very much changed me so in november i finally started facing my unhappy relationship head on we ended up filling for divorce about 4 months later in december i got another work opportunity and met someone who right away helped me healing my childhood trauma i grew a lot and very quickly in those months i was kinda suddenly able take the reins of my life and find my own happiness in a way that i hadnt really even considered possible before would love to hear your thoughts on this timeframe if youre open to sharing you might be comforted by the things paul hellyer former canadian minister of defense has said about them hes said that there are many up to 80 was his estimate benevolent nhi that have been visiting us for many years and only maybe 1 or 2 notsonice ones he also said that from their perspective were the ones who are a violent threat to ourselves and our planet they want to help us advance with our consent but,YourFriendMaryGrace
we havent responded super well so far essentially the exact opposite of a scary invasion movie lol its not a stupid question at all and you brought up an interesting point the number of uap sightings and incidents increased pretty dramatically after we started dropping the big bombs and as you said theres been many reports of them shutting down nuclear facilities i suspect that the bombs probably alerted a lot of nhi who werent really paying us much attention before to start keeping an eye on us awww im sure she appreciates all you did to take care of her over the years thats really sweet that shes checking in with you 3 this is purely speculation but i wonder if at least some of the nhi are forcing our leaderships hand in some way or if they anticipate an event or increase in activity such that they wont be able to hide it anyway so theyre trying to get ahead of the game well a lucid dream begins by realizing that youre,YourFriendMaryGrace
in a dream having full control is just something you can work up to once you have the ability to recognize that youre in a dream so its still technically a lucid dream even if you arent able to control it yet lots of people have to work just to get to the point where they can realize theyre in a dream so youre ahead of the game its a lucid dream theres lots of techniques for learning how to control it check out the lucid dreaming sub aww this is lovely to hear thank you and no worries if and when you feel like sharing your experiences were here for it ya the type of people who mock others and pick apart peoples appearances behaviors and actions as if theyre soooo much better its a sure sign of insecurity and its very unpleasant to be around not to mention its pretty much guaranteed that if they talk shit behind other peoples backs theyre talking shit behind your back too just gross bystander apathy,YourFriendMaryGrace
is crazy a few months ago i had to break up a fist fight between two middle school aged boys while a bunch of dads twice my size just stood around lol im glad you were there and acted quickly i relate i have a 6 year old son who sees things as well its hard to say what type of entity it is but dark energies feed off of fear so unfortunately kids who are perceptive to that world make easy targets traditional methods of cleansing blessing smudging salt in the corners etc are often very helpful you can also help him exercise spiritual boundaries by going to the space where he saw it and telling the entity that its not welcome in your home and it needs to move along do this with love which is repellent to them and firmness no anger as they feed off that as well sometimes ill also visualize white light pouring out of my hands and sort of sweeping them out the door or windows with,YourFriendMaryGrace
my hands it seems to work really well now he just comes and finds me when he sees something so i can kick it out for him lol but im working on empowering him to do it too the majority of dreams are made by your subconscious mind as its trying to work through your feelings some dreams can be premonitions but given your anxiety about this situation and your past trauma id say this is just your brain trying to help you confront your fears it doesnt mean itll happen again youre so strong congratulations on getting on the road to recovery i recommend smudging which is where you use smoke to cleanse the room i like to burn cedar but sage or any kind of incense works make sure to get it in the corners you can sprinkle salt in the corners as well most importantly know that you can practice boundaries with entities just like you do with people be kind but firm and let them know that only the highest,YourFriendMaryGrace
most benevolent energies are welcome in your space i suggest doing this regularly and do your best not to feel anger or fear towards any negative energies they like to feed off that love and light are repellent to dark energy so imagining a beam of light coming from your heart and surrounding yourself and the room can really help as well edit one more thing you should do whats best for you so just disregard this if its not helpful but theres a lot of ways besides catholicism to connect with higher energies and grow spiritually i was raised christian and while i still appreciate the teachings of loving others and doing good ive found that exploring spirituality apart from religion has been the most beneficial thing ive ever done i love this story thank you for sharing its incredibly common for people who have passed on to use the dream state to visit loved ones i saw my grandfather about a month after he passed early in the morning when i was,YourFriendMaryGrace
just starting to wake up i told him i was sad that he couldnt be there to see us grandkids grow up and that my baby sister had started walking and he missed it and he just smiled and said i know she started walking i can check in on yall from time to time fast forward about 20 years and he showed back up to comfort me when i was going through a rough time he appeared to my mom and my sister in law as well dont worry about your words to him being less than perfect he can feel your immense love for him very clearly 3 vibrations are everything if someone is in a low vibration angry afraid then its unlikely that a benevolent spirit will be able to connect with them so he probably tried to but couldnt he may have been ready to cross over and just needed to do that first its really nice that they give specific references i feel like that helps a lot my,YourFriendMaryGrace
friends dad said he was going to wait for her before he fully crossed over so maybe thats why he had time to wait around and communicate more than usual im sure you brought his mom so much comfort and him as well yeah pretty much i was doing yoga and then out of nowhere i felt the presence of an older man i couldnt see him exactly but i could just tell he was a nice old guy he basically just said can you get kelsey for me like he wanted to talk to her through me ive received messages from spirits before but never as out of the blue as this one i was hesitant so i stalled for like a week but the whole time i could just feel him waiting patiently lol so i finally reached out to her and she was super open about it and invited me over almost as soon as i got there messages just started pouring in about all kinds of things lots of specific,YourFriendMaryGrace
references and of course just general love and comfort they were incredibly close and hed died suddenly so she hadnt really gotten to say goodbye its really an honor to be able to help people in that way im open to doing it again but it hasnt happened since ive wondered this about sightings if everybody has them but only the people who are able to handle the experience actually retain the memories i recently posted about a uap sighting i had with another person where i felt calm and happy when we saw it but he kinda freaked out a couple years later hed completely forgot about the experience but he remembers a previous sighting we had together perfectly fine and it just so happens that he was pretty calm when we had that sighting so i posted on another sub and found that a lot of people have had the same experience where they remember but their coexperiencer freaked out and then later seemed to forget very curious im so excited for,YourFriendMaryGrace
you i love your metaphor of the butterfly thats beautiful it sounds like we are seeing very similar things with the sparkles and blueish purplish orbs i see the black flecks as well sometimes but not coming from people at least not that ive noticed the sparkles and orbs feel sooo benevolent to me i do feel like they are beings of some kind possibly from other dimensions which is why were not able to see their full form i love them i always giggle and say hi lol wow thank you for sharing it sounds like you had an awful lot on your plate at that time i wonder if they were helpers of some kind showing up for you and your family thats so cool that you saw them together what size were they thats adorable i hope you two have many happy years together thats really sad but so lovely that you were able to receive the message and pass it along to her i once received a message from my,YourFriendMaryGrace
friends dad who had recently passed id never met him so i was surprised he came to me and like you i was worried about sounding crazy but it meant a lot to my friend i think some souls just linger until they can find a way to pass along some comfort to their loved ones thank you for helping him 3 not being able to spoon is the hardest challenge i face as a single person right now theres just 1 flying around san diego now there were like 20 of them earlier ududemanthing1983 totally understand that this one is anecdotal if you guys are interested in the subject yall might enjoy checking out the research done by dr jim tucker and dr ian stevenson into past life recollection thats been done at the university of virginia for many decades theyve compiled a staggering number of children who recalled very specific details including the names of family members where they lived what their house looked like their occupation etc that were later matched,YourFriendMaryGrace
to real life people interestingly the memories seem to disappear by around age seven this particular publication has some cool stories ooo thats intriguing was it moving at all oooo thats very interesting that your optometrist hears that from patients a lot pinpoints of light is a good way to describe it i dont know what they are either but i usually call them angel sparkles lol because they feel so benevolent to me have you noticed any patterns in whenwhere you see them same this just brought back deeply repressed memories lol wow id never heard of this one before thats sad but also really cool rip and congrats on getting your justice ms zona why does it feel like i have a snake in my forehead is my new favorite google search ive ever seen lol congrats on your awakening as you probably know by now youre in very good company what do they look like wow this is amazing im so happy you shared isnt it incredible how once you become,YourFriendMaryGrace
open and willing the path unfolds with such mind blowing discoveries synchronicities and experiences i love that you were able to help get the mans message to leonard i often think about how good it must feel to spirits who have passed on to be able to find an open channel to communicate to their loved ones through also artemis was one of the first beings i connected with as well i just love her sounds like you have an incredibly special calling im excited for you 3 some souls are just extra motivated to get justice it seems heres a kinda similar story a 3 year old boy told his family that he was murdered with an axe in his last life he took them to his former village pointed out who killed him then showed them where the body and the axe were buried i cried instantly it was so helpful for me and my kids to be able to talk about healing scary feelings leftover from their past experiences my kids,YourFriendMaryGrace
6 and 9 and i just watched this one last night and it sent them both into a full blown existential crisis they were both running around yelling what if were puppets what if were an animation what if people are watching our show it was amazing and hilarious in my experience you wont see anything that you arent ready to see the subconscious mind has a way of protecting you which is why we dont walk around with all the bad memories of all our lives all the time i knew i had a particular traumatic past life and did a lot of regressions to try and figure out what happened but i wasnt able to see it for years by that point i was ready though and if you do decide to try it remember to send yourself past and present lots of love you may see something traumatic but its kind of like watching a movie so you arent necessarily fully experiencing it as if it was happening again and even,YourFriendMaryGrace
though seeing difficult memories isnt fun its been really helpful for me to identify where some of my fears and hangups came from and work through them just my thoughts the most important thing is to do what feels right to you thats really cool thank you for sharing this its not uncommon at all for past life memories to come flooding up out of nowhere like that if youd like to see more of this lifetime you can check out past life regression meditations on youtube you dont have to be used to meditating for it to be helpful we live infinitely so for this particular memory to come back to you likely means theres something you can learn from it or something left over from that time that wants to heal within you if you have any questions feel free to ask hope that helps in some way 3 were not even talking about weight you silly goose bot well theres nothing wrong with that at all finding the right balance for,YourFriendMaryGrace
you is a lifetime journey and its normal for levels to change and fluctuate you can even learn to work with the energies to achieve certain things i tend to utilize my masculine energy for completing tasks communicating and planning my feminine energy i often use for listening creating and intuition the most important thing is to send yourself lots of love and acceptance for who you are and how you feel every day theres no right or wrong way to feel as long as you keep practicing loving yourself its really interesting that you have experienced a life as a man who felt and dressed feminine and now it seems that you are experiencing the opposite in a way our souls want to grow and expand in each lifetime so we very often will choose to have these opposite experiences in different ways we will be rich poor attractive unattractive etc so that we can get to know our truest deepest nature over time which is ultimately not defined by any of those,YourFriendMaryGrace
things perhaps part of what youre learning is to accept and embrace both your masculine and feminine energies as one it might help to learn more about these energies apart from the cultural perspectives we all have both energies within us masculine energy is active it helps you go forth and build its an energy of doing feminine energy is receptive it helps you receive and nurture things its an energy of being at our most evolved we are able to balance both those energies within us beautifully regardless of our outside appearances im so glad youre here sounds like your journey is off to an amazing start first of all i want to say that your intuition is your best guide and from everything youve shared i feel youre very well in tune with it so ill share some of my experiences as they relate to yours but of course nothing i say is definitive so take what resonates and leave the rest your experience with the uap is really cool and i,YourFriendMaryGrace
relate to what youre saying about how it wanted you to be able to see it isnt that the most amazing thing theyre very aware of us and im glad they stopped by to say hi and get you started on your journey i have also experienced a sudden burst of growth dreams and abilities after a visit it almost seems as if part of their stopping by to see us sometimes is to give us a sort of personalized spiritual upgrade package the dreams could very well be a mix of things and again your own intuition is key if you feel that the one with the woman might have been a past life then it very likely was the apocalyptic one might have been a metaphor for your difficult childhood or perhaps something else entirely i do believe that seeing flashes of light is a very common part of waking up process were surrounded by dimensions and so much more we dont normally see but i think were all capable of seeing,YourFriendMaryGrace
much more than we realize and just becoming aware of that possibility can be a gateway to seeing more i began seeing little white spots during the day when i first started meditating years ago now i also see violet blue and gold ovals as well white streaks they always make me smile youre exactly right to feel out the energy you accept in your space remember that you can have boundaries in the spirit realm too the benevolent entities will respect that as youve already experienced when you arent sure if the vibes are right with a particular presence try sending it love the malevolent ones tend to be repelled by that and the benevolent ones will appreciate it as for determining what sort of entity you encountered it very well could be reptilian if that resonates with you in general id advise staying open minded and curious because entities will make themselves more known to you when the time is right if its important for you to know you may encounter things,YourFriendMaryGrace
that you later discover many people have seen you may also encounter things only you have seen its a very big universe full of possibilities please feel free to message me any time if i can be of help thanks for sharing 3 yay im glad it was helpful sounds like youre lingering in a meditative state before falling asleep its like you describe you are still conscious but your mind is able to see things without you having to imagine or really do anything i highly recommend starting a meditation practice its got so many benefits and youre a natural i used to have this same dream a lot it depends on whats going on in your life but generally speaking its illustrating that you know youre supposed be learning and growing but you arent really sure what you should be learning or how you can learn what you need to know to be able to move forward in life you might not be sure who to ask for guidance trying to find,YourFriendMaryGrace
the office so youre kind of in a limbo state does that resonate so thankful for this community we appreciate all you guys do to provide us with a safe space to share and connect right aries is literally the sign of the warrior i have a capricorn moon and venus in aries i fall in love quite rarely but when i do it happens very fast and i try very hard and often longer than i should to make it last absolutely as far as sightings go ive had 3 separate uap sightings with my kids dad i tend to connect telepathically with people im dating to varying degrees and ive made 3 friends that i share dreams and mediation visions with its really cool i definitely have flashbacks but mostly during the day like you said sometimes itll be a dream i havent thought about in years i just randomly see the location of the dream in my minds eye and usually feel the primary emotion attached to the dream interestingly ive,YourFriendMaryGrace
found that when this happens with bad dreams i can sort of tell my brain that ive seen enough of that one and would like to release it and the flashbacks of that dream will stop took me years of uncomfortable repeating flashbacks to figure that out though right like she has gossip and funny stories and opinions in there the last thing she wants is secrecy my scorpio sunrising son never forgets an insult when he was about 3 years old we went to a playground and a kid there refused to share his trucks more than 2 weeks go by and i tell him were going back to the playground he goes and gets his trucks and says i not gonna share these i just know he was hoping that same kid would be there and he could give him a taste of his own medicine my gemini sunmoon daughter absolutely loves to learn and she will share interesting facts with anyone who will listen she started keeping a journal but she,YourFriendMaryGrace
writes not private on the front of each one and asks people if theyd like to read it all the time thank you for your kind words and worries at all to be fair i have absolutely attracted creepy dudes who clearly are into me for that reason so its certainly not always an untrue assumption but some guys just genuinely like petite women for other reasons and im thankful for that its kinda weird reading this as a petite woman myself not picking on you lots of people say this and i know youre just explaining why the downvotes its just weird and inadvertently insulting to hear that the only way someone would be attracted to me is if theyre a pedo im sorry people say things like that i know how discouraging it can feel when you try and share only to be ridiculed just fyi rexperiencers is really cool and supportive place for people who have been through stuff like this what makes you think so if it makes you feel,YourFriendMaryGrace
any better from what ive seen doing that tends to backfire on people very badly i guess well never know for sure but it seems highly likely that her brother burke did it he had a lot of behavioral problems and had already beaten her with a golf club a year earlier not too much of a stretch to think hed do it again with a flashlight would also explain why the parents werent as adamant as youd expect about getting the case solved im really sorry for your loss i believe our loved ones can use dreams and other states of consciousness to connect with us im sure he was very happy to see you too if that doesnt work give it a solk instead omg thats awesome i love your mom i almost wonder if being petite in a world where physically threatening people are everywhere just makes our brains go fuck it at some point and then we become irrationally brave i was about to offer my condolences but now im,YourFriendMaryGrace
not sure what to offer congrats i got my big muscley drugdealing neighbor to stop hitting and shoving his girlfriend into his car just by walking up and yelling at him to stop im 54 and like 105 pounds i think the unlikelihood of the fact that i was going right up to him hollering like i could easily take him must have made him assume i had a gun on me or something i dont know but he looked legit startled and confused and he backed off so i walked away with his girlfriend in peace then i drove her to her friends house my sense of selfpreservation in danger is not great lol ive put myself in a lot of situations where i could have been beat up or killed but so far its worked out just fine i believe we plan some things including when were born but with many possibilities left open for example perhaps you and another soul plan to meet at a certain point in your lives and,YourFriendMaryGrace
become romantically involved from there you may end up breaking up living happily ever after or simply deciding to be friends so the initial interactions are destined but you cant really determine what the outcome will be ahead of time too many variables but regardless of the outcome meeting your person will help you both grow in some way and thats why its important edit i missed your other question i do think karma plays a huge role but not in a punishing way our souls are meant to grow through each lifetime so we probably cant or wont choose the same thing over and over like if you are given a lot of gifts in life like attractiveness intelligence material success etc and then you use those gifts solely for your own benefit or as a way to look down on others it will help your souls growth in the next life to experience what its like not to have all those gifts so you can learn to how to be more communityminded,YourFriendMaryGrace
and that true happiness and selfworth comes from within i havent but i absolutely would planning a wedding is just way too much planning lol i was excited to read the scientists account because it perfectly matched what ive seen from my past life regressions of my life on another planet so for me it was comforting confirmation but i understand how it could be unsettling just remember that whatever the truth is its been that way your entire life the only thing thats changing is your awareness keep living your life to the fullest and stay grounded you will be okay 3 i had a lot of strong pluto aspects with my ex boyfriend i felt a viscerally strong connection with him almost instantly weve been broken up over a year and i still feel it its tough i wish things would have worked out with him because if it werent for his betrayal of my trust i would have never ever wanted it to end as an aries venus mercury and mars,YourFriendMaryGrace
i agree if i like you youre gonna know it and ill want to see you again expeditiously i dont have the patience for games pretty accurate actually lol im a libra rising which is possibly the friendliest rising there is also a pisces sun with mars venus and mercury in aries in my 7th house so im passionate about my oneonone relationships thats a fun question ill cover the rest of the days thanks to that movie i can still rapidly recite the names of all of santas reindeer in order and in an austrian accent thats so cool i just saw this post the other day where a mother and son shared a dream lots of comments in there of similar stories you might like to read i love doing this sometimes i challenge myself by trying to guess the major placements of celebrities and then i look them up to see if im right i usually am its crazy right some people just scream the energy of a certain sign lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats a beautiful outcome im so happy for you im glad you posted i hope you continue to have beneficial experiences 3 that sounds so scary im sorry you experienced that hat man is a crazy common entity sighting but like you most people are surprised to find that out im fascinated by him or them its such a common occurrence that its hard to believe its just one spirit doing all that work lol like surely theres a team of them but then again hes probably not constrained by time hope he stays far away from you from here on out gemini in venus has a reputation for being cheaters bc they like variety but of course thats not always the case and with it being in your 7th house you could also be drawn to long term relationships i suggest looking for someone who is fun intelligent will have adventures with you and keep your mind stimulated i watched this happen on twitter and gawker rip when hillary was running it was,YourFriendMaryGrace
so obvious just like whats happening here is tons of people appeared out of nowhere who seemed to live their whole lives just to talk about how hillary was the greatest person of all time and harass anyone who said otherwise but saying that it seemed coordinatedpaid for of course got people further harassed then it turned out to be true with the whole correct the record superpac thing this isnt a political statement btw im sure both sides and lots of other organizations do this long way of saying i agree with you the amount of money it would cost to do this is minuscule to them and the benefit of disrupting the peoples ability to effectively communicate is huge edit what a surprise that your post got removed gahhh was the shadow man wearing a hat by chance with regards to the interdimensional world when you think about how theres likely at least 10 dimensions and we mostly only perceive 3 of them that leaves a lot of space for all kinds,YourFriendMaryGrace
of possibilities i suspect that what we see as shadows ghosts orbs etc would look very very different if we had the ability to perceive them in their full range of dimension we just see whatever part of them is dense enough to materialize in the 3 dimensions were accustomed to true i think the misperception that pisces are endlessly perfectly sweet and patient works to our advantage though people really show their true colors when they think they can get away with anything yes it was froot loops then fruit loops and then back to froot loops same with the flintstones its bizarre to see a mandela effect that is regularly discussed go back to how it was it makes me crazy luckily i dont come across people like that too often anymore but i have this tool in my pocket if i ever need it again me too i almost wish id told him myself but the silent satisfaction was too good omg hi twin i guess the pisces and the libra,YourFriendMaryGrace
makes us accepting of people as long as they treat others well but the capricorn just wont let us put up with bullshit for very long lol shes beautiful and you were adorable makes me happy to know that shes still with us and doing well thanks for sharing i wish i knew im a pisces sun cap moon libra rising in high school there was a guy who annoyed me really bad because he was so pretentious and always trying to act smarter than everyone so one day i told him a nonsense word salad philosophical quote id just made up and he said oh yeah thats a good one i already studied that one i was satisfied that i had proved to myself that he was full of shit lol im so thankful science is advancing in ways that are making it harder for people to label experiencers as liars or crazy oh thats fascinating i met my now ex husband in the first one and had a baby in the second,YourFriendMaryGrace
one thanks for this tip im even more curious now what this transit will bring exactly this i promise you once youve had time to grieve the relationship you will be amazed at the peace of mind that comes from letting go of someone who you love but cant trust you deserve to be with someone who adores you and cherishes the relationship enough that this kind of thing would never be a problem its not worth the hurt and worry mosquito larvae most likely im really sorry for your loss i bet that is a strange feeling indeed hope youre doing okay 3 yeah id be upset too if i was her but what you did isnt gaslighting op that term is chronically misused now i really appreciate your response ive only had acquaintances with it but no one close to me so ive never felt comfortable asking id think that would be really tough to deal with especially since when youre manic id imagine you probably dont want to come down sorry,YourFriendMaryGrace
about the charges youre dealing with and i hope things turn out well for you 3 ive seen a past life that had my kids dad in it and hes seen at least one with me in it too we arent together romantically anymore in this life but we will always be dear friends i think we just like being in each others lives one way or another im not very familiar with bpd so if you dont feel like sharing its okay but im just curious what do you mean theres no way of stopping yourself is it like another part of you takes over that doesnt care about the consequences or just doesnt think there will be any consequences poor john i wonder what happened i cant tell if mike broke up with him or died sick cycle carousel by lifehouse and breathing by lifehouse been revisiting my emotional teenager feelings with that album all i wanted was for someone to feel about me the way he feels about whoever hes singing,YourFriendMaryGrace
about in breathing please dont waste your time i spent 3 years encouraging an emotionally stunted man to heal and grow as a person so we could have a healthier relationship and i shouldnt have learn from my mistakes he wont get better hell use your love and devotion as evidence that he can continue contributing far less to the relationship than you do and youll still keep coming around i promise youll be happier being single than stuck in something like this its a slow and painful heartbreak i wouldnt wish on anybody thats so sweet congratulations on your 60th like attracts like she probably wont like this suggestion but i would recommend she remove the horror movie posters and anything else that has creepy energy from the room even the silly ones like chucky can provide a little portal for dark energy to come through put salt in the corners and burn sage or cedar the most potent repellent to dark energy is love and light so tell her not to hold,YourFriendMaryGrace
on to feelings of anger towards whatever is doing this that just feeds them if you find it let me know i scanned the whole page looking for him exactly were very unaware of the higher dimensions in modern times and so we arent even thinking about the multitude of entities that have been living in them for who knows how long so then we look at the egyptians and their mythology as a silly group of people worshipping some nonexistent gods and think were so much smarter lol i dont believe that theyre gods per se but powerful beings that arent bound to space and time the way we are they probably arent as active with modern humans because most modern humans dont even understand what they are nor do they reach the levels of consciousness needed to communicate with them the same goes for many other deities and mythologized creatures id imagine hes my favorite too i want to make friends with him youre perfectly human theres nothing wrong with only feeling,YourFriendMaryGrace
sexual attraction when youre emotionally connected as well i think its beautiful dont let the hookup culture fool you casual sex isnt inherently better just because its considered normal well if you havent already i hope you find someone who appreciates all that you bring to the table and does everything they can to make your life better too 3 right good luck ever finding anyone who cares about you like your wife does op most people these days are flaky and will bail on you the minute they see someone new and shiny just like youre about to do to your devoted wife when youre old and alone if not much sooner you will regret this time to the core of your being i love your placements now pls be my nonstop source of comfort spontaneity and emotional support bc thats just how you are and let me be the curmudgeonly cynic who drains your energy by always needing to be pushed and prodded into making any kind of positive changes in my,YourFriendMaryGrace
life lolol psychedelics are probably one of the most potent portals you will find meditation as well i also love the other suggestions youve gotten like ley lines and the earth chakras also try not to worry too much about the people who think youre off your rocker theyre the ones who are ignorant and uninformed and the way disclosure and scientific discovery is going theyll have to realize that sooner or later wow never thought about it like that it is just a projection and i have heavy neptunepisces influences you just helped me understand so much about myself thank you xd ive been called that a bunch of times im a pisces sun libra rising with lots of aries placements and uranus aspects so im kinda weird hyper and i have my own sense of fashion which i guess is mpdgish always have mixed feelings about being called that though it feels like im going to be expected to fill some kind of endless inspirational role in their life and never need,YourFriendMaryGrace
anything in return but thats just a tangent rant lol keep in mind whatever is out there has been there your entire life the only thing thats really changing is your and the publics awareness i highly suggest mediation both for the mental health benefits as well as for the opportunity to slowly adjust to and even access these higher dimensions theres an old saying first enlightenment then the laundry and i think thats very important and wise no matter what happens no matter how much our understanding of reality expands we still have clothes to wash and pets to feed and stuff so allow yourself to explore the higher dimensions but be intentional about staying grounded in the 3d as well i was raised christian and learned long ago that reality is nothing like were taught feel free to reach out if i can help when i was about 11 i had pet bunny rabbits that lived in a hutch outside the hutch was off the ground and really sturdy and our backyard,YourFriendMaryGrace
was fenced in so i never really worried about them one night i dreamt that dogs broke into the yard and killed them and my dad had tried to save them but couldnt less than a week later thats exactly what happened i knew from then on that time doesnt work like we think it does more recently a coworker that i hadnt really talked to much before he was a temporary worker told me in a dream he was writing a book a few days later he told me he was writing a book lol ive had more but those are the first two that came to mind you are so welcome you deserve the support and im happy that i saw your post and was able to help in some way youve got a lot going on and its completely understandable to need to vent everyone does sometimes again please feel free to reach out anytime 3 i care im glad it was helpful theres lots of past life regression meditations on,YourFriendMaryGrace
youtube if you feel like you want to explore deeper hahaha i assume it was just cloaking everything but its leg maybe like a test run to see if i could handle that before showing me the rest of itself which needless to say i didnt pass it was bizarre and i have no definitive answers for you im happy it resonated with you i see i believe that there are probably a larger variety of species than we can even imagine so predicting what they are like or how they operate isnt really possible as they arent a homogenous group but statistically yes there likely are at least some nhi that operate as you described you might find paul hellyer the former minister of defense of canada accounts comforting he has said that the vast majority of them are benevolent and would like to help us i think were kinda like the bad neighborhood of the universe and the majority of species are more concerned with us messing up our planet to the,YourFriendMaryGrace
point where it affects other planets and species than anything just my humble thoughts are you saying you believe the nhi themselves are malevolent my experiences started very young and were always with benevolent energies so that probably helped a lot im pretty attuned to energy so i can feel when an entity isnt trustworthy and i tell it to leave me be that being said ive still gotten startled and noped out of experiences that i wish i wouldnt have one time i was in my living room and saw the leg of a mantis creature walking by even though i could feel that it was friendly i still kinda panicked and it disappeared its been 6 years and im still hoping they give me another chance to see them the good entities dont want to frighten you so you probably wont have an experience with them until youre ready for it and ifwhen you do try to summon feelings of love peace and excitement the good ones love that and the bad,YourFriendMaryGrace
ones are repelled by it could be but i feel like a bunker is something most people with a ton of money to spare would build anyway i know i would doesnt necessarily mean theyre planning an event also nuclear fallout effects them too unless they want to stay underground forever which would get pretty old im sure you know this but uap sightings increased dramatically after we dropped the bombs and theyve been known to shut down nuclear sites for decades im hopeful that theyre here to stop us from doing worse and maybe help us access the free energy thats been withheld and stuff time will tell maybe thats what theyre trying to help us prevent we can hope i agree i think thats why sightings by regular people seem to be way more prevalent in the last year or two theyre tired of trying to work with our mess of a government and theyre forcing their hands knowing this is probably also why government officials are coming forward with information so,YourFriendMaryGrace
rapidly and the ones who dont have access to information are going on the record as trying to get information they dont want to be known as one of the ones who were keeping secrets crazy times its a total 180 and im delighted thats very sad but also pretty cool ive read lots of accounts of people visiting a new place and past life memories flooding back also souls often like to incarnate within the same family line so they can be with their loved ones again so its very possible you were one of your ancestors happy 16th birthday im glad you opened up and shared here i want to respond to everything so im gonna break it down into a few parts first of all i am so so sorry that you were sa as a child i was too and i know how it feels to not want anyone to know i kept it a secret until i was 27 and i regret that a lot i wish id told,YourFriendMaryGrace
someone much sooner so i could get help even if you dont feel like its affecting you its still really important to be able to get therapy as soon as possible so you can work to process it i encourage you to tell your parents i know its scary but if they are good parents theyll want to know and hopefully they can help you find someone affordable to help you a lot of times insurance will cover therapy as well its perfectly normal to be confused about your sexuality its a spectrum anyway and you dont have to decide how you feel about it just let yourself be open and curious and youll figure it out the most important thing is to love yourself every part of yourself you shouldnt have to be the therapist all the time you deserve support too sometimes parents get overwhelmed and they start to lean on their children more than they should you can be a listening ear if you want to but that doesnt mean you,YourFriendMaryGrace
cant also speak up about what youre going through and have been through friendships come and go and sometimes they come back the future is uncertain no matter who you are or what you have going on so try to take life one day at a time big hugs feel free to reach out anytime 3 yeah i saw that in the article and thought about you saying you were fighting him crazy like i said ive never seen this guy in particular but ive seen other things that i later found out lots of people see its a weird feeling right my kids dad saw the hat man a lot as a child and never knew it was a common thing either until i told him aww thank you friend yeah hes a busy guy lol people see him all over the world heres a basic article but theres lots more info out there if youre curious ive never seen him myself but i find him very fascinating edit that article describes him,YourFriendMaryGrace
as maliciousdark but i dont know if thats always true plenty of people seem to have neutral encounters with him he got 6 perfect shots big hugs to you and your son 3 the hat man very common entity sighting theres tons of information about astral travel on the cia website and other organizations have been studying it for decades its very real and it sounds like you two traveled together very cool this made my day thank you i think were slowly but surely moving towards cooperation as a species i think a huge step towards that is going to be realizing that we are far from alone in this universe and that other species have evolved to cooperate that we are primitive in comparison to the way other beings operate and we can do better and those of us who have been able to access these higher dimensions and beings will be able to help those who havent to adjust to new ways of thinking and being what do you mean a,YourFriendMaryGrace
destination for myself or humanity this will sound cheesy but i think were all special we humans have a tendency to look for or to try and create hierarchies and some people might look at those of us who can see and perceive things others cant as being extra special but i see it more like we have a certain role to play in the collective its no better or higher than anyone elses calling its just maybe a bit unusual lol oh my goodness i am so sorry this is happening to you how awful im a mama and i cant imagine not taking this seriously or defending you however i could i would have probably been to jail by now for punching him i wish i could give you a hug this is so understandably hard for you to deal with and im glad you reached out for support that little piece of shit boy will end up in jail for something eventually or get his ass beat for messing with the,YourFriendMaryGrace
wrong person hes disgusting and cruel and he doesnt deserve to be breathing the same air as you you are so so precious and worthy and you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect im so sorry that youre in an environment thats making you feel otherwise but please understand that what other people think or say about you has nothing to do with the the real you i know it feels like youll be in this pain forever but i promise it will pass you wont even think about most of these people someday please message me anytime i care and im here for you i dont even bother trying to convince skeptics of anything anymore at this point with quantum physics confirming that much of what were experiencing is not only possible but probable and with high level and highly educated officials confirming that extradimensional beings are present on earth if someone still wants to believe im crazy for saying that ive seen things thats on them theyre the ones that,YourFriendMaryGrace
are being unscientific i keep my experiences to myself unless im confident the person im talking to is open minded and even then i only reveal what i feel comfortable revealing which is often just a small fraction of my experience but if you do feel like trying to demonstrate that you arent being unscientific you can point them to scientific sources on how there are likely at least 10 dimensions and how our eyes see less than half a percent of the electromagnetic spectrum it doesnt always work but it can help people realize that just because they cant see it with their own eyes doesnt mean its not real remember that as disclosure continues on the skeptics are going to have no choice but to accept that reality is not what they thought ive had people who would get so annoyed and argumentative with me talking about aliens eventually end up realizing they were wrong and start asking me questions also that reaction of mocking you or trying to discredit your experience,YourFriendMaryGrace
is likely coming from a place of fear theyre scared to consider that we arent alone and they are just trying to comfort themselves into not believing it by turning on you where did he think eggs came from i need to know pls dont let me down im sorry this happened to you im not familiar with these particular creatures but i do have a suggestion that might help you avoid such encounters make a habit of consciously sending loving protective white light into and surrounding yourself and your home you can practice boundaries with entities just like you do with humans im not saying its foolproof but it can really help this is so cool thank you for sharing are you familiar with philip k dicks experiences with et they helped him save his childs life by informing him of a very serious medical condition the child had that he was unaware of your father calling you guys when youre sick before you even told him reminded me of that im so,YourFriendMaryGrace
sorry this is happening to you 3 thats awful and i know it hurts as the other commenter said be sure you get tested i can relate i was in a relationship where i was very encouraging of his sexual exploration and wanted him to feel so safe and comfortable talking with me about his kinks and stuff i was also clear that i was open to polyamory if it was something he wanted to explore and he always said he wasnt interested then i found out that i had an std and of course the only person id had sex with was him it hurts a lot when youre so open and willing to accommodate and then they just go and do as they please behind your back with no regard for you or your wellbeing but you will pick yourself up and move on and find great happiness just give yourself lots of time and lots of love hes shown you that he cant be trusted youll look back and be so,YourFriendMaryGrace
proud of yourself for leaving him to his own devices sending you big hugs feel free to message me anytime moon and venus signs will tell you a lot more about how you operate in relationships than sun sign example im a pisces sun so i do love to romanticize but my practical capricorn moon and my fiery aries venus will override and cut a toxic person off with a quickness no matter what time they text me lol yes many if not most of these beings are from higher dimensions so our brains and eyes literally cant perceive what they actually look like we just see the shimmers or shadows or orbs or whatever other aspect of them is dense enough to show up in the 3d i think it went something like this boomers created the bullshit with the help of some silent gen gen x knew it was bullshit but were outnumbered so resigned to it and participated millennials been screaming that its all bullshit since 2008 and were called whiny,YourFriendMaryGrace
and entitled for not wanting to participate gen z is now joining in the fight so we are no longer so outnumbered and can maybe actually join together and do something i hope thats so cool all the egyptian deities are powerful and helpful in their own ways im sure but hes the only one ive met so far just my personal experience his energy is very interesting he can alternate between being the fearsome deliverer of karmic justice and this surprisingly goofy friendly guy depending upon how he feels about you and your deeds i guess but hes definitely a protector of those who are trying to bring love and fairness to this world this resonates very well with the information ive received with love and compassion and encouraging others in their selfempowerment being the main focus for me its frustrating sometimes because much of humanity is stuck in a materialistic mindset where they feel they must compete rather than cooperate with others but very large numbers of people are waking up so,YourFriendMaryGrace
im very grateful and hopeful for the future thats a really sad first memory im so sorry hugs thanks for sharing ive definitely had similar experiences perhaps next time you can let go a bit more if youre comfortable leaving your body and astral traveling is amazing and it sounds like you have a lovely helper to guide you in at least one of my past lives i was one of those catlike people 3 made me happy to see you mention them did you ever get a sense of where the ones you interacted with came from well it worked out nicely bc i got to hear more of your awesome music one more piece of advice if i may from my personal experience regarding meeting spirits they tend to show themselves to us when we most need them but they are always there regardless so if you dont meet thoth right away it doesnt mean he doesnt like you when he introduced himself to me last year he said it was because,YourFriendMaryGrace
i was getting a lot of negative energy sent to me from certain people and energies and he was blocking it for me and returning it to them karmically at other times ive had alien encounters that helped me with my mental health ive met the spirits of deceased artists who helped me with my paintings my late grandfather checked in with me when i was having a really hard time going through divorce stuff like that so yeah just be open and meditate and see what happens youre welcome id love to dm were completely surrounded by things we cant see theres at least 10 dimensions and the visible light that humans can perceive is less than half a percent of the actual spectrum so yeah theres no one single giant truth that all experiencers know other than that theres much more to reality than what our almost completely blind human eyes usually see weve seen into those dimensions or have seen pieces of that missing visible light enough to know that aliens,YourFriendMaryGrace
fairies whatever else we have seen are absolutely real some people cannot handle that thought and will try and find any way they can to convince themselves that if they cant see it its not real its scary to them but it exists regardless just like the color red continues to exist whether a colorblind person believes in it or not ohhh i met you the other day in my post about memory gaps after a sighting im sorry i didnt recognize your username at first but i love your style and your drumming and your passion for it thanks so much for sharing 3 i would love to hear your music if youre open to sharing really cool that you write your own according to the egyptians written words are thoths thing too lol yeah its easy for me to say its adorable when im not the one coming face to face with it i just like how it defended its eye shape by comparing it to spider mans eyes makes sense as,YourFriendMaryGrace
a way to try and ease a childs fears it reminds me of my little brother when we were kids he said that a big monster creature had come in his room and she brought a baby monster with her that was very cute so he wouldnt be afraid it seems like they have a lot of strategies for making contact with certain people without scaring us too bad did you feel or sense anything in particular when they held your hand this is adorable lol ive had so many experiences yet ive never met a grey if i ever do get to meet one i hope its one like uppo for me it happened out of the blue one day while i was meditating he told me that he is protective of me and that he especially likes a friend of mine who i had just recently met so i texted that friend about it and turned out he had just finished painting a portrait of thoth i had no idea my friend,YourFriendMaryGrace
and i had never even talked about him before he seems to be drawn to artists writers and most importantly people who are very fair minded he is benevolent but he can dole out karma like a boss so hes not one to take lightly i would suggest just kind of mentally saying hi to him as you go into meditation or sleep and see what happens ooo i wonder the significance of the brokenmissing top then and isnt that the best feeling when you have a visceral experience that is so real and impossible to forget and then you learn of someone else having seen the exact same thing i wonder what happened to poor mars so long ago ive read some very sad past life hypnosis stories of people who were there long ago and they felt so devastated by the sudden destruction of the climate to me it almost sounds like a nuclear catastrophe of some kind but i dont know it could just as easily be a comet or a,YourFriendMaryGrace
technology failure or something ive never had any astral or rv experiences with mars myself but im quite curious about it this is a lovely response and absolutely resonates thanks so much the first time i saw one was as a child and it had such a friendly energy as do the ones im seeing now its really cool that theyre protectors makes me feel extra thankful to be seeing them just whatever information you feel like sharing really i keep seeing them in my dreams this week for the most part no names one exception to this is thoth he introduced himself by name about a year ago i know him by his egyptian name though djehuty hes cool and has a very protective energy and i feel thankful that he seems to like me bc damn it would be scary to be on his bad side lol do you have any experiences or insight into the orange orb type of ships theres been reports for decades of them shutting down our nuclear,YourFriendMaryGrace
facilities dodging missiles and running circles around our jets if they wanted to hurt us they would have by now and i think were about as much of a threat to them as a toddler with a toy sword is to a grownup its also a lot easier for us to stay calm and receptive when were sleeping or meditating and i feel like not scaring us is a big priority for them im curious have you or uvoodoolord ever read this remote viewing report from the cia website that takes place in ancient mars the viewer describes giant pyramids and obelisks and gentle giants really cool experience op thanks so much for sharing absolutely my dreams intuition and ability to sense energy is popping off too its been extra ramped up since sunday it feels like our conscious minds are expanding stay grounded loving and fearless everybody i love it setting a reminder on my phone wow this is synchronous i have been dreaming about these orange orbs a lot lately i saw,YourFriendMaryGrace
one when i was a kid it was cute lol thanks for sharing this theory it makes a lot of sense i suspect that they probably use all sorts of methods and make use of elements we humans cant see or fully comprehend just yet would you mind sharing about the orange orb you saw like where were you what did it do edit never mind i found your old post love it and im glad i found you bc like i said i keep dreamingthinking about the orange ones all the sudden it feels theres a lot of them hanging around earth for the past week or so edit again do you happen to recall what kind of trees it was hanging out above when you first spotted it the ones i see seem to like pine trees so i was just curious youre welcome i might not be able to relate to everything youve been through but i know how much it hurts to have your trust betrayed to feel guilt about,YourFriendMaryGrace
mistakes and ive been able to work through a lot of trauma over time and learn to release myself from a lot of pain if i can help you too im happy to do it so pls feel free to message any time i care love this question i remember my first nightmare clearly i was about 4 or 5 years old the dream took place late at night at my grandparents house with my whole extended family gathered together we all knew that the wolves were coming this was absolutely terrifying it wasnt clear what the wolves were going to do to us just that it was very very bad and there was nothing we could do to save ourselves there were giant purple clocks on the wall loudly ticking the time away other than that it was silent all we could do was wait for the wolves to come wow i wish we could chat in real life i could talk about all this for hours i have astral traveled to just,YourFriendMaryGrace
one ancient site but it changed the way i view humanity for sure love this comment thank you for responding thats so sweet thank you for sharing this story its a lovely reminder of how even a simple word or gesture can make someones life better i hope youre doing well and that your family continues to learn to love and support you as you are thats really tough im sorry youre going through this other than informing your friends parents or a school counselor about it theres only so much you can do be prepared to explain your concerns to your friend and remind them that they dont deserve to be treated that way im glad youre still here hope youre doing okay 3 thanks so much for the recommendation im very interested especially in the antediluvian so i will check those out i love this really thoughtprovoking thanks to you and chatgpt for sharing your thoughts youre welcome always here if you want to chat hey im really sorry for your loss,YourFriendMaryGrace
friend 3 grief is a weird process some days you might feel energized and focused on what needs to be done other days you might feel lost like you cant think straight it can even change by the hour just know that theres no right or wrong way to feel at any given time when you do feel like crying really let it out it helps so much lots of love to you and your family this made me laugh so hard i cant imagine how painful that would be to try and snort i hope hes doing well wherever he is lol i agree that certainly seems to be the deciding factor in all these cases those who freak out forget those who stay relatively calm recall i can only speak for my personal experiences and how theyve felt to me but i always sense that they just want to make sure i see them and sort of introduce themselves gently perhaps by sprinkling sightings and experiences throughout peoples lives theyre identifying who,YourFriendMaryGrace
can handle their presence and who will be overwhelmed by fear much more polite than the hollywood ufo movie way of just barging in doing what they want and leaving chaos and confusion in their wake lol i wonder what their next steps will be im looking forward to seeing what happens hey i appreciate you taking my perspective into consideration youre a great writer btw i was with you all the way up until the end theres no reason at all to assume this is cause for alarm its beautiful and most people are reporting feeling great today its not my place to tell you how to feel but personally i think fear is not needed or helpful at this time its a measurement of the earths magnetic frequencies so imagine it like a heartbeat chart for the earth youd expect it to have lines going up and down and thats about it all we can say right now is that its entirely unprecedented and beyond what any of us would have thought,YourFriendMaryGrace
possible personally ive been in a funk and woke up today feeling amazing many people are saying similar so anecdotally i think its a great thing thank you so much it is indeed very freeing im headed to the backyard now to paint some more im so sorry that happened to you friend 3 im glad you had the ability to channel all those heavy emotions through music i do the same with my art its therapeutic for sure i hope youre doing better now damn 30 orbs thats a lot its interesting that you guys were with his folks do you remember what their reaction was like that first one is so odd like he was ready to deny it right away lol your second one is similar to an experience i had when i was about 11 years old i was hanging out on some land my parents had just bought i talked to my older brother for a few minutes and then wandered out into a field by myself the last,YourFriendMaryGrace
thing i remember was just spinning and frolicking around having fun then suddenly i woke up lying on the ground i wasnt in any pain i somehow sensed that more time had passed than the 5 or 10 minutes since id seen my brother so i went and found him and asked how long id been gone and he said at least an hour for some reason i felt totally chill about it but didnt want to tell him or my parents i agree it seems like some of us are monitored or something because it seems like people either have zero sightingsexperiences or they have several yes super vivid dreams im so excited right now ive been checking this almost daily for about 5 years and its never ever looked anything remotely close to this im so excited assuming you mean its me thats delusional do you consider all of the air force pilots dept heads of the us and many other countries as well as countless other citizens who report sightings delusional,YourFriendMaryGrace
too how hard is it for you to believe that were not alone in this universe and that our spacetraversing technology might be primitive in comparison to other species to me it seems more likely than not but of course i respect your right to differ eeeesh yeah that would have really freaked me out i wonder what they were doing i always feel like there must be some kind of purpose to them being seen when and where they are considering how they seem to be able to cloakzip away as they please wow that song is powerful so much emotion and intensity im so glad you shared it ive always wished i could be a drummer but i lack the coordination lol heres a video of me painting like a crazy person bc why not always nice to meet a fellow creative soul im sorry he distanced himself from you that sucks i feel like with all the disclosure ramping up folks like him are going to have a hard time adjusting,YourFriendMaryGrace
but eventually they will get used to the idea that were not alone and who knows maybe you can patch things up edit unless of course hes not of this earth himself in which case i have no idea how disclosure might affect him oooo see thats super interesting because it seems like that would indicate that they do a memory wipe of some kind but its faulty or maybe its designed that way idk maybe by setting it so that you only recall it when its a few days later youre able to process the experience without as much panic did you happen to notice any missing time i read a story of a couple that had a similar sighting but there was a few hours missing from their recollection wow im not generally afraid of uap but your particular sighting probably would have freaked me out too its cool that she was able to eventually communicate with you about why she was downplaying it before that must have been a relief for,YourFriendMaryGrace
you on some level lol i truly appreciate the empathy honestly the experience of him suddenly not remembering it was almost as startling as the sighting itself if brett ever forgets pls update me nope i had left my phone on my blanket in the middle of the yard when i went inside to get him the sighting was only about 15 seconds long and happened as soon as we stepped off the back porch but tbh i understand now why so many people dont take videos even when they have a sighting with phone in hand its such a completely overwhelming experience that most people are going to have some kind of amygdala based response lol i can absolutely see how it would activate a freeze response for many people and that primitive survival instinct takes precedence over filming wow thats fascinating thank you quite a few comments in there about people experiencing memory loss after having one of these sightings oh man thats creepy almost sounds like some sort of mind programming,YourFriendMaryGrace
does he just change the subject or go silent until you do ooo would you mind linking me to info on this lol i mean whistleblowers have been known to say the nordics walk among us so who knows either way its curious that he doesnt want to recall or talk about it the cognitive dissonance of not wanting to believe but also seeing proof with their own eyes is very very uncomfortable for some people i guess is it though i was raised christian and it seemed about 5050 on whether or not christians believed aliens could exist ive even heard john 1016 jesus saying i have other sheep that are not of this fold interpreted as possibly referring to beings on other planets not trying to argue just curious what makes you say its unbiblical ohhh thats interesting i guess maybe she remembers then but just tries not to im glad at least your son remembered and can talk about it im curious what your mom will say update me if you,YourFriendMaryGrace
can thats not true at all ive been mediating for years and i agree that the benefits are life changing but ive also done mdma for therapeutic purposes and experienced permanent life changing results from that as well i healed more from my trauma in one day with mdma than i had in years of therapy combined i was able to get off of antidepressants for good when done properly the benefits last a lifetime im so glad its not just me i really wish i knew why this happens if my kids dad was the type to disbelieve or just try and ignore things id assume he blocked it out of his mind on purpose but hes not like that at all hes very open minded and curious i wonder if the aliens themselves would have reason to remove certain peoples memories but if so why would they take his and your wifes memories but not ours id love to hear more of your story if youre interested in sharing im curious what,YourFriendMaryGrace
your wifes reaction was to it at the time and did you two talk about it afterwards do you know about how long after the sighting she seemed to forget thanks for sharing your experience its really cool i have several but heres two of my favorites i left my body by accidentally astral projecting i woke up one morning but laid there with my eyes closed bc i didnt want to get up yet but the fear of oversleeping for work kept me right in that perfect inbetween meditative state so that when i finally decided to sit up i just floated right out of my body towards the ceiling lol i knew what was happening so i tried to get the mechanics right and move intentionally but it was tricky i finally got enough of a hang of it enough to start floating towards one of my paintings to see if i could touch it but then my snooze alarm went off and i floated gently back to my body intriguingly it,YourFriendMaryGrace
seemed to be an alternate timeline or something because it was a different house entirely until i got back into my body but i knew it was my house this one might not count because it was during a past life regression so its more like a memory of leaving my body that i saw in first person it was the 1960s and i was a woman in my 40s very sick in the hospital i was sleeping and all the sudden i was floating above my body i had no spiritual or religious beliefs in this lifetime so i was just floating there like wtf do i do now for what felt like a long time until i finally realized that i had no obligation to stay there with my body then i was a little ball of light and i zipped around the world looking at the eiffel tower and stuff id always wanted to see then i went up to a very heavenly looking place and reunited with my long lost,YourFriendMaryGrace
childhood best friend hes the father of my children in this life and still my best friend wow ive never read a nde quite like this before thank you so much for sharing im glad you came back and wish all the best for you and your loved ones its so crazy to think about right how not only are we blind to other dimensions but we see less than half a percent of the electromagnetic spectrum thats why it makes me a little crazy when people say that aliens fairies or whatever else cant possibly be real to me its like a color blind person refusing to believe the color red could be real thats crazy i cant imagine something like that becoming routine but i guess just about anything does if you do it long enough im so intrigued i wouldnt have guessed this was so common i guess its hard to know but are these likely to be murdered and stashed bodies tell him that youre concerned about him that youve,YourFriendMaryGrace
been noticing him acting differently that you love him and you want to help remind him that you guys are supposed to be together in good times and bad and that you wont think any less of him for having a hard time if hes reluctant to go to therapy on his own offering to go together might help oh sweetheart what youre feeling is completely understandable allow yourself plenty of time to grieve for the relationship and the friendships and the future you hoped to have with them dont feel bad for feeling sad thats just adding shame on top of the sadness let yourself cry and listen to sad songs and whatever else you need to do to get it out but make sure to keep doing things you enjoy too look for opportunities to make new friends by volunteering or joining groups that do activities you like or would like to try things will get better a little at a time hugs im so sorry for all you experienced both the,YourFriendMaryGrace
painful of your dad loss and the complete lack of support from your partner not to mention the cheating thats awful if you can trust a woman on the internet enough to accept some internet hugs then hugs try going to therapy if you can they can help you work through the feelings of guilt and shame and also help you figure out why you did these things in the first place have you ever heard the expression hurt people hurt people its true usually when people cause others pain its because they have some unresolved issues that are causing them to act like they are getting to the bottom of that will be really helpful in forgiving yourself as well as doing better going forward big hugs 3 well wanting to be a better person is the best place to start try to forgive yourself we all make mistakes and have regrets it may be too late to get this person back in your life but you can grow and do better and,YourFriendMaryGrace
be better for the next person yeah ive been the ex in this situation and at a certain point it just starts to feel like just they apologize to get you back into their life so they can hurt you again its possible your ex wont want to hear it no matter what you say but if you really want to say something like i deeply regret the pain i caused you im so sorry for my actions and for the way i made you feel i care about you very much and i hope you are doing well i would focus more on the apology than the gift express your remorse and acknowledge your mistakes without making excuses without knowing what you did its hard to say what you should write specifically but thats a good start its very much okay that you cant be fully supportive of your friends in a genuine way right now it doesnt make you a bad friend at all for now you can go through the motions,YourFriendMaryGrace
by following a simple formula listen empathize and reflect for example im sorry youre going through this at work right now it sounds really frustrating for bonus points you can ask a follow up question and just listen some more most of the time people just need to vent more than anything but dont put pressure on yourself if theyre good friends theyll understand that you cant be at full friend capacity right now sincere condolences for the loss of your sister be patient with yourself and kind to yourself man matthew 6 is jam packed with things most christians try so hard to ignore i guess thats true of most things jesus said though i dont expect anyone to believe me but i saw the leg just the leg of one of these guys walk through my living room about 6 years ago it felt like my heart stopped ive always wondered if it meant to be seen or if it was just a brief interdimensional glitch just because people have it worse,YourFriendMaryGrace
doesnt mean you arent supposed to be sad or upset about things remember that youre still growing and changing your brain wont even be done developing for like 7 more years you do have a lot to look forward to and its not hopeless as for the social anxiety and assuming the worst try and remember that people are busy with their own lives and it isnt a reflection of you i sometimes forget to message people that i love very much for like days lol try and get involved in some new hobbies and learn new things life will get better be kind to yourself my heart hurts for you im so so very sorry i cant imagine the pain you must be feeling please get into therapy as soon as you possibly can you need and deserve the support sending you lots of love and hugs i think its time to tell your mom everything about the phone and waking up to him touching you all of it i know its really,YourFriendMaryGrace
hard and scary and uncertain but the spying alone in so messed up and she needs to know what her husband is doing for her protection and yours he wont stop and he cant keep getting away with it you and your mom arent safe im so sorry that youve had your feelings dismissed and been made to feel like a burden humans are social creatures and its natural to want to belong and feel supported im always here if you want to chat im really sorry i can only imagine how sad and stressful that must be for what its worth this internet stranger is thinking of you and sending you hugs and cozy blankets and chamomile tea first of all happy birthday im sorry youre going through all this thats a huge amount of stress on your father that im sure he is still traumatized by so try not to take his words too personally im sure he loves you very much give it a little more time and hopefully you two,YourFriendMaryGrace

really respect yourself enough to not put up with peoples bullshit youll keep attracting the bullshit people im a 38 year old woman but i very much relate online dating is so messed up you have to try and post the best pics and describe yourself in a cute catchy way and then be witty in texts and it all just feels so forced and fake and yeah people are very flakey i feel like everyone has it in their heads that someone better is just a swipe away so theyre not even trying to get to know anybody in depth also a lot of men get really mad if you arent trying to sleep with them on the first date like scary mad im at the same point as you not giving up but not interested in putting in much effort anymore either i do hope you find someone great tho seconding this learning about my north node sign and house has helped me immensely especially since many of us tend to shy,YourFriendMaryGrace
away from the very things were meant to be working towards could definitely be past lives its also possible to accidentally remote view in a dream in which case they would be strangers and your subconscious just kinda clicked onto their channel i have experienced both and for me viewing past lives feels very personal i know its me whereas remote viewing feels more distant and unfamiliar even though im seeing it from their perspective edit to add just as an example ive seen a lifetime in which i was a little tribal boy even though his life was nothing like my current life everything about it felt so real and relatable and like a memory in remote viewing ive accidentally seen through the perspective of a woman my age with a similar lifestyle yet she felt like a complete stranger maybe he was just glad to see you and the words didnt seem so important as just making sure you knew that he knew you were there 3 im so sorry for your,YourFriendMaryGrace
loss ive seen a life in multiple past life regressions plus a few vivid dreams where i was a catlikehumanoid being on another planet most of my friends were these giant blue lobster looking guys i liked to run fast and climb trees the terrain was not too different from earth but everyone lived in small houses with no hierarchies or government or money just communities this might sound weird but it was so peaceful that it was kind of boring to me personally sometimes so i would periodically go on spaceships to negotiate with other species in other ships that were not as peaceful as us and basically try and persuade them to be nicer to each other lol but when i was on the ships i couldnt run and climb so id get stir crazy and frustrated so it was always kind of a challenge of being under stimulated one way or another stay hydrated and only watchlisten to stuff thats happy and positive itll wear off eventually i promise im so,YourFriendMaryGrace
sorry 3 this is so heartbreaking im so sorry you went to this nightmare i wish i could give you a hug ive had to do a lot of healing work myself and would be happy to chat any time just reach out 3 it really helped me feel better about death i hope it helps you too wishing you all the best im sorry for your loss he was lucky to have someone like you in his life who cared about him are you in contact with his mom at all it might be healing to reach out to her and let her know that youre thinking of her and remember her son fondly i did that for the mom of an old friend of mine who passed and im glad i did i felt weird about it bc he and i hadnt talked for years but she was so grateful also it might be helpful for you to search up stories about peoples near death experiences theres tons of them online and,YourFriendMaryGrace
they are so cool the vast majority of people experience total peace and acceptance im sure your friend did too first of all i want to acknowledge that you have stepped up in this kiddos life and are doing your best to support her i know its not easy try and keep in mind that shes at an incredibly difficult age right now between the hormones and her brain developing and changing rapidly you gotta understand that shes just going to be challenging a lot of the time its not personal and its not even indicative of her true personality i couldnt stand my mom when i was that age and now i adore her lol that combined with the difficulty of having an unhealthy mom is im sure really hard for your stepdaughter theres nothing wrong with her being excited about a new room or wanting to be with her mom even if it isnt at all in her best interests so try not to hold that against her it worries me that,YourFriendMaryGrace
yall decided if she wants to act like an adult she can deal with it like an adult please dont keep her out of the conversation and cause her more pain and frustration just to teach her a lesson she needs support and understanding here shes going to be an adult before you know it and shell remember this time please take breaks and take care of yourself so youre able to handle her teenage years with love care and most of all empathy and make sure youre incorporating plenty positive reinforcement for her efforts at school its far more healthy and uplifting than punishments edited to add a sentence i really think you should get into therapy if you possibly can it sounds like youre holding onto a lot of pain from the relationship understandable and you could use some help sorting it out guilt is helpful if it helps you learn how to be a better person but if its holding you back from being able to live a good life or,YourFriendMaryGrace
feel like you deserve to be happy than thats not helping anyone the world doesnt benefit from you feeling like shit about yourself forever also karma is a tricky thing sometimes it can take years for people to learn from their mistakes some people never do you cant assume shes happy just because shes pretending to be on the internet im glad to hear that its a long road but youll feel better little by little be patient with yourself and again im so sorry for everything youve been through you do deserve to be happy obviously cheating is wrong but so is physical abuse everybody makes mistakes its okay you can learn from this not to stay in an unhealthy relationship especially if theres abuse of any kind and i really doubt theyre as happy as they seem it sounds more like they teamed up to try and hurt you id strongly suggest blocking them both and moving on with your life learn about healthy relationships and how they work so youre better,YourFriendMaryGrace
able to find healthy partners and be a healthy partner thats horrible im so sorry the justice system failed you so badly im proud of you for having the strength to come forward and go through all this are you able to get into therapy you need support to help you heal it takes time but youll get through this 3 feel free to reach out to me anytime i care oh sweetie youre a wonderful sister please know that you did the best you could in the situation and honestly you handled it way better than a lot of adults would your parents need to know your brother needs to be able to get help and support to process and heal from this and your cousin needs to be in jail im so very sorry this happened to you both im glad you posted here the relationship between you and your brother will be okay i promise you that hell be glad you told your parents maybe not right away but soon enough,YourFriendMaryGrace
sending lots of love feel free to message if you want to chat i read your whole post and damn i am so very sorry youve experienced so many tragic losses my heart goes out to you i can understand why youd be afraid to make friends now after so much trauma i think it might be worth trying to find another therapist unfortunately some of them just suck and anyone who would tell you simply get a pet isnt a good fit you need help to unpack and process all of this im so glad the mushrooms were helpful the amazing thing about them is that they actually help you create new neural pathways in your brain so they can help you heal from trauma on a physical level literally rewiring your thought processes have you ever looked into microdosing them it might be worth a try also if youre open to it and can do so safely mdma is incredibly healing when taken in a peaceful environment with the intention to heal,YourFriendMaryGrace
trauma im always here if you want to chat its not trauma dumping to want to express what youre feeling to someone who cares and i care im sorry 3 would talk to your lawyer about it but in most places releasing that type of content without your consent would get him in a lot of trouble i know it sucks but personally i wouldnt bring it up to him like you said it probably would just make him more likely to be manipulative about it hugs going to university right after high school is overrated and a lot of times just a bad idea its not realistic or fair to expect people that young to know what they want to do for the rest of their lives i love your dream of being a florist i suggest finding a job at a florist so you can learn about the business while saving up money when people ask you about what youll be studying you dont have to tell them that you didnt get,YourFriendMaryGrace
accepted just say that youre going to take some time to work and help your family out and remember that you dont have to go to school to study english or literature the internet is an endless resource and you can learn the things that interest you most also im very sorry for the loss of your mom im a mom and i just want to say that youre doing great and im very proud of you 3 wait whats that i eat avocados every day i wanna try it for me it was very vivid imagery it was like watching a movie where you dont know what will happen next but it played out very quickly in a few scenes depending on the lifetime you see you may experience some unpleasant emotions but even those are very helpful for understanding what affects they have on you in this lifetime and you can always stop it at any time well im a mostly white person im horrified by racism and would never defend it,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont hang out with anyone who would i really think you need to get out in the real world a little more and spend less time on the internet friend your perspectives are very skewed and its causing you to live in a really ugly version of reality im not saying that the world is all rainbows and sunshine but theres so much more kindness and compassion than you seem to realize social media is dangerous because it shows you more of what you respond to good or bad for every woman or man on the internet you see doing awful things theres thousands more going through life being loving caring people i was in a relationship with a very narcissistic guy and because i searched up narcissistic men on tiktok suddenly my fyp was full of toxic men doing horrible things it would be easy to start believing all men are like that but i know it simply isnt true youll miss out on all the good things and people in life,YourFriendMaryGrace
if youre focused on the bad if youre happy with being single then theres nothing broken at all society makes romantic relationships seem like the ultimate form of happiness in life but thats simply not true so dont beat yourself up about it do the things that make you happy and focus on your friendships if later on you feel like dating go for it but do it because you want to and not because you feel like youre supposed to im sorry for some reason a lot of people think that its fine to make comments about someones weight as long as theyre skinny and not overweight its weird and its really rude dont be afraid to tell people that you dont want to hear comments about your body or how much youre eating its none of their business im really sorry its hard to lose a connection with someone she definitely should have answered you honestly when you asked if she was in a relationship give yourself time to feel sad about,YourFriendMaryGrace
it and know that little by little you will feel better you deserve to be loved and appreciated and you deserve to be with someone who can be honest with you youll find someone and in the meantime please give yourself a hug from me 3 youre so welcome love you deserve all the kindness and support you can get i know what you mean about not being able to bring yourself to say the words out loud i was 27 before i finally told someone but the minute i finally said it out loud to someone i felt enormous relief i know it can feel like youre the only person in the world whos been through this but sadly its not uncommon at all therapists are there to help and they are trained to help with this exact situation including the feelings of shame and guilt which are also very common im here for you anytime you want to talk 3 thats really cool you were able to lucid dream a little bit,YourFriendMaryGrace
ive only managed it twice and both times i woke up as soon as i realized lol auntyflo is probably my favorite it has a massive amount of dream interpretations and usually has a few possible meanings for each one depending on context it sounds like you have a lot of conditioning and ideas about what men should be like that are confusing you you are you and you are a unique person with lots to offer id suggest putting down the porn and the romance books for a while both are complete fiction and not at all a realistic idea of what it is to be in a relationship women are diverse and they are looking for different things so try not to get caught up in the idea that all women want this or that one womans fantasy is another womans nightmare lol i know it sounds cliche but try to just focus on learning who you are apart from all these other peoples opinions the more you learn to be who,YourFriendMaryGrace
you are the more youll find people who appreciate you i am so very sorry this happened to you my heart hurts for you the only responsibility that man had was to protect you and he did the opposite it was never your fault and you were never to blame even if you straight up asked him to it would still be entirely and completely his fault have you been able to get into therapy sending you lots of love i promise you even the people who seem like they never have to question themselves or how they fit in still do i worked with celebrities for years and you would be amazed at how many of those people were cripplingly insecure no matter how rich famous beautiful straight whatever you are real happiness only comes from within selfacceptance is a journey and for me it didnt come until my early 30s after lots of therapy including some alternative therapy also you mentioned not feeling like you fit in with the current queer culture,YourFriendMaryGrace
please know thats totally okay theres something painful but beautiful about not quite fitting in anywhere it means you have something special to offer to the world and if you try to fit perfectly into a little box youll never shine the way youre meant to theres a whole lot of philosophies and religions that are based on these ideas so i dont know of one particular name to give you but you might enjoy checking out rreincarnation and rpastlives theres discussions and tons of amazing stories past life regression meditation is where you go into a meditative state and with the help of a hypnotist irl or on the video you are able to look at a life youve lived before it doesnt always work so dont get discouraged ive probably done it at least a dozen times but ive only seen 4 lives heres a good one but theres lots more if that one doesnt work for you also if youre on tiktok i highly recommend searching christian deconstructing theres a huge,YourFriendMaryGrace
community of people who are going through the same process you are and its very encouraging i understand its a process and its not always linear im proud of you for working on your healing its not easy and you are strong im sorry this is happening to you dreams are your subconscious minds way of trying to make you face what youre feeling in real life unfortunately it does this by writing crazy scripts packed with metaphors since you often dream about being trapped id imagine you are feeling trapped in some way in your real life you can google any detail of your dreams and the meaning and find lots of possible interpretations but feel free to message me if you like i was raised christian and now i believe exactly what you described i did some past life regression meditations on youtube that totally changed my perspective if you scroll down through my old posts i wrote about it in one called i feel like i was healed of some inherited,YourFriendMaryGrace
trauma while meditating where i described one of my experiences that one left me unable to believe in a god that would send people to hell ever again i know how hard it is to leave religion especially when youve been in it your whole life and your friends and family are in it too but remember that you and only you get to decide what you believe and you dont even have to decide give yourself time and space to just be open minded and curious and explore and let your heart guide you wow thats actually pretty special i study dreams and my advice would be to try and work with them as soon as you open your eyes in the morning write down or type in your phone every detail of the dreams that you can remember you can learn a lot about what your subconscious mind is trying to tell you by googling the meaning behind various aspects of your dreams for example people who are in a stressful out,YourFriendMaryGrace
of control situation in life often dream of being in a speeding car they cant properly drive or with brakes that dont work but meanings aside just the act of starting the day by writing out your dreams will help you create a clearer distinction between waking and dreaming time and side note theres a lot of fun things you can do with dreams like lucid dreaming and astral projection that might be easier for you than most im so sorry this happened to you and so sorry that the adults who should have protected you failed to do so you deserved better if you havent already going to therapy could really really help sa affects us in ways that arent always obvious but you can work through it i promise hahaha this johnny cash guy is gonna make a name for himself someday i can feel it i love that did anything in particular prompt you to start coming up with it a most delicious discovery i remember having a sore throat when,YourFriendMaryGrace
i was little and noticing how good it felt to breathe the steam coming from the dishwasher i definitely thought i was going to be famous for discovering that steam relieves sore throats its hard to explain to anyone who hasnt experienced it a massive something flew over my car silently late at night on my 30th birthday my husband and i were freaking out and staring in disbelief and it did occur to me to get my phone out but i just didnt i couldnt stop staring and i didnt want to miss anything i get why people who havent seen anything like that would think that it would be second nature to whip out the phone but it just felt like a very low priority to me in that moment for some reason i would be very tempted to accidentally not make it to the bathroom every time i needed to vomit for the rest of the shift the only thing that would stop me is knowing someone who is also underpaid,YourFriendMaryGrace
would have to clean it up if yall arent in contact i think it would be best to keep it that way i agree with you perhaps i should have worded it differently and said that she should be with someone who loves her as she is you should be doing what makes you feel good and he should love you as you are its weird that hes mad about this if he likes seeing you dressed up thats cool but he should give you a chance to get dressed up for something that makes sense like a nice dinner not football lol im sorry you are capable of having a healthy happy relationship even if it didnt work out for your mom she probably means well but shes misguided in thinking that all marriages end horribly lol you have to live your own life and make the choices that are right for you run no amount of beauty is worth being physically abused and manipulated over shell only get worse i promise you,YourFriendMaryGrace
youll be 10x happier with someone who is sane loving and would never dream of hurting you on purpose i dont feel like its that simple for this long of a relationship it kinda is though whether youve been together for a month or a decade the fact that his family does not support your relationship and not only excludes you but actively tries to replace you is a huge problem clearly hes not able to make them cut it out completely and respect your relationship together hes trying to toe the line between pleasing you and them but thats not possible because theyre opposed to you being around at all i know its hard but please consider if this is what you want for your future because they wont change and it will be a continual source of tension and hurt can you please give some examples of him needling poking the bear its hard to get a read on the situation without more context if you feel yourself getting angry do you,YourFriendMaryGrace
walk away from the conversation to cool off yes that is very manipulative for sure thats emotional abuse on top of the physical abuse im very glad you got away from him now you know to walk away at the first sign of someone not respecting your boundaries because if theyll do it once theyll do it again worse and worse big hugs to you im proud of you for getting away and learning from it im so sorry this happened to you im concerned that you feel bad about threatening to punch him in that scenario please know that if youre ever in that situation again you need to do what you need to do to get away punch him in the face balls whatever you can your friend is the one whos fake af if shes taking his side keep them and people like them out of your life thats really sad for her im so glad shes in therapy her innocence was taken away at a very young age due to,YourFriendMaryGrace
that exposure and she needs support be a listening ear empathize with her and be supportive of her going to therapy and working through the trauma healing is very much possible and it sounds like shes doing what she can youre allowed to feel how you feel porn is highly addictive and he may have a problem if thats a deal breaker for you thats completely fine and nothing you should feel bad about talk to him about it and see how he responds dont feel bad about how you feel or try and pretend to be cool with it if youre not yeah and im sure that was difficult to deal with since youre only trying to help try and keep in mind that ed is a form of addiction so just like with any addict when they feel like their addiction is being threatened they will lash out even at the people who are trying to help its tough and my heart goes out to you personally the mundane daily life stuff,YourFriendMaryGrace
from the ancient past is the most interesting to me im not that interested in battles or notable events but i love looking at ancient hair and makeup products restaurants home decor etc it sounds like he felt cornered and accused next time try and use more empathetic language like i love the both of you very much and your health and well being is important to me please know that if you ever need support with your ed or anything else now or in the future id like to help they are adults and they have to make their own decisions so theres only so much you can do im sorry oh my usqitten has given you some solid advice that i agree with please take it to heart the next step with people like her is usually gaslighting making you feel confused and crazy for having a problem with her behavior so please try to keep a clear head and get some outside support as soon as possible that scares me so,YourFriendMaryGrace
much to know that people are being actively shamed for showing empathy empathy is like the 1 ingredient to a healthy society lack of empathy indicates a seriously emotionally unintelligent person if that becomes the ideal were screwed whaaa familiarize yourself with darvo deny attack reverse victim and offender thats what shes doing theres nothing misogynistic about standing up for yourself and not wanting to be called names does she do this with issues you try to address i am so very sorry that you lost your brother and father thats an enormous trauma and its very understandable that its affecting your relationships are you in therapy i think you touched on something very important when you said its the same thing i say to myself most of the time we can only give to others the amount of love and empathy that we give to ourselves if youre telling yourself that you shouldnt complain about little problems you wont be able to empathize with others problems either pain comes in all shapes and,YourFriendMaryGrace
sizes youre allowed to feel upset about things even if they seem small compared to the tragedy youve experienced and other people are too try and find compassion for yourself and it will get easier to show compassion to your friends please give yourself a hug from me and feel free to reach out any time i care im afraid that cant be your problem he has to want to change make solid efforts to do so and find support along the way as it stands youre enabling him which is the last thing he needs i dont want to sound harsh because i know youre confused and caught up in all this but you have to kick him out and let him hit rock bottom out of your sight for your own sake and his coming back to add congrats on getting sober and pulling your life together again that takes enormous strength and im proud of you now boot him lol oh my bad im not sure why i thought it was,YourFriendMaryGrace
it sounds like she might not even be aware of why shes getting triggered but even if she is aware the fact that she wont communicate her issue is all the more reason to try and not let it affect you too much at any age but at your age especially relationships are about learning and growing and getting to know yourself better dont let her weirdness throw you off and make you overthink something thats making you happy thats odd i wonder if deep down shes feeling sadweird about the fact that youre in your first relationship and just trying to slow it down for her own comfort at 4 months its perfectly normal to talk every day you could try asking her if shes got any concerns but at the end of the day only you can decide whats best for you in this relationship i hope op sees this i feel so bad for him well regardless shes definitely into you and i think you should ask her to hang out,YourFriendMaryGrace
sometime absolutely do not keep him around kick him out change the locks and never speak to him again he ruined your life once and hell do it again narcissistic people almost always have an addiction of some kind and they will bleed you dry of your time energy and money for as long as you let them who cares that hes attractive i promise you youd be a billion times better off with a healthy happy partner who is less attractive than this mess of a person do not fool yourself into thinking you can help him or that youre his best chance to selfimprovement narcissists love it when you think youre the super special person that can save them because it incentives you to keep trying hes not going to change no matter what you do it sounds like its way too early for either of you to really know how you feel besides that you like each other and want to see where it goes so im not sure what your,YourFriendMaryGrace
question is from what youve shared here shes 100 into you she was probably hoping for more than just what when she said shed kiss you so she took it back if shes shy then youre probably gonna have to make the next move aww man my heart goes out to you friend i can tell that you take things very seriously when it comes to how you behave and treat others you are not a horrible person by any means your intentions were misguided but honorable i think you already know this but your definition of love is very skewed love is not about putting your own needs and feelings aside and suffering in silence not at all in fact you can only love others to the degree that you love yourself i gather that it might be challenging for you as you tend to intellectualize more than you feel but try to really offer yourself as much love and respect and forgiveness as you can throughout all this youve already been selfharming,YourFriendMaryGrace
by way of ignoring your own needs dont double down on it by shaming yourself for the fallout if you can get into therapy i think it would be really helpful and definitely try reading some books on healthy relationships so you have a better understanding about what it means to be a good partner youre welcome i hope the conversation goes well aww man im glad youre at least a little more comfortable but still that sucks dont let the fact that your mom is paying for everything keep you from being upfront about your needs and having a bed is a pretty basic need if she really cares about you having a nice time thats the least she can do and congrats on the wedding i am so sorry youre going through this i dont know of course but its possible he could have attachment issues read up on avoidant attachment specifically but regardless of the reason which you may never know for sure allow yourself plenty of time to grieve the,YourFriendMaryGrace
loss of what you had and what you hoped you could have together youre in the hardest part right now and it will get easier i promise i went through something similar and had to learn the hard way to pace myself in relationships because it really does take time to learn how another person operates on a deep level i think that as you heal and grow from this it will get easier to vet future partners and give yourself some time to feel it out before falling too deep there are people out there who will love you just as deeply as you love them i promise another thought if you are able to you could go ahead and go find a couch or something in the house and that will kickstart the conversation in the morning when she finds you no longer on the boat oh my you have every right to be annoyed youre the one being celebrated you shouldnt be sleeping on the floor lol im sorry babe it,YourFriendMaryGrace
sounds like its too late to switch it up tonight but in the morning i would tell her that you were really uncomfortable and will need an actual bed for the remainder of the trip if you think she might be argumentative or weird about it then bring it up in the group so that others can help you figure something out definitely bring it up if its bothering you theres a whole range of possibilities he could just be feeling a little down and its affecting his communication style he could have avoidant attachment issues and you guys getting closer triggered him etc try to open up communication and see what he says if you cant get a straight answer from him or he says nothings wrong but then continues to be distant its probably time to walk away good luck that makes my day thank you love ahhhh thank you so much ive been thinking of it like a portal so looking at it through your eyes as a sun or moon,YourFriendMaryGrace
adds a whole new perspective and i love it uartisticnoob both those comparisons are making my day thank you guys that means so much to me thank you love this gorgeous love the title too thank you so much thank you so much heres a video showing a bit of my process i love your style thank you love the background colors oops meant to write 4ft tall cardboard not 5ft anyway heres a video of my process yes i use brushes occasionally but i find that painting with my hands really helps me loosen up and stop overthinking everything im glad it found you and you replied its really nice to know its not just me i have an aries stellium too lol we neeeeed the excitement i have an aries mars so i act like i have no sense whatsoever oh my goodness this made me cry so much wow wow wow i am so proud of you and happy for you and thankful to hear that youre doing so well 3,YourFriendMaryGrace
you have unbelievable strength and power to have made it through everything youve been through i knew you could do it 3 thank you so much for this message it means the world to know that it helped you im always in your corner and here for you any time i have a capricorn moon so i feel bad for myself that i dont know how to feel well that was way too accurate no problem good luck to both of you guys absolutely just the fact that you already kinda talked about it even if it was just joking really helps my ex and i would joke about staying friends no matter what too and we have you might need some time to adjust and reset as individuals but just continue to be respectful and supportive of each other and youll be good i love this so so much oh my goodness im so very sorry you went through that especially so many times its a heartbreak i wouldnt wish on my worst,YourFriendMaryGrace
enemy and yes we do need much better resources for helping people cope and less stigma around talking about it because its so common but so rarely discussed i mean yes of course thats a bizarre and disturbing thing to do but people dealing with extreme traumatragedy dont always react in logical or appropriate ways i had a miscarriage at 12 weeks and the grief of that alone made me kinda crazy for a while not to mention after childbirth theres a massive hormonal change and a bunch of other stuff thats challenging even when you have a healthy baby idk i just think its way too simplistic to write it off as simply wanting attention or caring about getting likes too much or whatever and i feel bad for her to go through all that and then be dragged down further bc she coped in a really weird way oh i love these the meat one is so gross but so relatable lol something about being slightly high gets me super in touch,YourFriendMaryGrace
with my intuition sometimes i end up doing what seems like completely random shit but then i end up understanding the reason why i felt compelled to do it after the fact nothing as crazy as that though usually just stuff like feeling the need to reach out to a friend and it turns out they just got bad news or something whoa thats pretty cool did it seem unusually big to you at the time or only in retrospect after that nap like did it go from normal to big and then back to normal or just normal and then way smaller i dont know if that makes sense but i tried id love to hear some of your experiences if you feel like sharing i wish i had for some reason i had the feeling like i shouldnt go in there im not sure if it was actually a bad idea or just a fear of the unknown but i couldnt bring myself to crawl in and then it was gone this,YourFriendMaryGrace
is my favorite one and i totally believe you i think kids have an ability to peer into dimensions that for whatever reason get harder to see as adults my story isnt as cool as yours but when i was a kid i looked into a pile of pillows that were kind of stacked together in a tunnel shape but somehow the tunnel went on and on like hundreds of times longer than the pillows themselves i walked away and walked back to look again and it was just back to being a normal stack of pillows yes or like we want to be their new bff when actually were just being genuinely friendly but not like we want to be like friend friends thats the only downside of the placement imo accidentally leading people on just curious do you feel like that in real life trying to figure out the best direction to take and keep ending up in the wrong places i would say that the guilt and shame of killing the,YourFriendMaryGrace
dog probably factored into the situation a lot but regardless please do not think that all women are like this i have spent the last 3 years trying to help my boyfriend open up cry rage whatever he needs to process his feelings every bit of progress hes made has been so incredibly rewarding and brought us closer together the only way id weed him out as a mate is if he stopped working on expressing his feelings and started trying to be all stoic again as a partner its exhausting and isolating always having to wonder what your mate is really feeling if you end up with another person who cant handle seeing you cry weed her out and dont look back you do not deserve that sexist bullshit im sure theres a lot of additional factors like that but from what i understand the tradition stems from the days where talking about womens problems like periods menopause etc were taboo and so miscarriage was supposed to be kept quiet but if someone,YourFriendMaryGrace
wants to tell their friends and family early on its easy enough to say that its still early and they should wait a few months before making any purchases i actually wish the whole dont tell anyone too early notion would go away too losing your pregnancy even if you have only been pregnant for a few weeks can be so incredibly sad and if you havent told anyone then youre either alone in that pain or having to tell people that you need support from that you were pregnant and now youre not of course some people would rather be alone in that process regardless and if thats how they feel theres nothing wrong at all with keeping it quiet i just wish there wasnt a stigma around announcing too early it kind of creates a social isolation around anyone grieving before that 12 week mark it makes me glad to see someone else talking about the just world fallacy i used to post about it online like a reverse evangelist all the,YourFriendMaryGrace
time bc i think its so important for people to understand that this way of thinking is prevalent and insidious even nonreligious people do it without realizing it either to avoid having to empathize or to make themselves feel like if they just do everything right theyll be safe im curious about the microdose my life has been changed in other ways due to a standard amount of it on separate 3 occasions over 2 years was it a one time thing and did you go into it with the intention of facing your addictions edit also congrats on your accomplishment really encouraging to hear your progress i have a theory that the rest of your chart plays into what kind of connections youll enjoy which is a little too complicated for an app to take into consideration for example my venus is in aries so i kinda like it when things are exciting aka complicated lol so for me a delicate or complex bond is stimulating and fun but an extraordinary or powerful,YourFriendMaryGrace
bond can be boring like its too easy what did the tire look like ahh same here i guess its been about 2 or 3 weeks for me that ive obsessing over my jaw muscles bc something just felt off i kept trying different massage techniques to make it feel normal again this is really interesting did you feel it when our ribs changed you sound like a really good person your mama is lucky to have you thats beautiful it seems like most souls tend to reincarnate within the same family i bet hes been really looking forward to seeing you guys again first of all im very sorry for your loss thats really cool about the dream and i firmly believe that the women in a family line are super tuned in to the energy of new babies when i was pregnant with my kids i didnt want to know the gender until they were born but me my mom and my grandmother were completely positive i was having a girl and,YourFriendMaryGrace
i was same thing with my next baby we knew it was a boy and he was pluto heres a pic of my chart feel free to ask any questions i have those two in my second house i tend to have a lot of money or none lol how did it work out if you dont mind sharing this hurt my heart to read i love people who dress however makes them happy and i hate to think of her being made to feel bad about her awesome quirky self thank you so much 3 im okay im thankful that my dogs life was so full and happy and that she had such a peaceful ending and there are positives to being single and not having an elderly dog to tend to any more such as being more free and independent traveling etc so its really hard to cope with all at once but im trying to think of it as a new chapter with gratitude in my 9th house on the night,YourFriendMaryGrace
of the lunar eclipse i told my boyfriend for the billionth time that we needed to start doing some very things differently because i just wasnt happy in our relationship and he said hed work on it but he didnt so on june 8th i broke things off then later that night my sweet little dogs health took a serious turn for the worse and i had to put her down on the morning of the eclipse ive had her with me for 14 years she was a gemini sun and sagittarius moon im heartbroken its amazing you were able to recognize the pain you were causing and turn it around especially after everything you went through yourself just commenting to say im proud of you and dont give up on your brother closest in age it may take time but if hes able to heal on his own he may come around to the idea of a closer relationship with you happy birthday thats a good life skill to have did you get,YourFriendMaryGrace
to play with them so it was entrapment what a bastard aww thats a good one my little boy is 4 years old now and i always wonder what random stuff hell remember lol and of all the beverages you could have chosen to spit out you went with the one most likely to stain the carpet aww those early childhood accomplishments are the best how did that turn out i have a vivid memory of standing in my cousins yard staring at a tree im not a christian but uanotherreaderofstuff is right the bible does say that although its in matthew not revelation start on verse 34 of jesus sermon in matthew 25 hes saying that if you didnt take care of the poor imprisoned etc while you were on earth you dont get a spot in heaven wow thats really cool would you mind sharing what sort of meaningless thoughts and views you saw yourself having as a teen i feel like i waste a lot of energy on meaningless thoughts now,YourFriendMaryGrace
as an adult but im trying to improve thanks for sharing i hope the despair goes away completely soon and that you find more and more warmth and happiness in your life yeah its a different song but its a similar vibe to the beach boys so im thinking op might have just misremembered slightly are you thinking of this one thats a real gift i have it too with some close friends for example once i started spontaneously crying while i was in the shower and i had no idea why i wasnt even sad but my friends name came to mind immediately after so i texted him and sure enough hed just had a heartbreaking thing happen to him i think its possible our brains are silently communicating with each other in ways we cant observe with current technology and some may just have stronger communication links than others whatever it is im glad you guys found each other thank you you should give it a go theres some great ones on,YourFriendMaryGrace
youtube you could try people seem to have a lot of success with this one i totally get being wary but it seems like the subconscious has a mechanism of sorts that will only allow you to see what you can handle i tried many times before i saw anything and when i finally did i understood why i hadnt been able to see it before i actually participated in a thread about this recently if youre interested it seems to be a somewhat common experience its its complicated lol but i love him very much when i saw him in the glass thing i looked at him for a long time and then i understood that hed be hurting a lot in this life then i understood a second thing that made me agree to him being my dad unfortunately i dont remember at all what that second thing was but i assume its something that im not supposed to remember just learn over time oh wow ill have to check it out,YourFriendMaryGrace
thank you for telling me i did a past life regression once where i saw myself choosing my parents i was sat in front of a giant clear glass with a gold frame that had pictures of all the options and i could kind of flip through them like turning pages in a book but with my mind i was flipping through them thinking nope nope nope because i felt nothing when i looked at the couple until i got to my parents and i totally freaked out with excitement because i recognized my moms soul from having what felt like thousands of happy lifetimes together i said she could be my mom yes yes yes and then i looked at my dad and didnt recognize him at all but understood they were a package deal theres more details but yeah it was very interesting oh interesting my little boy always called water by what sounded like whoa im curious now if that sound matches the word for water in another language oh wow,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love this thank you for sharing theoretically though if a conscious or soul if you prefer doesnt need a living brain and body to operate from then one could exist in a plant animal maybe even a drop of rain or just floating in space 22 is an incredibly powerful number in numerology its considered by many to be the most powerful master number really cool that you have a significant astrological event on that date i cant tell you what to expect but i wish you the best adderall starts trying to make the bed while youre still in it youre awesome thank you for saying that i sure want to be a good mother she deserves it re my big 3 yes i absolutely feel pulled in many directions a lot today my pisces sun just wants to meditate feel my feelings read tarot cards and sit with my crystals while my libra rising wants to shop for new nail polish and hang out with my boyfriend meanwhile my cap moon,YourFriendMaryGrace
is telling me that all of the above is a luxury and i shouldnt indulge until my house is spotless and ive researched some investments bless you this is all so helpful and encouraging and helps me understand whats going on in her brilliant little head going from distraught to cracking jokes is sooo her its nice to know that isnt unusual and i absolutely love the idea of turning the process of talking about her feelings into a game itself i think shed really enjoy that and it would help create a more positive association with emotional processing bc right now i think she wants to but then feels like it is too boring lol shes a great reader but shes not writing fast enough yet to keep up with all she wants to say so maybe i can create another little game for that where she can tell me what shes thinking and i write it down for her im a pisces sun capricorn moon and libra rising my only gemini placement,YourFriendMaryGrace
is my chiron but i do have my moon and neptune in the third house look up attachment styles and specifically anxious attachment i have this and its a struggle but being aware of it is hugely helpful this is such lovely and helpful advice i cant thank you enough definitely sounds like my little fairy she even says no one understands me sometimes which makes my heart ache i have another question if you dont mind a lot of times when shes feeling things deeply and lashing out i take her to a private place and give her space to talk about what shes feeling she often says that first she wants to play some word games like coming up with a word for each letter of the alphabet sooo gemini and i do but then it can be almost impossible to get her to actually start talking about her feelings shell just keep suggesting other games i guess what im trying to figure out is if playing games is actually helping her,YourFriendMaryGrace
or is she just avoiding processing her feelings my 6 year old daughter has the same big 3 as you if you have any parenting advice pls share my lifetime before this one i was human in terms of how i felt like my sense of individuality and my emotions but i looked more like a cheetah or leopard on two legs i could run and climb really really fast the planet i lived on was completely peaceful so much so that i found it almost boring i spent most of my time on a small space craft doing missions with my friends who were giant blue lobster looking guys we all communicated telepathically i remember more details about my job than anything else unfortunately i dont remember anything about my childhood and i dont remember there being anything like what we would call a couple or a family so i wonder how babies were even made there wish i could remember more maybe someday yeah those memories were rough they were so much,YourFriendMaryGrace
worse than i would have guessed as for who he is in this life the tv show is still on the air and hes still on it so i have some idea of what hes like in this lifetime it seems like hes still got some anger issues but hes come a loooooong way thats for sure i havent tried to contact him im afraid id just sound like a deranged fan lol but im okay with not meeting him in this life i feel like we reincarnate with the people who were meant to learn from in each life so if theres anything to be gained by us meeting itll happen on its own and its a pleasure talking with you too thank you for sharing your story i was in high school when 911 happened and it was all so shocking and tragic its oddly comforting to think of the victims living new lives and the things that happened to them being a distant memory but im so very sorry that happened,YourFriendMaryGrace
to you and i hope you get the answers you seek not the person youre responding to but ive had experience with not being ready to remember certain things years ago i used to watch this tv show with a clist celebrity that isnt very interesting on his own but watching him made me feel deeply angry but also kind of aroused im not someone who easily forms emotional attachments to celebrities so this was really confusing bc the feelings were just so irrationally strong i did at least half a dozen past life regressions and never saw anything about him then years later after i had done a lot of work on personal stuff that was affecting me in this life a flood of memories came back while i was meditating that pretty much answered all my questions i wont get into the details but basically he was my uncle in a past life and he was horrible to me but i had a stockholm syndrome type of affection for him nonetheless i,YourFriendMaryGrace
saw the horrific things he did to me and yeah i was definitely not ready to see that back when i first started trying the reasons youre not able to see it might be different but like uredseaaquamarine said youll see it when youre ready and itll probably make sense to you then why you couldnt see it before aries scorpio leo im up for almost anything but prefer that it be exciting or novel in some way i feel a little awkward being romantic in the traditional sense so flowers chocolate etc is definitely not a requirement this is great advice thank you so much thank you aries wow thats interesting i found myself reflecting on some events that i experienced in feb 2018 just this morning do you happen to have any more info my son is a scorpio sun and rising leo moon hes only 4 years old though any advice you may have for me as a parent would be appreciated how long do you cook for im close pisces,YourFriendMaryGrace
sun cap moon and libra rising im your slightly more approachable sibling not that it matters but what the hell is the context of that like whos children immigrants liberals just random kids no problem this one from 2016 is good because it recaps the historic events that followed previous similar conjunctions like the ones had last year it depends on what youre looking at studying theres different areas of focus like personal astrology your ownsomeone elses birth chart synastry how two peoples charts interact with each other which is used for relationships mundane astrology is used to predict events and tbh im not educated enough on the methods to help with a recommendation i usually look at similar themes in my real life housesapts often represent the dreamers own mind so in this case it might be about wanting to make some changes in yourself but feeling like youre going from bad to worse mentally just an example but hopefully helps theres a lot of old like years old astrology articles saying that,YourFriendMaryGrace
2020 would be a globally historic shitshow we had a whole lot of these types of conjunctions over the past year and were not done the newspaper style horoscopes and stuff are definitely bs but actual astrology the type that is ancient and takes years to learn is really very interesting i really like em i think the piscescap combo balance each other out nicely and the libra rising gives me a nice approachable vibe libra rising yayyy how do you feel about the combo hey were almost twins i have libra rising i couldnt get into the clinical trials so i did a kind of diy version on my own but heres a good rundown on how they do it i had a friend sit with me and im so thankful id love to pay it forward so if you need someone to sit with you id be very glad to help via zoom or something i still struggle at times with intimacy but ive come a loooong way regular therapy helped a,YourFriendMaryGrace
lot as well as using mdma aka molly in a therapeutic setting i can go into more details about that if youre interested for me the biggest hurdle was admitting to myself that i needed help processing it and healing thats so awful and so fucked up of your friends to respond that way im so sorry theres nothing lucky about having your bodily autonomy violated no matter what the violator looks like to suggest otherwise is a gross ignorant lack of empathy and understanding it took me 13 years to tell anyone what happened to me because i was so afraid of not being believed so my heart really really goes out to you knowing how much not being believed just adds to the trauma of it all i believe you and im so sorry that happened to you please dont think that because you didnt force her off that you are to blame in any way response to trauma is automatic and we dont really get to consciously choose between fight flight,YourFriendMaryGrace
and freeze i froze when i was coerced into sexual abuse as a teen and for a long time i felt shame about it but i shouldnt and neither should you could be a past life memory i have a few questions that would help with interpretation whos house is it are you in the same house every time or does it change what about the locations are you in the living room basement etc are there any patterns in which part of the house the attackers come through where is your glowworm now seems like theres quite a few of us i hope its symbolic like of an era in a spiritual sense also funny sync that you responded to me just now bc i was literally just thinking about you you wrote me some very kind encouraging words during a rough patch a few years ago and im forever thankful weird my boyfriend and i both had vivid dreams last night in his dream he lost his job and his house burned,YourFriendMaryGrace
down in my dream my house was being torn apart an apocalyptic storm and my son was terribly injured theyre in the very late degrees of capricorn right now and by the 21st of this month theyll be in aquarius what are you listening to same here i miss being able to look at the houses im sorry when you say everybody else who do you mean hey congrats i got off mine about 3 years ago and im so glad i did i learned that the meds were putting a damper on my positive feels too not just the negative ones so while i might have some moments once in a while of feeling much sadder than i would on meds i also get to experience a lot more excitement love happiness etc every day btw i highly recommend taking st johns wort herbal supplements if you can theyre cheap otc nonaddictive and as effective as some ssris at curbing depression anyway whats a song youve listened to lately whats the weirdest food,YourFriendMaryGrace
order youve ever gotten well the fact you skate tells me that you arent too lazy to move your body you know how to get back up when you fall and you like to learn new things keep it up you can apply the same energy to other things now and in the future well maybe you just havent found out what makes you feel alive yet school is great but its not everything and failing definitely doesnt make you a loser what do you do when youre not being productive what makes you think youre a loser i see i dont know if it will require a harness or not then but maybe is that something that youre worried about gah thats messed up i wonder if theres any kind of loans for stuff like this that would have lower payments im uninsured right now and thankfully my health is good but yeah its scary how fast medical debt can pile up here in the states and youre welcome im always here if,YourFriendMaryGrace
you want to chat or vent or just need some encouragement youll see the other side of this someday and in the meantime be kind to yourself im so sorry for everything youre going through thats a lot why do you have to come up with the money in just two days im sorry this happened to you thats awful you deserve better people in your life and i hope you find them im not sure theres different types of buses but usually they dont have harnesses i relate to this i was raised in an uberconservative environment i literally only knew of two people in my hometown who were openly liberal lol and it wasnt until my midtwenties that i felt safe expressing just how different my views are now if i can offer some advice when you do start talking about it be as calm and as humble as you can im amazed how open minded people can be when they dont feel like they have to defend themselves using phrases like,YourFriendMaryGrace
i was surprised to learn or something ive been thinking about lately really helps i think it will also help a lot that you are interested in doing things differently and what you would like to see in a new political party the whole democrats vs republicans thing is so toxic and it gets people all worked up but by approaching it from a neutral perspective and making it about new ideas you can really help people open their mind even if they dont admit it to you are you trying to decide whether you want to try it lol i get that what part of history are you learning about rn i hope you enjoy the new program im sure it will be a cool and safe experience do the people around you know that you no longer agree with those views or are you keeping it quiet for now if they know how did they respond whats one thing youd change about your life right now if you could im afraid have,YourFriendMaryGrace
massively different perspectives on this my friend i can see how you feel im being obtuse because you seem obtuse from my perspective but were not were just on very different pages and thats okay you are fully entitled to your perspective and i wish you well they could share that wealth to an enormously powerful beneficial extent if they chose to but they choose not to if youre a part of my company supply chain whatever and you help me earn 20 dollars and then i keep 1999 for myself and gift you with a penny i have generated wealth for you doesnt mean i am a great person doing great things for you im a selfish dick capitalizing off your work and reaping the benefits they are not generating immense wealth for anybody but themselves and their shareholders instead of murdering a dozen or so people serial killer style they are in possession of millions of wage slaves who must grind away for decades just to hopefully have food shelter and healthcare,YourFriendMaryGrace
that is not productive use in my book not at all of course and btw i think the story of your friend giving you the crystal is so cool those spiritually intuitive kinda friends are a blessing i dont think its idiotic at all i think its really cool that theyll share those placements and i bet they will have a lot of understanding for each other as they grow up i was curious too so i found this tldr he said he wanted to save the government money by hiring his own security team as others have already mentioned thats not a good astrology app but in addition i think they have some kind of listening capability builtin because their do and dont keywords have been way too accurate for me more than once when i was redecorating my front porch i got front porch as a do for the day another time i was asking my boyfriend if we had any parchment paper and parchment was one of my dos the next,YourFriendMaryGrace
day thats not astrology thats spying lol i have the same theory the whole jesus as messiah storyline is remarkably similar to much older mythological origin stories including the virgin birth and coming back from the dead and its paul who flipped all the stuff jesus said about helping the poor on its head and said instead if a man doesnt work he shouldnt eat actually paul flipped just about everything jesus said around and christians believe what paul says jesus uh meant to say far more than they believe what jesus actually said christianity is 100 a religion of paul jesus the man would have wanted nothing to do with it taxpayers are already footing the bill for their being arrested sentenced jailed on probation etc treating it as an addiction rather than a crime might very well end up being cheaper and actually help people but we will see agree withu2muckingfuch that this will serve as a good test run either way i like you youre smart i think the democratic party,YourFriendMaryGrace
has utterly failed to address the most important issues facing americans and frankly im not convinced those at the top level care one bit except for bernie of course theyd rather go hog wild combatting fringe issues and demonizing anybody who supports trump than look at themselves critically in 2016 i wrote a mildly critical comment about hillary on a liberal site and got nasty hateful messages for weeks and i even said in my comment that i do not at all support trump theres this selfrighteous fuck everybody who disagrees attitude among democrats that is gonna be the death of them if they dont change im like you still figuring out my politics but socialism seems to be the best way forward for us imo but like uapi is saying we have to start by putting up a candidate who will earnestly address the very legitimate concerns of the american heartland and stop being so damn unwelcoming to anyone who isnt already on our side at the end of the day humans just,YourFriendMaryGrace
want to feel like theyre safe and cared for trump obviously makes people feel that way and while i dont understand why i do understand how the left makes them feel unsafe and unwelcome definitely look into wing chun according to legend it was created by a woman which is pretty cool im a small person as well and i dont like violence so the approach of training primarily to disableescape from attackers appealed to me i wish more people understood this i really hope youre right my friend conservatives say its all soros liberals say its all koch bros andor putin i think the truth is probably all of the above and much more were merely puppets on the string of the super wealthy being manipulated into turning on each other so we dont look up and realize were all being swindled by the same forces anybody who thinks the billionaires on their side are actually on their side are painfully naive its an illusion if we united as a people wed be,YourFriendMaryGrace
too powerful for their absolute greed to continue going unchecked as it has been for decades and thats their worst nightmare i really truly think that this civil war narrative is being pushed into the conversations of both sides by an outside source theres major world powers that would have a lot to gain by americans being so divided against each other i have dear loved ones on both sides and nobody i know irl wants bloodshed online though i see it brought up more and more by both sides equally and both sides seem convinced that they have no choice because the other side is already planning on it i dunno maybe im paranoid but it all just feels very orchestrated for sure then again it could just as well be about anger youre actually feeling towards him but its just being illustrated in a satirical and overthetop kinda way dreamland is a very symbolic and metaphorical place and the details matter for example the computer keyboard the sloppy food they both mean,YourFriendMaryGrace
something specific about something in your life that is or has made you feel pretty strongly the computer keyboard might mean that this is a dream about anger youre feeling specifically in regards your communications with the outside world or perhaps while working from home the sloppy food might mean youre feeling disgust too im just spitballing but you get the idea hope its ok that i said all that i just get excited about dreams lol love your style i help people interpret their dreams as a hobby and i might be able to shed a little light quite often the people we see in our dreams arent playing the part of themselves they often represent a different side of yourself that you identify in them for example i have a very spiritual side but i also have a very logical reasoning side i have a friend darion who is pretty dismissive of anything spiritual metaphysical etc when ive had moments of feeling conflicted about these two sides of myself theyre often followed,YourFriendMaryGrace
by dreams of me and darion being on bad terms even though were getting along fine so i see it as darion representing my logical side and my subconscious mind trying to tell a story that calls attention to this disconnected person within me just something to consider in case its helpful i have the same placement i think it is playing out for me like this the scorpio south node means that my past lives and my past in this life tends to be filled with drama power struggles abuse of some kind and money problems i feel my mission is to find peace stability and prosperity in this life and basically stop expectingcocreating chaos i think this tumultuous time period were in with the virus and worldwide political issues is such a good opportunity to be a port in the storm so to speak the inspiring thing about this placement is that if you believe in past lives you can bet that you have already been through just about everything a person,YourFriendMaryGrace
can go through and youre still here youre stronger for it and you can handle anything its okay to just relax and enjoy life and lean into those lovely taurean traits like gardening enjoying good food and indulging all your senses absolutely my bffexhusband and i have had a lot of lives together i think it sounds so cheesy but the first night we spent together we didnt even fool around just stared into each others eyes and felt completely at home i didnt even believe in past lives at the time yet i felt like id finally found him now 15 years later hes still the only person i can just look into their eyes forever and never feel uncomfortable were divorced but we are still as close as ever weve both done past life regressions and seen lives weve had together usually as a couple or just dear friends i have another friend that i feel for some reason was my son in a past life ive also had the experience of,YourFriendMaryGrace
simply locking eyes with a stranger and thinking i know them like an instant love and familiarity and it always makes me wonder if its a loved one from another lifetime you need to be able to heal and process and release trauma before those experiences become helpful imo ive dealt with everything from sexual abuse to homelessness and for a long time it did weaken me but years and a lot of psychedelics therapy yoga etc later i feel pretty damn powerful i think that what doesnt kill you saying does a disservice in the same way that calling cancer patients fighters does it gives the impression that if you dont possess a superhuman ability to immediately bounce back to better than before youre somehow deficient the focus should be on healing and transmuting and being supported until you start to feel stronger im here for you if you ever want to chat my cap moon is in the 4th house and cleaning my home makes 95 of my bad feelings feel better,YourFriendMaryGrace
for a little while i have a pisces sun but a cap moon and 4 aries placements i still come across as gentle to most people at first theres a lot of interpretations but generally i just take it as a sign im on the right path i would look into numerology if youre interested in learning more about the particular energy numbers carry you can even generate a free reading online based on your name and birthdate it really does thank you shes amazing and i love the way her clever little mind works and i just want to support her the best i can that sounds just like my 6 year old gemini sunmoon daughter any parenting advice for me especially when it comes to the tantrums to be fair a lot of things have happened this year that we wouldnt have thought would happen in a million years its kind of the theme thats what i hope for at this point those are great placements imo having your moon and ascendant,YourFriendMaryGrace
in the same sign helps because peoples first impression of you is better aligned with your inner self descendant signs can often represent your shadow side parts of yourself that are underdeveloped but having it the same sign as your sun means those traits are much more inherent in you amazing i have the same placement of chiron and related to all of this i started unintentionally having spiritualmetaphysical experiences at a very young age that didnt jive with the religion of my family and community it was difficult enough just to process those experiences alone and trying to explain them was impossible and socially risky so i kept quiet im still figuring out how to share my thoughts and feelings about things without sounding crazy lol i feel the same way about my pisces suncap moon thankful to have both bc i can see myself being extremely lazy or a workaholic with just one or the other lol if the relationship is no longer healthy and the parents cant get along they already,YourFriendMaryGrace
have an unstable family unit plenty of people grow up to wish their parents had just divorced rather than stay together arguing and being passive aggressive all the time the 29th degree sun year is said to be a time of preparation for the changes to come when your progressed sun changes signs mine changes from aries to taurus next year and i am kind of feeling that energy like im getting ready for something if he knew anything about true astrology hed know that summing someone up based on their sun sign is ridiculous unfortunately there will always be people who have a prejudice against certain signs but thats life you geminis are awesome and he sounds like a terrible friend lol i feel like its safe to say they hardly ever use it that way this is their time to plot and scheme amongst themselves safe from the peoples expectations and opinions getting in the way really rough but ultimately it was all necessary for me to transform into a much more,YourFriendMaryGrace
authentic version of myself yes i hear what youre saying and i cosign your petition for everyone to stop with the gun waving right im referring to ops comment about his real life interactions the ones that know were not racist were there last night and people with open minds were willing to hear us out and have conversations with us and saying that i dont think its fair to dismiss what hes saying about his real life experience and intentions just because it sounds like something trolls say its crazy and honestly it scares me im reminded of that noam chomsky quote all the time lately the smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion but allow very lively debate within that spectrum im sorry but thats a stretch billions of people converse every day lol you cant attribute everything that is said and done in the real world to divisive online lingo personally i prefer to engage in good faith and if it,YourFriendMaryGrace
doesnt work out i move on why are we really at the point where wanting to have a conversation is suspicious if so then were completely screwed because exchanging ideas and perspectives is crucial for peace woah thats crazy my first name in this life is similar to a name ive had before but dying in an alley and being reborn as ali is wild i hope remembering how tough you had it before has helped you release any guilt about having it good in this life you deserve all the best ali yes ive done it many times probably at least a dozen times lol but its only worked twice in total ive seen 4 of my past lives one through regular meditation one through a guided meditation like this one was in a dream i had after a psychedelic trip and the most vivid and recent one ive been remembering since i was a little girl thats funny i almost asked you if you have any fears related to big cities or,YourFriendMaryGrace
alleyways honestly its really great to hear that youve had a good life this time your story was very sad and it sounds like youshe more than deserved a break this go round do you have any experiences or feelings in this life that might be influenced by hers im always interested in the parallels like ive had a lifelong determination to only have sex with people who truly appreciate me as a person and then in one of my past life regressions i saw myself as a woman who had really low selfesteem and let herself be used by a bazillion different guys bc she thought being sexy was her only valuable quality magician and i relate to the description very cool thanks for sharing thats really heartbreaking im sorry 3 well im 35 years old and im embodying my libra rising more than ever so dont hold your breath wow this is my boyfriends placement if you dont mind me asking were you bullied or just generally made to feel small by,YourFriendMaryGrace
a parent weird i didnt sleep at all last night and my 3yo was awake until like 3am my 6yo woke up about 4am and never went back to sleep no problem im still fairly new myself browsing this sub plus reading birth and synastry charts of people i know then looking up the placements and aspects that interest me have been my best learning tools its giving you the option of which astrological method youd like to use placidius and whole sign are probably the most commonly used ones around here personally i prefer whole sign you can search those terms in this sub for a lot more info did you guys get more than a one time relief payment of 1200 months ago damn im so sorry youre going through all this another fireball checking in i have mars mercury and venus in aries also lilith do you mean that mars is in your third house in your natal chart or transit natal placements tell you how those energies will most clearly,YourFriendMaryGrace
manifest in your life as a whole transit charts ie where mars is in your chart right now will tell you how youre currently being affected is it in your 6th house in your birth chart or do you mean thats your current mars transit my natal mars is aries in the 7th house but right now its transiting my 6th house i am feeling super motivated in my health and wellness routines and getting a lot of things done that ive been putting off well thats awesome youve already laid out a foundation for some really helpful stuff definitely give mdma a go if you can get your hands on some quality stuff if you need someone available to talk to during your trip id be really happy to help dm me i think you already know this but start by putting dating wayyy on the back burner until youre in a better relationship with yourself this woman was able to use you because you dont yet fully believe you deserve to be,YourFriendMaryGrace
treated as an equal as for what to do expect some trial and error and be open to trying a lot of different things i highly recommend beginning a meditation practice because over time you will learn to detach yourself from your thoughts rather than letting them run the show and negative selfimage is the product of negative thoughts about yourself run wild it sounds like you have a lot of emotional trauma with regards to women and being in society in general so therapy can help you work through a lot of things using psychedelics like mdma with the intention of revisitinghealing negative experiences has been lifechanging for me but of course you should do your research and proceed with caution etc etc also work on building healthy platonic relationships its much easier to get sucked into an unhealthy romantic relationship when you dont have a solid friend or two you can lean on for support and honest feedback im sorry this happened to you and i hope you keep working on yourself,YourFriendMaryGrace
and your mindset because there really are great people out there who will treat you as well as you treat them i worked in the tiny backstage of a 105 year theatre before i got laid off due to not being able to have shows anymore i dont know for sure because testing wasnt really available in my area at the time but i think i had the virus already working with internationally traveling performers and crew every day in tight quarters is challenging even without this particular virus idk if i can do that lifestyle again it kinda blew my mind how people were celebrating it like i can understand being happy to see liberal media go down if you arent at all liberal but how could it not even cross their minds it what an awful precedent it was setting yeah hulk hogan vs gawker and im still sad about it gawker could be hella trashy but they had some really great journalists too and were one of the very few mainstream,YourFriendMaryGrace
media companies left that were not owned by a billionaire my dad is a retired doctor and has been in a remarkable number of situations where he has been able to help people off the clock via witnessing car accidents people having heart attacks on planes and at a gas station i dont know what it is either but i like to think the universe has a way of putting brave and helpful people like you guys where theyre needed sometimes what is the factor not his literal house though he said my fathers house meaning the temple people had basically turned the temple into a moneymaking scheme and jesus was extremely not okay with that thus the table flipping and such because paul the opportunist came along and claimed to be miraculously converted from the guy who loved dragging jesuss followers to be stoned to the guy who was given special permission to tell everyone what jesus really meant to say he proceeded to write tons and tons of letters that he claimed,YourFriendMaryGrace
were the word of god to the point that more than half of the new testament is just paul blabbering on urging people to be judgmental saying stuff completely opposite of what jesus taught and modern christianity is entirely based on pauls teaching not jesus rpracticaleffects especially this post gosh i have a bunch of these and i do think some might be actual alternate timelines playing out like my dream self pops over to experience it for a little while theres a huge openair church that looks like a remodeledexpanded version of the church i grew up in i am no longer religious and i dont go to church but in these dreams it seems im still trying to play along and its very lonely disempowered feeling but the most frequent ones happened around 20122013 and they were scary the world was a dangerous lawless place and my ex husband we were still married at the time though and i had to be extremely careful about leaving our apartment bc there were so,YourFriendMaryGrace
many violent people everywhere but every time i was there i knew that apartment complex parking lot etc like the back of my hand even though it doesnt exist in my life here i really like to help people interpret their dreams because i have a gift for reading the metaphorical language of dreams but these types of dreams are just so different in the way they feel and the content is so undreamlike that when i have them i dont even try to interpret them anymore i just assume i went timeline hopping again lol i read somewhere that the draconic nn is set to aries because of the idea that ultimately were all on a solo soul mission of some kind and aries represents that energy personally i resonate with my draconic chart in some ways more so than my birth chart but im not educated enough on it to speak to its validity you dont have to do anything really except be mindful of your thoughts and feelings if you feel,YourFriendMaryGrace
anger frustration anxiety whatever lean into it enough to see whats really under there we all have shadows and trauma and stuff weighing us down but remember that this is the energy of rebirth too releasing the old makes room for the new i like to do some symbolic things too like during the day i will clean my house really well get rid of some clutter and at night ill take a long bath or shower idk just something about getting my environment and myself super clean while thinking about releasing and cleansing stuff that my old self went through really feels good you can google rituals and stuff but i suggest trying different things and seeing what feels good and helpful to you just remember to keep directing your mind im a pisces so i cant do anything about it myself lol my capricorn moon strongly disagrees ooo id be interested in reading this if you have a link im a capricorn moon my mom is a virgo moon and she had,YourFriendMaryGrace
me when she was 25yo she is a cancer sun and i think thats a combo that led to difficulty expressing her emotions in a healthy way but shes improved a lot i had my first born gemini moon when i was 29 and my second child leo moon 25 years later i think so i feel like i relate to my draconic chart more now than i would have if id seen it at a younger age but i think a lot of it depends on the souls evolution and intention for this incarnation maybe we take on the natal chart characteristics well need for this leg of the journey and for some people more than others that may mean a drastic change in how they operate compared to their draconian chart for example my exs draconic chart has a ton of capricorn and virgo placements which is baffling because he hardly has a drop of those energies in his birth chart or personality lol but his north node is in gemini so,YourFriendMaryGrace
it kind of makes sense like if he came into this life with a capvirgo heavy chart itd be that much harder for him to embrace the free curious excitable gemini qualities hes meant to embrace this goround is it really that bad i have toe thumbs and i try to tell myself its okay but i dont feel like its okay pisces being lazy my capricorn moon almost completely cancels out my ability to be lazy unless my chores are done and im at somebody elses house where im not distracted by other things i could be getting done when i was really little i was so gentle and looooved helping people to the point where my older brothers friends would take advantage of my kindness asking me to go get them water or whatever stuff they could have easily done for themselves and id do it one of my earliest memories of getting really pissed off is from when i was in first grade and my brothers friend told me to go,YourFriendMaryGrace
get him something and i realized i was getting walked on and said no after that i was a lot less helpful for a few years lol and ive been quite wary of being taken advantage of ever since its funny looking back because thats the year i turned into a little aries im moving into taurus next year i was just thinking about this last night my boyfriend has some troublesome aspects like pluto square venus and i have a lot of 7th house aries placements from what hes told me about his younger self i dont think we would have gotten along very well at all if we were the same age and wed dated in our twenties hes fifteen years older than me though so he has been working through a lot of relationship stuff since before i was even dating age hes also a leo but by progressions hes a virgo which i love i have venus mars lilith and mercury all in aries in the 7th house and i,YourFriendMaryGrace
endorse this comment libra rising 25 degrees i have mars in aries best was with fellow fire mars people im a cap moon and i have learned to embrace my rather mechanical structured approach to processing emotions i think it can actually be very helpful for working out problems with others or for helping people sort out their own feelings because the analytical skills i have for it help me break issues down to the root cause see how different feelings are interconnected etc part of fortune is where you can find success so if its in capricorn in the 7th house maybe you find success by working hard alongside your significant other or a business partner chiron is where youre wounded but can ultimately help others heal for example mine is in gemini in the 9th house and boy oh boy does that resonate i was raised with a very strong religious doctrine 9th house stuff but from a young age was having my own spiritual experiences that didnt jive with what i,YourFriendMaryGrace
was being taught so talking about my own beliefs sharing what i learned on my own gemini stuff was a liability that would have led to being told that i was wrong a sinner etc which honestly still hurts all these years later i think part of my purpose is to be brave enough to share and in doing so help others feel free of religious constraints lilith is a little more varied in interpretation some people say its the part of you that society rejects or a part of your life where you embrace darkness i would look at different articles about your specific placement of lilith and see what feels applicable how did you determine which fated events were indicated by them by looking at transits or was it the symbology of the placements making it clear internet word for small youd rather die than live without compliments thats crazy i have both the sun and saturn trine my mc what about you and yes im definitely used to making changes in,YourFriendMaryGrace
my life some of the things ive been through just in the past year i never anticipated happening to me like a divorce sometimes i think that might be part of my growth process learning how to be stable and consistent and enjoy life despite seemingly never being able to be sure whatll happen next yay how do you feel about your sunmoon combo i like it because i think the cap moon helps me stay grounded in reality and keeps the stereotypical pisces laziness under control but sometimes it feels like my feelings are overly filtered out because i wanna analyze them to death before i share them well i definitely relate to my scorpio south node im oddly comfortable with crisis darkness and the idea of just burning it all down about 7 years ago i gave away almost everything i owned and drove out to the desert with no plan except to start over this was before i discovered astrology ha ha and it was right before my saturn return but,YourFriendMaryGrace
i can see how it reflected both nodes kind of a south node reaction with north node intentions my mc is in cancer so that combined with my nn signhouse im wondering if my calling is at least in part to be a source of comfort and stability in other peoples time of crisis what about you i have nn in taurus in the 8th house which honestly feels kind of contradictory i can imagine that im meant to focus on taurean qualities like stability comfort followthrough and generally just enjoying life but the 8th house would seem to be the opposite of a lot of that im a pisces sun capricorn moon and libra rising we should be friends did you also feel a libra risingesque fear of displeasing other people by admitting that youre told that youre pretty because i did and still do libra rising and i think i am pretty in a very conventional sort of way none of my facial features stand out as exceptionally good or bad i,YourFriendMaryGrace
just have good symmetry i guess im clumsy but that always surprises people once they notice because im told i seem like id be very graceful lol im 54 and weigh about 115lbs so fairly petite i think most of this is aligned with the standard libra rising description except for my height as ive read they tend to be taller than average okay im not arguing with your data as ive yet to see it myself im just saying that your phrasing gives the impression that being gay is unfortunate and even if you dont care about hurting peoples feelings i think youll get a more productive discussion out of this post if you share what youve been researching in a more neutral less negative light saturn just entered my 5th house like 2 weeks ago so my experience is very limited but i feel the sudden urge to buckle down and complete a short film i startedabandoned two years ago whereas new creative ideas arent really coming to me ive also been,YourFriendMaryGrace
doing a lot of reflecting about what i really need in a romantic relationship and what im really willing to contribute another thing i think its interesting timing that im stuck with my children almost 247 right now because its made me more aware of what they individually need from me as their mom and a lot of it seems to involve me being more structured planning ahead better etc hopefully you get some more responses im very interested in reading about this from people who have been through it can you give some examples might want to change your wording too lol i think i get what you mean but saying risk of sounds like being gay is a disease or something i assume she means venus in aries maybe venus in scorpio too if going by traditional rulerships depends on what you need us to be whats your rising sign im a libra rising venus in aries and my style is similar what country do you live in check out rprecognition this,YourFriendMaryGrace
is a lot more common than you might expect happy birthday same here and i was terrified to grow up i cried a lot when i was getting ready to turn 13 because i felt like i was gonna be a teen and not a kid anymore now im 35 and i guess ive accepted it but if i could be someones kid forever i would lol listen to take a walk on the wild side first then listen to can i kick it and you cant possibly miss it and a tiger saw a man thats funny i had the same recurring dream as a newlywed i think sometimes our brains just run through alternate path scenarios via dreams and your emotions in the dream help you feel what making different choices might have felt like you cant be serious lmao these are babies when i was this age i told my babysitter i was gonna cut off her head i wasnt a future murderer just a little kid copying what i heard,YourFriendMaryGrace
disney villains say if you wanna predict adult personalities based on tiny childrens behavior youd have to come to the conclusion that theyre all gonna be psychopaths thatd be great thank you trying to avoid unnecessary trips the grocery store plus having way more time than usual to spend in my back yard definitely has me veggie gardening wish theyd reverse it turning churches into homes even temporarily would do a lot more to help the sick and the poor you know the people jesus said to look after no im kind of the opposite of that if they seem uninterested i lose interest too capricorn moon in the 4th house im cleaning and organizing the shit out of my home and putting together a homeschool plan for my kindergarten and preschool age children hold on by alabama shakes mine also happy birthday birthday twins edit omg a slice of pi award and our bdays are on pi day this is the best ever thank you upoky23 i love you the article is wrong,YourFriendMaryGrace
it was actually a single dad banana hes still married but separated while he and his wife try and work out their differences congrats on your new baby boy im sorry you wont have visitors extra sets of hands really help with those newborns but i hope you two enjoy lots of happy healthy snuggle time im here if you wanna talk i dont know if youve ever been miserably sick with the flu before but posting on reddit was probably the last thing on everyones mind and regardless of whether or not the commenters here had covid19 maybe we did maybe we didnt its not at all surprising statistically that out of over a million subscribers half a dozen or so people would have had their worst flu ever in the past few months statistically it probably happened to way more than half a dozen doesnt make us liars just unlucky yeah just lifting a cup of water felt like a physical feat at the time i was too out of it to,YourFriendMaryGrace
post anything i honestly for the first time understood how otherwise healthy people could die from the flu but i think i wrote some texts about how at one point my fever reached 104 and i was sleeping so hard i wouldnt have even woken up to take medication if my ex hadnt stayed over to keep watch on me and our kids and checked my forehead in the middle of the night edit oh and i have texts that i sent to my dad a doctor about how to watch for pneumonia bc my kiddos breathing was sounding wheezy interesting i definitely had the worst flu of my life in december and my children caught it and both had some difficulty breathing for a few days maybe a dumb question but would that give us immunity now if it was indeed the same thing alright well i hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend lola asking about specific placements isnt allowed here for some reason its okay on rastrologymemes and raskatrologers though,YourFriendMaryGrace
if you wanna repost this i think you might find this post and comments really helpful ahhh yeah that makes sense i think pisces can be a very childlike placement if its not balanced out with some strong earth or fire signs i have a lot of aries which helps and without it id probably be looking for guidance all the time in an effort to feel grounded thats interesting i have mars and venus in aries both in the 7th house which makes me a little relationshipcrazy lol ive had to teach myself to be picky about who i date because if im not careful ill stick with people who arent actually good for me he has a lot of first house placements which do make him a little selffocused but hes definitely a relationship person his venus is in 7th as well and its actually been good for me to be with someone who has his own stuff going on because my pisces tendency to get lost in people is kind of,YourFriendMaryGrace
kept at bay im more able to rememberfocus on my goals and personal activities as opposed to other relationships where i got so wrapped up in someone that i lost touch with myself all that to say pisces relationships might work better for you if shes able to accept your individuality and let it encourage her to focus on her own as well id say trust your gut feeling pretty much regardless of placements im so sorry for your loss youre a good sibling you have a lot of signs and often times the sun sign is less relevant to the personality than others for example im a pisces but i have a shit ton of aries in my chart and it shows lol so a lot of the classic pisces descriptions lazy reserved a pushover dont describe me at all put your info in a birth chart calculator and youll get a lot more insight into yourself yes i have a bowl shaped chart and its said that people with this shape often,YourFriendMaryGrace
feel incomplete as though the missing half of the chart is felt but not entirely accessible i only started studying astrology last year but looking back at the charts of people ive dated i see now that i have definitely been drawn to guys with heavy taurus gemini leo and virgo placements maybe in part because theyre bringing some of those energies to the table that i dont have a lot of on my own definitely this has been going on for quite a few years think how many apps you have and how many of them could easily be listening with your permission per the terms and conditions i love the 8th house its nothing to be scared of honestly yes it deals with death but also rebirth transformation contracts secrets sex etc if it makes you feel any better my 50 year old boyfriend has some of these placements and hes one of the most welladjusted and lucky mfers i know lol he does have quite a fascination with horror movies though,YourFriendMaryGrace
my saturn return was god awful although in hindsight of course i can see how myself and my life is much better because of those trials im at the end of my sade sati and its been really rough and just as lifechanging but not nearly as heartbreaking as the stuff i went through with saturn return the flight attendant said i want this lady off my flight and then the woman started apologizing saying she was really stressed out etc no worries i was actually responding to unettlepunk about his capricorn date but re your post im dating a leo guy and id say your best bet is just hype him up with genuine compliments often and carry on like it never happened next time something embarrassing happens to you maybe tell him about it for laughs so he remembers embarrassing things happen to everyone im a pisces and i listened to under the bridge obsessively in high school so i could feel all the feels i really want to know what happened,YourFriendMaryGrace
now i love this decoding my toddlers mystery phrases is one of my favorite things about having a toddler lol i felt like a genius when i finally figured out boocoos was blues clues lykeen was lightening mcqueen etc he looks unwell but someone showed methis clip of him dancing with little kids and its pretty damn cute so im pulling for him i can definitely understand taking issue with him as a psychiatrist proposing that conclusion but he is far from the only one the cia did some fascinating research on the topic of consciousness that particular link is a rather dense read but its really fun to ponder all the potential implications if youre into that kinda thing first of all thanks for engaging in convo with me respectfully secondly im not looking to convince you or anyone to believe one way or the other i do want to say though that a lot of the children remembered random people who the parents couldnt have known about and in some cases they,YourFriendMaryGrace
recalled correct details that were not publicly available information also for his consciousness theories he rely on theories of quantum physics quantum mechanics theories which is not the same as pseudoscience but i acknowledge that the birthmarks could be coincidence some kids remembered incorrect details etc again believe what feels right to you and be as skeptical as feels right to you im open to the idea of reincarnation but mostly in the camp of who the fuck can ever really know how this crazy universe works thats a depressing yet empowering thought lol on the one hand i dont wanna be a bug but on the other hand now i feel like a badass for making it to the mammal level at least once fuck yeah im a mammal lotta possibilities like maybe their past lives were on other planets or maybe not everyone is reincarnated or maybe our consciousness spends time elsewhere before returning to a physical body so theres not extra people right now just a lot more here at one,YourFriendMaryGrace
time than usual edit could also be that we reincarnate as creatures sometimes if so i would like to be a bear next time because annual hibernation sounds awesome i think youd enjoy reading dr jim tuckers research hes a actually continuing another u of virginia school of medicine psychiatristresearchers work dr ian stevenson so their combined collection of data from children who have past life memories spans decades most children lose these memories by age 7 or so theyve matched soooo many childrens memories with real life people its nuts interestingly most often the remembered deaths are traumatic or sudden in nature so lil suicide baby in the meme fits right in lol just let him go i definitely understand the need for closure but some people just arent willing to have the conversation and hes pretty clearly unwilling you deserve to be with someone who wants to be with you so put your focus on that and try not to take it personally lots of great people out there will want exactly,YourFriendMaryGrace
what you have to offer dreams of having a baby are usually to do with birthing a project or a part of yourself something like that similarly a miscarriage dream can be about something that you maybe planned on or started working on that ended for whatever reason but you were happy about it so if theres something you startedended around 2 months ago that you feel good about it ending its likely symbolizing that rather than an actual miscarriage dream interpretation is tricky with strangers because you dont have any idea whats going on in the dreamers life and feelings that may be symbolized but hopefully that helps you get started whenever youre listening youre really just quietly wondering how long until you can talk about yourself some more aww yay no problem im so glad it was helpful best of luck to you and your boyfriend i see what you mean now thank you for clarifying and youre right i dont disagree i just wanted to point out that there are more,YourFriendMaryGrace
legit options than say costar for example and for someone like me and presumably op who still has a lot to learn its kind of nice to have something simple to start with not all astrology apps are social media based and some of them are remarkably indepth timepassages has over 70 aspects just for my birth chart with most of the descriptions being multiple paragraphs long including less known aspects like biquintile and asteroids like juno their synastry is just as indepth but you do have to pay for the individual additional charts you sound a lot like me and my boyfriend im a pisces sun cap moon and hes a leo sag moon its been about a year for us as well and we are really compatible if you can get the app timepassages and pay 99 cents for his chart youll be able to use their compare charts feature which is awesome the most thorough and accurate synastry reading ive found it spelled out what makes us compatible really well and,YourFriendMaryGrace
even explains the challenges in a helpful hopeful way heyyy you have the same placements as my little 3 year old boy got any parenting advice for me if you can find out his birthdate you can find out his moon sign venus north node and more which will be far more helpful than going by the sun sign alone im a pisces with a leo boyfriend and those two signs are supposedly incompatible but its a really lovely relationship for lent im giving up a little bit of work to work on my life not a bad idea actually nodal returns squares and reverses never miss me lol you can read the timing and descriptions here i grew up in america but this one makes me sad too i feel like humans are meant to live in community and sharing taking care of each other but instead we isolate ourselves and just schedule time to not be alone once in a while im a pisces with a leo boyfriend sometimes our love languages,YourFriendMaryGrace
arent exactly aligned like he loves spoiling me with gifts and taking me to nice restaurants and stuff which is very appreciated but id be just as happy smoking a bowl whilst wearing jammies and talking about our childhoods lol im a very affirming person though which works well with his need for praise and i love his physically affectionate nature our senses of humor are pretty compatible too i think if id met him earlier in my life i wouldnt have appreciated our differences nearly as much as i do now it took a long time for me to realize that being super similar to my partner doesnt actually work out too well for me edit another interesting thing is that according to the synestry of some other placements we have we should be butting heads a lot and having to reign in our tempers but i have never had such a peaceful gentle relationship before and when we do have issues were able to talk a them out in a really empathetic,YourFriendMaryGrace
and loving way which again may come down to having met at the right time what was your experience like with this combo im a pisces and my baby daddy is an aries we have a 5 year old gemini and a 3 year old scorpio i like to think our parenting styles provide a wellrounded balance but i dont know pluto and saturn making squares oppositions and sextiles to practically everything in my chart lol basically the last two years have been an unending journey watching of everything i used to think would never change changing including my marriage got divorced this past summer doing my best to sit with the uncertainty of it all and trust that greater fulfillment and selfrealization are on the other side aww lol they were giggling so much as they signed it i wondered if they were writing crazy stuff but i guess they were just happy to be signing it thank you thank you this was sad but i enjoyed reading the details thank you for,YourFriendMaryGrace
sharing if you dont mind sharing how do you feel about relationships in your current life at a theater where artists are allowed to sign the walls backstage a bunch of teenage performers wrote this and id love to know what it says mr rogers for pisces sensitive gentle guy who lived to make people feel loved and empathized with he had a 29 pisces sun with moon mercury and venus in pisces too lol wow til never really looked into these before but i just looked it up and my life has definitely shifted dramatically right on schedule with these returnsreverse returns no idea we lived there for 3 years and never heard anything like that before or after birth chart and transit chart so very grateful for any input at all i can offer dream interpretation in return this happened to me and my ex one time when we were the only ones in the house two really loud knocks on the bathroom door the only place i have gemini is my,YourFriendMaryGrace
chiron but feel like i relate to gemini the most of any sign could be my partners north node is my sun sign and we have the rare and exceptional pattern it specifically says that being together supports the person hes becoming im a cap moonpisces sun and i feel things very strongly but i wont reveal my feelings until im ready which isnt often and i can only talk about my feelings to like 3 people and even then its usually after ive ruminated over it and tried to feel better on my own for a long time i set mine for desired nap length approx how long i think it will take me to fall asleep 10 minutes because it always takes me longer than i think it will i can relate as i have a pisces suncap moon but im learning to appreciate the beauty of being able to deeply empathize with people without getting swept up in whatever is going on with them and that i can have my head,YourFriendMaryGrace
in the clouds and my feet on the ground at the same time i would definitely pass on the message even if anonymously like usubfootlover suggested who knows maybe this message could spur an awakening in her that would lead her to change her ways in my experience youll only remember the things youre ready to see i had a deeply uncomfortable feeling of dislike almost hatred for a very minor celebrity on a show i used to watch even though i had no conscious or logical reason why years later id mostly forgotten about him but then i started thinking about him again at random times and feeling so uncomfortable i tried past life regressions many times before eventually seeing flashes of a life in which he was my horrifically abusive uncle now of course that was not a fun thing to relive but it was actually really helpful for me in working through some issues i had around sex and relationships with men but if id remembered all that earlier i dont,YourFriendMaryGrace
think i would have been ready whats interesting too is that i no longer feel that anger or dislike of him anymore at all i actually find it comforting that hes evolved over his lifetimes and is now as far as i can tell a good guy weve probably all been horrible people in the past so whatever you learn from it know that it doesnt define you now im so sorry this happened to your girlfriend shes really lucky to have you in her corner i think a lot of people are intimidated by those who march to the beat of their own drum because theyre unconsciously forced to confront their own conformity like were all incredibly unique at heart but when fitting in is your priority you suppress your own unique qualities and then resent the people who are able to let theirs show i hope that makes sense its something ive thought about a lot as ive dealt with it in my own way keep doing you you sound awesome costar,YourFriendMaryGrace
powered by pretentious delusional robots i got caught in that cycle for a while when i was young i didnt have enough selfrespect to leave him but i had enough strength not to do what he said of course its shitty but some people just repeating what they see normalized and havent learned how much better and different a relationship can be my brain went to the same place and i liked it i have taurus in my 8th house as well as ceres in taurus in the 8th what confuses me is that my north node is taurus in the 8th house and the descriptions of having a taurus nn is basically the opposite of the 8th house nn description am i supposed to be embracing comfort and stability or learning to live without it im so sorry you lost your son readingrpastlives might make you feel better my venus is in aries and ive never related to the falls in and out of love quickly thing if i commit to someone its,YourFriendMaryGrace
because im hoping it lasts forever my venus is retrograde though so that may have some impact aww well needless to say im a big sag moon fan and yeah the needing space thing took some getting used to because i felt rejected at first but that didnt stop me because my aries venusmars loves the chase lol just curious but have you ever lived with a partner before and how do you handle your need for alone time my two most significant relationships including my ex who i was with for 12 years have been with guys who had a sag moon in the 1st house from my perspective their common themes are loyalty and a deep deep need for autonomy and freedom also both have a very funloving nature i love you i can tell just by looking at you that youre a kind person and i bet youre fun to hang out with too keep being awesome the world needs more people like you ill believe you you might enjoy checking,YourFriendMaryGrace
out rprecognition thats so weird but ive read similar stories before so youre not alone what time was it before you blinked vs after thats so beautiful no prob im glad it was helpful the collective unconscious fascinates me too i started learning about it when i was studying dream interpretation and how our subconscious minds use similar themes water emotions for example in dreams to illustrate our deeper feelings i think that and probably many other influences numerical astrological etc probably play a big role in these types of persontoperson coincidences which arent actually coincidental at all take your kiddos with you i drove mine to randomly generated spot in the middle of a suburban neighborhood and there were like 10 deer ambling around it was wild and they loved it never know what you might see i dont have an explanation but id say definitely keep in touch with him you can keep it light and casual and see where it goes maybe youve found each other for a reason if nothing,YourFriendMaryGrace
else you know youve got a kindred spirit out there and thats always a blessing in itself if its a metaphorical dream he probably represents a part of yourself that youd like to get reacquainted with or theres something about him that youd like to be more like think about his qualities and if theres anything about him you particularly admired could also be a glimpse into an alternate timeline as a latenights working mom of a 3 and 5 year old quiet time is vital to my sanity lol just having even fifteen minutes or so to myself really helps me regroup and keep going what did she keep in there kenan good morning you sexy beast maybe but im glad you did i think i the way i worded that question was a little more bleak than i intended and i agree with you im still healing but its a process of getting happier and happier and a lot of my healing has happened through metaphorical dreams like these because they help,YourFriendMaryGrace
me identify what im feeling on an unconscious level which is why your question caught my eye thank you for the thoughtful response do you also feel like you went through hard times that dramatically decreased your capacity for joy to this day because thats where i think my shitty disney world dreams come from i have recurring locations but what happens there varies theres a ridiculously large mostly empty church that i wander around in sometimes a postapocalyptic disney world where everything is shitty and unsafe but its the best we can do i only date people who are mature enough to value the content of someones character over the color of their skin one of the past life memories i have is of being a woman who died in the 1960s with no spiritualreligious beliefs at all i floated above my hospital bed and just kind of hovered there for a long time before i realized that i wasnt obligated to stay in the room with my body lol after that i,YourFriendMaryGrace
zipped around the world and saw things id always wanted to see like the eiffel tower before eventually making my way up to the clouds and beyond to start the betweenlives process which is a long way of saying that i think some souls need time to process the experience of not having a body or they simply arent ready to cross over because of fear or the feeling of unfinished business in this realm and thats probably where a lot of ghost sightings come from edit i dont attribute all spiritual entities to this sort of thing though i think energy good and bad can manifest in this realm all kinds of ways and theres probably an untold number of extradimensional beings passing through at any given time that we cant fully perceive on this planet ps i was raised christian as well welcome to the wonderful world of following your own path wherever it may take you a shuttle cock for bad mitten sounds like the title of a whimsical porn written,YourFriendMaryGrace
by a childrens book author my boyfriend has never said i love you to me even though ive said it to him many times hes incredibly kind and affectionate and generous and thoughtful which makes me feel loved but not hearing it is really starting to hurt i wrote about mine here i went to school with someone who is getting fairly well known as a comedian a few people found her annoying but most people including me thought she was funny i guess its still a little surprising just because so few people actually make it in the entertainment industry and she did it i think the idea that anyone can be a bad dancer is silly just move your body in whatever way feels good to you whether alone or with people those who make fun probably just wish they were brave enough to dance its never too late to turn things around geraldo i said no one of either gender should be forced into killing being killed didnt expect that to,YourFriendMaryGrace
be an offensive statement how about the kind of equality where no one of either gender gets forced into killingbeing killed on behalf of some rich dudes my moon is in capricorn and i feel like im good at stepping up to the plate for other people not so much for myself lol definitely feel guilty about my irresponsibility on a daily basis but guilt doesnt seem to motivate me so im trying to be more selfaffirming yes been getting a normal amount of sleep at night yet feeling desperate for naps and caffeine just to get through the day way more dreams than usual too this article is really fascinating to me they talk extensively about the pole shift and estimate the number of smaller circular structures similar to this one to be in the millions but for more indepth reading you might find this and this interesting english explorers who discovered the ruins in the late 1800s found it inhabited as is illustrated in the picture i linked above and documented some,YourFriendMaryGrace
of the things locals said about it i think it would be super awkward at first and yes painful for a while but personally i believe the vast majority of people are really good at heart and so much of the pain we cause each other is really because we ourselves are confused afraid and hurting and that telepathy would ultimately bring us closer together in a new way because wed be able to feel the pain thats causing people to act the way they do and maybe even inherently understand the source of their pain and the feeling of being understood and empathized with would change peoples lives for the better i think thered still be factions but it would be a much more massive yet simpler twosided one of good vs evil instead of the everymanforhimself sort of world we live in now but im just speculating of course thanks for reading i have had mixed results sharing this with people in real life so its nice to be able to talk,YourFriendMaryGrace
about it and not feel like im coming across as crazy haha its weird i feel a deep sense of tragedy and loss looking at pictures of the ruins and if really it was an accident that shifted the poles and caused us to lose telepathy that really would be a great tragedy to be able to communicate and empathize seamlessly and effortlessly and then suddenly everything changes for everybody in an instant and nobody understands why misunderstandings uncertainty about peoples motivations and so much more would be a problem for the first time and our resulting sense of being alone in the world would be so painful to experience all at once and if that is what happened it makes sense that there would be factions and people would start splitting up into tribes and inventing their own way of communicating like in the story of the tower of babel edit another interesting thing about these ruins is that theyve discovered hundreds of much smaller versions of it covering a wide area around,YourFriendMaryGrace
it as though the people who built it were experimenting and working their way up to the big one and it doesnt make sense as a fortress or city walls or a place for livestock or really any of the things we associate with ancient human lifestyles i have past life memories and by far the most vivid one is of being shown the footprint of a massive structure and understanding something similar to what youre saying except the languages came to exist because of a sudden loss of telepathic abilities as a child i would see the shape of this structures footprint everywhere in clouds popcorn ceilings the floral pattern of my bedding and it drove me crazy because i couldnt put into words what it was and how i recognized it then a few years ago i ran across this image of the footprint of the great zimbabwe ruins and it stopped me in my tracks because its the exact same shape ive remembered my whole life then i started reading more,YourFriendMaryGrace
about the legends surrounding it and it sounds an awful lot like the tower of babel theres even theories about it being some sort of natural energy producing mechanism that was just too big and too powerful and the people who built it ended up accidentally shifting the magnetic poles which could indeed affect the way our brain computers link up anyway i could go on and on but its a fascinating rabbit hole to fall down for sure or hear me out you love things about yourself that youve actually accomplished things about yourself that make you a good person or a unique individual etc and dont need to cling to where you happened to be born as a form of identity i wanna see as you grow and evolve youll take on characteristics of the sign following your natal sun for example im a pisces sun and i still have many of those characteristics but ive been a progressed aries sun since childhood and i relate to that because i had to,YourFriendMaryGrace
learn to be more independent and assertive than the typical pisces at a young age who always has their dms open if you need someone to talk to not at all everyone needs to feel wanted and loved i hope you find someone who appreciates you for you really soon speaking with kindness hearing them out and acknowledging their feelingsperspective even if i disagree and sharing my own feelingsperspective without insisting that my way of thinking about it is the only correct way basically i make every effort to have a polite discussion rather than an argument and by doing so i find that its far more likely to go my way and even if we stay on different pages the relationship can usually carry on just fine i am happy birthday just call it a leg injury and reduce your recovery time by two weeks i love you aww thank you very much for saying that my man i hope you have a great day too youre awesome thank you for chatting with,YourFriendMaryGrace
me about this i agree with you that the media is pushing it pretty hard and as someone who has almost zero trust in the media i do have to question why but at the end of the day i think its a good thing for kids to feel free to explore the world around them without having to deal with all the cultural input theyll be dealing with the rest of their lives and if this kind of thing helps parents feel better about itnot read into it too much i think thats great anyway thanks again it says a lot about you that youd earnestly consider the other side and be willing to change your way of looking at it the world would be a much better place if more people were brave enough to do that i have to work on it myself all the time ive read all your comments here and im not a fan of arguing id like to understand your side i dont get it yet but,YourFriendMaryGrace
im trying it seems youre okay with your son consciously choosing to dress as a woman once hes old enough to understand that what hes wearing will be perceived as feminine and good for you i think thats great what i dont understand is why youre not okay with a little dude playing dress up before hes old enough to have picked up on all the culturalgendered associations isnt that inherently more pure in intention its like you want to teach him its not okay but then be cool about it if he does it anyway which in my personal opinion is kinda sad because then hell only be able to express himself with the knowledge that hes going against what his parents have taught him is acceptable i have a transgender friend who still gets emotional talking about the time as a child when they said they wanted to wear a waitress costume and their parents laughed at them and said no thats for girls it was the beginning of a 20 year,YourFriendMaryGrace
long shameridden hide out in the closet until they were finally able to even think about expressing their femininity again and they still arent close with their parents statistically the odds that one of my kids will be transgender gay etc is low but regardless id so much rather be supportive of them wearing what they like than set up a precedent where they feel like they have to audit their choices based on my personal feelings as long as theyre safe and not hurting anybody i dont see any reason to get picky if a little boy wants to wear a dress its got nothing to do with their sexuality and everything to do with wanting to look like a character they enjoy my 3 year old boy likes to put my makeup on sometimes bc mommy does it and its colorful sparkly shit that can go on your face all of which appeals to his toddler sensibilities assuming that makes him gaytranswhatever would be idiotic i hear you on the first point,YourFriendMaryGrace
but you cant just lock your door and keep sleeping when your kids wake up early unless theyre old enough to be unsupervised which takes years ya got me there pal maybe hes allergic to cats befriend everyone on the planet one by one until were all cool just hanging out and making nachos and stuff making all my own decisions isnt nearly as much fun as i expected is this love by bob marley hes singing about the happy life hell have with his lady friend and when he said for ja provide the bread i heard well jump rope on a bridge which i thought was a cute but oddly specific couples activity i love you i walked through my apartment complex after a light rain and the sidewalk was covered in snails just so many snails it freaked me out but i kept on walking until i crunched one at which point i screamed and took off running crunching snails and screaming all the way home psychedelics taken for therapeutic purposes,YourFriendMaryGrace
give yourself time to grieve ryan were here for you well done linda and michael amicably coparenting with your ex can be challenging but the rewards are so worth the effort pattern i am my day job i work with artists but not doing art myself but ive been painting for a few years and sell them sometimes ultimately i want to be a filmmaker too im learning how to animate and id like to make short films what about you oh thank you that made me smile and youre welcome please feel free to reach out any time you have a dream youd like some help figuring out of course youre the best interpreter of your dreams because youre living the experiences that lead up to having them but it always seems to help me having someone readhear mine and tell me what sticks out to them i used to have chronic nightmares as well and learning how to understand what my brain was trying to sort outtell me made a huge difference,YourFriendMaryGrace
i also usually google the setting and such for common interpretations which helps like last night i had a dream that took place in a stadium and i was on a computer trying to animate i read that dreaming youre in a stadium can mean that you are trying to be more assertive and put yourself out there more which sure enough is what im trying to do with my art so it makes sense interesting im a pisces sun cap moon and an infj makes sense since infj are known for their empathetic yet emotionally reserved ways oh yeah i know but it still might be relevant since the description of the metaphor strangulation stifled emotions aggression kinda fits with your description of the dog having to be kept in the garden due to being aggressive with certain people im sorry it made you feel horrible bad dreams can be really upsetting i would interpret that as your minds way of telling you that whatever the dog represents be it stifling your emotions,YourFriendMaryGrace
or something else its a valuable part of yourself that you should protect no part of ourselves are ever really killed forever they just get pushed back or forgotten but theyre still there and you can nurture them it might be worth a try to ask yourself what the dog represents before going to bed tonight i do that sometimes and will get a new dream that illustrates it differently hmm thats interesting i googled the meaning of dreams about strangulation and this came up in dreams the feeling of being strangled suggests a deliberate act of suppression strangulation suggests a violent act of suppression emotionally our more violent aggressive side may not allow us to act appropriately in certain situations to dream of strangling someone is an attempt to stifle our own emotions maybe something in your life has made you feel like you were too aggressive or said too much or like you had to stifle your emotional responses that might explain why your brain chose that dog specifically for this dream,YourFriendMaryGrace
possibly but that someone could also be you the subconscious usually creates a character for each part of yourself that it wants to illustrate so sometimes you are all the elements of the dream do you remember any more details like how the dog was killed how would you describe your cousins dogs personality irl animals often represent a vulnerable part of yourself it might help to think about it metaphorically and whether you might feel like youve lost a part of your personality mars in aries here too and same im a pisces woman with a leo man i like our differences for the most part the biggest hurdle probably had to do with his sag moon though he doesnt like to talk about feelings until theres a problem and i could talk about feelings all day lol but ive learned to appreciate his love language of making fun plans and helping me with stuff instead of expecting him to express it my way happy birthday if you look in the shared experiences,YourFriendMaryGrace
section of a particular pattern some of the comments may tell you what its based on a lot of things seem to be based on the rising signmc is your rahu different from the north node my western north node is in taurus but if i do a vedic chart i get aries rahu me heres what its like for me personally the cons too much of my self esteem is tied up in feeling accomplished i have an emotion and then i immediately feel compelled to ignore it categorize it explain it away or feel bad for feeling it in the first place lol i rarely get comfortable just feeling i spend a lot more energy thinking about what i should and shouldnt feel the pros it overrides a lot of the less helpful pisces sun traits like laziness lack of boundless and so on also makes me popular with employers as i have a very overpowering urge to work hard edit to add i like to think that as i continue to,YourFriendMaryGrace
learn how to accept and integrate what im feeling it will be even more of an asset i hope i can learn to use my pisces empathy and my libra social skills combined with cap moon stoic side to be a port in the storm for others thanks so much and btw if youre ever interested in reading professionally id love to be a client just read your kim post and its fascinating could you recommend a site for calculating midpoint in synastry charts asenchal oil well you sound like a good parent to me and i appreciate that we were able to chat about our different perspectives without it turning into a pointless fight all the best to you and your family wanting to wear someone elses clothes sure sounds like creatively experimenting to me obviously well have to agree to disagree here and thats fine but my belief is at least partially formed by experiences like when i sat across the table from a gay friend of mine last year and held,YourFriendMaryGrace
his hand as he cried about the time when he was 4 years old and his conservative manly man dad made him feel ashamed for wanting to buy a barbie hes 30 years old and that shit still hurts another friend who is trans has memories of being laughed at by his parents for wanting to wear a waitress costume these parents didnt raise manlier boys by censoring their interestsexperimentation they raised boys who grew up to feel like their true selves werent good enough for their parents im not saying youd do these things just explaining why i dont want to be the person who makes my kids feel bad about experimenting and liking what they like theyll get plenty of that from the rest of the world and when that happens ive got their back i get you i was just responding to the other persons question of why not and i get your reason for saying no in your case but yes id let him wear his sisters clothes to school,YourFriendMaryGrace
if thats what he wanted to do and she didnt mind hes only 3 but hes worn her shirt with the hearts on it out and about before lil homie just really likes hearts as long as theyre safe and not hurting anybody i try and let them figure out what they like without putting my personal feelings and bias in the mix i have kids and i let my son wear his sisters pajamas lol theyre the same size and she doesnt mind he likes them so yeah why not i think its all pretty much done by ai like they have certain plugin phrases for planetsignhouseaspects and the robots then string sentences together based on your transits for example my moon is in capricorn in the 4th house and my venus is in aries in the 7th house so when theres a transit happening with my moon and venus it might say something like explore what happens when you allow your sturdy emotional connection with home and family to recharge your energy,YourFriendMaryGrace
for significant relationships sometimes its eerily helpful and accurate sometimes its just word salad kids will be petty no matter what you do though id rather teach my kids to express themselves in spite of the occasional negative feedback than teach them to try and fit in my 3 year old son likes fire trucks and digging in the dirt and stuff but he also likes having his nails painted different colors he studies his options carefully and usually picks specific colors for specific fingers its cute but if later on he stops wanting to do it ill be cool with it i think theres a balance between encouraging them to be themselves and forcing them to buck the trend all the time i hope i get it right but im far from the perfect parent thats so awesome youre definitely not alone i wasnt feeling well and didnt have the best experience last night in particular but generally i find the days before during and after a new moon and full moon to,YourFriendMaryGrace
be extra beneficial for that kind of inner healing libra rising with a lot of aries and scorpio im petite like 53 and 110lbs dark curly hair which i usually have as a pixie cut or a kind of mop top lol big brown eyes small nose often told i look like a fairy libra rising and this moon is transiting my 8th house also my north node is taurus in the 8th house im thinking about my future a lot what will truly make me feel happy and comfortable im also feeling a strong urge to examine my inner self and what my actual wantsneeds are vs what i feel like i should wantneed my moon is in capricorn so i dont often get the urge to just let myself feel what i feel riding the wave while i can full moons are great for releasing think about yourself as a cup and the feeling of heaviness as a symptom of being too full what behaviors fears thought patterns etc are you ready,YourFriendMaryGrace
to release edit the moon is in taurus so you can work with the energy of this specific full moon by also thinking about your five senses and indulging in pleasure take a long bath eat something yummy listen to beautiful music etc no worries at all just wanted to offer i bet youll find the perfect deck in no time i dont use tarot myself but ive enjoyed getting readings so if you ever want to practice on someone lemme know well they say your first deck should be given to you if youre comfortable sharing a mailing address with me send me a pm id love to gift you a deck from amazon if not no worries ive seen them in stores that sell games and any crystal or magick shop should have them thats so cool you gotta do it keep me posted if you have time second house is in scorpio with saturn in scorpio and uranus in sagittarius there as well i dont know what im good at but,YourFriendMaryGrace
it sure isnt makingkeeping money interestingly my south node is in scorpio in the 2nd house using whole sign so it seems i should be able to overcome this but idk im still pretty new to astrology its cool you had this dream so close to todays date of 1111 i typically read dreams metaphorically but this one might be worth looking into literally get yourself some tarot cards and learn how to read even if its just for fun im so sorry for your loss i hope things look up for you as the days go by be patient with yourself im sure you know this but the grieving process takes time im always here for you if you want to chat i have the exact same placements and disposition thats sounds about right the circumstances of my childhood made me feel like i had to be very stoic and cheerful especially around my mom shes in a much better place now and our relationship is good so i forget how much that,YourFriendMaryGrace
probably still affects me subconsciously i think of cancer like a mama bear looks very cuddly and sweet likes to hibernate but holy shit dont mess with her or her loved ones im mostly basing this on my own mama bear who is a lovely very badass cancer and my cancer granddad who was the same way im a pisces sun with a lot of scorpio and while i have some great qualities from those placements sometimes i think theyre less practicalhelpful in the outside world than cancer qualities oh thats really interesting my south node is in scorpio and my life came crashing down at age 27 i went full scorpio lol and basically expedited the burnitdown process myself so i could move on to rebuilding and i had a pretty major epiphany that could be called a spiritual awakening it was a rough time in my life but im thankful for it now everything i lost was just stuff id built trying to please or impress other people oh man i totally,YourFriendMaryGrace
do that lol for me its usually because something ive been ignoringsuppressing with various distraction tactics has suddenly bubbled up to the surface and i cant get it out of my mind and because i dont like to talk about my feelings until ive had time to process them alone i end up sitting there unable to pretend nothing is wrong and unable to talk about what is wrong its awkward edit you can help by not forcing them to talk about it just let them know youre there if they want to talk capricorn moon i was just reading about it this placement this morning actually bc im 34 and i still dont understand my own emotions very well id say that it applies to my current career in a sense my midheaven is in cancer and i work with a lot of emotionally sensitive people a nurturing personality isnt required for my job but it sure helps ultimately id like to be an artist fulltime and i can see how my art,YourFriendMaryGrace
might take on some cancerlike qualities eventually right now its very scorpio though wow thats awesome i cant think of a more appropriate profession based on your sunrising empathetic yet very comfortable with death re the bowl shape i find it confusing because some of the information i read seemed to indicate that the best way to move forward in life would be to work counterclockwise starting with the first empty area which would be taurus8th house others seemed to be saying that sorting out the saturnscorpio 2nd house stuff would be the biggest factor re the aries at 29 degrees in the 7th house i feel confused about what it means i got married too young and i still struggle with the balance between being myself and going for what i want vs truly merging with another person and my north node is in the 7th house so i feel like this is important to figure out edit i forgot that i used whole sign for this chart which puts my north node,YourFriendMaryGrace
in the 8th house and finally my progressed sun hits 29 degrees in aries next march which feels significant heres a pic of my progressed chart for that date in case its helpful any help or insight suggestions etc with any of the above would be hugely appreciated go for it i like to learn what charity why should i move my backpack off the one empty seat left on the bus when youre capable of standing why should i not be a murderer we all do a lot of things because its the right thing to do why do you want the people who run companies to be an exception so bad im glad you mentioned infrastructure because its a great example of what im saying pipelayers provide an incredibly valuable service and the work is difficult af starting pay is about 24000 a year does that seem fair to you yeah it would be dumb because bench pressing cars has no value getting the food i ordered in mere minutes does and,YourFriendMaryGrace
just because people arent properly compensated for doing difficult work doesnt mean they shouldnt be if you have a dog capable of standing up for hours at a time in a hot kitchen keeping track of multiple orders at a time busting ass to collect bag each order in well under 5 minutes interacting with customers many of whom are unpleasant working with computer systemscash registers and making correct change you should get that dog a tv show ill never understand why people think working at mcdonalds is easy i get tired just watching them because the white car ended up on top of the red truck that tried to pull it out of the water i think im no expert but i think thats more of a synastry question specifically where you have placements in each others 5th house maybe 4th house too go to astro seek or horoscope yourself websites and make a birth chart using that info lol my 5 year old has been a demanding lil punk all morning i,YourFriendMaryGrace
was just telling her that she should try being positive and encouraging more often if she wants people to care enough to cooperate with her this video couldnt have come at a better time the night i met my boyfriend he had an astounding number of conjunctions happening with his natal venus and his north node was parallel his sun sign which is kinda cool because his north node is my sun sign mars in aries 7th house i think just about everybody does that in one way or another driving in a dream usually symbolizes the way your life is going so the fact that youre the one driving and nothing scary happens is a great sign probably indicates that you feel in control of your life people who are stressed about life circumstances often dream theyre driving a car with no brakes for example it being your dads car probably symbolizes having to do some things your dads way or with his permission which makes sense given your age just my perspective,YourFriendMaryGrace
take it with a grain of salt oh thats interesting sometimes i think i might be projecting and its actually me that keeps us from talking about stuff lol i feel self conscious because my circumstances at present are keeping us from being able to progress at any rate its nice to hear that sag moons are capable of getting excited about commitment the stereotype is so bleak when it comes to sags and commitment my boyfriend has the same placements and this describes him to a t im curious though how do you feel about talking about the future with regards to relationships hes a sag moonasc so maybe that plays into it but hell talk my ear off about nearly everything but the relationship even though all the other things he says and does point to him being as committed if not more so than me hahaha thats a perfect nickname im a pisces sun so we probably have a lot of the same tendencies i have dreams where im leading a,YourFriendMaryGrace

give you more information such as your north and south nodes which imo are some of the most helpful things to know about yourself but i definitely recommend supplementing your knowledge by googling stuff no app or website really covers everything time passages is another great app btw google venus in aries and read some articles then google venus in the 5th house and read some more the combination of what you read will give you a fuller picture edit astroseek gives birth charts that include interpretation of both house and sign but its usually a very brief description from what i can tell it can cause people to be extremely cautious about entering a relationship or even having sex i was in my 20s before i had sex and in my 30s before i had sex with someone else from what i understand thats not uncommon with venus retrograde people i really like sex id just rather be celibate than be intimate with someone i dont feel a strong connection with this thread,YourFriendMaryGrace
might be helpful science is not a belief system it does not rely on hopes and dreams i completely agree with you which is why im sharing scientific research with you instead of my hopes and dreams i have no idea whether or not pluto or the apparent retrograde of planets etc affects us neither do you but thanks to decades of research we can say with mathematical certainty that the cycles of the moon as well as some of the inner planets do in fact affect us i dont think you were expecting that so youre pretending like im linking you to pictures of voodoo dolls burning in sage piles rather than engaging with what ive actually written i also agree with you that clinging to beliefs is antiscience which is why its disappointing to see you clinging to your belief that planets have no effect on us despite being shown hard data indicating that some of them do i linked you to properly scientifically conducted research on the topic of planetary effects,YourFriendMaryGrace
on humans hoping to have a cordial sciencebased discussion it seems youre more interested in being insulting im not insulted but it feels like you want me to be and arguing against a meme that im in no way trying to defend so i dont really know how to engage with you now arguing on the internet just isnt my thing but lemme know if you ever feel like discussing research and the implications of the results btw i checked out your music and youre very talented i also work in film and i used to live in ocean beach if you believe in science and i suspect that you do then approach this scientifically and see if the evidence supports your hypothesis you stated earlier that the planets moon etc do not affect personality life experiences etc conveniently this is by definition a null hypothesis which means that nearly all the research found here applies to your hypothesis statistically significant meaning that mathematically speaking the correlations cannot be attributed to random chance evidence,YourFriendMaryGrace
rejects this null hypothesis which as scientific research usually does brings up a whole slew of new questions youve already listed some really great ones in the comment im replying to now which is why its a bummer to see you close by restating your belief that its all silly and nonsensical rather than examining the evidence and seeking the answers to your own questions asking questions and examining the evidence is the best approach we humans have for learning about our universe the idea that the earth revolves around the sun was once considered silly and nonsensical too but naturally the scientists of the time kept asking questions and examining the evidence and found it to be true and fwiw i do understand where youre coming from im 34 years old and up until may of this year i believed that astrology was a bunch of make believe woowoo nonsense and to be fair the socalled astrology seen in memes and pop culture very often is made up written by people who arent,YourFriendMaryGrace
even using astrological methods to back their claims but when i ran across an article citing scientifically conducted studies showing that ancient astrological methods can be used to predict certain human behaviors and experiences to a statistically significant degree i had to accept that i might be wrong of course you are fully entitled to your beliefs and fully entitled to disregard any evidence contradictory to your beliefs but theres a lot to be said for keeping an open curious mind without open curious minds there would be no scientists dreams are often metaphorical but this one might be a little more straightforward perhaps youve been thinking even just hypothetically about having sex and what the ramifications would be in a worst case scenario or maybe youre trying to separate your true feelings about sex from how your parents raised you to think about it just my perspective may or may not be true for you fwiw i grew up in the same kind of household and it took me a while to let,YourFriendMaryGrace
go of the guiltshamefears i had about sex but ultimately these types of dreams are helpful and probably a good sign that youre letting go of some obstacles to being yourself well now youre just being obtuse lol my second link has a long list of statistically significant data on the effects of not just the moon but many of the other planets everything is cited and you can even read many of the studies yourself and see the data if you just feel like arguing knock yourself out but calling research done by phds using blind studies and scientific methods of measurement voodoo makes no sense in no way does it effect humans emotions or personalities or life experiences theres an awful lot of statistically significant data suggesting otherwise heres a very small collection of examples and more here but theres lots more out there if youre interested thank you for saying that i hope it helps someone im very glad youre still here this made me sad im sorry your parents reacted,YourFriendMaryGrace
like that when what you needed was empathy and support i hope you feel better soon this is so cool i cant wait to try it thank you for sharing it could be a reflection of how you feel youre currently progressing through life for example when people are feeling good where theyre going in life they might dream of driving a nice car down a beautiful road or flying in an airplane lately ive been dreaming of being in a car thats out of control with no brakes so youre not alone lol can you think of anything in your life lately that youve killed it could be a relationship an idea you decided not to pursue a part of yourself that youve suppressed or even someone whos feelings you hurt the fact that you did it without thinking but felt bad afterwards is probably a helpful clue im so sorry to hear that same here and i dont relate to the typical venus in aries description very much im extremely choosy about,YourFriendMaryGrace
who i have sex with and rather than lose interest quickly as venus in aries supposedly do ill stick around way longer than is healthy for me in answer to your question op i think i interact fairly normally but under the surface im a bundle of insecurities for the beginning of the relationship and even once im settled in i have an underlying fear im not good enough ive come a long way but i still need fairly regular reassurance from my partner thats actually an urban legend and not at all based in factual evidence the universe and i have arrived at the conclusion that youre a six foot tall pile of awesome i would love that someone posted a dream here like a year ago where aliens invaded and created a test to determine whether she was a real human or an alien in disguise it said what did you do last summer yes or no and she was sweating it out trying to guess what the aliens thought a human,YourFriendMaryGrace
would respond that needs to be a meme i still laugh when i think about it im glad it was helpful and congrats on making big strides forward im a straight woman and im not even on tinder but samantha has the power to change all that definitely start keeping a dream journal it will help you start remembering them with way more clarity also check out rprecognition youre not alone the profile pic in my dream was a little different her pose was less sassy and more fml with her shoulders slouching arms down and she was frowning but i could only find so many options for images of women in coveralls isnt it crazy i only discovered the nodes a few months ago and i was amazed as my north node is precisely what i had realized that i needed to cultivate in myself earlier this year i showed a friend of mine how to look up his and he had the same reaction best of luck to you we got this,YourFriendMaryGrace
driving your life path the dream with your high school friends might have been about the path you were on back then bridge connection between things so it could be pastpresent and future for example where an unfinished bridge represents an uncertain future or unclear path to get what you want busbus station public aspect of your life journey or the parts of your life that you have less control over these are just some possible metaphors to consider dreams are usually little stories we tell ourselves to illustrate how we feel so think about the feelings in the dreams and what they might represent for you personally like the fear of heights you have in the dreams might represent a fear you have about falling or losing control in some aspect of your real life right now thank you so much normally i default to the metaphorical method of dream interpretation but this is one of those dreams that feels more spiritualenergy related to me i do think its relevant that youre doing,YourFriendMaryGrace
emdr therapy right now if i had to guess id say that youre probably ridding yourself of some yucky energy that accumulated in the time you lived in that house and the therapy is bringing it to the surface to be dealt with so while im sure it was awfully scary its probably a sign of progress renergywork might be a good resource for releasing it just remember that youre safe and in control would you mind recommending a website ive tried astroseek and the timepassages app but neither of them seem to include north node in their synastry interpretations the person im seeing now his north node is my sun sign which id think would be a good thing but im an astrology newb how can you tell that hes activating your north node your sister and i have the same sunmoon placements i agree about the pushover stereotype i think its because pisces are intuitive enough to recognize why someone is behaving badly and empathetic enough to give them a pass if,YourFriendMaryGrace
they feel like it like if someone is going off on me about some trivial thing i can see that theyre actually stressedangry about something that has nothing to do with me and it makes me feel like figuring out whats actually bothering them more than getting defensive so from an outside perspective it looks like im just incapable of standing up for myself when actually its a conscious choice to let them off the hook and see if i can help my mars is in aries though so im fully equipped with a temper lol it just doesnt flare up easily or to run away from peoplerelationships if you feel pressure to conform to circumstances or the partner i love aquarius so i think thats a nice placement however oh snap thats definitely me i can hang in there for a while i just ended a 12 year marriage that i was mentally ready to leave 6 years ago but i feel very claustrophobic when a partner expects to have a lot of,YourFriendMaryGrace
sway in my decisions im still trying to figure out whats fair in that regard and i love leos btw i have no leo in my chart and i wish i did theres just a cheerful magnetism in the leos i know that draws me in like a moth to a flame lol im currently seeing a leo sunsag moon which seems to be working out well in that he needs his freedom and respects mine the lack of communication is trying though secondary characters often represent parts of your psyche that arent fully integrated sex kissing etc often represents the integration or merging of this part of yourself into the whole so for example if youve been working on being more assertive your subconscious might illustrate that with a dream like this thats just one possibility to consider you can try asking yourself what the man represents as you fall asleep and it may be illustrated in a different way with a new dream my jupiter is in aquarius in the 4th house,YourFriendMaryGrace
of all my placements ive probably looked into that one the least im still not sure how it manifests in my life my venus is in the 6th house and opposite the ascendant within 35 degrees according to timepassages would that be considered wiggle room mars opposite ascendant within 45 degrees i dont relate to the venus in aries descriptions very much i never knew why but what you said about the double negative and directing the typically outward tendencies onto oneself is interesting and got me thinking mine is 22 degrees so from what i understand if i were to pick up on the tendencies of another venus placement itd be taurus but i relate more to the venus in pisces descriptions hey cool im a libra rising too i wish i could take credit for the chart analysis but it must have been someone with a similar user name im still kinda new to astrology but im glad another your friend or mary grace out there was helpful ha my lilith is,YourFriendMaryGrace
also in aries as is my mars both in the 7th house and conjunct my venus it occurred to me recently that in all my major relationships theres been an ongoing power struggle where my independence and need for autonomy is perceived as a threat to the relationship im also very choosy about who i have sex with to the point of long periods of celibacy even though i have a really high sex drive i dont even know why but i just cant do causal sex and im happy with how i look now but its been a loooong road to get here how do you feel like it affects you im a retrograde venus in aries ive forgotten several including the big one that seemed to cause some major glitches in the following days i take it as a sign that my jump was so successful ive just forgotten the previous timeline you can find out right now using this free calculator once you know what nodes you have google north node,YourFriendMaryGrace
in and read a few different sites to get a good understanding if you do locate your chart it should also tell you what houses your nodes are in which will give you even more insight into your souls journey i love all of this shes very artistic but she has a short attention span so i think something that requires figuring it out as she goes would be perfect and hold her attention better thanks so much for the suggestions this is so fascinating i absolutely give in to her wanting to quit things all the time and i would say ive been doing less discipline than id planned im a softie pisces sun lol but i can see how it is more helpful to her in the long run to teach her perseverance and responsibility now thanks for taking the time to respond its really useful stuff wow its really good you brought this up because her dad and i are very recently divorced so theres lots of changes happening and my,YourFriendMaryGrace
tendency is to keep her out of the loop unless its a big obvious thing that needs to be discussed but shes so observant that i find her asking questions that she wouldnt be asking if she hadnt already picked up on a lot of what is going unsaid thank you if youre open to astrology calculate your birth chart and see what your north node and south node is theyre commonly known as karmic parts of the chart with the north node being the traits you should develop and the south node being what you need to overcome for example my south node is in scorpio which indicates my past lives have been dramatic and probably full of controlabuse issues this is reflected in my past life memories and has been true for my current life as well and my north node is in taurus so im meant to learn how to be in control of myself alone and build a stable enjoyable life for myself i suppose it comes down to a,YourFriendMaryGrace
matter of belief but personally i believe that our loved ones animals included can use the dream world as a vehicle to come check in on us and let us know theyre still around i had some very memorable dream moments of conversing with my granddad after he died as did several other people in my family who were close to him im sorry for your losses and hope it helped to be able to see them again this is so helpful and encouraging thank you it definitely sounds like her she loves to paint and seems to have a knack for learning languages my challenge with her is that she is very interactive she doesnt like to entertain herself and wants me to be engaged in everything she does and she wants to do a lot so im always looking for ways to keep her busy so she doesnt feel ignored when mama needs a minute im so sorry to hear that my 5 year old daughter is a gemini sun and moon,YourFriendMaryGrace
pisces rising would you guys mind sharing your parenting tips what helped or would have helped little you thrive and feel supported growing up im a pisces sun and a capricorn moon i consider it a blessing because the practical downtoearth cap qualities help me regulate my spaced out pisces tendencies youre the best interpreter of your own dreams so the following is just my first impression take whats helpful and disregard the rest seeing her in a gritty fast food restaurant this was not a healthy or nurturing relationship resembling someone you dislike seeing with new clarity the aspects of her that didnt jive with you all black clothing endings closure holding a baby new beginnings fwiw i find its pretty normal and common to dream of an ex once you find a better partner when youre still single and searching it can be harder to process the emotional impact of a past relationship and harder to see it clearly too youve found someone more compatible which makes it easier for your brain,YourFriendMaryGrace
to sort out what was wrong before think of it like selftherapy its possible you woke up after did you ever love me because thats not something you can really be certain of either way hope that helps and best of luck with your new relationship the hot and cold thing ok thank you for the straightforward feedback i definitely dont want to change him i guess i just wanted to understand if this is his true nature or if im just not someone he feels safe opening up to or what hes a leo sun not positive but i think hes an aquarius rising no aries in his main planets but a neptune in scorpio venus in gemini yes to the temper tantrum letting it go quickly though the tantrums have so far been directed at people he feels are being tricky or unfair and not at me he does get jealouspissed at the thought of guys hitting on me though i i am so glad you told me this thats the opposite,YourFriendMaryGrace
of my natural reaction lol thank you but what if he never brings up anything thats bothering him like ever until eventually hes so fed up about something that he wants to end things and its something i could have made better if only id known does anyone here have advice on getting a sag moon partner to open up about his feelings or at least admit to having them thats amazing if you havent already looked at the research into past lives i think youll be surprised how much evidence there is to support it jim tucker is a great place to start that being said i find its helpful to think about it from the perspective that regardless of whether or not the memories are real these images and storylines came from your own subconscious mind so theres something in olivers experiences that you can learn from or relate to in this life i did one of those regressions and had vivid recollections of being a really sad and sexually degraded woman,YourFriendMaryGrace
named marnie who married for money and then spent the rest of her life depressed and bored out of her mind ive always had a strong desire to marry for love respectown my sexuality and make my own living and maybe those hard lessons marnie learned are part of the reason why or maybe its just a story my brain told me to illustrate how i feel either way it was helpful thanks for the update how would this affect someone with their venus in gemini i dont know but i do think it gets easier with practice for me the mental diet definitely seems to be helping that being said last night i found myself worrying again haha so im still learning im reading this 44 minutes after you posted it im so sorry for the things you never got to experience with him i bet hes so proud of you he cant stand it first of all im really sorry youre feeling this way id suggest you start by manifesting better selfesteem,YourFriendMaryGrace
imagine that youre happier and more confident in yourself than youve ever been imagine that youre turning heads when you walk into the room or getting compliments that make your day whatever feels like a wish fulfilled of being a confident person to you just leave sp out of it as much as possible for now and when you do think of him try to simply intend that hes happy and fulfilled too i know its not easy and definitely give yourself a grace period of processing that anger but it will help you in the long run to work towards genuinely wishing him well in life with or without you once youve got that selfesteem up then work on the sp by then you may not even be interested in getting back together but if you are youll be all set to have a healthier happier relationship sat state akin to sleep but im not sure how it might be translated into the books youve read its the method of getting very relaxed,YourFriendMaryGrace
but still awake and visualising the end result of what you intend to manifest sp specific or special person its not a neville term as far as i know its used by people who have a particular person usually someone they know like a friend or an ex they want to date damn thats exciting youre a badass and you got this there ya go perfect step one for your new formula i like being subscribed to rhydrohomies because its like a wholesome drinking game for me lol if im scrolling reddit and i see one of their posts i stop and drink some water it also helps me to keep a reusable water bottle i can carry around with me its a little annoying to keep up with but thats part of what makes it an effective tool for remembering to hydrate once you get used to the wonderful feeling of being well hydrated for a few days in a row i bet itll become a habit the mental clarity alone makes it,YourFriendMaryGrace
worthwhile not to mention youll start to look and feel more healthy without any specifics its hard to offer advice but generally speaking i think starting with small changes in the way youre going about life can get the ball rolling go to bed thirty minutes earlier tonight drink a little more water than usual tomorrow say hi to that neighbor you usually dont speak to kind of depends on the context of the dream but it often represents some new or underdeveloped part of yourself could be an aspect of your personality thats ready to grow or even an idea youd like to see brought to life feel free to message me if youd like some help with anything specific from the dreams usually overwhelming emotions maybe youve been through or are in the midst of an emotional experience the good news is that you either made it through or youre well on your way to making it through oh man thats a lot of stress to deal with and i think its,YourFriendMaryGrace
understandable that youd feel totally overwhelmed by it but its also the kind of thing that a few years from now you could be telling a new partner or friend or colleague about and theyd say what you did that and laugh their ass off because it is so out of character for the person theyve come to know and love one of my favorite people in my life is a guy who got duis and stole shit in his younger days even spent some time in jail and now hes so damn accomplished and successful and happy that i a relatively successful woman with two kids look up to him a lot point is as bad as this may seem it is really and truly okay and you can get through it and come out the other side with lessons learned and a hell of a story try and cut yourself some slack were lucky to have you here and i really hope you stick around i often dream of my friends as,YourFriendMaryGrace
a representation of some part of myself and sex dreams can often be symbolic of mergingintegratingaccepting two or more disconnected parts of yourself it might be helpful to think of the first thing that comes to mind when you think of each friend for example lets say kevin is really comfortable in social situations a dream about having sex with him might be your subconscious minds way of illustrating that theres a part of you that can also be comfortable around new people and you can integrate it you would probably find rastralprojection very useful youre already halfway there i think first and foremost you should follow what brings you joy that being said real love in my opinion doesnt involve trickery and confusion and demands of loyalty its just freely given to you as you are im wary of anyone or anything that expects you to jump through hoops to meet their needsdesires it sounds like both these fellas have you in a rather vulnerable and confused place even as they may say,YourFriendMaryGrace
its for your own good you are all you need to be empowered and vibe high i dont know that theres anything we can be 100 certain about in this realm of existence thats part of the adventure but you might find it helpful or at least entertaining to do a past life regression meditation on youtube i saw myself in vivid detail as a humanoid cheetah looking being from another planet who decided to come here to spread love and light the revelations about that life and what i was like before continued to come to me through dreams and meditation for about a year afterwards regardless of whether or not its true it all came from my subconscious mind and really helped me know myself better as well as refocus my energy and refine my goals for this lifetime i havent experienced flips with anything but fruit loops and it seems to flip every few months for me this reads like a message from you to yourself that you can be more,YourFriendMaryGrace
assertive its all started with you saying yes to a date not because youre dying to go but because you dont want to be rude and then you stay in a very uncomfortable situation because he told you to you only get freedom in the end by doing what you want and need to do in spite of the guys orders it seems like a horror story about being passive in other words but thats just my interpretation and i might just be seeing it that way because i tend to be way too passive and im working on being more true to myself gotcha thank you for clarifying were probably going to have to agree to disagree here but personally i believe holding fast to love and light is the only way to fight the dark responding with violence only begets more violence and round and round it goes nothing new about that i also believe that respecting the free will of others is essential to being truly loving and as such we,YourFriendMaryGrace

of who you truly are just something to consider if it doesnt resonate disregard happy birthday this is a synchronicity for me i had a strong urge yesterday and this morning to lie in the grass and get some sunshine i felt a little bad about it both times because my brain was so quick to remind me that theres chores to be done gotta get ready for work etc but yesterday my 2 year old seemed to read my mind and ran into the back yard and stretched out in the grass smiling i followed suit and then did it again this morning that little bit of spontaneous relaxation just for the pleasure of it seemed to set my whole body and soul on a better track reading this at 1111 oh my never knew about this before but its super intriguing thanks i think so too and i wonder if the magnetic pole shift believed to have happened many thousands of years ago may have messed up earths frequencies or messed up,YourFriendMaryGrace

decisions we made over the summer and the motivations behind them without going into boring detail basically the way i remember his motivations are completely different from the motivations he remembers not only having but discussing with me at length before this would have angered me and i would have thought he was delusional but seeing how me has effected us both differently some of the differences being cultural stuff that has happened since weve been married i feel like theres really no use trying to insist that im right about how i remember him feeling we might just be coming from slightly different timelines ohhh i get it now that makes so much sense thank you for clarifying gonna try it tonight do you set an alarm for every 90 minutes if nikola tesla and johnny depp had a baby thats really sweet one of my coworkers was telling me recently that his wife watched the andy griffith show every night at the same time after she passed away he was watching a,YourFriendMaryGrace

tends to tell stories to help us work through whatever were consciously thinking about you might really enjoy taking something like meyers briggs to help you get to know yourself better i was in the same boat trying to figure out who i was without the outward influences and it really helped me to take this and read about my type if the first result you get doesnt feel like it describes you very well try this one hope that helps re your post title you might find it interesting to check out the recent research coming out on the nature of our dreams it would seem that they are often meant to be helpful in processing our emotions and experiences anyway i think the finale of the dream is quite interesting because bathrooms are where we tend to our most private business and in dreams they often represent the same thing but youre in a public bathroom which seems to be a hint that this is symbolizing a private element of your life,YourFriendMaryGrace
that is difficult to keep under wraps the costume or rather pretending that you are wearing a costume makes me wonder if theres some part of yourself or your personal life that you try to disown in front of others but you are the best interpreter of your dreams since you alone know whats on your mind and whats happening in your life if any of this was helpful awesome but if not please disregard asking for help is an act of strength not weakness theres nothing pathetic about it and the sooner you can accept that the faster youll be able to make some strides this has been the biggest lesson ive had to learn this year and its tough its sad because we come into the world as little babies who are completely dependant on others for survival and we accept this about ourselves naturally but over time we internalize messages about being independent and forget that humanity wouldnt have survived nor would it continue to survive without relying on each other,YourFriendMaryGrace
its natural and human to need help and by asking youre giving people like me a chance to experience the joy of lending a hand another thing i see in your post is the negative spin youre putting on your life story i have failed at many things as well but thats just one way to look at my life i could just as easily frame my failures as many different things ive had the opportunity to learn the story we tell about ourselves is very very powerful and sets the stage for our future so look again at your life experiences and think about how much youve grown what youve learned what lessons and experiences youve had that you can utilize in your new chapter i also recommend taking a personality test that can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses i really like meyers briggs which of course is not perfect but has really helped me to understand myself and how i best fit into the world okay i could go on,YourFriendMaryGrace

a sign im on the right track i think we live in the midst of infinite timelines and repeating signs that feel positive are basically a function of the more optimal timelines happy cake day friend thanks for sharing this great picture of your handsome pops and uncle you are an amazing artist this is beautiful the most effective tip ive found is setting the intention as youve already done by jumping and carrying on as if its already done think about it like placing an online order you trust that it will come to you but you dont expect it to show up instantly or order it again and again you just place the order and know it will be delivered it also greatly helps to put it out of your mind as much as possible and when you do think of it practice feeling grateful for the thing youve asked for in other words think im so thankful that i get to have rather than why havent i gotten my yet ahh,YourFriendMaryGrace
fair enough well i wish you the best of luck and if i can help you with your experimentation lemme know i think your belief in it working is pretty helpful so going into it expecting it wont work may manifest exactly that not working i wouldnt advise you plan on trying again for the same thing rather do your best to expect the jump you already did will work that being said i typically wait at least a week between jumps more gradual methods can be found at rlawofattraction or rnevillegoddard ive had success with both but mostly prefer these over the jumping methods loving and forgiving people brings you much greater joy and peace of mind than holding onto your frustrations and pain easier said than done i know but worth the effort every time narwals are not a fictional creature i used to coordinate weddings brides and grooms were 10x easier to deal with than the parents of the couple tended to be moms of the bride and groom ime are,YourFriendMaryGrace

in fear of crunching another one it took my husband a while to convince me to start walking again and almost as soon as i did i stepped on another snail rather than get stuck again or ya know watch where i was walking i decided to make a run for it crunching snails and screaming all the way home st johns wort its otc and remarkably effective also just taking good care of myself even or especially when i dont feel like it specifically i try to have at least one green smoothie every day so im sure i get at least 45 daily fruits and vegetables getting out in the sunshine exercising several days a week limiting my internetscreen time and making time to do creative stuff this is not medical advice by any means but personally i took antidepressants for years and they werent nearly as helpful as all of the above also finding friends who arent judgmental and will listen to my problems and empathize ive been fortunate to find,YourFriendMaryGrace

what i would consider a download for me days with big energy shifts or upgrades often make me feel super restless like i need to run sprints or something and in the days following i often find myself having enormously helpful dreams about my emotional life sometimes i make unplanned changes for example on 8818 which is sometimes called lions gate i suddenly lost all interest in eating meat others found that their habits and addictions were suddenly much easier to kick now that youre aware that these things often come in waves youll be able to make note of your own personal symptoms its different for everyone yet theres a lot of common experiences id love to hear about your achievements if youre comfortable sharing i think its really cool you live in ireland i spent the summer in dublin one year and loved it my kids are only 4 and 2yo but i hope they grow up to travel and have different experiences as for always being the one to reach out,YourFriendMaryGrace

be something from your past or even worries about the future that are surfacing if you feel like sharing your dreams or even just some of the recurring themes id be happy to help out front yards usually represent the way you present yourself to others or how you feel like youre perceived toilets are typically used in private so having to use one on the lawn would seem to be a metaphor for you feeling like your privacy and personal business are exposed think about what in your life has madeis making you feel vulnerable and it might help you hone in on what your subconscious is trying to help you with we really are my friend i love how the internet enables us to find our kinds of people i couldnt agree more about the monetary system i really believe well evolve out of it or it will simply collapse at some point in our lifetimes in the meantime im sending you abundance vibes with all my heart were gonna make so,YourFriendMaryGrace
many people happy with our random tips gifts and donations edit another thought i had that seemed to come from somewhere greater than me if i really want to peacefully disrupt the system and i do what better way to do so than to open myself up to greater abundance and redistribute it myself it seems obvious now but it was a revelation when it came to mind yesterday you got me thinking with your post so thank you as well its funny you mention the financial stability ive been having this realization over the past 24 hours that i dont need to be broke to be a good person not that theres anything wrong with being poor in fact i think guys like jesus and ghandi are in part why i have been afraid to accumulate money but for now i see that getting to the point where im not worried about the bills and actually have enough to take care of myself and others would better enable me to give freely and,YourFriendMaryGrace
use my gifts of service its a wildly different perspective but it seems like im getting the message that being financially strapped is actually keeping me in a place where i have to think about my needs more than i would without financial stress i think too that i need to learn to trust myself im terrified to turn into a selfinterested rich person who is negligent in the needs of those less fortunate so i keep myself in a situation where im always busy trying to make ends meet which isnt really helping the less fortunate either the silver triangle i havent had the chance to watch your video yet but your title is a little synchronicity for me as ive had the phrase you cant pour from an empty cup running through my mind lately i have two children 4 and 2yo a husband a dog a cat two parttime jobs friends and family who have their own emotional and practical needs i try to fill the list goes on and i,YourFriendMaryGrace
can do a lot but i tend to be selfsacrificing to the point where i simply dont take the time to nourish myself or get enough sleep i used to consider taking care of myself as service to self but i no longer see it that way i see that getting adequate nourishment and rest putting on clothes that make me feel confident instead of schlepping around in whatever i pull from the drawer first exercising getting out in the sunshine and putting on makeup or earrings or whatever else feels fun that day these things allow me to open my arms wider and work harder for others to me the only real difference is intention im refilling my cup so i have more to pour out not so i can keep it full and set it aside just for me as for the darkworkers thing i actually never heard that term until this week but it perfectly describes my pastlife memories on a spaceship and essentially what i do best in this life,YourFriendMaryGrace
i seem to have a knack for walking right up to the bad guys and diffusing situations breaking up fights etc which is kind of funny because im tiny but when i first ground myself in love and light i am somehow able to gently talk down angry men who could chuck me across the street if they wanted to lol but it is essential to do so as though they are my beloved brothers because they are so i consider myself a lightworker i just thrive in the presence of darkness and transmute it the best i can this sounds like a game i would have played all day you should try rtipofmytongue,YourFriendMaryGrace
