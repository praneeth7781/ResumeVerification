i dont know anything about fashion week either but this does not sound legit at all tell her not to pay anyone any money for anything you know you did the right thing in breaking up with him he wasnt being a good partner to you you seem to think him going to therapy has somehow made whatever intimacy issues he has disappear thats probably not the case he may be having sex with whoever the new guy is but will it continue you had no issue in the beginning also he may get this guy get comfortable and stop having sex with him too im not so sure that being in contact with him is good for you youre having a really hard time getting over him but really you shouldnt be you have so much going on in your life youre successful good looking have new friends basically youre a catch speaking with someone is good it might help you re think what exactly you are so upset about losing maybe instead,Mentalcomposer
of being sad about him or what hes doing start being mad mad that he refused to be a good partner and put in the work that needed to be done mad that he robbed you of 6 years that you could have spent building a life with someone who values and appreciates you youre not broken maybe a little bent but bendy things bounce back and you will too no she says she doesnt want to block ppl from the past and its toxic and youre stronger than that but he was already blocked until now so why did she unblock him now somethings not right i hate saying it but is she lining him up for when she gets rid of you how long are you married is everything ok i dont know what you should do because if she shows you that she blocks him shell just unblock him when you dont know if you truly think youre heading for a divorce instead of getting back together then start divorcing him,Mentalcomposer
that way theres no way he can get citizenship even without your documents if youre no longer married and tell your fam whats going on so they dont help him i have 3 kids and am 1 of 6 siblings might have been ok to have 4 i always thought of it like this between both parents we have 4 hands so we can hold hands with 4 kids but no way in hell would i have gone past that there is no way to really give any substantive time energy or affection to a dozen kids while i agree with you the diff is the friends wife specifically made sure that op was not invited to their wedding even tho friend wanted to invite her i wouldnt invite her either and friend can decide if he wants to come solo its also good for your liver cleans it out or something we always have it in our house use it on beef or cocktail sauce honestly you really couldnt afford to go and,Mentalcomposer
then you wanted to be there for a whole week you should have gone the day before the party and left the day after you would have seen everyone at the party this is the third time ive seen this same post and the second time you left out running into the nearest store and not coming out youre not getting whatever answer you want so you keep trying ok heres the answer you want hes a fool to have ever stopped wanting to date you you are just the most amazing woman on the planet and how he didnt see it is a mystery to all of us because we can tell with your obsessive need to harp on this one date and why he didnt want you that you would make an absolute splendid partner if he would only see that all would be right with the world s if you couldnt tell there happy you got the affirmation you so longingly hoped for please get some help based on your post,Mentalcomposer
n t a butyou dont say how old both are or how long youre dating im gonna need that to try to figure out why this whole situation is bizarre the way you word it were your parents out of town or something these are things you sit down with your parents and discuss your bf asked permission to ask you im gonna guess your dad didnt say he wanted him and your mom to be there not that i think bf should have done that but he could have had that convo with your dad at that time hes not affectionate enough but they forbid that what exactly is it about him that they do not like what are they seeing that makes them think youll be disrespected if you marry him what signals is dad seeing that you dont or you know you can be happy youll be away from these crazy people once you marry nta why do i think your bro purposely either didnt tell fianc you couldnt make that,Mentalcomposer
date or picked that date just to screw with you im sure by now his fianc knows about the conflict so what does she have to say about it and how is it that nobody ever mentioned to her that date is off limits does she never see your family does she never talk wedding things with your mom id go to the friends wedding your bros was planned after and youre a groomsman the mere fact that her dad called your mom about this is staggering to me who is he to get involved is his d so upset that her future bil cant attend weird just tell him to open his own investment acct most people dont really share an investment acct whats wrong with just not having sex with her until she is more secure that this is going somewhere its only been a few weeks if you like her you wait if she doesnt want to respect that and drop it and if you really cant date her without sex,Mentalcomposer
then be honest with her and tell her that our rule of thumb was 1 sport per season and 1 non sport we had 3 kids so if a sport had 2 practices a week and 1 game that was 9 places we had to be every week plus 3 more for the non sport the non sport thing was usually once per week but that depends on what they do as they get older some non sports become more frequent dance gymnastics and if they play a sport on a hs team thats every day plus a game but its not that bad because they go right from school so its just a later pick up i was realistic about activities with the kids unless they showed an absolute talent for an activity there were no private lessons no travel teams i knew parents that had their grade schoolers in private sport lessons or dance classes 3x a week they got bored at some point and quit and this is a very small,Mentalcomposer
sample size but i can recall 2 kids who actually played semi professionally and one didnt even start till hs so encourage what they want to try but dont make their schedule rule the household just my very personal opinion and you just lay there while hes getting off id be up in a flash and there would be a reckoning he really cant disrespect you anymore by doing that jfc say something idk about others but its my experience that long term couples do not stop having sex because of weight gain especially if both people have gained some im talking nominal amounts of weight not excessive snapping his fingers and pointing at his dick would get him a kick in the balls anything having to do with ig i cant comment on as i or my partner do not use any sm that involves following sex workers for me all of the above adds up to breaking up i refuse to be in a sexless disrespectful relationship you should rethink your self,Mentalcomposer
worth and decide if this is what you deserve and i really hope you come to the only decision it can be esh while i understand just how upset your wife was and not being able to reach you when theres an emergency just compounds the worry been there 8 mo pregnant done that the thing is she knows your phone gets locked up so calling it would do absolutely no good if youre ok you dont have it with you to answer it and if youre not ok you wouldnt be answering your phone anyway so either scenario is not going to get her the answers that she needed anyway yelling at her isnt going to help the situation but getting written up when this was an extenuating circumstance is pretty crappy of your job did you explain to your boss about the d d and the override and just how worried your wife was id suggest you give her the number to an office where she can actually speak to someone in,Mentalcomposer
case there is an actual emergency like if a family members is taken to the hospital not to ask you to bring home milk hotspurs advice of approaching this talk as coming from a place of love is the way to go stress that it really has nothing to do with matt and how you feel or not about him its more about how you feel and care about your friend best of luck but she doesnt own half theyre not married so assets wont pass to her if he dies and her name is on nothing the biggest problem in all this is that at the time you purchased homes 23 you didnt insist that your name be put on the deed it doesnt matter who put the money toward the down payments who pays the bills or any other thing your name is not in the deed therefore if you two split up he is sole owner of all those properties idk if by not putting your name on the deed was,Mentalcomposer
due to you having a lower credit score which would make getting a mortgage together harder or youd get a worse rate or if it was your reasoning if scamming the govt idk how that even works to be honest but for whatever reason if you think you should be a legal half owner of these properties the only way is to have your name added to the deed if youre counting on him to put it in his will that you get all his assets if when he passes then you can do that but im pretty sure if he passes as it is right now his assets will go to his next of kin and that is not you you were very shortsighted when it came to protecting yourself not that i blame you being how long term you two are but if i was you id get all the papers that i need to add my name to the deed of at least one home bring it to him and fight,Mentalcomposer
with him cause it will be a fight to sign it and then get it filed ill just add hes a pretty crappy partner in that he doesnt have care in the world that you will be left homeless if something were to happen to him you are being a hypocrite he can do playstation and play games which they talk to each other while playing but you wont let him just plain talk to his friends lighten up if you must keep your insane amount of control then make his down time from midnight to 8 am what do you expect him to do after 9 pm in the summer youre treating him like a grade schooler i agree with everything hotspurjr said it is possible that since theyve been together for so long that your friend just doesnt see a way out he may be unhappy but not know what else to do he may be ok with his life but you wont know that until you talk with him if you,Mentalcomposer
can do it offer him a place to stay somewhere he can get a better perspective on what his life has become please talk to him i think you should sub for a year or so before you go back to school make sure you actually like it i went back to school later than you and i got my degree in education i wanted to be a middle school science teacher loved the material my last year of schooling was my student teaching year i came home crying more days than not it was absolutely horrible and i never worked as a full time teacher shes not wrong for asking but her timing could have been better its not like you just met if arent comfortable with being with someone with a high count or a low count or any count then you find that out before youre engaged in what could lead to adding to their body count maybe this time things progressed faster and further and she wasnt expecting it to,Mentalcomposer
go as far and never got around to asking before sorry i think i did wrong thats federal maybe so i just looked at my nj 1040 if you have to pay send it here nj division of taxation revenue processing center pi box 111 trenton nj 086450111 include san and make check payable to state of nj tgi if you do not owe send here nj dept of taxation revenue processing center po box 555 trenton nj 086470555 took a pic but it didnt copy here you go yeah but my kids have friends ive known for years but mainly from the occasional time they come over hearing about them over the years but im not sure if id want to vacation with them i think thats what theyre saying they dont really know this guy if this guy hasnt hung out with the family for any amount of time you really never know if everyone gets along or not that would suck to find out on a vacation dont answer any requests,Mentalcomposer
from people you dont know ir set your acct private idk ig so is that even possible ignore ignore ignore if you blocked them everywhere how are they reaching out to you does she have any friends to talk to maybe she wants to talk about you so she cant talk to you about you is there anything new happening in her life that would bother her is she going off to college in the fall if in the us maybe shes afraid being apart or maybe she wants to break up and be single in college or shes just looking for attention ask her if its any of those things but id tell her she looks pathetic posting things like that nta youve let your bro decide the relationships you have had with family members for the last 4 years its time to take back the ones you can salvage but id leave your wife home she doesnt deserve the vitriol and can i just say for a person who is antimental illness,Mentalcomposer
he sure seems like hes a candidate for intense therapy what is it about your wife that he hates with such an intensity does or did her ocd impact him in any way when you were all living together im missing what she could have done that just the sight of her has him going into a tantrum are you sure youre the only one shes seeing you barely see this woman its been 6 months you see her once a week she ignores your texts and your intimacy is close to none what exactly are you getting out of this relationship she may be a great woman but it feels like youre more just friends you need to have an open and honest conversation about all of these things and whatever else is bothering you its great you like her enough to give her time to work on her issues but how much time are you willing to wait you two should be growing closer but it seems like youre at the same,Mentalcomposer
place you were when you first started dating the only part i cant figure out is why she would talk of a future when she barely sees you i wouldnt be staying at her place the majority of the nights and i absolutely wouldnt be moving in after 6 months you have a place use it dont you just ever want to have time to yourself come on give the relationship some time and space stop playing house after such a short amount of time if its meant to be itll still be there in another 6 months or a year and if its not then you saved yourself some angst idk whats going on with her searches it could be as simple as she just wants to see who they moved on to or just curiosity what theyre up to but my advice still stands slow it way down why did she put her clothes outside of the bedroom is this the norm do you also leave your clothes outside the bedroom i,Mentalcomposer
want to say this cannot actually be real as i cant imagine you could have failed your d over and over again yta in what universe does a woman not immediately throw the pervy disgusting man out of the house the second he gets done saying hes attracted to your d this cannot possibly be someone you want to continue to be married to youre trying to fix the wrong things but it seems youve been doing that for the whole of your ds life your first marriage was so bad that your d has developed mental health issues from it you stayed too long with a man who was no good for you and your d your d is being bullied yet you once again made the wrong decision on how to handle that situation take a shower thats the absolute best you could do mom oh im sorry i see you were too busy trying to salvage a horrible marriage s then you marry yet another man who is creeping on your,Mentalcomposer
d and once again you made the wrong decision heres a tip your marriage is not a healthy one is it any wonder that your d disassociates shes trying to block out you shes an introvert of course she is she stays to herself because she knows she literally has no one to support her so your solution to that is to put her out of the house how in the world do you think that is going to help her since you dont know what to do ill tell you kick the h out have d live with her dad leave your d alone youve done enough fixing get into therapy to figure out why you are possibly the most self centered selfish and mean mother to your d explore in therapy why you choose absolutely horrible men get your d into therapy so she can heal the wounds you left her with somethings odd here if your friend group is all marrying at such a young age why is that is it,Mentalcomposer
a religion thing because i cannot even imagine how or why your friends think its a good idea to marry while still in school you need to be up front and tell your gf that there is no way youre going to propose until youre done with school and have a steady job you have told her that before and you havent changed your stance in this if that doesnt work for her then as much as it would hurt you will let her go to find someone who wants to marry on her timeline its impossible to think that you arent doing anything that bothers him or annoys him not a knock at you but nobodys perfect but maybe its just not that big of a deal to him at the time he gets a bit annoyed not enough to mention it he takes it in stride and moves on so maybe the things that you bring up he feels are just not that big or important enough that it should bother you,Mentalcomposer
as much as it does you can of course feel the way you feel idk if thats the case but maybe think about the things that youve fought about and ask him if thats the case ask him what are the things he gets annoyed about with you that he doesnt bother saying anything about he might just be a real laid back doesnt sweat the small stuff kind of guy yta did you ever think that jacob was a bit freaked out and got quiet when your answer meant that you were the cheater since he knows your stance on cheating since he thought you and nick were dating then why were you the one cheating in his mind esh you because you didnt know what to say to her how about be honest shes nice youre enjoying spending time with her but kids are a dealbreaker for you so lets not waste both our time just as casually as she mentioned having a child you could have just countered with you being,Mentalcomposer
sure that you dont want kids and that its unfair to both of you to continue this as a romantic thing her for waiting weeks to let you know about her child she should def be more upfront with that info either a guy wont care and continue dating to see how it goes or she wont waste her time with guys who are opposed to kids what would she do if she finds a guy she really likes and he isnt ok with kids shes setting herself up for hurt i agree she needs a man who will love her and her child but she has to weed out the ones that dont want kids first how in 11 years do you still not know his exact views on marriage thats a conversation you have to have if he says he doesnt want marriage then you go your separate ways and find someone who does if he says he believes in marriage but never got around to it mainly because you havent talked,Mentalcomposer
about it didnt push the issue etc then you tell him to get a ring and youre planning a wedding stop sitting around waiting for things that you dont express you want if your ex was in the bed with them what does she say about it did you tell your ex what your d said about the tickling id tell my d that if anything makes her uncomfortable that she yell and scream her little head off if she kicked up a big enough fuss mom wakes up and sees whats going on id call my lawyer and ask what can be done can you change your agreement that d is never to sleep over this creeps me out he wouldnt come his wife wont let him hes got to forget his other family hers is the only one that matters i sure hope your aunt and grands know all about what his wife said to you tell his side that they can tell him all about the party and to do it,Mentalcomposer
in person and to watch carefully to the wifes reaction at the mention of your name thatll be all the proof they need that your dad is well and good out of your life and why the thing is you just dont like him not you dont like the father he is you dont like him as a person if you met him and he wasnt your dad would you want to be friends with him because once were all adults its less about being parentchild and more about being friends of course parents still think of their kids as kids and kids think of parents as parents but its a more level relationship he came back when you were a young adult on some level you wanted needed him to be the dad that you somewhere in your head had an idealized version of its just taken you a bit longer to realize he is never going to be that person you also have some unresolved feeling of something not really toward your,Mentalcomposer
half bro but toward your dad for favoring him but it still hurts and it hurts on a deep level that you probably buried so as to not rock the boat when he came back into your life so you have to decide if you can accept him warts and all or if you genuinely just dont like him as a person enough to cut contact theres nothing wrong with either decision youve made a good life for yourself despite his non support and youll continue to do so its not an easy decision i wish you peace with whatever you choose thats crazy at least you can escape to the other room what is the temp outside do you at least have a fan i always feel better if a fan is blowing on me basically the games are exactly the same minor leaguers are farm teams for the majors so theres talent there minor leagues are smaller stadiums so less people and they sometimes do some fun stuff between innings theres no,Mentalcomposer
major league team in nj youd have to travel to the bronx in ny for a yankees game or queens in ny for a mets game both sort of far from jersey id suggest if youre in south jersey for anything else to maybe check out a philadelphia phillies game nicer ride to get there and nicer neighborhood i think theres a train there too but i dont know enough about it and if you go you must eat a philly cheesesteak atlantic city is fun beach boardwalk casinos asbury park is cool to walk around and theres usually some kind of concert going on tour the battleship nj the pinelands might be interesting take in a minor league baseball game the jersey shore blue claws you two are so perfectly matched and i dont mean in a good way ill leave it at that but i would have serious reservations that a person who claims to love me could be that cruel this woman was a huge part of your bfs life for,Mentalcomposer
a long time and he at one time loved her too dont forget that part idc what she did back when you were only dating for 6 months she showed up where you were and yelled at you boo hoo had her friends be mean to you on sm aw you must have been traumatized but she was a young woman scared and wanting to be with the person she loved to help alleviate some of her fears do i think he should have went back to her no but a little empathy goes a long way his callousness is just to great for me to ever overlook i dont think she caused you or your bf any irreparable harm that you or him should have demonize her to the extent you both did and even years later this guy has absolutely zero feelings even if not for her personally but for the knowledge that the person he onced love is dying and his only reply is basically i dont care shows his true,Mentalcomposer
character i wouldnt want to be you if you two have a really bad break up he has shown you that once hes done hes done and hell go scorched earth on anyone he did it to her and hell do it to you too since you agree he needs professional help why dont you suggest you will go with him not to a session but more to interview the therapists im sure the therapist would agree to this if you explain he had a bad time last time and is therapy shy because of it so youre trying to help him see they arent all terrible if you can get him started on that road you and him might feel better about him living on his own nta do whats best for your family meaning wife and kids your bro owns a house hes not using he can go live there you are not responsible for taking care of a grown man if your mom is so worried she can become his roommate,Mentalcomposer
if you consider gambling your job then you are a professional gambler she likes you but doesnt want anyone to know if you date shes doesnt want to be your wife men get better looking with age yet you dont think youre good looking youre talking about wifey material which is kind of gross but you want to have a wild phase who thinks like that if it happens it happens i doubt most people plan that out so you just want her to be the start of your wild phase you admit to not being mature enough for a relationship so save the people you are even thinking of dating or having a situationship the trouble she works for your dad if this goes sideways its gonna get ugly for you her and your dad this is a disaster waiting to happen esh just cause youre both too stubborn im sorry but this made me laugh this is such a silly thing to argue about if thats the worst it is in your,Mentalcomposer
marriage consider yourself lucky does it really matter why he doesnt like you smelling of old spice i think youre looking too much into that it is possible that your body chemistry just doesnt go with the old spice smell like how some perfumes just smell awful on some people go back to your own products and move on what i replied to was the assertion that nobody loved the kid enough to set up a college fund thats unfair to a lot of parents who dont have the means i pointed out just my thoughts in regard to that one statement it has nothing to do with should she pay or not you should try moisture wicking underwear thats kind of unfair no do you also feel that low income parents dont love their kids if they cant afford college how about single parent households where dad or mom skipped out how about families where one parent has died and the surviving one is just making ends meet loving your kid is not,Mentalcomposer
dependent on whether you have the means to set up a college fund or outright pay for college nta dad paying his support all these years has nothing to do with paying for college they are 2 separate things unless his divorce says he has to pay his half which i doubt because mom wouldnt be telling son dad has to pay all of it if she knows legally hes on the hook for half because then so is she interesting that kid isnt the least bit pissed at his mom for not having the money for college no threatening to not talk to mom anymore its just dad he seems to think has to fund this endeavor for all those saying dad should have been saving for college nobody mentioned that it seems mom isnt saving either if by age 8 she told the kid to tell that dad had to pay dad is not obligated to pay did we forget that there are lots and lots of families that havent saved any,Mentalcomposer
money for college no one is demonizing them yet because sm makes apparently good money shes obligated for the sole reason that she married the dad dad can continue his support amount for the 4 years that kid is in college but that still isnt going to totally fund the college bill theres also no indication that dad and sm arent going to provide info for fafsa so until that comes out its also a non issue what op is saying and i agree with her is that once the kid has gone thru the college app process and fafsa forms and any scholarships the kid might get shes not paying the bill for his college and she shouldnt have to it doesnt seem like her husband is the one pressuring her to do it its just the ss who she is not obligated to if kid wants to cut dad off over this thats his choice but you still cant blood from a stone if dad doesnt have it he just doesnt have,Mentalcomposer
it can i just point out also that the expected family contribution that you get after fafsa does all its calculations is wildly inaccurate at least for my 3 kids i dont remember the exact numbers but i remember thinking theres no way we have an extra whatever the number was it was in the multiple 10s of thousands i agree with you only on some of these points but i think op should reply back and start a dialogue while i understand the anger of the son thru and after the divorce and the op tried everything he could to see his son until he was so beat down that he stopped at some point he had to get on with his life and at that time he knew his son hated him and never wanted to see him i think he should meet up with the son to see just what he has to say for himself there are a lot of years that the son could have reached out and he,Mentalcomposer
didnt he may be feeling guilt over that or maybe becoming a dad has made him realize the love that a father has for his kids and that his dad did actually love him id want to know if the son actually realizes just how badly he hurt op my biggest fear for op would be that he and his son get back in contact and the op isnt this idealized version of the dad that the son wants him to be when we grow up with our parents we see them and know their morals values ideas on life their sense of humor their politics their faults and strengths and we accept them because all these things we have seen day in and day out and were used to them im afraid that the son will find his dad lacking in some way and reject him again im not sure op will be able to come back from that a second time or we can look at is as trying to be a,Mentalcomposer
bit more equitable to your partner of two years who you would assume you love since youre moving your relationship forward but i guess im an outlier in that thinking gonna have to work on my me first attitude maybe she should start charging him for all the house chores and cooking she does since just because she has sex with him doesnt mean hes entitled to her labor its either a true partnership or its not slightly esh what is it about weddings that make people literally lose their common sense civility and decency i have never in my life heard of getting a dress approved for most normal weddings everyone is told the bridal party color and people just stay away from that in this instance i would have stayed well clear of any shade of green so thats your ah part your brother is the biggest slight ah for going off on you you said youd return the dresses that should have been the end of it and to say that,Mentalcomposer
you bought the same exact dress they did for their d is absurd what are the actual chances of that unless there is literally only one store that you all have to shop at and if by some weird stroke of fate that is what happened you didnt fight about it you just said youd change dresses its not that big of a deal but then he brought your mom into it if he has a problem with her dress he should address it with her and then he got mean toward you with the name calling your mom is slightly the ah for buying a dress with green in it even if its floral there are a million other colors and patterns to choose why that she should just get a diff dress because as i said steer clear of any shade of green this wedding is a nightmare stop asking about it pretend like its a distant cousins event and just show up have you asked him if he is going to,Mentalcomposer
use that money toward rent and bills explain that thats what that money is meant for that you dont mind sharing that expense but you cant do a 5050 split because you dont make as much money suggest splitting your mutual bills by of what each earn and any money you each have left over is your own you live together you both go to school and both work but you do all the household chores why thats something you might want to revise also otherwise you can go back to however you were living before you moved in since you had to have been able to afford that stop being taken advantage of as far as the chores and figure out a mutual agreed fair way of splitting bills stop wasting your time you havent seen her in years and shes dodging you at every turn how old are you if you are of age where you can work then get a job some people have a job as a teen and are,Mentalcomposer
able to at least put some money away but many work while still going to school and use that money as their spending money and save nothing then we graduate hs and if were not going to college we get a job im not sure what your problem is with your parents not leaving you any money are you saying they are both now gone and didnt have any money to leave you in that case you should have known this would happen as you would have seen them struggle to make ends meet if they did have money and didnt leave any to you and left it to others or charity then you should also have some idea why they did that too im gonna need a lot more info to determine if you never worked and lived off your parents or whatever is going on its only been 4 months look at this objectively hes telling you he thinks hes incapable of taking care of a child think about that you may,Mentalcomposer
want to pretend that hes going to get all his issues straightened out and be able to be a participating dad but hes 29 hes been dealing with his issues probably most of his adult life he knows what he can and cant handle believe him and you think youll be ok with raising this child with minimal help from him but it wont just be the child youll have a disabled partner too and you say youre disabled also ofc i have no idea what either of your limitations are but you did lead with that this is not a good long term scenario for either of you nta i have no problem with him paying rent however i do think you should lower it its usually recommended to pay no more than 13 of your take home pay on rent now i realize rent everywhere is so overpriced at this time but i think if you want him to be able to stay sober you need to help alleviate just a little,Mentalcomposer
of the stress that might drive him back to drink if he doesnt have money stress and can actually save some money that could be a big thing just some food for thought but also can you just give the kid some credit for staying sober for a whole year you say youre not proud of him but just you saying it will go a long way he needs support and to feel like what hes doing now is a good thing dont withhold kind words hes sober but probably dealing with his mh issues still i think youd be better off not online dating girls and guys are going to pass right by anyone who is heavier just based on that dont you know everyone is a 10 and deserves a 10 your best bet is to join a club volunteer go out with friends and meet people check out meetup its an online thing where people post meet ups for a specific thing could be a sport a lunch or brunch lectures,Mentalcomposer
etc i def agree your weight will be less an issue once girls get to know you and once you find one dont try to keep her by spending on her that will lead to you getting hurt theres not a lot of strategy when you think about it the only thing id say is if you can afford it dont play the minimum but that doesnt mean you have to play max either i switch up but i always do 3 or 4 spins at a higher price than the minimum then move down and then up maybe if i play 10 or 15 spins and win nothing i move everyone has their faves so heres mine lightning links its a multi denomination with a min 50 i usually play 02 or 05 denom with a total bet of 250 or 5 heavenly treasure is fun because you sometimes get a random bonus but that max is like 8 or something so i go somewhere in the middle i wont win huge but,Mentalcomposer
im ok with that game of thrones for 3 is fun if you get a bonus 88 fortunes diamond is another fave if you get a winning hand with a diamond in the middle row the diamond grows and multiples the win just walk around and choose whatever looks fun to you good luck i hate days when it seems like all i do is lose and then i come upon something new and i live to play another day slight yta we married 34 years ago and i actually thought we got a good deal but when i talk to my 20 something kids whose friends are getting married there is no way we could have afforded our wedding and it was not extravagant by any means so i think you and i just havent been exposed to what things cost in the realm of weddings an example the average price where we live per person for a sit down dinner at a venue is 125 yes i was shocked too and im,Mentalcomposer
pretty sure there is no haggling to be had the price is the price photographers florists and decorators do this for a living they are professionals not people just doing it for extra cash so tell your son you had no idea how expensive things have gotten and you didnt mean to insult him and hes not spoiled and maybe give him another 5000 condolences to you and your daughter id caution you to not rush into anything it has only been 6 months i know everyone grieves differently but i cant imagine that your d is ready to have you dating and you should be sure that you are ready too its perfectly normal to be lonely after losing a spouse but you need to make sure you have processed your wifes death or you will not be a good partner to someone else no woman wants to be a substitute for a dead woman nta it was about time someone had the guts to actually tell her what everyone else has known,Mentalcomposer
for a while shes only 21 so she has time to get her life straightened out obviously she has addiction issues but i dont know why people are jumping to mh issues also she must know she has issues ask her why she hasnt done anything to get help for them have her explain it and then point out the flaws in her explanation and then find a place for her to go yta emy is a bully and a ringleader of the bullies a straight up mean girl and you dont even seem to care well i dont care that she had to sit on the porch you need to sit her down tell her what she did was mean and cruel and she had the nerve to do this in the other girls own home and that at the very least she owes ava a huge apology its ok that these girls dont have the same interests but its not ok that emy thinks its ok to make fun of someone elses,Mentalcomposer
interests and id be having words with the parents of emys friends just so they have an idea what their little angels are doing too ok so you need to find out where his head is at in regard to the baby what does he worry about what are his fears about being a father what does he fear about how or if your relationship will change you need to talk less about how you feel and what you want and more about what he feels and needs about this big upheaval thats happened even tho a baby is a good thing some people woman included are so fearful of the responsibility that they draw into themselves because they dont know how to deal with their fears men may feel they cant be vulnerable about these things their partner will see them as weak so as hard as it is try to put your issues in the back burner for a bit and concentrate on his you cant make someone show you that they,Mentalcomposer
love and want you they either feel that for themselves and act on it or they dont id take a brutally honest assessment of your relationship did his selfishness begin when you got pregnant after the baby was born or does it go back even further what did he used to do that he doesnt now i think youll find he has always been a me first and ill fit you when when i feel like it guy and you might have been ok with that when you had your own stuff going on maybe you worked saw friends whatever and you didnt even realize he wasnt as invested in you as you go back to work full time start making your own money and put the baby in daycare if he balks at that just tell him he needs to pay half and thats the way it is if he doesnt like that he can stay home and care for the baby you need to look out for you the baby and your,Mentalcomposer
future even if that doesnt include the bf stop thinking youre stuck with him just because of the child nta a few things need to happen here bf needs to tell her in as serious a ti e as he can that she needs to stop being so forward hes not interested he will never be interested and its disrespectful to him you and your relationship plus shes embarrassing herself bf needs to block her everywhere there is absolutely no reason she should even have his phone number why does she bf is not her car service she needs to figure out her own rides if she gets brazen and does or says anything when others including your fam is around he needs to say loud and clear to her to stop its getting ridiculous shes embarrassing herself whatever so others can catch on to how shes behaving im guessing your mom doesnt know this is going on you should clue her in even if shes judge mental that judgement should be on your,Mentalcomposer
sis not you or bf you can say innocently oh bf had to block sis because its been going on a while but hes gotten really uncomfortable with it so he did that and then told me if i was you i wouldnt say anything to her it is your bfs issue to fight if you get involved its going to make her think youre jealous or feel threatened by her thats a boost to her ego and shell keep going if she asks you or more likely accuses you of making bf block her just tell her he explained she was crossing lines and boundaries and he was tired of it you had nothing to do with it even if youre not close to your sis i wouldnt cut her off just limit contact you dont always have to answer every call or text why have any family drama happening its going to escalate and spill over to others at some point shell grow up and stop or get another bf the big,Mentalcomposer
thing for me was when he said he got used to you being gone and that its going to take a while time to build back up the connection really youve been together over a year and while it stinks that you had to be gone the last thing anyone would do is resolve to forget about a partner while theyre off working its not like you just up and went off on a grand adventure and left him home id be counting off the days till my partner came home and i agree that his behavior was and is atrocious you dont need to be made to feel bad for the job you have you should have a partner who misses you when youre gone and makes you feel appreciated when you get home cut him lose you gave him enough time for him to straighten out whatever it is thats going on in his head now he can have all the time to realize what he had no the fitted sheet covers,Mentalcomposer
the mattress then a top sheet lays on top of the fitted sheet and then you put the comforter on top of the top sheet the top sheet helps to keep the comforter from needing to be washed as often because your body isnt touching the comforter im on the fence about this one i theorize with absolutely no hard evidence mind you that since young kids have had screens in front of them since basically toddler age that may have altered their perception they are impatient because everything on a screen is so fast unable to stay on task due to the nature of games constantly changing so they dont have to concentrate too long on one thing and need almost instant gratification at all times because thats what a computer does all these things mimic adhd no that could explain why medication helps them their actual cognition is altered since their young brains are still developing but on the other hand i thought there was proven differences in actual brain chemistry in,Mentalcomposer
adhd people explains why meds help them so some may have adhd by nature and some may develop it by nurture in a way nta its about time someone told leah that your family vacation is not fodder for her social media i would go as far as to tell her no more pics of me ever if she wants to post your bro her bf not a problem but not anyone else as for the party first i would def tell her no phone you will hold it for her for the day or she can leave it in the hotel and no fan girl behavior these are your friends they are not there in a professional setting this is personal if she cannot agree to these boundaries then shes not welcome its may be hard for your friends to even let their guard down with her there anyway they dont know what shes going to spread around and im sure theyve been in that position before and if she gets out of,Mentalcomposer
line speak up dont let her get away with it even once id even tell the friends they can say something also if she does something they dont like so you broke up with ex because she moved now dating new girl but youll be breaking up when you move to the town ex is in ex wants to come but it will upset new girl you dont want to tell ex not to come obviously you dont want to upset the ex because once you break up with new girl and move to exs town you will go from new girl right back to the ex im not sure what that says about you but if i was new girl id break up with you now us too the idea that a relationship is hard work is so odd to me im of the opinion that the right relationship is easy it just works if i have to work at it its not worth it we just do sums it up perfectly nta,Mentalcomposer
you funded the whole party you had everything you needed if someone else bought and brought something i wouldnt be paying for it ive had lots of parties and covered everything if a guest brings something extra drinks desert etc thats meant to be shared with everyone theyve never asked for me to pay for it and i never did ill say this as nice as i can youre are being stupid paying any expenses for someone youve only been with for 4 months is just plain stupid adhering to her demand that you stop hanging out with people because she doesnt like them is just stupid staying with her when she doesnt get her friend to stop disparaging you is stupid putting up with her incessant complaining over little things is just stupid you giving in and giving every minute detail of where you go and with whom is stupid she can do whatever she wants with her room and hygiene but you dont have to go there if youre not comfortable with,Mentalcomposer
it thats you being wait for it stupid what exactly do you love about this girl she is bad for you and to you she basically sits around all day doing nothing and expects you to do what she wants when she wants get out now shes just not a nice person and a horrible gf congratulations thats awesome if youre made to sit thru the dvc pitch its not really bad there is no hard sell so go walk thru the model listen and then make your excuse why you cant buy or maybe you want to but i will say our first stay was in a 1 br at boardwalk that we paid cash for we walked thru the model got the details went home and called a few days later and bought in dont regret it at all and we were an every other year disney fam while the kids were growing up we do other vacations too oddly enough i just saw an interview on a morning news program with,Mentalcomposer
matt damon who said him and ben afflack have set up a production company and the main reason for doing it was that so everyone working on a production would be paid on a more equal basis im not sure how it all works but he did say there is so much bloat and since they know about it they figured out how to cut down on it something about each dept is separate from the others and he said paraphrasing everyone deserves to make more money sorry this is jumbled but it was on nbc ny this morning if you want to see it so if a few more of the more wealthy actors and actresses did that more non acting production people would want to work with them they could revise the whole system edited had the wrong network sorry i hate putting it this way but your financial support of them is your leverage you can basically sit them down tell them whatever you want them to know about how you,Mentalcomposer
live your life and if they give you any push back you cut off the funding is that mean sure and they can be mad what good is that going to do for them and if it somehow comes out so what you tell them its their fault that you had to resort to keeping your life secret because of the things they have done while you were growing up but they have to realize at some point that you are an adult who can make the choices you want and they have to come to terms with the fact that however they raised you has forced you to be so secretive but it also made you a responsible adult one who is supporting them if you can your drive when the kids would normally sleep that gives you a few good hours to get on the road we tried to time it so theyd wake up when it was time to stop for breakfast so if you leave at like 11 or midnight,Mentalcomposer
once they wake up and you get some food its only 5 or 6 hours left to go then theyre happy after a good sleep they can watch a movie or play games on a device that only lasts so long so things like mad libs was fun cause it kept all of us involved we did a lot of trivia on a game boy id ask the qs but the 3 yo cant really do that but you can make up your own qs for them based off of what they like things like what is the monkeys name in dora the explorer did i just date myself haha or whatever they like it might actually be good for him to live with friends is hes a bit of a peter pan let them show him how much responsibility it is to live on his own hell get used to cleaning up after himself doing his own laundry cooking for himself etc things he may be under a false impression that you would,Mentalcomposer
do for him since youre the woman and his mom probably did for him if thats the case if you want to buy a place i think you should do it this should be solely your decision buy where you want to live living on your own will also show you what its like to be responsible for the whole place but id caution you to not let your place become his place ofc he can stay over sometimes but dont make it every day and dont get into a routine of him coming over every day and you cooking for him iow dont do living together things all the time if youre not actually living together if it turns out that you two move in together then you can figure out at that time if the area you buy in works for both of you plus if he annoys you you always have a place to go back to im curious if the cruise was full im not sure i could handle a,Mentalcomposer
lot of sea days if the ship was crowded how long are you together nta i think i must have missed something here your 44 yo bf got pissy because you couldnt see him on friday night because you didnt feel well but youve been seeing him every fri mon since youve been dating what is wrong with him id expect a child to throw a tantrum when theyre looking forward to something and then it doesnt happen but not a grown man and who has a birthday weekend at his age and you didnt have any real plans except of course his end of the week hour long massage i wouldnt even bother contacting him he can get over his tantrum and apologize or he can get lost you are a fantastic artist nta its perfectly ok for you to have a solo or even a guys trip without her and she can do the same time doing something for yourself does not mean you dont prioritize the relationship it means that you,Mentalcomposer
prioritize your well being and enjoyment for a week out of your relationship what shes saying is if you go on this trip you wont have enough money to take her on the lavish trips you have in the past you wont have as much money to spend even tho you split the cost she says her gfs wont go but she hasnt even asked them take the cruise treat yourself and enjoy yta first off hes not your child you are his stepmom he has a mom second psych isnt a bad degree as long as he realizes that he cant be an actual therapist if he doesnt get his masters at least in my state i actually think there is going to be an explosion in the therapy field third you know the kid is not thrilled with you why in the world would you say anything about his future plans nod and say that sounds great youll be a great therapist well miss you when you go to college stop making,Mentalcomposer
problems and then claiming to be the victim reddit coins arent in any way shape or form crypto they are coins that can be bought and used solely to gift to other reditt posters for posts or comments they make they signify things like great advice wholesomeness etc so your ex from 8 years ago who has a partner and a child gets in touch for the purpose of having sex and youre entertaining this idea why why would you want to be someones plaything i would be so insulted and im not sure why you arent and didnt tell him to get lost nta honestly why are you even going to this wedding you knew this girl in college havent stayed in any sort of close contact its nice that you called when she got engaged but thats as far as it should have gone im trying to figure out why youd want to spend money on an event when afterward you will go back to being basically no contact with this person,Mentalcomposer
same as it was for the past few years you already wasted money on a big that you didnt go to why waste more nta news flash they are annoyed with you nta but only because im wasnt thrilled with leaving my kids in the house with friends at that age if i wasnt there either didnt matter the sex just too many things that could happen power goes out someone gets hurt they decide to make food etc but you did say they were going to play video games and you said that was in the lr where you have cameras so that would have been ok i dont think youre worried about pregnancy or even intercourse at this age but kids are curious and who knows what they could get up to but i will say you need to talk to your son about girls sex consent all of it he is not too young at all if hes as responsible as you say then give him the knowledge to be responsible,Mentalcomposer
you and your partner are what real love is give him a huge hug and kiss i wish you all the best but is it homophobic when op said in another comment that the wife didnt allow girls to sleepover before he came out i think its more that mom doesnt want to think that her teenager is having sex with anyone in the house doctor said she probably had it for a couple months not years theyve been together 6 months op says she knows bf passed it to her my reply is based on what she said nta at all this is your home too you go put your photos up shes being ridiculous what diff does it make when the photos were taken tell her youd love to put up family photos only from when you two met but since your parents arent here anymore thats gonna be impossible so should your parents never be displayed in your home your friends are your family will she never allow baby pics to,Mentalcomposer
be displayed how about your college diploma those was pre her how did you marry a girl who isnt mature enough to realize that your life didnt begin when you met her nta why is he not an ex already you have absolutely nothing zero nada to feel guilty for so he gives you an std and then told you it isnt his fault when it most obviously is his fault this is the first time you should have broke up with him then it gets worse hes tired of your problems that you couldnt blame him or bother him about it well if he didnt give you an std you wouldnt have this problem this is the seco d time you should have broken up with him get rid of him hes not worth any of this crap and he thinks sex is so important and not getting enough well thats why he has an std to begin with hes not very responsible with his own sex life hes not going to be,Mentalcomposer
with yours it anyone elses that still doesnt tell me what your mom wanted you to do did she want you in the home when the cleaners come since thats the only thing going on today im assuming she scheduled her dentist around that appt since she was the one who scheduled the cleaners so she was planning on being in the house anyway or does she want you to be there but didnt bother to tell you until today honestly tho deep cleaning the house before a party is a waste the party is in the yard so the only time ppl will be in the house is to use the bathroom really i have a relative who lives in easton and works in the city they take the bus its 90 minutes but they also have a start time of 7730 so i think theres less traffic earlier but the bus is at least a relaxing ride assuming youd be driving 78 i wouldnt drive all the way to newark to then,Mentalcomposer
take the train you might be better off driving to a closer nj train station to where you live and taking the train from there parking would probably be cheaper and youd almost certainly encounter worse traffic the further east you go on 78 get a nj transit schedule and see what the cost is from a few stations then look up parking rates and see how long the trip would be its not cheap tho our tix from central jersey are almost 30 round trip but a monthly pass will be discounted and parking here is a monthly thru the town so its also cheaper than daily but thats a resident rate also the commute is doable but you have to mentally be prepared for it day in and day out i need info it depends on what your mother wanted you to do the tent table and chairs are all set up youre not responsible for cooking food decorations cant be done today so what did she want you to do bridal,Mentalcomposer
shower things or general house things or something else nta so you have no contact with brother and you see your mom only when hes not around and he sees your mom only when youre not around that all sounds perfectly fine to me now as for nephews you really dont have to get gifts for them for the reason that you dont have a relationship with your brother i highly doubt those kids miss one gift from a person that they havent seen in over a year and might not even remember you exist nevermind why he does this does he ever say what he actually does like about you just tell him you dont like that he doesnt like you so youre cutting him loose to go find his tight glutted straight toothed skinny fit girl with blonde hair nta this is an amy problem she wouldnt have a good time if you go but you would have been just fine so she should have stayed home im taking bets amy is,Mentalcomposer
interested in paul and didnt want you there theyll be dating when they get home as it is now all three of you are each paying a third of the mortgage in an empty house that you all own equally you all own it equally thats the key if your sister lives in the house you all still need to pay one third of the mortgage because you all still own the house equally your sisters idea that she shouldnt be paying anything toward the mortgage makes no sense at all she still is obligated for her third of ownership therefore one third of the mortgage but if one is living in the house they should be paying all the utilities since they are the only one using them im curious what you three are going to do with this house in the future once the mortgage is paid off only one of you can actually live in it so unless that person can buy out the others youre going to have to sell,Mentalcomposer

your kids dont think its there fault that they cant see their friends honestly you need to let him go as a partner im dont know why he would even want to stay hes done nothing wrong and youve consistently treated him like trash its going to be very hard for him to trust you and even if he doesnt say it it will manifest in other ways stay single or dont commit to one person if you have to date that way you can do what you want with who you want as long as everyone knows thats the deal its only been 2 months in therapy do you really think thats enough time to say youve got it all figured out you may know what the underlying issues are but it seems your need to step out on a partner comes from how you feel about yourself you need to get to a place where youre ok with you before you can be ok with a partner good for you you look,Mentalcomposer
great nta if she knew how much money you made then she had this planned figured youd be so enamored with her youd agree since you were already living together just tell her youre not supporting her at all not fully not helping with rent when shes short nothing but a reasonable split whatever you agree to if she balks even slightly go get an apt by yourself or break up and move wherever you want do not let her goad you into giving her time to find another job that will not be happening and whatever you do do not get her pregnant id actually not even have sex with her unless she has a job but im overly cautious do not ignore your instinct on this one you knew it was too soon but you did it anyway yta just for having a 1030 curfew for a 17 yo and then also for tracking her every movement find out what her best friends curfew is and adopt the same one that way,Mentalcomposer
theres always someone else heading home at the same time as your d you say the river is dodgy but you then want your d to make her way home all by herself because none of her other friends are going to leave so early she has a higher chance of something happening to her if shes by herself were you long distance for the whole 4 years just do a mock booking on each cruise line site youll almost for sure have to do a 34 or 5 day and youll all have to share a cabin but you probably will only use it to shower and sleep so it may be tight but its doable keep in mind this is what youll have to pay base cruise fare taxes and port fees daily gratuities these are extra drink pkg any specialty dining keep in mind most people give their room steward an extra cash tip at the end of the cruise you dont have to its totally up to you so id,Mentalcomposer
check carnival ncl and royal caribbean the advantage to ncl is that your drink pkg is sort of included where you pay the 20 gratuity amount based off the full price of what the pkg would cost and youll get at least 1 specialty dining restaurant included again you pay just the gratuity carnival is fun but the drink pkg cost will probably put you over the budget for example a 3 day pkg is close to 200 i havent been on royal for a long while so i cant say anything about them also check out each ship some are smaller without all the stuff rock walls go carts etc if you just want to get away lay by the pool have some drinks visit an island or two to go lay in a beach youll should be able to find something that keeps getting said but the reality is that you just cant expect two teen girls to become fast friends just because their parents marry each parent should have been having,Mentalcomposer
continued conversations with their child and they should have been having ongoing talks with the others child also and they should have been having talks with all of them together and since theyre not averse to therapy they should have gotten some guidance there too op says his d was handling the transition ok but was she really maybe not if an argument over bread turns into insults and he says the step d was not no wonder remember this girl was moved to a new house probably a new school left all her old friends behind they are the same age so the same grade except d has been in this school has her friends and social life all ready in place and since sd was having a tough time she gets sent to therapy how did that make her feel and everyone thinks that isnt going to cause a conflict the girls should have been spending so much time with each other that any kind of issues would have come out and,Mentalcomposer
they could have been dealt with so no the kids dont dictate what the parents do but the parents needed to ensure a smooth transition for everyone and im not sure they did i think they thought there would be some bumps along the way but ill bet they werent expecting the girls to viciously go after each other so whats done is done but now the girls need someone to counsel both of them about how they can be respectful and civil to each other because if they dont figure it out the parents marriage will not last neither one will allow their child to be the victim of the other one most im gonna say i doubt that find better people even small colleges are big i wouldnt because i wouldnt even engage with someone with that view were you trying to change their mind why bother nta hes a grown man give him a list of all the doctors phone numbers and tell him to schedule and take care of his,Mentalcomposer

the only way i dont understand yet again why parents blend families when they know that one or more of the kids is not happy about it now they are stuck with this mess get both girls into therapy together they dont have to be even friends but they have to find a way to have some semblance of a respectful civil relationship she has basically told you that she doesnt want kids in a round about way forward sure but that comes from her knowing that this relationship will end if she tells you outright and she doesnt want that you can spend the next how ever many years together hoping shell change her mind but if she doesnt and finally gets around to being brutally honest with you you both will have wasted those years together she could change her mind but you need to decide if this is something you are willing to chance do you really want a child with someone who doesnt want them and is only having them,Mentalcomposer
to satisfy you what kind of mom is she going to be in that scenario she wont do the same to him cause hes a dr and has money shes an ex so i dont really know why you even care what she has to say unless the reason shes your ex is because she didnt want you to help your sister ever and you refused in that case good riddance ill be the downer sorry maybe its not that youre too comfortable but maybe its that youre both trying desperately to hang onto something that just isnt there anymore too many down times have worn you both out and neither of you have the will to fight back up to the good times so youre trying to force it with romance youre both not happy have nothing to talk about and dont enjoy each other and no amount of romantic gestures is going to change that you can try but she needs to be gesturing also why does it have to be you,Mentalcomposer
it reads as if shes looking for you to make her happy and feeling loved instead of both of you being happy and feeling loved it cannot be one sided im just curious who ties your shoes they do make no tie shoelaces if you think that would be something you want to try since its not just shoes maybe theres an issue with your fine motor skills or is it gross motor not sure if you have any physical therapists that work at your school maybe you can ask them nta has your sil never realized your d has the developmental capacity of a 3 or 4 yo shes obviously been around your d for the last 19 years does she think shes just going to magically outgrow her autism meet a boy get married and have children i commend you for doing what is really the best for your d why should she suffer but especially that she cannot understand why ok good i feel better for you so basically you allowed,Mentalcomposer

excuse in the book in order to not see that he is just a shtty bf you dont want to admit it because you think that will reflect badly on you that you picked the worst bf and stayed for years and how could you have been so stupid but every single person on this thread has given you the same advice and that is to not take him on vacation and to get rid of him and you know why because we collectively the women and also the men of reditt have had multiple years of dating experience we have gone thru done been there went back again and tried it all over again and we can tell you he is not ever going to change please listen to the universe you dont want some things to change you want a completely different boyfriend and you really should find one this guy is horrible did it really take you two years to realize that you do so much more for him than he,Mentalcomposer
ever did for you i think youre making a huge mistake taking him on this trip find a friend and take them someone who will pay their half and actually enjoy spending time with you because it doesnt seem like your bf is all that into you nta for saying no why do his friends even want to stay at your apt i wouldnt all i can think of is that my home would turn into party central but its not a stupid q because its also his home so he has the right to ask and at least he did ask do we really want to start this he packs it gets some things done thru the courts then when the presidency changes party they pack it even more get a few things done and rinse and repeat until when you didnt even advocate for what you wanted to eat why not thats on you if a date told me to order x and i wanted y id just say no i dont,Mentalcomposer
want that im getting y if he argues with me over it then hes not for me is he just stingy with money who knows you can continue seeing him for a few more dates but id keep it casual for now see if there are any other odd behaviors its fine if you dont want to date right now but the idea that you have nothing to offer a partner comes off as you arent happy with yourself so dont date continue finding yourself and along the way you will find if not a passion at least a hobby or activity that will make you happy once that happens you may or may not want to find someone to share yourself with do you really not know that being yelled out insulted and a door slammed on you is abuse are you waiting for it to escalate even further and he did this in front of his crying child seeing that didnt even make him stop hes a horrible person he needs to,Mentalcomposer
get help for his childhood baggage hes carrying around and then flinging at you its been 6 months cut your losses get out and never look back nta does your dad know that you want to work on your relationship with just him and that right now shes an impediment to that that you want to go one step at a time plus your mom is at the party im sure she doesnt want to see the affair partner there she probably would prefer hes not even there so tell him this is the best you can do at this time youre at least working on it he doesnt seem to be doing anything you know things arent going to change by the end of the year if he were planning anything more permanent his answers would have been more along the lines of that hes got a timeline not to worry hes thinking toward the future etc why should he change anything about his life at home his mom takes care of all,Mentalcomposer
the mundane chores he has no expenses and he gets to see you on the weekend to do stuff with he knows if you two move in hell have to contribute money and do chores be careful what you wish for if you move in with him youll be the one taking care of him and all the housework as great as he is do you want to be doing that wait you have a five year old and a dead bedroom for the past 5 years ive had kids and sure the sex was lagging a bit after each one for a little while but it never stopped completely never to be had again ask her why shes so averse to even discussing this issue if you say you communicate so well i honestly believe my h wouldnt have left me over no sex but he sure as hell would have needed to have at the very least a reason for why and id feel as though id owe him one for me,Mentalcomposer
thats an absolute never gonna happen would you even feel comfortable being with another man while being watched id never be able to get into it but i also view sex as private its not a spectator sport that being said there are people who find that exciting and a turn on and theres nothing wrong with that if thats you then go for it nta for not clearing it with your d but when its brought to your attention that shes feeling some way about the situation why wouldnt you just ask her whats going on not to ask permission more to alleviate whatever she is having trouble with ignoring your ds angst isnt going to be good for a relationship with her going forward and ifwhen this relationship ends you will have changed and possibly ruined the relationship you have with your d do you really want to take that chance nta go on the trip with your family it will mean a lot to your parents i know this cause im,Mentalcomposer
trying to plan a fam trip with my adult kids and its also a cruise plus your bf is 25 hes old enough that he shouldnt be pouting about his bday youll be home early enough to hang out with him stop not blaming him you have been with this man a year and still havent met his best friend enough times that she would give you a heads up about a party shes throwing him even if you two dont get along you should have been invited if he valued you as much as a year king relationship should he would have made apologies at the party and come to you the fact that he had no idea why you would be upset is staggering what the heck did he think you were going to do the night you had plans once he cancelled them hes not that invested in you im sorry to say i wouldnt waste any more time on him esh you deleted kyle off fb but did you ever,Mentalcomposer
actually tell him that what he said was rude offensive and uncalled for then you told chase you wouldnt travel with those two except for birthdays or their wedding why the exceptions id never want to be around those two chase took that as youre really not serious about not being around kyle chase is because he invited two people you dont like on a vacation without talking to you about it thats common courtesy you cant realistically stop them from booking but it might have been early enough for you to cancel and make other plans if the cruise is in a few weeks you cant cancel or youd lose a lot of money id still go but i wouldnt be anywhere near kyle or steve no dining together no excursions no hanging out at all and id let chase know that if he wants to hang with you and your wife if the others show up youre leaving once is an accidentgetting caught up in the moment two more times is intentional,Mentalcomposer
i say you should look for a used mazda 3 we had 3 still going strong until a month ago a 20102014 and 2017 older ones passed to kids when h bought a new one the 2010 was running fine but oldest traded it in for another model mazda these cars last with no major issues for us i will forever recommend this car but also call your insurance before actually purchasing to make sure of the monthly payment dont want any surprises and idk how you blew an engine but if it was something you did dont do that again please nta i dont think randy thought it would embarrass zach but now that he knows he wont do it again or at least until the girl jokes stop which is really a crappy thing to say you didnt tell your son to tamp down his out and proud gayness i hope that didnt come out as rude not meant to you just told him he should be a bit more mindful of,Mentalcomposer
zachs feelings zach is still feeling out how much and what public displays he is comfortable but if randy knows that zach is getting some slack he should have known this wouldnt go over well but theyre young and will learn and may need some guidance just like any other teen couple they do they make mistakes they learn and grow from it the thing with the auto gratuity is that you can have it removed at guest services on the ship this is what royal says about the auto grat according to royal caribbean gratuities are shared among dining bar culinary services staff stateroom attendants and other hotel services teams who work behind the scenes to enhance the cruise experience that being said if you remove the auto grat please tip these people whatever you are comfortable with but know that there may be ppl that you never see that might be included that will then miss out and the grat on any drinks purchased without having purchased the drink pkg is basically,Mentalcomposer
the tip you would give to a bartender or server kind of like everywhere else so you get your drink and dont have to give them a dollar or whatever now if you buy the drink pkg you pay the gratuity up front which again just means you dont have to give the server the dollar or so you are free to do it of course and some do and some dont as for specialty dining if you went out to eat wouldnt you tip your server most people usually tip at least 20 so the 18 isnt that bad nta why didnt you really mean what you said you are absolutely correct in what you said if his position is the male should be the providers and that the man pays for the woman and carry the burden then thats what he should be doing i cant believe he doesnt realize what hes saying as he isnt the provider hes not paying for you and he has no burdens to carry nothing wrong,Mentalcomposer
with you working and him staying home whatever works for a couple is good for them its his attitude thats messed up his friend calling you saying you were too hard on him can take care of bf with kid gloves all he wants now let him stay gone for a bit he might realize hes not as alpha his definition of alpha as he pretends to be yta i didnt even read the whole thing after realizing youre probably close to 40 if not older your gf is 27 and the first few lines of how nuts she is i didnt need any more info and based on the last paragraph you have a savior complex ditch the gf pay attention to your children and find a hobby instead of trying to fix the girl as your hobby really this isnt a hard decision go back to medical just tell them youre worried the headache is lasting so long better to be safe im surprised they didnt tell you to come back for,Mentalcomposer
a check in the following day i hurt myself on a ship and they had me come in every day to for a check in the things they were looking for were obvious signs that something was going more wrong so it seemed like overkill to me id be able to see and feel what they were looking for you dont have to justify anything tho you both know this marriage has not been working for a long time so her saying horrible things about you while hurtful to you really doesnt help or hurt your divorce case if anything she wrote show any kind of abuse emotionally or financially keeping that to yourself could be one of the grounds for a divorce you may be able to get a slightly better settlement due to that for instance if she says im keeping him around to support me while enjoying other men and i love seeing him miserable as i go out on dates maybe financial abuse maybe emotional i really do t know,Mentalcomposer
the answer to that tho ask a lawyer you cannot do this alone anyway might as well get professional advice consultations are usually free use them see more than one lawyer some may be more of a pit bull type wants to win but more so want to destroy the other side i wouldnt do that dont show her what you have go for the separation it might give her the push she needs to get a job which would help you financially in a divorce if she at least had some income and once youre separated go about your life knowing its only a matter of time until youre divorced and free to find your happiness that may be with another partner or even by yourself see a lawyer ask what the divorce might look like financially for you so that youre not blindsided with the lawyer try to figure out an equitable settlement and when youre ready present it to your now separated wife make it at least fair enough that she,Mentalcomposer
wont deny all of it but leave some room for negotiation youre very young still if hes this irrational now it will be worse if you marry him he is going to be gone to uni for a while how is he going to monitor your every move are you supposed to walk around with a camera so he can see where and what you do every second of every day but yet he doesnt have to account for anything that doesnt sound right to you does it forget the sex thing i realize it will weigh heavy on you but you need to come to terms with that aspect youll find a good guy who either doesnt care or who also has had premarital sex and that guy will not abuse you hurt you and try to control your every move you have to realize that nobody in a committed relationship wants to feel like they have to constantly reassure their partner whether that be that they love them are in for the,Mentalcomposer
long haul need assurances they are their number one etc its exhausting you wanted your partner to be your number one cheerleader yet you barely did anything to make her feel like she even mattered her promotion didnt matter only the co workers did therapy is good for you to know where your insecurities come from but you havent put anything you learned into practice why should she stay let her go she needs time to build herself back up because you sure knocked her down enough work on you if not to get back with this woman but for any future partners you will have what do you want us to revolt over are you willing to start this revolt there are two very large sides to every issue you will never get a big enough percentage of the population that agrees with more than one issue to have an effective revolt lets complain about gun violence and then propose a revolt which by its very nature needs armed people no thank you,Mentalcomposer
id rather keep on trying to change whatever i disagree with by working the system if thats voting or lobbying or hell even running for office in some capacity than have to live thru violence in the streets in every state or storming govt buildings or kidnapping and holding representatives hostage or whatever other means you think a revolt will look like do you want to live thru that what if you dont live thru that if your parents or kids dont lets at least pretend were a more civilized society then that please shes not thats just a fact wishing wont change that so your other comments indicate you have zero experience with anything sex related kissing making out foreplay without penetration is something most of us do as teens while dating thats how we learn so either start doing those things or let her go shes gonna get tired of the rejection you need to tell her at this point shes got to be wondering whats wrong with her that youre not,Mentalcomposer
sexually into her if you keep pulling back shes gonna break up with you if she feels youre not into her honesty is your friend nta youre way more nice than i would ever be what he wrote is disgusting and inexcusable i would have just put him out with nothing let his sister pay his fare home this guy was bad news from the jump you never even met and let him move in you had no idea who he really was did you really agree to just have him show up and do nothing while you supported him does your gf know youre a virgin and that youre nervous make sure you are completely comfortable with your gf work up to it do everything else then let her take the lead itll be a gradual lead up to actual piv sex she knows what shes doing but make sure you let her know if you dont like something shes doing stop worrying if youll be good enough and honestly you probably wont,Mentalcomposer
be but at first thats just due to your inexperience in time you two will forge your own satisfying sex life funny how he notices when you purchase a big ticket item for your enjoyment but doesnt notice when you could be going months without purchasing anything for yourself and thats what you need to explain to him not that you should even have to you wanted something that cost more than one month if your fun money so you had to forego your fun spend until you saved up it would be the same as if you bought a new chair one month the pc the next and the desk the next and gtfoh with his stupid buzz words what even is financial infidelity nta this is not normal behavior for a 17 yo why cant he live with his dad millions of kids have parents that go thru a divorce and dont need to live elsewhere why are they treating him with such kid gloves just leave your h isnt supporting you,Mentalcomposer
and id say being just as disrespectful as his brother was he just supposed to sit around and wait for when you decide you want to be with him you are the one who told him you couldnt date him when he asked why did he do it if he liked you so much because you rejected him and she was there and he wanted to so really if you would have just started dating him he wouldnt have been with her its been 2 years move on from this stop asking about it it really isnt your business anyway well not good that hes in jail but good that you visited im sure the message was to let you know he appreciates the visit i think the problem is that although you were together you were separated by distance when you date someone who you can freely see a few times a week you get to really seethat person you see how they live you see how they interact with their friends and,Mentalcomposer
family you see how they deal with stress and problems that come up you two know each other im sure but seeing the other is a diff perspective you two didnt get to do that the 3 weeks you spent together was like a vacation everyone on their best behavior now that you are living together you both are seeing the nitty gritty of each other it may be growing pains or it may be an indication that you two arent compatible idk what the small stuff is that youre arguing about but would it help if you have house rules chore charts and maybe even nights after work that you not spend together one of you stay in the lr one in the br just to give you each time to gradually get used to the other person always being there whatever the small stuff was make sure you completely resolved them and theyre not lingering do you see any kind of a future with someone who is this gullible really shell always,Mentalcomposer
be looking for the next get rich scam i wouldnt give her any money and i wouldnt pay for anything for her but id also break up with her yeah i found the idea that italy doesnt have lines odd ill wait my turn whatever im on line for will still be there when i get there nta you need to remind your bro and especially his gf that this is your and your other bros home they are guests if they dont like what goes on in it they might want to find another place to live youve been gaming before they got there and youll be gaming long after they finally get their adult lives on track free speech just means you can say anything you want it doesnt mean you are free from the consequences of what you say if social media wants to allow anything what are the chances that the whole platform will be taken over by either side i would think there are more users to any sight,Mentalcomposer
that are not extreme in their views and arent most sm platforms friend based where you are linked to your friends not like reditt where you can basically see anybodys posts in that case most people wont be seeing extremist posts unless they are friends with the person posting if they get through you block or mute it unfollow it whatever if the banter does i fact go back and forth then id say nah im guessing that your friend has moved to europe not that you moved to the us so its possible that she really is struggling with the cultural differences and even if its just silly banter to you id guess she may feel a bit ganged up on because there are 2 of you against her one so her misconceptions are pointed out way more than you and your friends if you sincerely enjoy this friend it might be worth it to message her and explain that any slights werent meant to hurt her you thought she knew that see,Mentalcomposer
what she says she may be really struggling and not know how to tell you for fear youll either make fun of her or not want to be her friend anymore and then id stop the banter thank you ill be in mostly big cities im not an aggressive person so ill line up and see how it goes while i agree wherever you go its better to adjust to how they do things it makes sense really but if everyone just rushed to the front of a line what does that look like is it really just a fight for who can push past first ill be in italy later this year so id really like to know do i really just walk to the front of any line are there any rules or social norms i need to know that you can share so i dont look like the rude american bravo well wellwell thatll do it conveniently left that out now did she you dont you should have been gone literally,Mentalcomposer
the day you found out what are you thinking why would you want to be with this person we are all trying to figure out what exactly you want us to tell you because any woman with any sense would have been gone you are 20 hes not the love of your life obviously cry yell curse his name eat lots of chocolate or ice cream whatever but do not even think about contacting him or anyone who knows him give yourself a week and then pick yourself up and start living your life do not let him take another minute if your time did she say why you are not invited did your bf tell sis hes not happy about that decision do you two not get along there has to be more to this where are you going to run to are you going to keep the baby if you are how are you going to support both of you rent childcarefood utilities is there a dad who is going to help,Mentalcomposer
you you need to think long and hard about what the future is going to look like whatever decision you make its up to you if you want to push this issue you can keep making your own foodbut id be making sure everyone knows mom isnt as accomodating to her own d as she is to the in laws gee wouldnt it be nice if mom liked me as much as you bil shes so thoughtful of your allergy or when youre invited you can ask what shes making and if its not something you can eat just keep declining it sucks cause im sure its fun to be around everyone but maybe shell get the message when her family isnt all together youre nta for getting upset but what did your mom say when you asked her 2 adults get the 2 meal dining package only if those 2 adults are booked as guests 1 and 2 in the same balcony or above cabin you were guest 1 in an interior cabin,Mentalcomposer
with a child you get 1 dining because you are the only adult your wife was guest 1 in a balcony cabin with a child she gets 2 dining because she is the only adult in the cabin that mix up is absolutely not ncls fault you misunderstood how that works im not sure what the problem with the internet pkg was did you buy a pkg before you left did you not know how to log in did you not understand that it was for 1 device did you know that you could have shared 1 internet pkg between devices as long as there is only 1 person logged in at a time you would have been ok what were all of you doing on your phones at the same time and slow internet really is nothing new on cruise ships i dont do the arcade so i wont comment on that but i do know that it too can be purchased pre boarding each line has different policies before i ever book,Mentalcomposer
a new cruise line i make sure i read everything i can so i know exactly what im in for everything you encountered has been discussed many times on many diff places online what you should do dont contact her dont chase her you reached out the first time if she wants this to work she will reach out to you she doesnt want to deal with a problem but you can drive her to work do you see a pattern everything is on her terms when do you get to dictate the terms id consider it over just because you love her doesnt mean shes good for you you need someone who will talk to you to solve a problem that is not her she likes to blame you and just wait till it gets forgotten until the next time this is a very dramatic response to basically what reads like i got rejected by my crush so ill martyr myself and get sterilized and live as a hermit sorry it seems so,Mentalcomposer
over the top im not sure how youre going about meeting someone but heres a thought if youre doing online dating what does your profile look like dont focus on the negative like never been in a relationship play up your strengths what you like to do in your spare time music you like places youd like to travel to show that you are an interesting person your pics should be you smiling laughing having fun even being goofy dont stick with your usual type you say you meet average inexperienced guys go outside your regular go for the extroverted has lots of friends goofy life of the party type go for the guy who has an unusual hobby pick an intellectual pick a guy who is out of your level whos to say what your level is anyway basically whoever matches with you and doesnt give off serial killer vibes meet for coffee during the day you may be narrowing your choices too much find the diamond in the rough give it a,Mentalcomposer
year and see where that gets you but change your mopey woe is me attitude you may think you hide it but it will come through nta what do they want you to do at their house you just buried your last parent its been months of turmoil for you and everyone you need time time to grieve heal and get back to your own life telling them your list of reasons will only inflame them if thats ok with you then go ahead but do you really want to be fighting with your sib right now just make up excuses every time they invite you there is no normal but i think this is way too much time together do you or her have any other friends when do you spend time with them when do you just spend time doing nothing tv reading homework i cannot even imagine what you two would have to talk about when you see each other if youre texting all day long get a hobby tell her,Mentalcomposer
to get a hobby not the same one and start having your own life separate from your gf tell her you dont want to see her every day not because you dont like her but because its just too much and youre going to get sick of each other i was just going to type the same exact thing there is no reason why she shouldnt work after marriage until they buy a house and have kids she thinks they have so much money but shes taking about a wedding a house and a child and probably an engagement ring also and id bet she wants all these things pretty soon just so she doesnt have to work can her bf even afford to support all that probably not at 22 let him stay thats all you have to do go get his stuff from home that he wants to save and maybe store it for him once he leaves for the marines tell your bro hes an awful father for fighting with his,Mentalcomposer
child idc who they each think started it he is the one person who his son should never ever have to worry about getting violent with him and i know it happens in families but this reads like it was a first nta you at least were trying to find a compromise where you could be at both things she didnt want to hear anything if it wasnt you choosing her completely i dont have a problem with you yelling it happens to all of us has she never had anyone raise their voice to her you didnt scar her for life you werent disrespectful in what you yelled you didnt call her names you raised your voice to be heard understood and trying for a solution all of which she didnt want to hear her only solution is you skip the wedding not exactly a compromise as important as her grad was to her your cousins wedding was as important to you is it disappointing you couldnt make her ceremony and lunch sure,Mentalcomposer
but in life sometimes there are disappointments and we deal with them and move on as for the friends you know they didnt get the absolute truth of the story right maybe send one text to all of them laying out how it all went down and then block everyone she was afraid to see you but then expected you to show up even after you sent her back her stuff what planet is she on thinking you two were even together still and she was going to apologize but couldnt but she could give your number to all her friends to relay this message instead of using one of their phones count your lucky stars you got out a partnership is not choose me at all times no matter what else is happening its i know im your number one but others are important people in our individual lives and we cannot discount everyone and everything else nta shes being ridiculous she has got to see that your kids are just too big,Mentalcomposer
for their ages id get the pediatrician to explain to wife that your kids are unhealthy not just bigger id also have a chat with the kids themselves the 8 yo might not understand it fully but certainly the 11 and 9 yo are capable of recognizing that they are bigger than their peers and id bet theyre not happy about it explain the food rules at bils for when they will be staying there and ask them to try it out and see how they feel about it they might surprise you when you get back from your trip and want to begin a more healthy way of eating never mind the ones who have paid their loans how is this proposal supposed to go forward is the bigger issue fed loans are capped for each year of undergrad i think the amount is 37500 so youre not financing your whole degree with fed loans anyone who has more loan debt than that has taken out private loans those will never ever go,Mentalcomposer
away be lowered and i have absolutely no sympathy for anyone who took private loans sorry but you knew if nothing else the high interest rate of this loan do students who just graduated this may get the forgiveness they havent even started paying yet how about the students just starting college in sept do they take the loans for the next 4 years and they also get a reduction 4 yrs from now and where does the fed govt get the money to make these loans when the idea is that the repayment of loans go toward funding the new loans look it sounds great on paper its a great campaign promise but it just is not feasible in the real world i know college is expensive i put 3 thru and yes they all have these loans heres a better idea make it a law that every college and uni have to use a percentage portion of their endowment every year as scholarships in place of the 37500 loan students would have,Mentalcomposer
to take out some of these institutions have humongous endowment amounts the student will then be ineligible for the fed loans im just sick of hearing about this topic today its believing gays will go to hell and after you marry it will become cut off your brothers because they are sinners oh and then your oat ente because they support your brothers and then its your friends cause theyre not true believers soon youll find your life is him his crazy religious family and his church you havent experienced emotional abuse until you experience it at the hands of a religious husband run he will only get worse hes the worst kind of christian a hypocrite hes perfectly ok having sex with you because he repented sure he did he has no guilt over that act just normal teenage horniness if he really believes he would have held to his values but he didnt so hell pick and choose how and what he expects you to do that is an automatic good bye,Mentalcomposer
never mind hes been getting more aggressive as time went on if this was your d and her bf did this would you tell her to stay nah im sure your parents arent thrilled with picking you up understandingly but you also arent thrilled to have to rely on them which shows youre not really entitled which is good i know you said you tried to live on your own and couldnt do it but can you find a roommate in the city that might be a better idea or how about you drive yourself to work go out but dont drink youll still have fun with your friends i remember my mom watching nixon resign on the tv i was 9 all good that was quite the read he did do his own tests shows what the mom said only the boy is his nah she will always be taking care of her mom and if she really is an alcoholic she will end up moving in at some point its quite commendable,Mentalcomposer
for your gf but do you really want this in your future this isnt what you want and thats fine a lot of people wouldnt want it but for right now this is still your apt you were trying to be nice since her lease was up and i know shes living there but its not really hers to do as she pleases with you wouldnt let her redecorate without your input would you i dont have high hopes that this is gonna work out and you should decide now before you get more invested in this girl its only been 4 months give her time to find a place and part ways i think i understand the choices youre 16 you can go to college for two years and get credits for that and can you get a job with this amount of education 2 yrs of college is it equivalent to a bachelors degree we have or you can go to an american school do you mean 2 years of what we,Mentalcomposer
call high school and then youd take sats and apply to american colleges if thats the choices id probably say do the two years where you are if youve finished what is your hs you might be bored doing it again i could be wrong but in the us we require so many college classes that are irrelevant to your course of study so if you can cover all that in just 2 years id do that it stinks not having storage space do you have any space on the side of the refrigerator ive sired some pans there sorry cant be more help sorry im having trouble picturing this when they slide out onto the floor do you then have to take the drawer all the way out and then reach back to retrieve the pans are the pans above the top of the drawer and slide out over the top cant be that cause its too easy to suggest not stacking so many pans so the back panel of the drawer is,Mentalcomposer
gone there must have been one at some point so find a metal piece that will fit and use the existing holes to fasten it or see if you can find a replacement drawer so they already told you what your flights are for next march thats amazing in itself and do i understand that the cruise price automatically includes flights thats interesting what if you live close enough to the embark port that you dont need flights nta we were friends with another couple who got a dog and they named it my name this was years ago and i really hadnt heard of naming pets human names was i insulted no i laughed and joked that they liked me so much they had to have a my name in their home daisy is a bit too sensitive and aunt and uncle are so afraid their precious baby wont ever get another girl that everyone has to bend over backward to make her stay nta i guess they found a way to pay,Mentalcomposer
for the wedding without you id love to know any of their reasons as to why you should be paying for her wedding sept 25 thats a long way off to make that decision now but i def think you should be talking about this working out the logistics of it all maybe you go and come back for the holidays then he takes vacation time and you travel somewhere during spring break or when you dont have to teach try to see if there are some agreements you can work out together its only 10 months its long enough but not insurmountable nta im sorry there is no reason your wife cant cut her daily hours long phone call with her family short for one day she doesnt work and has no friends what the heck does she even have to talk to them about every day for hours and she sees them every 6 weeks this is all very weird to me thats some serious co dependency going on there and then,Mentalcomposer
to cancel with your sis for the next day was childish of her have you ever expressed that at some point youd want to live abroad before now its kind of a big thing to drop after 6 years can he work from abroad if not why would he give up his job that said if you think your relationship would survive the 10 months then maybe do it get it out of your system youll either be satisfied afterwards or youll realize you dont want to be tied down to one place there is no jr jr if bil is daniel jr his son would be titled daniel iii the third but only if the babys first middle if he has one and last name are exactly the same as his father if just the first and last name are the same if they drop or change the middle name then the baby becomes just danielmn or not last no jr no ii his son cant be daniel ii because he is the,Mentalcomposer
ii second even if he uses jr nta i think a bill for the materials and labor for the ruined garments are in order how petty is a grown woman that she thinks shes owed something from another person shes acting like a child and was told so no issue there id be commenting on that fb post and in addition making my own and id go as far as to text every family member of what was said what she did yta its just so stupid in the first place that you asked her to read to you thru the bathroom door just ask her to stop while you do what you need to and adding to this it was your idea to do this stupid except use in the first place the least you could do is give it your all attention i wont even get into how i feel about the idea of actively trying to strengthen a relationship but i have to ask is this a self help book or,Mentalcomposer
just a run of the mill novel im thinking its because he was the one driving the boat its not a recycle thing but instead of buying new bottles of anything soda or water juice there should be drink stations where you bring your own reusable cup and just fill up one button dispenses the amount you pay for sml if you dont have a cup you buy a paper compostable for a nominal amount yta she doesnt need you to set the record straight she should do it herself and she should start with a lovely text to your mom explaining how its your defect and does mom now think she should divorce you you better start getting the word out its gross that you would let your wife be looked down on be a better husband why would you immediately go to shes hiding something how low do you think of your wife that you would think she did anything in this scenario you dont deserve her and she deserves better than,Mentalcomposer
you she did nothing wrong again in case you still dont get it she did nothing wrong your friend is totally to blame and you sent a very nasty message but wait then you drag your wife to therapy to work thru it work thru what exactly she doesnt need therapy she needs a h who unwaveringly believes her when she tells him she was harassed and threatened by your friend id never look at you the same way ah ok well its a crappy conversation to have maybe something like this look theres no easy way to say this but im not comfortable with d coming to the christening you know she has some issues and lets not pretend that she is better when shes not and i cannot take the chance that she will act out at what should be a happy celebration for the family this is an important celebration for me and w and we just want a nice happy day of course i want you there youre my bro,Mentalcomposer
but i will completely understand if you dont want to leave d with her mother for the day but im sorry she is not invited bro wont be happy but when you have a child with serious issues you have to realize that there are places she wont be welcomed at how is he going to bring her if he doesnt have custody of her its your bro in law which means he is was married to whos sister if he married your sister you should be telling your sis to tell him not to bring her if he married your partners sister then your partner should be telling their sis its not a good idea youre an in law this needs to be done by a direct family member shes lived in this city before she met you so she knows how expensive it is how did she manage before i gotta be honest you work 2 jobs she works and you still cant save any money something has to change either you,Mentalcomposer
get one higher paying job she gets a higher paying job or you move you cant move with the job you have but does your company manage territories anywhere with a lower cost of living that you can switch to moving from everything you know is not ideal but a lot of people do it because they want to have a better life i can understand her frustration up to a point and it seems shes rushing this relationship a bit but the dramatics she is showing are unwarranted if you absolutely are 100 positive that you will not move anywhere and you are determined to make a life in this city you need to tell her that she can then decide if she wants to stay with you or go her own way this may be one thing that you are not compatible on you say you have 50 people but those 50 include presumably all of your and her extended families aunts uncles cousins but usually when people have a destination wedding,Mentalcomposer
the guest list gets cut way down to immediate families any very close to the b and g extended family and very close friends your 50 people might be able to be whittled down to maybe 25 or even less the people that would come would be the ones that really really care to be there for your wedding as opposed to aunt gertrude who you see at family weddings and funerals you wont miss her everyone shows up the day before the wedding then you can have one whole day of total wedding she walks down the aisle you marry and have a nice celebration afterwards the following morning can be a brunch and maybe find one activity that all can do maybe a vineyard next day everyone goes home just a thought stop texting with josh on anything unless you want karen to be spreading your business all over town if you need advice from him call him when hes not with karen oh and please do some research before asking another,Mentalcomposer
16 yo about important things like possible pregnancies i cannot see him being any more of an expert in this subject than you i agree immediate family should take care of them the boys immediate family as in mom and dad and yes theyre not safe in florida by themselves that is but with their immediate family ie mom and dad they will be perfectly fine i would never communicate with sil ever again literally block her everywhere your brother can get in touch if he needs you at least he seems like a rational adult seven months is a long time when youre 15 but not in the big scheme of things this is your first gf you have no idea what a good healthy relationship looks like going thru a rough patch by 7 months is not a good sign having other people who are more objective than yourself telling you she is controlling is a big red flag youve already have thoughts of breaking up that is your gut telling you,Mentalcomposer
something always listen to your gut doing everything for her is not an equal partnership her crying is emotional manipulation not a good thing if youre brutally honest with yourself you would see that you are not happy being with this girl you know what you want to do youre just too inexperienced to know that you will survive this break up you will meet another girl and itll be nice and then youll break up and youll meet another and on and on and on you are so young go have fun for the summer with your friends another gf will come along did you two meet in the city that you live in now how long are you together what do you realistically think your time frame for buying something is if youre basically paying a mortgage amount how do you ever think you could save up enough to buy something can you both work from a diff city that you are in now thank you i know child support does not,Mentalcomposer
hinge on him having visitation but is there any way she can get support but he does not get visitation otherwise i feel hell dip in and out on a whim and those kids will always be in flux or if she doesnt need the support and his name isnt on the birth certs can she just move away so he cant find her stability of one parent has to be better than what he does nta why was sean the only one home at that time where was your family did your h allow sean to wake you to make supper i would get out its not worth staying there to me im actually surprised sean allows his wife to stay out past supper cooking time nta that relationship is gross at this point really just uninvite them dont engage anyone about it ignore any texts from anyone in the family dont pick up any phone calls make a declaration and stick to it the topic is closed you do not need this,Mentalcomposer
aggravation she has to wear white because she got pregnant didnt get to have a wedding gtfoh this is the most asinine thing i have ever heard yta youve eaten the same meal since you were 5 which means someone else cooked it all those years who would that be im guessing your mom you said parts are complicated and you cant do them so just get your mom to help you with those parts if she cant do it then you muddle thru best you can adapt funnily enough ive been sailing carnival lately i havent seen any over the top crazy tho no fights at least and i think only one really drunk guy whose wife was trying to guide him out of the casino when she finally gave up and just left him in a chair at one of the machines and walked away but they def take top prize for outlandish outfits on their passengers its like they dont have a mirror i feel like the british seem to have,Mentalcomposer
a more almost jolly good fun crazy time tho i just took a look that trip sounds amazing i hope you have a fantastic time maybe you can pop on here and give us a few updates as you go i have a few qs purely out of curiosity if you dont mind im assuming you have cruised and probably long trips but are you a little nervous about being at see for so long i dont think i could do the whole thing did you get a veranda cabin i think id need that definitely are there any specific ports you are more looking forward to ooh i might be up for a crazy time thanks can you expand on the craziest please i never looked into marella so im curious youre going to be apart from each other for 23 years what kind of marriage will this be when youre not together and she wants to add kids into the mix hows that gonna work honestly you guys shouldnt even be together,Mentalcomposer
she has a romanticized version of marriage dont settle your spouse is the most important decision you will make in life if youre seeing problems with her now they will only get worse you two wont even be together to have the time to sort them out this is a recipe for disaster what exactly are your wifes limitations if you dont mind answering she has the capacity to disagree with the go fund me so is it that she has physical limitations is she getting therapy that she may improve and this is somewhat temporary if youre finding it so hard to move on after everything this girl put you through maybe you need to work on you for a bit it may help you to speak to someone to figure out why your self esteem is so low nurturing faithful and hardworking are good qualities but honest and respectful need to be there also manipulative and unforgiving cancel out all the good i realize you cant help who you fall in love,Mentalcomposer
with and i hope you truly find your match who treats you with the respect you deserve just know that with ncl you say you have 4 people if you are all not in the same cabin they can split you on diff flights you will be kept with your cabin mate but if for instance you book you and partner in one cabin and your 2 kids in another cabin your kids may end up on different flights with layovers in diff cities what did you do wrong 1 after you broke up for absolute legitimate reasons you went back for more abuse 2 you didnt work on any of the problems you had originally but just figured shed magically be better the second time around 3then you smartly broke up again but went back for even more abuse 4in the two mo the you were broke up the first time you should have moved on its like you were determined to make her a better person it never ever works what was,Mentalcomposer
so freakin good about this one person that you had to be with her please dont make a mistake number 5 find a woman not a girl and go slow so slow you might be going backward get to know them in and out before you commit yta for allowing someone to use you financially fo so long cut your losses dump the guy and find someone preferably where you live so you can have an actual relationship with go on dates with see how they act in real life with their friends and family can h ask for a gag order on the divorce proceedings that would work to shut her tf up i dont even remember the last award show ive watched ive been over them for a long while come on now she must have some wrinkled designer frock somewhere in her closet she can throw on first of all vision is not something to be ashamed of its not like you actively did something to cause it lets get that,Mentalcomposer
out of the way also your numbers arent really bad 2020 is so called normal who told you these were really bad numbers exactly theres zero overhead especially if shes recording from her house no transportation cost no wardrobe cause wtf is seeing her thank goodness no security to get to a studio shed need double that budget for the armor plated tanks with mounted mini guns guests just show up so you pay an editor maybe a music and sound person buy this is what spotify does its literally their business you telling me they dont have these people on staff a million dollar budget for each episode what could they possibly have needed to justify that budget i doubt they paid guests so how many people does it take to record one podcast id like one of those jobs please spotify is looking more and more stupid every day nta did you actually leave with your friend then she went somewhere other than home not your problem her husband figured shed be,Mentalcomposer
home at about the same time you got home and if i was him id think that also but when she didnt arrive he rightfully asked where shed been seems pretty normal that would happen even if he doesnt think she did something she shouldnt have he was probably worried what happened to her i always text when im leaving a place im usually driving but if im not home in a reasonable time and dont answer my phone at least someone would know approximately where to look for me with you youre in an uber with a stranger if you dont turn up at least theres some way to try to track you it was a box grid but when i copied it it didnt come out that way ill try to clean it up edited to make it clearer i found this it does seems kids are entitled did i interpret it wrong box titled if you die with spouse and descendants from you and someone other than that spouse box titled,Mentalcomposer
heres what happens spouse inherits the first 25 of your intestate property but not less than 50000 or more than 200000 plus 12 of the balance descendants inherit everything else your gf told you she was in love with someone else and wants to travel with this person thats not an open relationship that is her wanting you to sit on the sidelines while she has her fun you two have been long distance with occasional visits where you played house she came back earlier this month and is in love with another already let me guess this guy is from where she used to live and you dont think she was seeing him prior dont ever be someone elses back up plan so sorry for your loss losing a parent is hard sending hugs you seem to have an awful lot of empathy toward sandra and her grieving process this is a woman who alienated your dad from you ever since she met him its lovely in a sense but you and your,Mentalcomposer
sibs lost your dad she doesnt seem to care much about your grief thats not to say you should go after her but all you guys really want are sentimental things youre not trying to throw her out of the house that said and your sibs may be entitled to part of his whole estate and you shouldnt just ignore that this of course depends on where you live i did a search for my state and kids from a previous marriage are most def entitled add your name to the suit if the lawyer can show you what the laws for dying intestate in your state are and if you really dont care about any of his estate simply suing for the sentimental stuff you and your sibs want should go even easier sandra will hand it over if it means you wont be going after his money or property dont stress let your sibs handle the legal stuff but you should put on a united front the funny thing is weve all,Mentalcomposer
probably been the new one to the group at some point i have but it never bothered me i enjoyed hearing the stories about when my partner was young and dumb it had a great adventure whatever i just listened and took it all in it gave great insight to everyone in the group this behavior i cant even put the feeling g into words really which makes it all the more creepy maybe your bf is being petty and immature you are allowed to go away with a friend and not him that you planned it while you were broken up said to him that you arent sitting around pining away and hes pouting him then going to all your favorite places and making sure you know about it says he wants you to be upset that hes doing all these things without you but youre not taking the bait so he has to up the ante except hes out of ideas so he breaks up with you again dont you see youre,Mentalcomposer
not worshipping him youre not miserable without him you can actually be ok without him and he doesnt like any of that buy a ped egg use it after a shower then slather in moisturizer put socks and shoes on i also frequently just moisturize but always put socks on and shoes i feel like the heat from the socks and shoes helps i dont know anything about either of you but seriously you think a 23 yo single mom is in love with you shes in love with the fact that you will send her money cut your losses find a woman somewhere near your age this chickie will string you along until she cant get anymore from you nta honestly i would have assumed she was still loopy from the anesthesia and not really taken it seriously and if i said anything i would have caused a problem between them was the reason for her wanting to split because he wasnt able to be there any sooner because he was with his,Mentalcomposer
friend at chemo wait you share an apt and you pay for it on your own why are you still with him besides that youve been together for so long does he have any plans to actually get a job be an actual adult or whats his plan dinners with his mom isnt that odd but every week is obsessive but i guess he has nothing else to do nta the idea that she wants to feel included in your previous life is strange really really strange thats not how it works im not exactly sure if thats a reflection of anything really it just feels a little obsessive all consuming maybe idk just gives me bad vibes depends how young babysitting is the easiest thing you can do but if youre not old enough for that then a mothers helper is doable you basically watch the child while the mother is there doing other things in the house who says theyre ugly you one persons pretty is anothers ugly and vice versa well,Mentalcomposer
thats horrifying thank you for that visual lol so its your apt ask your lawyer if its legal to literally get him kicked out make sure he doesnt have tenant rights or something then call the cops have them escort him out and have a locksmith in standby to change the locks but you didnt you went back there are so many things that are concerning in your post you two just should not be together you need to separate get court ordered custody and child support so when its his time he has the baby find another place to live and seriously get on a birth control that you dont need to even think about implant iud not 100 but pretty damn close and no possibility of human error thats what i wondered im sure d would have said to her cousins that her parents need to know and that their mom had to let them know that they werent taking the cousins word for it or call the sil the night before,Mentalcomposer
final numbers had to be in and just ask its now or never yes or no whats the alternative everyone just sit around all day and be given the basic necessities what about wants maybe after a few years of just being handed your needs youll get to choose a want youre not special we all grow up and have to support ourselves there is no coping to be done where did this idea even come from it comes up on his site so often doesnt anyone elses family not say anything and then just talk about the person behind their back no just mine my sibs and i would have a field day with those names well just keep on keeping the peace over stupid stuff like this and you havent blocked this girl why you cant just not talk to jason tho you can either tell him you want nothing to do with him or that you want an actual bfgf thing and he needs to tell the girl l you seem,Mentalcomposer
to be taking jasons word that he was just talking to this girl she thought he was her bf theres a huge disconnect with those two statements one of them is lying my 20 somethings are still wearing mismatched socks its been years now its really not all that important is it me i dont do it but its not my feet and not my socks your so is making problems when there are none why ive never heard of that at all my understanding is that if your flight is 8 pm and have transport to the airport thru the cruise line you will be among the last group off the ship but every disembarking passenger has to be off the ship before any embarking can be done so you may be scheduled to debark somewhere between 9 and 10 am but you cant stay on all day and when embarking even if your flight is arranged thru the cruise line if your flight is delayed they will not wait for you they,Mentalcomposer
will wait if you are already on a cruise line arranged shuttle coming from the airport if delays are traffic or whatever so not hours long delay but not for a flight delay i heard you be able to fly into the first port but that is at your expense she can ask anything she wants realistically tho what organization is going to pay this amount or even what organization is even wanting her to speak and to speak about what she has nothing of any value to talk about and thats not being mean really she can speak in a generic term about any topic but we all can do that if im looking for a speaker for my org im looking for someone who has at the very least some expertise or personal experience about whatever my org represents and thats not her theyre waiting to debark bars wouldnt be open until the next group embarks hes been sleeping for 10 hours so he should be nice and rested to handle the,Mentalcomposer
baby for the next 810 hours while you sleep he has no excuse at all right now go get some sleep nta based on the info about the uncle alone never mind where shes going hashad cartel violence thats a def no from me why take even the slightest chance her aunt is coming to visit when the baby will actually be able to interact with her anyway you have to sign something for the baby to leave the country anyway dont sign because they dont really care about any of these groups they just think if they say they care people will fawn all over them its been said over and over they dont want to do any of the actual work involved to actually make a difference this website says it costs 8000 to build a well and its in africa harrys second home youre telling me their foundation cant part with some money for this project and they dont even have to do any of the work this took me 5,Mentalcomposer
seconds to find a charity that actually does the work and they have a staff that cant find not one thing they can support theyre actually disgusting people i think wed all like a more democratic liberal power for russia we can always hope you can eat chicken tho its a meat but its not red yes it gets boring i know but a salad with grilled chicken carrots celery tomato maybe throw in a hard boiled egg and a dressing was basically my go to meal when i diet you can make pulled chicken like pulled pork just eggs and toast french toast should be ok too quiche with veggies might be good too egg salad might be ok if you dont use too much mayo you can have a sandwich or just put that on a bunch of lettuce sorry im trying to help give suggestions thats what i wondered wasnt it reported that the russian soldiers sent to ukraine were giving but cause they didnt want to fight so i wondered,Mentalcomposer
if the russian military in russia would do the same thing if they do indeed allow wagner a pass do you think this is a good thing for your country what do the regular russian people think would be the best outcome so i did a quick search and didnt find any indication that losing weight releases purines everything i saw said losing weight helps with reducing gout flare ups dont despair just yet can you get in to see your doc or do telemedicine they can give you the med to help with the flare up and then once youre feeling better you can concentrate on losing some weight the people i know who have had gout have absolutely kept it at bay by diet they know which foods may cause a flare up and avoid them like the plague i hope you find some relief any chance you can call in sick to work at least for today well the obvious answer is to get your gout treated and then avoid whatever,Mentalcomposer
it is that causes the gout in the first place read these if just the thought of marriage id making you physically sick maybe thats your instinct telling you this is not the guy for you youve been together so long hes all you know but being insecure moody jealous and judge mental are not really traits you want in a partner id work on those issues first before you even think about a life with him honestly id be thinking if thats the traits id want in a bf those traits will absolutely stifle you in regards to what you want to do in your life yta so you admit you just want to be a degenerate for life if thats the best you hope to aspire to then leave why are you fighting to stay this is not normal im sorry why exactly would you even date anyone who has said this to you 2 relationships for 20 years means when you were in your 20s till now how did you manage,Mentalcomposer
to find a guy in his 20s who didnt want to jump anything with a pulse do not give up but seriously before you get past the first date you need to ask about his sex drive if hes not up for at least once a week dont continue to date him make this an absolute requirement for yourself cologne smells diff on everybody depending on how it reacts to your body chemistry so no one cologne is the one you should have you need to try them and see if you or your partner thinks it smells good on you i see the skinny and the muscle but wheres the fat the answer is no you are not skinny fat at all you are tall and lean and muscular why do you want to live up to a cheating ex has it occurred to you that all the ex ever had was maybe a different look and alternative lifestyle and thats what he thought was soooo attractive at the time because it certainly,Mentalcomposer
want her loyalty but where did that get him cheated on married and still cheated on again just saying that to compare yourself against the ex is pointless because he is choosing you choose him back with no reservations just go with it you have no idea where its gonna end up life is too short to spend it with someone youre not crazy about and besides youre both young been together a long time and may have outgrew each other but youre both sticking around just because of the time put in already if youre not feeling it youre not feeling it if you do break up if her parents dont know about her harming herself that might be the time to clue them in so they can be aware and get her the help she needs i had trouble following who did what when all of this is messed up tho your d was bullied but it really sounds like she gave it right back with the mom joke no the time,Mentalcomposer
for her to speak up was when she was paired with the bully then she did none of the work so why bother going to the competition wonder why the bully didnt tell the club leader that your d did no work if only 2 signed up im assuming she got to the competition and her bully said something to her again all i know is i wouldnt force my kid to go and do anything they didnt want to do shes 13 is model un or any club really that important shes got plenty of time to learn to stick to her commitments you know the ones that really matter are you on the lease i think if you are then youre stuck until the lease runs out someone else would know for sure i would remove my banking info from it let him deal with it worst that can happen is he takes you to court for the rent till the lease comes to an end but will he maybe its not,Mentalcomposer
even worth it to him and hell just pay the full rent aw thank you my response to op says maybe he wants to do it on his own for a sense of accomplishment idk i just dont want her to get too paranoid and borrow trouble where there is none so its possible he may not tell you where he is when he needs to calm down because he wants to handle his issue on his own he needs to feel he can become a less angry person on his own sense of accomplishment and all if you do notice a pattern of less aggression please mention it in a nice way not youre not as angry more whats got you in such a good mood lately i like it give him a few weeks then casually mention he seems more buff than usual see if he mentions going to the gym i dont think hes doing anything nefarious you guys are ok is it possible he is going to the gym and,Mentalcomposer
stopping off at the park before he comes home because he knows hes in a bad place and doesnt want to bring that anger home two hours in traffic can rile anyone up the gym would be a good place to work out his aggression and a park seems like a good place to calm himself down has he been coming home in a better frame of mind that you noticed are there any other places hes going that are sketchy and not places he could maybe just collect himself before coming home nta but how did it get to this point when you were dating did he have a job an apt support himself did he just suddenly get sick and quit his job after you married and you were ok with this and how do you not know if he has asthma or the much more serious copd id certainly need to know exactly what kind of medical issues my h was dealing with if he was supporting himself when you met,Mentalcomposer
and dated he can do that now i think something is missing what does your mom say about being limited to the amount of time she spends with her grandson what did your bro tell mom he thinks youre telling his son have you asked these other family members why you shouldnt be seeing bros ex wife even in the context of it being just to facilitate drop off to visit with nephew what possible reason could there be for that it makes no sense he is still your nephew you didnt divorce anyone he cheated she divorced him she is not the bad guy here your bro should be thankful that you and mom want to spend time with his son yeah thats a pretty big thing to leave out nope im out too he wasnt a close friend and you barely spoke prior to dating so go back to that dynamic i wouldnt actively snub him say hi to the group when you get there and say bye to the group as,Mentalcomposer
you leave if youre thinking of it as a win lose then you would lose if you cut off the friend group he will think he won just because he would look at it as she cared so much and cant get over me so she cant be around me dont give him that but def come to terms with him and the breakup or youre setting yourself up for misery when he starts to date and bring her around curiosity has me wondering i just want to know exactly what role the snake had at the wedding and why it was so important to be there edit due to knowing the real reason jen cant leave the baby with her partner i change my vote to yta its totally understandable why jen wouldnt feel comfortable leaving the baby with anyone make the exception for her she needs some happiness in her life right now and mom is nta anymore she obviously empathizes with jen at this time nta but id go as far,Mentalcomposer
to say mom is does jen not have a friend family who can watch the baby so her original plan fell through not your problem i never understood people who wont go anywhere without their child who wouldnt want a night out without child care duties your ss is going to literally sit at your wedding with an infant in her lap at 10 months even if this baby is walking your ss is just going to follow her around while she roams sounds like a great night huh jen can come to the ceremony go check on her d then spend a few hours at the reception if she wants to leave early she can your moms stance is ridiculous why is it so important to cater to jen shed rather skip her one daughters wedding to do what sit at home with her other d to make what statement exactly that she likes jen better that her grandchild is more important that its unfair to leave an infant out of a wedding,Mentalcomposer
that said infant is never even going to care about ill get downvoted but whatever its my take on the situation it will be helpful if you can get your husband to talk to someone all of this mess is ultimately his issue to come to terms with i wont say your h is homophobic he may be he may not he obviously had has a vision in his head of what he wanted for what his sons life would look like every idea he has had is now shattered and he has to find a way to come to terms that what he envisioned will not come to be lots of parents have this same realization but they are able to take a step back and say its not what i had envisioned but it is what it is and accept and go forward this goes back a long ways every time your son had trouble your h turned a blind eye his mom disappearing his cutting his lack per h of a,Mentalcomposer
gf and ultimately his coming out his dad has ignored the obvious simply because he didnt want it to be true that his son was suffering thus driving your son deeper into himself as good as you are as far as being there and understanding your son and as much as you tried to get your h to get on board so to speak you havent been able to so its time for professional intervention i am sure your son knows how much you love and care but your son needs his dad to accept him that is the part your h does not want to realize so work on h to get some help with basically letting go of what could have been and moving into this is what it is youre 18 youve been dating for 3 months youre going to be away for training and then stationed wherever tell me again why you would even want to be coupled up with anyone go do your thing as a single guy but,Mentalcomposer
be smart about the girls you will be meeting once youre stationed dont be a stereotypical young dumb enlisted guy who marries just to get off base date for sure if you meet someone you like but dont be in a rush to marry good luck in basic training and stay safe its been 1 date slow down what gives you the idea that she wants serious see if date 2 or 3 goes as well make plans to actually see each other once a week talk or text a few times during the week which incidentally is exactly how dating is done dont make it an every day thing right now i like just the basic details i dont need every single teeny tiny detail spelled out for me not even so much to form my own mental image just because unless its instrumental to the story its irrelevant so in your example basic description works heart monitor beeping not the big beige box to the left of the bed that is incessantly,Mentalcomposer
beeping telling me person is alive while i watch the line move up and down hoping praying it doesnt flatline its not all cash but pizza delivery makes cash tips thats an option if you have a car if youre ok with kids you can babysit or ive seen people offer to play teach their kids a sport or you can offer tutoring ive seen kids home for college offer to do basic yard work weeding mulching etc go on your towns website and post there whoever told you it was offensive probably has no idea who the people in the shirt are they say the words and went right to its a trump thing i wouldnt worry about it this is it exactly the vitriol shown to wealthy people on this site is unreal as if any of those people suddenly came into enormous wealth they wouldnt be doing exactly what the wealthy are doing they like to say theyd be solving poverty and world hunger but theyd be the first to flaunt,Mentalcomposer
it buy the mansion jet and of course since its reddit hookers and blow its gross really yes this sounds absolutely ridiculous to me how exactly does she want you to give her your undivided attention are you supposed to just stare at her give her non stop praise hug and kiss on her for hours on end what how is it that she can go out to dinner with you and a friend and thats ok when youre obviously not giving her your undivided attention how have you even lasted 6 months with her nta you should have just told him you did for fd exactly what he did for md he cant counter that because then hed have to come up with what he did which is nothing im married i dont think my bday is all that special but we take the fam out to dinner for all our bdays not just mine but there is always at least talk about it coming up how is this not even talked about,Mentalcomposer
by anyone including the kids thank you at first i wondered if maybe he was a bit overwhelmed with all that was going on in your fam but hes had all that info for a while so that shouldnt be why he now needs space he is showing you that he cant be there for you and everything in his life is his priority not exactly traits you want in a partner but you have been handling everything long before he came around and you can and will be able to handle it all if hes not around info please how new is this relationship is it just 4 weeks no idea how you got to the conclusion that i think parents can be abusive or yell at their kids i never even mentioned parents i spoke to how a kid can rebut a parent or elder if you look at his edit hes been taught to say yes every single time he is spoken to where most of us took it as normal,Mentalcomposer
parent child interactions where there is a dialogue idk how your parents spoke to you or others but parents most time dont go right to yelling or berating they ask the child to do something kid either does it if its a reasonable ask or question why do it why right this minute why cant it wait etc my response explained how to answer back in a respectful tone not something that includes sarcasm yelling or with attitude if you were trying to catch her listening to you you should have made up something you were talking to your husband so make you something about your house or car you chose to tell your unflattering opinions about coworkers of course those things would get around so if you really dont care if all your coworkers dont like you then n t a but if you want a drama free workplace then y t a but why would you want that it makes no sense not a moron sometimes it helps if you lay the,Mentalcomposer

fit you might not get your way but youll at least have gotten your say yta just for accepting the no contact clause when you divorced you might be ok with just 9 days a month sorry this is in no way a decent amount but i do wonder if you just got tired of fighting and gave in as far as asking to see kid when hes with mil is that actually illegal or just not right based on custody i wouldnt do anything to get myself in legal trouble wait the 6 mo and go back to court to revise custody child is old enough to recount what was happening at dads id be shocked if full custody is not awarded and just to be spiteful id see if there was any way to get gf charged for throwing kid out in those conditions dad can get sort of a pass because child not wanting to ever see them again is sweet poet justice to me or if gfs charges somehow get,Mentalcomposer
linked to dad he can deal with that too im not giving a judgement but i would highly suggest you separate the kids have each one sit opposite each other theres 4 of you one at each side of the table that will cut down on the boys being in each others face and being ha day to the other id also suggest redirecting any conversations when you think its not dinner topics ask about school hobbies tv shows anything to keep them involved and interested so they dont go off track this may mean you have to ask qs just to keep the convo going theyre just rambunctious young boys who are doing what young boys do i guarantee they will not be talking about pee poop or burping while on a date could be an excuse but why pick the one thing he knows would hurt you in that way its almost cruel you know he may not want marriage with anyone at this age while it seems thats where this would,Mentalcomposer
lead as you say its normal in your families he may just be thinking he hasnt dated around enough hasnt really sowed his oats as they say but thats a diff conversation that should have been had its hard for some people to think that the someone they met as a teenager is going to be the person they would spend their whole life with it scares them they panic please dont think of him as the only man you will ever have these feelings for we all think its the absolute worst thing that could happen at the time and when we look back after marrying we realize that person would not have been as great a match as we thought at least i did take some time for yourself let yourself grieve the life you imagined and then move forward cry it out rage it out whatever you need to do lets just say that what he says is true that he didnt find you attractive which is kind of hard to,Mentalcomposer
believe because at 15 thats usually the first thing that attracts you to a person its not their mind but anyway even if thats the case what usually happens is as you get to know a person their physical appearance doesnt really come into play you find the whole person attractive and their physical becomes a non issue its not a deciding factor so yeah i cant believe someone i spent 3 years with coming up with that of all things to use as a reason to break up you deal by realizing that this one relationship is a stepping stone to the man you ultimately will be with who loves you for all of you not just your pretty face you dont why would you their aftermath is not yours to deal with at all you block and move on and deal with your own feelings about the break up on your own youre long distance its not like youll see this person all over town listen to your therapist your guilt will,Mentalcomposer
guilt you right back into a coupling that you do not want anymore nta sam isnt smart enough to realize that shes in the easier classes really in hs the issue is sam feels inadequate to her sister she knows shes not as smart and has to make herself feel better by focusing on grades has emma never actually said to sam you only get as because youre in the stupid class come on emma knows whos the smarter one your wife was wrong why does she need to coddle sam im thinking mom knows sam isnt too bright you need to take emma out for pizza and ice cream now too the flags are only banned on city owned buildings individuals and businesses are free to fly pride flags and they should be painting that town in flags if you vote in a majority muslim city council whose religion doesnt support non heterosexuals and were voted in according to the article to combat anti muslim sentiment you had to think there would come,Mentalcomposer
a time they would vote according to their beliefs have we not come to the point where we know our elected officials are not voting and doing what their constituents want but what their own personal feelings on an issue is leave him alone you broke up with him in the heat of the moment take that as your gut telling you this is the right thing to do always always go with your gut you admit you were an emotional wreck and arguing all the time take this time to straighten yourself out hes probably ok breaking up as he was tired of navigating this unstable relationship sometimes things just run their course i have a diff take on this why is your partner crying to her parents that she needs support for gf seems to be doing ok long term bf bought a house what is the problem and you seem to know all the answers so why cant you handle her problem you say they were raised to be insecure but,Mentalcomposer
im thinking their hands off youre not a failure dont be daft answer to sis is akin to saying stop your whining and get on with your life should they have been dissecting every minor complaint theyve had growing up and solving all the girls problems for them i think you and possibly by your influence your gf is expecting coddling when the parents are more no nonsense people a handle your own stuff attitude you cannot stay with her just because youre afraid of hurting her that is literally the worst reason for staying together what good does that do for you or for her just rip the band aid off and break up with her the sooner you do it the sooner shell get over it it hasnt as shown in this article its from 2021 with a 70 approval this article from this year shows a 71 approval where was she going or she just walked around the block if the pap have her in their sights youre gonna tell me,Mentalcomposer
they didnt follow her to her destination everything is always fake esh you because as nice as it seems to spend the day with just your wife and kids you also have a father were you not planning on seeing him so i fault you for not realizing that you would want or at least should want to spend some time with him for fd before agreeing to your wifes plan even if you would have planned for seeing him on sat why didnt you suggest that when your bro called your wife because obviously talking about ending a relationship just because you invited your father and bro over for a few hours on fd is the most ridiculous thing ive heard in a long while and the fact that shes going to punish you by taking the kid to her cousins shows that maturity doesnt come with age its not like she planned some elaborate day where having visitors would upend the whole day there has to be more to this and im,Mentalcomposer
thinking it has to do with your wife not seeing her dad on fd civility seriously its as if after staying home for a year everyone turned into nasty self centered brats i also dont moan about anything teens do publicly that is but to my so ill comment when i see someone else moaning but only when it involves destroying someone elses property idc if kids are loud running up and down the block even fireworks normal kid and teen things but it bothers me at destruction but how could she not expect the gf to show up if nothing else it gives both of them a reason to come visit with family and ill bet the gf was the one who actually went out and bought the gift around here baby showers are for the women men are never invited and if they are they usually have a golf date that day anyway op planning her own shower after the baby is born just feels off somehow unless its a cultural thing,Mentalcomposer
as someone mentioned where showers are not a thing before the baby is born why didnt her mom throw one maybe moms not as thrilled with her d having this baby i hate to say this but it seems like a gift grab almost sort of like a come celebrate me ooh good luck to you also im hoping since we get to buy before the public we might actually have a chance thank you yeah i saw that which is what prompted my question because i never paid attention to the process before since i knew i wouldnt be there but im kind of excited now that we may be able to go keep your own space the idea that youre asking and arent sure means that you know thats what you really want to do why dont you just keep the apt that youve been given while the renovation is taking place this way you can have as much or as little time apart that you want youve only been together 9,Mentalcomposer
months and you are so young id be a little leery about giving up my newfound freedom too and if you move in totally i also think youll never be moving out until you break up how do you stop it you ask to see the last 3 or however many tax returns you ask for a pay stub from each of the previous 6 months you ask for any investment and bank account info and you ask this for anyone who will occupy the apt and then you follow this up every year you cant renew your lease until you produce all these docs in addition the city should be verifying all this info why are they taking someones word for it you want a cheaper apt its up to you to prove youre eligible oh im sure her very good best gf gwyneth was just dying to let meg in on all her secrets to building a successful empire which really means she has absolutely no idea what shes doing again they,Mentalcomposer
can market and ask whatever price they want doesnt mean anyone will actually book them i dont know why this isnt more understood because federal student loans the ones that were paused are capped at a total of not bothering to look again for exact number somewhere around 3540000 for undergrad slightly more if you are eligible due to being low income having a pell grant maybe the reason peoples debt is so large is because they took out massive private loans which were never ever going to be cancelled so its getting really tiresome to keep hearing about crippling student debt when the federal ones are not even the ones causing the problem it was just ok for me i just wanted the rest of the original top gun class to show up for ice man is there no income verification each year that allows you to stay like if you make too much money you cant rent that stabilized apt not sure if it has vocabulary so you might need to just,Mentalcomposer

problem with that is the reason you joined those subs in the first place is that you are interested in that topic subject whatever drew you there in the first place if you unfollow the subs you like based on this protest your feed will be full of things you dont care to see or are not interested in how is that fun i follow the things i like why would i want to only see the things that dont interest me i dont fully understand the whole protest ins and outs but i thought i saw where some subs wont be coming back and others are only dark for a few days ill wait it out and see what happens thanks sorry to cut into this thread but if its going to be read only what will there be to read posts that were made before the blackout and if theres no posts allowed will there even be any responses to the post thanks if you know nta she has no intention of,Mentalcomposer
getting a job why would she she gets benefits and does nothing seriously she cant go to the employment appt because she has to rearrange her room what else is she so busy doing this week and to boot she somehow has what appears to be a pretty decent bf who is willing to work oh and make and break all her appointments for her shes just waiting till you can support both of you do not let her move in with you even if she initially has a job she will quit that job and youll be stuck i really hope you get that job and move away nta is there some reason why your ex hates you so much that she wont let you see your kids more is this standard custody in japan if it is do you know the rationale for it you can ask her to swap fd for the baseball game but i doubt shes gonna give it to you take the game itll be a nice activity,Mentalcomposer
with your kids how old are your kids maybe they can mention to their mom that they want to see you more because this generation is lonely but also alone they want love but cant find it or keep it could you ask that one of her friends leave their car for you to use do you know these friends im not a big fan of using other peoples cars but the friend is getting their transportation provided for the trip and their car will just sit around for 2 weeks id also only use their car for work youll have access to one of your parents cars in the weekends thank you for taking the time for that explanation can you explain this please i thought the subs were only going dark for 2 days and then will be back up are you saying that some most subs wont come back at all and one more please does each sub pay to have moderator bots so if they raise the price the sub,Mentalcomposer
wont be able to afford them so people can just post anything in any sub sorry i just dont know much about all this oh and thank you in going to be brutally honest here and im sorry for that but you need to hear it loud clear and not sugar coated you do not owe that man not one more minute of your time you have been abused and manipulated for 15 years that is half of your life you got out that shows how strong you are now take that strength and cut him off he is no longer your concern hes a grown man and can figure out how to do life without you he wont starve and hell eventually figure out the rest its very telling that he has no friends and doesnt speak to his family anymore gee could it be that everyone who meets or knows him knows what kind of person he is please stop doing for him he will try to manipulate you back into his,Mentalcomposer
life and you will be right back to where you started the next thing to work on is selling the house why shouldnt you get your half to help you move forward i wish you nothing but the best but you need to stay away from him shes been alluding to a surrogate scandal forever if she knows something then just say it already or stop the baiting its getting old already idk what they had to do to squash any info coming out about the kids and her past activities but there has to be a loophole for it somehow its just gonna take one brave soul to spill it as far as her ambitions there is no way never not in a million years that wannabe celebrity is ever going to get anywhere near the oval office its a preposterous notion one i think lady c just made up she has neither the intellect or connections to even begin to think about this she cant form a coherent sentence never mind dialogue,Mentalcomposer
with other world leaders why would he be mad you complimented his gf if she is pretty you wont be the first or only guy to notice this is a no big deal thing if hes mad thats his insecurity dont contact her this isnt just all about you how selfish can you be if you could be totally honest with yourself the only reason you want her back is because you dont want to go thru all the steps to meet someone new you say youre willing to marry and have a baby with her now but those were things werent even on your radar after seven years and you were living together so youll do those things and find youre unhappy with your life anyway she deserves better she deserves someone who absolutely wants to build that life with her and that just isnt you dont waste anymore of her time nta you are legally adopting this baby in any other adoption scenario your cousin would not have any standing to make,Mentalcomposer
demands on a name just because she knows you its pretty bold of her to think she can i realize emma is only 15 but she is old enough to understand how adoptions work you need to reiterate that this child will be yours and your husbands and that emma or her mother will not be involved in any decision making in regards to this child now or in the future this is why family adoptions are messy the bio parent is always around hovering criticizing and the other family members are chiming in i really hope you dont live close to these folks because i def see trouble in the future nta she certainly expects a lot huh and i have to say it you are setting a really really bad precedent for any occasions going forward what gave her the idea that her bday should be an elaborate affair of surprises and planning and spending it is simply unsustainable sorry it seems like you need to be 21 in order to sail,Mentalcomposer
alone no parents or guardians with most of the major cruise lines im not sure what consent form you are seeing but the ones i know are if one parent is cruising with a child without the other parent or if someone is taking a child that is not theirs grandchild son or ds friend those type things you can request a new card online youve done what a lot of others havent done yet you lost the weight and kept it off good for you as far as lifting weights you just found out that type of exercise is not the one for you list 3 other types of exercise that you think you might enjoy try out the first for a couple months and see if it satisfies you if not move on to another youll find one that you will enjoy and it wont feel like a chore to do i think the seamstress is just saying come in for a fitting when youve lost whatever weight you wanted to shes,Mentalcomposer
not saying to lose more weight it makes no sense to come in have the seamstress take in the dress then lose more weight and take it in again and repeat this isnt a case of just taking in a seam wedding dresses can have some unique properties that take more time and more expertise to alter for instance if there is beadwork on the bodice the seam cant just be opened cut and resown oops i forgot about the dress thing ok so sis didnt know sis is in the clear now yta its really not that hard to make an excuse for not drinking or just say you dont want to that you dont like champagne not in the mood there were a million things you could have said other than to confirm or just take a sip one sip is not going to hurt anything or you could have announced a month earlier so by the wedding it would be old news but im guessing sis wanted you to wait until,Mentalcomposer
after her wedding which is selfish also in order for slim fit anything to look good the person wearing it has to have a slim body it wont look good or fit well if you have an average body type but can we talk about the awful trend of mens suit pants stopping above the ankle why i hate the look pants should meet shoes why are you trying to hang onto this guy he doesnt seem like such a catch if youre not happy with him then get rid of him its common sense better to be single and happy than paired up and unhappy just to point out this person who im sorry idk who she is other than obviously an actressis having numerous others testify on her behalf notice h had none thats the way you try to prove a case not with i felt must have been i dont remember possibly im speculating etc is there any way others can win their cases but hs is not won or is,Mentalcomposer
it all or nothing because id hate to think hell get a win judgement not based on the merits of his case but by piggybacking on others much stronger cases because we all saw he had absolutely zero evidence that his phone was ever hacked but i guess we have to see what the others present as evidence its very simple money equates to security that doesnt even mean you have to have a huge salary doesnt mean you have to live a grand life you can live a very minimalist lifestyle but you need to have some money saved somewhere so if theres an emergency or a crisis youre less likely to panic which is why we all should have an emergency fund her schooling actually makes you look worse you actively dissuaded her from going to college with a bribe and if there was no stipulation that she couldnt leave the house vacant you really have no legal leg to stand in for cutting her off from the house and the monthly,Mentalcomposer
payments do you even slightly like your child were taking a month long vacation i hope my adult kids dont take that as abandonment and change the locks think about everything you have done and put your daughter through if indeed you and your wife feel everything youve done is appropriate then you two def deserve each other now you can sit on your pile of money and assets as you grow into old age alone esh im not really sure i believe some of this your d was homeschooled but she was in a gifted program but she isnt educated which is it her telling anything to your niece that could have legal consequences was obviously wrong but what was your wife doing that she shouldnt have i actually hope the d and niece rat her out then you lied about it to make the situation for your d worse and force her to settle out as lawyers you sure did take a huge risk doing this then she dares take a trip,Mentalcomposer
and you decide that violates the terms of the settlement and kick her out and cut off payments was that even a stipulation i cannot imagine two more vindictive people and worse youre both vindictive against your own daughter im wondering if all that wealth youve built up was actually earned legitimately you two seem to have found every possible loophole to destroy your d and when there wasnt one you lied to make one id hate to be your client if your husband is falling asleep and waking up later than your 7 yo he might want to see a doctor that seems like an unusually high amount of hours of sleep for him to need how ever does he handle waking for work and getting thru the day its great he loves his job and all but it cant be to the detriment of every other single thing in his life time for a heart to heart he needs to be contributing more to this family than a paycheck you can do,Mentalcomposer
that alone i think i see where youre coming from i can of course state that phone hacking is of course an absolute horrific thing to happen to anyone and obviously illegal so if we assume he was hacked its awful but if we think about it harry really hasnt been caused any real quantifiable harm can anyone point out any real harm that has been done to him he jumped into this case just to rail against the press he doesnt like what they print about him and he wants someone to pay he didnt like how they covered his mom and in a sad twisted way he has to defend her too did anything come out that was so abhorrent that his life was irreparably damaged no he did what he did his relationships went where they went and all these things would have happened anyway and they would have been reported on he would have had the same exact things written about him anyway we would have known he broke his,Mentalcomposer
thumb that chelsy broke up with him that he had gotten a lap dance where he was staying that he met with flack all these things would have gotten out anyway nobody lives in a bubble again im not saying that the hacking isnt awful or illegal just that for him idk about the other defendants he hasnt proved it occurred he just wanted another wingefest how did you let it get to this point you do this mans laundry take care of his dog every day he doesnt clean you do all the planning and cooking and you pack his lunch is he a child does he not know how to make a sandwich and to boot he was unemployed when you met and you thought he was such a great catch that you supported him for the first 6 months that in itself should have given you an insight did you think he was just suddenly one day wake up and hed become a responsible partner and split the chores and now,Mentalcomposer
youre stuck you signed a lease with him can you get out of it and stay where you are id do that now lets move onto the way he spoke to you the first time a partner tells me to f off f myself etc would be the last time that person ever saw me never mind the disrespect if he doesnt have the skills at his age to have an argument without resulting to insults then he never will his insults will get worse think long and hard about if this is a person you want to have a life with you know the answer you just feel stuck because of the lease not a good enough reason instead of thinking that your bf is so much more accomplished than you and thats kind of a weird way of putting it start turning those thoughts around to how well you have brought yourself up since moving to this new school if you think about it hes had every advantage all through school whereas,Mentalcomposer
youve had to come from behind to get where you are who really is more accomplished in that scenario id say that would be you no sense worrying about what you think he would think nta you needed to eat it was dinner time his unusual eating habits are his own to deal with its nice you asked but i would have ordered anyway he could have gone out for a walk while you ate if it would bother him so much and calling names thats a big no happens once i might forgive as long as theres an understanding that it never ever happens again i dont name call and if my partner cant have a disagreement without name calling it shows me that they have no valid argument and has to result to hurting me on purpose nothing i said was overly rude every other comment has said youre making more of this than need be yta you seem to think of laura as a sil instead of a step daughter while,Mentalcomposer
technically that his true this little girl most certainly thinks of you by now as her dad figure shes been in your life since she was 5 and now at 12 she has to deal with and try to understand why this guy whose always been there is suddenly pushing her aside because he now has his own kids it seems as if your parents accepted laura as a grandchild and laura thinks of them as her grands which is really lovely when you think about it you should be thrilled your parents think that way to have a visit with the grandparents means all the grandkids you might need to rethink your mindset with regards to laura this is weird does she celebrate her friendships with anyone else no then why is this one person so special different important that she or they feel the need to mark the date so what did they do hook up one last time and then decide hey tomorrow were gonna start our friendship so no more,Mentalcomposer
sex one of them is still looking to either become fwb again or more this is probably the tiniest thing you or your wife should be getting annoyed about seriously does your wife really feel slighted over a meaningless affirmation on a holiday that has nothing to do with your fam they are neither her mother nor is she theirs you should wish your wife on behalf of your child and mother a hmd has your wife ever made an actual effort to get closer to your fam im gonna guess no she and you just think your fam should fawn all over her just because you married her it doesnt work that way did you call or see your mom for md did your wife extend a greeting to her even if she just shouted it while you were on the phone with mom ive been married a very long time so heres some advice these close relationships to your spouses family take time it starts small and grows my mil is now,Mentalcomposer
one of my favorite people i have no problem picking up the phone and chatting but in the beginning as in the first bunch of years no way stop looking for things to back up your claim that your mom and sis arent close with your wife accept the relationship and let it grow organically i thought i was the only person who just went with one other for my dress it was my mom she had 4 ds and that was her rule shes paying and its just us the only opinion she had was if the fabric was cheap cause i would have never known i also think your dress should be your decision it shouldnt be made by committee the bride shouldnt care if nobody else likes her dress as long as she does i thought the same thing no way any of their kids would have white blonde hair even did some google search to check the best they could do is strawberry blond from hs red gene and her,Mentalcomposer
if by some teeny tiny chance has a recessive blonde gene from her dads side thomas has dark hair as a younger man and im thinking samantha dyes hers blonde because she has dark eyebrows im confused tho you woke up he wasnt there so did he come home to take you to lunch and go back out are you sure hes actually working did you tell him you wanted to do xy and z on this day if you know he keeps taking these jobs on the weekend then you have to plan for him to block off that day you can always take the kids and go do something significant with them rent a car if you have to calling out means the person didnt show up for their scheduled shift they called to say they werent coming into work its so odd to us older people isnt it a signature had to be cursive somehow it always seemed at least to me that it made it more official or something we,Mentalcomposer
just had a discussion about this heres a thought and im sure im overlooking a lot of things so ai takes over some jobs ok its inevitable so now those people are out of jobs ok theyll find something else to do or retire or retire early because as it stands now weve got ss retirement accounts etc but these things are all based on at one time having a job and in most instances putting aside some of our income to fund these accounts except ss that comes out of our paychecks but then ai begins to take more and more jobs now we have i wont say millions but possibly 100s of thousands jobs being done by ai which means that same amount of people are unemployed how do they live do we institute ubi but where does that money come from and how much money is enough and even more importantly what do these people do all day do we really want this amount of people just sitting around all day,Mentalcomposer
long with nothing to do yeah hobbies travel etc but dont people innately want to have a purpose in life we can say raise taxes on companies because they no longer have to pay out as much in salaries but we all know companies arent going to want to do that why because their stock price is based off their earnings and the stock market is one of the leading indicators of the state of the economy so itll be an extremely hard fought battle to win we complain about not enough good paying jobs now whats it going to look like when there are literally no jobs left to be had and a ubi that allows only basic living if we think we have a great divide between wealth and poor it seems it would only get worse maybe i think there def needs to be some serious forethought to all this before we just replace anything with ai as i said im sure im missing a lot of the ins and outs,Mentalcomposer
but just looking ahead at possible pitfalls so basically if she never says or does anything to upset or annoy him all will be well shes got her head in the sand and thinks placating him will make it all ok but no one can placate forever there will always be another thing the kid finds fault with and lash out because of personally id leave i realize you love your wife but sometimes that is not enough you also need and want a partner one who will allow you to be an equal partner you can still have a relationship with your wife itll be more like dating again while you live apart if she wants you to stay out of it then stay way out as in separate households you dont say how long youve been together or ive missed it but it seems its been years what was he like when he was younger you say youve been to his sport events so im going to assume he hasnt been a,Mentalcomposer

so he then has to earn more to replace it or does he increase the amount he needs so he still cant pay his fair share you can do whatever youre comfortable with as far as your money but id never pay into a shared life unequally so my partner can hoard his cash do you ever feel like youll be subsidizing him forever why would i want to forget it every one of those events have made me who i am today if there are bad things you wish to forget that youve done or happened to you you make peace with it and move on you cant change them you dont have to rationalize them they just have to be a blip in your journey then why the heck are you contributing more he should be paying his fair half if for no other reason than to make up for his lack of companionship you need all your money to do things without him kidding but not really my sister would have,Mentalcomposer

take care of the baby because youre going to do that right but this is not going to turn into a living together and being a couple its not unheard of that a hookup gets pregnant and you both comparent but not have a relationship id have to ask him about it if he was that drunk its possible he doesnt even remember it and continues to hang out with these people who are clearly not his friends youve known him for 4 years does he look 20 or 16 do you recognize his clothes as what he wears now or in the past look for little clues as to a timeline or he knows it happened and it was a one off that his friends were just screwing with him because he got so drunk way way too far but idk these ppl either way it warrants a conversation he may be embarrassed but if he cant discuss it with you after 4 years together i wont say its a problem per say,Mentalcomposer
but you two should be able to talk about pretty much most things by now right now im kinda obsessed with married at first sight its a train wreck but i cant help myself does it not seem odd to anyone that you live outside of the country your godfather gets diagnosed decides to rewrite his will and the only person gf told he gave you your inheritance already was your brother the one who got everything im calling shenanigans on your brother hes gross taking advantage of a sick old man youre broken up stop obsessing over did she or didnt she cheat what diff would it make to know at this point anyway will you be more angry and what purpose will that serve being angry at your ex will do nothing for you except hinder your moving forward do you want to be an angry ex to any other girls you might meet cause thats a sure fire way to stay single nobody wants a bf who is stuck in the,Mentalcomposer

concern what did she do before you were around anyway what you need is some time to yourself stop picking her up every single day go back to your 3 dates a week you will have time for yourselves and will also have things to talk about when you get together maybe you should join a club or activity so you meet some people you need other things in your life besides her and tell her that you will not note will not entertain her ridiculous amount of texts throughout the day she can either stop sending them or be prepared for them to be ignored you are an adult you have a job you cant be watching tik toks all damn day you have to make your boundaries very clear to her or she will run over every one of them you need to have a talk with his mother is she as worried about him as you or is she ok with what hes doing if she is worried then you two,Mentalcomposer
need to decide what to do next if he has a therapist maybe it would be worthwhile to make sure they know what hes been saying maybe he needs in house mental health care im sorry youre going thru this its painful when your kids are struggling you are the teacher all teachers should aspire to be good job school dad if he had a draw id just throw them in but it feels odd to just throw them on a shelf all willy nilly idk now i feel like a weirdo im a woman and i do like your gf and it goes in a draw but i do the laundry and i fold my husbands underwear boxer briefs are bigger than my bikinis and have more structure to them his dresser is a tall one so he has shelves on the top where his underwear and socks go on the top shelf behind doors and deep drawers on the bottom so he stacks his undies so in order to stack they need,Mentalcomposer
to be folded makes perfect sense to me i agree the idea that shes more worried about talking to him is a problem she might find that after spending however long24 hrs with hubby she might actually enjoy alone time and she gets to hang with her gfs for her bday and talk about the wedding and honeymoon i realize tho that some people feel a certain way about their bday maybe shes one of them me ill celebrate whenever just wish me hb on the day and were good i dont even want a gift just take me to dinner i tripped coming down stairs and broke my tibia i sprain my ankles pretty easily so i thought it was just that hobbled on it the rest of the evening and until midday the next day i was on vacation at the time had a cast up to my knee and was told no weight on it at all got home a week later went to ortho and the break was stable so,Mentalcomposer

pm then she can both go do whatever and you can go to sleep when you need to also texting is ok too you dont have to have marathon calls every night of course they did have to keep it till the 11th our so both sides can tout their compromises and their thats what we were proposing all alongs this whole routine is getting old i think it doesnt matter that its a you feel as opposed to her feeling that way shes not going to admit shes just with you for the lifestyle you can afford her so it doesnt even make sense to ask add in that its difficult to talk to her about money why is that you think this relationship isnt an equal financial partnership in addition to not feeling this is a romantic pairing anymore shes a gf not a wife there is no reason you have to stay with her if you want to move and go back to school she supported her d before you came,Mentalcomposer
along and she can go back to doing just that youre going to work part time to basically help support her and her d why would you do that youll be gone 5 out of 7 days of the week its time you decide what you want not what you think is the right thing to do as far as gf is concerned nta i dont think theres anything wrong with that we do it frequently in my family and we all live about an hour away we just had a childs bday the day before mothers day and we all gave the moms their gifts then no sense driving on sat seeing everyone and then driving again on sunday just give your dad a heads up that since youre making the drive for the graduation its silly to do it again just a week later he shouldnt have a problem with it nta hes afraid youll expose him as the abuser he is to the gf i might accidentally on purpose run into,Mentalcomposer
gf at daycare one day if at least ask the daycare people about her does she seem like shes nice enough to your d doesnt the daycare realize that all of a sudden someone new is picking up d and using her dads pin to do it you would think they would want to know who she is give her her own pin and have a contact number stop trying to find your one and only that will lead you to settling just so you have someone which is why you maybe stayed in an emotionally challenging relationship for so long take this little break to analyze what it is you want in a partner and what you are not willing to put up with this is especially important for people who had less than easy relationships you dont want to get back in the same routine just because its what you know does that make sense wasnt sure how to put it when you feel you are at your strongest then you can,Mentalcomposer
put yourself out there and start dating again and maybe you can be the one to go after the person you want to be with iow ask out the guy you want to get to know instead of waiting for him to do the asking how many guys do we not date because they didnt ask itll happen maybe when you least expect it but is he in therapy its great that your bro adopted an older kid but he had to know this child would come with some issues its been years what are they doing to help him then thats what you should do move out to the country you two are never going to agree on lifestyle and be assured where you live will dictate your lifestyle youll stay in london and be unhappy and years from now youll realize you should have left years ago nta as long as when applying for this job your wife knew there would be travel i cant imagine you went thru the application interview,Mentalcomposer
process and accepted this job without talking to your wife about it but also its only 4 days with one almost 4 yo why cant she handle that i would tell her that instead of making excuses as to why she thinks hes still open to the idea she needs to just ask him its a simple do you want kids that is either a yes or a no question not a discussion although we all know he doesnt she needs to hear it point blank why in the world would you volunteer that info theres no reason for her to ask specifics of your where and what you did with a past gf and its kind of gross that you even told her maybe you should think about having some respect for the woman you date and not go blabbing a gentleman never tells reditt has a mix of everything i like seeing how diff generations deal with issues theres funny sad stupid weird crazy posts its amazing to see glimpses into how,Mentalcomposer

your dad may well be ready for a nh by the time hes 86 i think this will work if he can pay cash for 6 or more years he can transfer the house now then it wont be in the look back period make double sure what the look back period is i think it may be longer but im going with this time since it seems to be the consensus in the comments also when you move him in go see the social services office they should have one explain to them that your dad is private pay his house is not needing to be sold in order to pay his bill and no one from the facility should be talking to his dad about it at all have them put it in his admission record watch them do it explain that linda is pushing this and its not going to happen you might want to get a poa for your dad that way he cant be held if he signs anything,Mentalcomposer

id mention the fact that none of them contacted you when your bf of 4 yrs disappeared when you were pregnant and both him and his mother ignored repeated attempts at contact after that then mention the repeated attempts after the baby was born and passed then nicely mention they can all go to hell nta how old is this guy i wouldnt let him in either even if i heard him this is lower than even basic adulting he remembers to lock the door and that doesnt instantly make him realize he needs a key you can always tell him to wear his key on a string around his neck like the latchkey kids always did not going to be popular but oh well honestly i think your wife is just done with parenting altogether its easy to just say go out and play you bathed them took to urgent care went to pharmacy made breakfast and she hadnt even gotten out of bed yet then you still had to go fill the,Mentalcomposer
prescription and then she gives you attitude and decides she isnt talking to you im all for giving the sahp a day to sleep in and taking over the kids but when my spouse tells me its urgent care time you bet im up and seeing whats going on has she always been so irresponsible this relationship has run its course its extremely common when ppl start dating as teens but you are an adult and you have to know that cheating is not the way to get out of a relationship thats a cop out you knew on some level exactly what you were doing and you thought this would be a sure fire way for your gf to break up with you im shocked you were the one who had to tell her you havent said much about your gf reaction is she not upset how could she even want to still live with you are you planning on living together until sept thats a mistake doesnt your school break for summer,Mentalcomposer
go back home or find someone who has a graduating roommate and move in there me too just never liked her maybe its time to lay out everything sis has said and done to you to the kids if they dont know that way they will know to stay away from sis and not believe anything she says they are old enough to make a decision not to be around their aunt and id expect them to decline any invites where she will be your h can go alone he is the one who didnt put a stop to this nonsense from the very beginning i can understand partner worries about transitioning in that climate but what op is asking about has less to do with that the way i read it is that each one of them is asking for reassurance about the other still wanting to be a couple its their personal relationship they are worried about and in that case the transitioning one is not really reassuring op why shouldnt both,Mentalcomposer
of them be each others support ops life is drastically changing also she is going from having a male partner to having a female partner its a lot to handle and their concerns shouldnt be discounted just because shes not the one going thru the physical transition they need to know that during and after transition their partner is planning to still be there op you need to explain to your partner what youre feeling and thinking your partner should be doing everything in their power to reassure you when your insecurities creep in i dont think id want anyone in my home without me being there even if you know half this couple isnt it kind of understood that youd all be going back to your home together at the end of the night thats what i would expect if i was the friend maybe call your friend and ask her to thank her bf for the trinkets you should def acknowledge it i always wonder tho you spent a few hours with,Mentalcomposer
this new person did any of you actually try to talk to him get to know him its hard being the new one its natural to be the more quiet one in this setting if you did and he didnt really reciprocate or try to keep the convo going then great but usually its the group just doing their thing and expecting the newbie to just join right on in which if youre not an outgoing personality is hard to do if one wants kids then its not going to work ever if its a matter of spouse just wanting to sponge off the other then you have to decide if thats a dynamic you would be happy with if you can afford to live on one income and the stay home person is willing to look at doing all the domestic upkeep as their job and the other will be ok with that then maybe try it out but if one feels that no one should be a stay home person then again,Mentalcomposer
its not going to work someone will always be resentful ooh how good would it be if no photogs even bothered to take her pic she gets out of the car no flashes she walks to the door no flashes she walks out at the end no flashes that would be awesome conventional wisdom says dont quit until you have another job lined up so thats what you should be doing use your unhappiness about your job and homelife to give you that push to find another job id you quit with nothing lined up you will be home all day in a place that makes you miserable you have an education so you should be able to find something else and dont just take anything find something you think wont make you miserable but also that will allow you to move out even with a roommate or two dont just go thru life start taking a pro active stance with your life its the only one you got thats all well and good,Mentalcomposer
if you want to believe that but the second i walked in and saw everyone else i would have had some questions of my sister and i wouldnt have stayed after such a blatant disrespect of my relationship i believe your hopefully ex gf never mind fianc knew all along theres no way she hasnt been around or talked to anyone in the family or friends in the lead up to this marriage for it to not come out why you are still with this person is beyond me you obviously arent her number one and if im marrying someone thats the spot they should be in well id like to think a 4 year old knows the word beautiful one of mine was reading by then who do i call to get an article about them it still just blows my mind that any and i mean any publication would print obvious puff pieces that have anything to do with these two i cant be bothered to check cause i really dont care,Mentalcomposer
but did either of these two publications cover the chase non chase or do they just exist to go give platitudes oh did you think she was actually going to do something ive figured her out since shes a woman and self proclaimed activist she thinks that is enough to get otherpeople to do something she just collects awards while others do the work i can understand her wanting stability you have a child together and she wants to be married for all the protections that come with that for her and your child so give her a wedding maybe not the one she wants but one you can afford stability in a relationship is more about the innate knowledge that youre in a partnership that person is there for the long haul through it all its less about the stuff you have but stability also comes in another form and keeping even one of the properties will give you instant financial stability in the future if the need arises for an immediate need,Mentalcomposer
for a large amount of cash a luxury apt is nice if its well within your income level to purchase and upkeep it which it isnt because you have to sell off both your safety nets to afford it not to mention one is your childhood home or would stability come from owning an apt that is easily affordable and you can then save more for experiences you both may want in the future travel or hobbies or extra activities for your child or if you have another or two or more children kids are expensive im one who has always believed to live below your means without denying myself certain things that i want and save as much money as possible investments and building wealth will always trump biggerbetter or more expensive every time for me just something to think about nta its absolutely astonishing to me that your gf wants to sell property as part of financing a wedding and not just 1 property but both of them how big of a,Mentalcomposer
wedding does she want and how expensive of an apt i could maybe understand maybe selling the apt if its not a place you or her do not want to live maybe you cant live in the country while working in the city or for whatever reason but in that case proceeds from that sale should be used only to buy something where you want to live even if you have to finance the rest the country house would be a wonderful place to have as a respite from every day life in a city talk to her it seems theres more to this is she looking at expensive luxury apts when you normally wouldnt be able to afford and wants that as status you should have cancelled the weekend with your sister on wed or thursday when you realized you are not up to having visitors idk about the secondary stress but if you cant even get off the couch i really hope your sister isnt expecting you to entertain her and the,Mentalcomposer
kids why would she even want to come if you are so sick thats just risking her and or the kids getting sick also do yourself a favor and lock yourself in your bedroom until you feel well enough sis can use your home as a base and take the kids out to do whatever she wants and she can feed them on her own also i would never still visit if i knew my sister was so sick your sister is being selfish thank you for that it would take a bit of getting used to for sure nobody thinks how parents feel when the kids move away for their careers or just because they want to try living elsewhere and i think it really depends on how often you saw them were in the same state as our parents and sibs but they both live an hour away we see them a few times a year each holidays birthdays etc we def think about that when we talk of moving away like,Mentalcomposer
how often do we really see everyone and we can just travel back yeah the whole thing with the cab and go pro was odd were they originally stopped for a red light or did they just get into the cab either way you get in and take off why would the security guy in the cab get out to try to shoo away the one guy all that did was make the cab stay stopped for a longer time thus more photos and none of the three of them even tried to hide their faces if you want to make the pics unusable you dont give them a shot you give them the most unusable pose you can yeah the whole thing with the cab and go pro was odd were they originally stopped for a red light or did they just get into the cab either way you get in and take off why would the security guy in the cab get out to try to shoo away the one guy all,Mentalcomposer
that did was make the cab stay stopped for a longer time thus more photos and none of the three of them even tried to hide their faces if you want to make the pics unusable you dont give them a shot you give them the most unusable pose you can i had heard it was because in coed classes the boys were getting more attention from educators and the girls were kind of getting lost in the shuffle boys called on more for answers girls questions not being explained to satisfaction those sorts of things so having all girls would let them be more involved in the lessons or discussions the problem i see with sending the photos to the friend is that you have no idea who else hes sharing or showing them to at least when your h shared he was in control im assuming by just showing the friend his phone and i hate to say it but you shouldnt need any affirmation from other men to make you feel,Mentalcomposer
good i understand missing your h but that could lead to a slippery slope and you might not even notice it happening i would let h know and hope hed blast the friend and i would let the friend know what his gf said then id send a scathing text to gf then block her and the friend so wait was there even any paparazzi trying to follow them the article says they didnt want it known where they were staying so they were driven around for a over an hour overkill much but was there anyone actually even following them it doesnt actually say that so then what go to the police station to what wait for another car oh and they had to be escorted to the next block before they could get into them other car these two are only important in their own minds so much drama for absolutely nothing this chick lives for pictures of her was she afraid someone was gonna break into her hotel room gmafb dont,Mentalcomposer
be so quick to judge lots of younger kids gain a lot of weight right before they have a growth spurt where their weight evens out with their height but when i see older kids within a family and all of them are overly big then i wonder why the parents werent more conscious of the kids at least like they can be however big they want but wouldnt you want better for the kids sandals are even better than sneakers if you have a lightweight button down that looks great with shorts too roll up the sleeves the idea that you both have to see other people in order to know that you want to be with each other permanently makes no sense to me there will always be someone else that either of you could fall in love with and that person becomes the one the idea is that when you find a person you want to commit forever to you stop looking but you two are young have been together since,Mentalcomposer
youre teens so basically what youre both saying is you both want to play the field sleep around and see if theres someone better out there because you havent and you dont want to regret it and thats fine to want to most people do that in their teens until their mid 20s or longer just realize this be honest and verbalize this if you want to pretend that dating others will be the catalyst to losing weight and solidifying that your current partner is actually the one you might be surprised with the reality and are you both prepared for that i think it depends on what youre doing after the grad ceremony if youre going to a lunch at a decently nice restaurant then please dress accordingly if youre only going to the ceremony to be there for a friend and not going out afterward then i think its ok but actually i hate flip flops in public especially on men so i really think you should put sneakers on how about,Mentalcomposer
nicer shorts a polo and a pair of sneakers youre still comfy but look like you made an effort there are a lot of recipes that hide veggies in regular meals try to look up some of them at least hell be getting some nutrients that way one i know is shredding carrot into meatloaf so things like that is it just a case of him not used to these veggies maybe try to get some veggies that he would have from his home country so hes at least eating something healthy does he eat fruit its not a substitute but its good for him at least then you can try to introduce new ones be patient everything is new to him and hes only 10 info how long are you dating and is this your first serious relationship if you care for this woman at all you would let her go you want to go back to normal but verbal abuse has no place in a relationship you admit you have verbally abused,Mentalcomposer
her for all 4 yrs of this relationship you are not a good partner because of your anger issues you need to stay single get some help for your anger issues and only then should you try to have another relationship you cannot solve your issues on your own and asking this woman to be abused more from you is cruel late to this thread but ive heard this is a new thing ccl is doing its not so much an offer anyone can earn it i read something about it but i think it works this way as you gamble on the ship you accrue points you always had an option to convert these points to free play while on the same sailing points do not transfer to another sailing so it didnt make much sense not to convert them you did however earn some perks on the sailing ie at 1500 points you get free drinks in the casino you might get a steakhouse dinner or a spa service but idk how,Mentalcomposer
many points you needed for any of them now however the new plan is that if you do not convert your points you are supposed to be given a certificate for the above amounts depending on how many points you earn but i believe these certificates are used for a future cruise so is it worth it idk but i just play whatever i would normally play and whatever i get i get i wouldnt overspend my budget just to get to the next level of points im harsh because honestly im gonna take care of me first what he does after you break up with him is of no concern of yours at this point id send a text tell him its over youre done tell him to get some help then block him everywhere and all those friends who hate you now once you block him you can give them a heads up that its their turn to take care of him you know since they care so much then block them,Mentalcomposer
too you dont need these people in your life id rather have no friends nta its not your parents event idc who is paying for it your fsil said pants or a dress so you can wear the pantsuit and i dont know you but a pantsuit will look great on you go and have a great time and after the wedding try and keep in touch more with bro and sil i have found that once i really get to know a potential romantic partner their attractiveness or lack of becomes a non issue like their personality just meshes so well with me that they in turn become sort of better looking in my eyes if that makes any sense i know this person would not be on anyones top 10 good looking list but that one trait just isnt a dealbreaker compared to the immense feelings when im with this person but if youre talking about do i have to find my partner attractive all day every day no we all go,Mentalcomposer
thru periods when were not looking our best did we gain weight happen to get a horrible haircut that changes the way we look did we radically change the clothes we wear cause were in a weird fashion phase those types of things come and go take a good look at your partner when theyre all slack and sleeping probably not the best look but that is them in a raw sort of way im thinking it wasnt malicious more so that the two of you you and sil are the babys main caregivers not great wording by mil i love my mil but i would have laughed and said something sarcastically funny like wait im the mom i did the labor and have the body to prove it or said to sil ok you get her when she wont stop crying since were sharing anyway i cannot fathom why your h and bil were included unless the gift was a ticket for each of you to go out somewhere together are you gonna,Mentalcomposer
get a fathers day gift too honestly i usually dont care if the story itself is a bit disjointed ill see if it evens out or ill even reread a sentence that sounds odd to figure out what theyre trying to say but spelling errors are a non starter for me a random one here or there ok constantly nope i just stop reading you want to be a writer ffs learn to spell or get even a friend to read just for spelling errors i want to know why you want to do this are you gonna wake up and have a couple shots in the morning or wait before bed there is absolutely no good reason for you to do this are you making up for lost time do you think itll make you a grown up what this just seems like a weird ritual to start this is what i would and have told my daughter he can be frustrated and rant and rave about that thing but he has absolutely,Mentalcomposer
no right to take it out on you get up and leave you do not sit there and take it you need to draw a line with him tell him in no uncertain terms that you will not be treated in this way this is your first bf know your worth and what you are willing to put up with and what you are not and this is not one saying sorry does not negate the fact that he scares and hurts you there are other guys out there oh yes i watch a lot of news programs the one thing that always gets me talking back to the tv is when anyone usually politicians are on there telling me again what the problem is and blaming someone else usually the other party so ok we all know the problem so instead of blaming someone else tell me what you propose as a solution id rather listen to a ridiculous idea than no idea just give her back the money for her ticket and,Mentalcomposer
take someone else wow had no idea about any of that so thank you id be up for building a bigger building you dont have to have a high credit line but you could call your cc and ask them to increase it for a medical emergency it might be helpful to call before hand and ask if thats something they could do in the event of an emergency maybe explain that you have insurance and can prove that so they know you will have the means to repay my policy is a pay now and get reimbursed so if i have to go to the ships doctor i pay and then submit for reimbursement but for example medical evac i call the insurance and they make the arrangements im not expected to lay out half a million for that what form of govt do we move towards correct me if im wrong but the system we have now was laid out in the constitution so in order to change it to something else,Mentalcomposer
wed have to effectively dismantle the constitution keep the good parts and change the bad parts that will never happen our system should work there are adequate checks and balances to keep things on the up and up but individual interests are always going to take precedent over the greater good im certainly not educated enough to know where it all went wrong and i suspect its been a long time of small incremental changes that have got us where we are today but it would be an interesting discussion from what i read and see middletown township has a really great special needs program like people move here just for that the problem is there arent a lot of rentals around and home prices are high id suggest getting a list of school districts checking out col see if you can afford to live there and take into account what your commute would be and if you can find anything about their special needs programs dont know if its published but then join,Mentalcomposer
the facebook group for those towns or cities and ask there ive seen moms ask and the responses have been overwhelmingly positive those that have been thru it are the most knowledgeable of the ins and outs i think i remember it being this way hospitals were so wildly overcrowded that the idea was that anyone who came from a nursing home and was deemed stable or on the way to recovery could be sent back to finish their recovery in the nh but the caveat was that the nh was supposed to be able to segregate these patients away from the other residents until they were no longer able to infect others if youve ever visited a nh youd realize that this is impossible to do besides there being no empty rooms usually each resident has an assigned room and as is the case with older residents they know where they belong suddenly moving not sick patients out of their room in order to use that room for a recovering but sick resident,Mentalcomposer
will not go over well and vice versa moving sick out of their room so i think nhs took back recovering residents either thinking they could make it work or knowing they couldnt but were getting so much pressure to alleviate the hospitals burden or the nh only gets paid from medicare when the resident is actually in house that they didnt want to forgo that payment i have a relative in a nh and i will say there is no way to stop the spread of any communicable illness most of the residents dont even ever leave the home even just to be outside on the patio some more mobile residents can get themselves out there but most need assistance and the staff cant be bothered and there are never any windows opened luckily mine never caught covid during the major surge but we suspect she had it prior i get that she thinks shell get a payout but it comes up so often that kc will be the one who pays that,Mentalcomposer
it just gets on my last nerve again with kc paying her out i really dont understand what the rationale for this would be even if she has an nda shell never stop she will find a way to get whatever she wants to get out to get out another leaked letter to a friend anonymous friend source spilling info cryptic statements it is not kcs responsibility to get rid of her what could she really know at this point nothing so earth shattering damaging to anyone but harry and i have no problem if she drags him thru the mud its just karma coming back to him nta personally moms attitude is crappy you are supposed to fund a gift and a dinner for 4 people just make her lunch at home and be done with it shes taking this mothers day thing way too far considering she only has 1 kid who has a job shes never going to see your side of it she needs to be right more than she,Mentalcomposer
needs a relationship with you your partner needs to stop entertaining his mom he needs to tell her if she has something to say to you she should say it to you not him and hes ending any conversation that goes that way shell either get in touch with you or not but your h being the go between at this point is ridiculous it doesnt matter dont analyze someone you are not dating its exhausting move on nobody should have any patience for a constant on off relationship we either want to be together and resolve our issues or we go our separate ways nta you have two other kids in that house that you need to protect not that they need to know i say you have every right to ask hes living with you and you are caring for him through this tumultuous time in his life he should trust you enough with the information but dont say that and just accept if he wont share his diagnosis tablecloths because i,Mentalcomposer
hate to see the fold marks when its on the table nta for keeping the letters i would have also do you forgive him the problem with lying is that once they lie you dont know what if anything else is true only you can decide if your relationship is real with him or not what did he say about all of this why lie about having a gf whyd he keep the letters what did she mean to him i have an idea about why he lied but id like to know what he said so im a lot behind on this whole story so if someone could explain please phone hacking i agree would be something to sue over but paying for a pi to get info any him or anyone else just seems to me like its a normal course of events so for example if im a tabloid or even just a newspaper how else could i report on a celebs activities if i didnt know where they would be,Mentalcomposer
seems like to hire someone to follow them would be par for the course also the suspicious phone calls what made them suspicious were they hang ups were they asking for confirmation if the subject was going to be at a particular party ceremony etc sorry but other than the hacking is hiring a pi even if its to follow someone illegal walk the strip and go into each casino hotel its fun to see the diff theming nta for trying but i dont think its going to do any good you can try to occupy him when its usually her days but shell just change up her schedule the fact that he proposed a poly says that he isnt willing to stop seeing her and that is the real issue why hasnt he if he knows you are not happy with her specifically why isnt he putting your marriage first what did he say when you said no to a poly situation she sounds a bit unhinged youre getting in the way of,Mentalcomposer
true love and its gods will does he not think these missives are a problem he may well be miserable in the gloomy grey cold winter time its a thing but also some people dont need to see their so every day you guys see each other at work so theres no reason you need to be seeing each other every night also when do you see your friends do laundry grocery shop pick one week night and make that your night wed is good its right in the middle then you can decide if and what youre going to do on the weekend hes telling you its too much not that he never wants to see you again give him space so basically you just dont want him to show up on mothers day with a gift from your kids and then you all go to his moms like youve always done because you had a fight and are still not talking if you successfully dodge him on moms day and he gets,Mentalcomposer
in touch on monday what are you going to do it seems like youre trying to punish him by making him go to his moms alone as for the picture chances are his d is putting hers in front of yours find another spot you dont want to go on vacay with his parents bc of whatever happened last year fine but has that situation been resolved at all if not why would you ever entertain mothers day with his mom no key did you ask for it back or were you waiting for him to make a grand gesture over it theres a lot of passive aggressive going on here speak up use your words look its been 9 years it either works or it doesnt and it seems like it doesnt work maybe it did for a time but realize this both your and his kids are seeing this and im sure its not the first time this is the way this is all what he thinks theres not one iota of,Mentalcomposer
what he says that would show that he actually knows for a fact that the kids watched or that the non existent party happened or that h tucked anyone into bed that night so basically this is a non story its really easy for anyone to say what someone else would do or thought or felt but those ideas are based off of what we ourselves would think or do or feel why even give this guy any interviews have they not caught on that hes not reliable at this point did they actually say that do they really expect you to never have another partner that you should be alone and lonely while they go off and make their lives were not talking about children here who are still living home they should have some semblance of sharing a life with someone especially the 29 yo so if any of their marriages dont work out they are never going to look for another partner because they might be replacing the first one your,Mentalcomposer
kids are being selfish by denying you the happiness you deserve and im over here pushing my step dad to move on and its been over 10 years since my mom passed i want him to have someone to share his life with why should he be alone nta but your dad sure is the first person he should have told is his wife what does he hope to accomplish my telling you kids first is he hoping one of you will tell mom so he doesnt have to he makes no sense at all what if he tells you all and takes his sweet time telling mom do we all just pretend all is well mom might not see it coming but shes been as unhappy as him she might welcome the divorce i need to know how this person knows their partner did the partner move to nigeria after an in person relationship or is this an online thing if its online absolutely no way in hell should a parent leave their,Mentalcomposer
child to go meet someone they have never met and i dont care which country it is but doubly if the country could be dangerous if its a case of knowing this person and they had to live for a legit reason like a job then i might go but my partner would need to meet me at the airport and not leave me alone in an unfamiliar country doubly if its a dangerous country come on this is basic common sense even if i didnt have a child why would i put myself in a dangerous situation in a foreign country i have no idea if nigeria is dangerous to travel to i got the sense that you think its dangerous yeah and we have no idea if thats really what he said ive seen 3 or 4 diff interpretations of the lip readers i dont trust any of them i do find it hard to believe that h would talk about either his fam or m in this way so freely with,Mentalcomposer
jack unless they have been in regular contact like was jack asking how are you and h went into a litany of complaints or has jack been privy to any ongoing crap with m or the fam that theyve previously spoke about i didnt think they had that kind of relationship if they do it would be the only secret either harkle ever kept does your h understand that your dr has not cleared you to go back to work theres clearly a reason for this explain it to him again in plain english obviously his advanced degree isnt in english i will never be able to go back to my high paying job that i love that supports this family if i do not get myself mentally healthy in order to get healthy i need to rest and rest means not working a crappy job while you refuse to be a partner to me and a responsible dad to our children the answer to this is that you take over being the support,Mentalcomposer
of this family as i have been for the past 10 years if you cannot do that then you are not the man i thought i married that man would be worried that i had an actual mental breakdown at work that man would be doing everything in his power to support me until i am better and able to resume my career if that is not you then tell me now and ill figure out what my next steps should be because i cannot go on like this sorry but i cannot understand your husbands attitude at all i dont understand why anyone would change majors just because they arent getting straight as that was the first mistake your kid made straight bs gets the same diploma as as so they changed majors to something they didnt even like thats the second mistake so now theyre miserable just let the kid quit this job if they keep getting bad reviews they wont have a job and they wont have a god recommendation either,Mentalcomposer
let them come home get some therapy if they need it and let them figure it out from there this isnt a hard decision nta first off quit whatever job you have your health is more important does your h at least agree with the fact that the household needs an income that covers your bills and even more importantly has benefits that cover your medically fragile child this is a man who has a masters degree and is confused as to why he needs to get a job so what exactly does he think the solution should be too bad if its going to hurt her someone always is going to be upset in a breakup better her than you break up block her everywhere and move on youll be better for it no because in order for her kids to experience anything like this she would be forced to volunteer you know like an actual act of service and not get paid for doing it oh the horror youre missing the point,Mentalcomposer
here establishing paternity is in your childs best interest if he is the father then you can file for support thru the courts and he will have to pay that benefits your child but if you just want to keep going back and forth with him he will not just hand you money for the baby every month as he has proven split the cost of the test massive massive yta in the event this is actually true which i doubt strongly because no one can be this out of touch what exactly do you and your wife do in regards to your kids your bro has been doing literally everything for your kids between you and your wife you dont even bathe and put the kids to bed how exactly is him doing the kids laundry going to help you out so much seems to me you have an over abundance of free time after work and on the weekends since you dont do anything else you do realize he has a job,Mentalcomposer
and a life that doesnt revolve around your kids i really hope he just leaves in the middle of the night id love to see how that next morning goes so he asks if her robe is heavy whatever she said made him instantly uncomfortable maybe it was something like its a small sacrifice for the family crownfamily or service is a huge weight to bare or she really dug in with something like youd know if you stuck around no theres nothing to be embarrassed about this relationship isnt doing it for you anymore youre thinking is that there has to be a big reason to break up with someone but you can break up with someone for any or no reason dont stay with her or anyone you are not 100 invested in its not fair to you or them found this he needs to see a dentist and a doctor its possible that at 18 this ldr satisfied your emotional needs and even just seeing each other intermittently was doing it,Mentalcomposer
it may be tho that at 20 it isnt satisfying your needs and you need a partner in closer proximity or youre just really bored with this girl it happens have you tried redirecting the conversation or has your wife do the other men also add to these little anecdotes sex conversations will and have come up occasionally but they are short lived and not every time were with friends thats an odd topic to always come up maybe the other women keep bringing it up because your wife never has anything to share theyre trying to figure her out your issue is your frustration with your sex life not that your wife laughs along with the conversation its been 8 years you must have some idea what is holding your wife back is it something that can even be fixed with therapy if not all the therapy in the world will do no good maybe you as a couple should see an actual sex therapist gf is tah for not deleting the pic,Mentalcomposer
as soon as asked especially bc they know op doesnt want them to have those type of pics and op is tah for physically restraining the gf it should not have had to get to that point but gf did challenge op to come get it and they did so it seems as if your parents and his know each other do they speak often i ask because you said you argue with your parents over something and once they see they have no reasonable reason to say no they back down and you get your way i wonder if your parents can explain to his parents why they are ok with this trip and maybe that would help his parents get on board i understand its cultural but you both have the same cultural norms yet your parents are being more tolerable esh just the fact that she didnt delete it as soon as you asked is a problem for me especially that youve already had this conversation today its a picture what,Mentalcomposer
is tomorrow boundary break going to be i have to trust that my partner is going to respect me enough to not do things i specifically ask them not to ywbta if you say anything now this family is your uncles wifes no why would these people even be invited to your wedding i can understand being close to an uncle and his wife but her family other then saying hi and bye at occasions your uncle has you can absolutely not invite them plus youre no where close to even getting married so leave it for now i have no judgement because honestly i am not understanding this your friend wanted you to design her wedding invitations were you supposed to draw or write one invite and then shed what make photocopies and send them out were you supposed to hand write all the invites is there a reason she didnt just order invitations i would think he would be invited with a plus 1 and that would be you i wouldnt expect,Mentalcomposer
to receive my own invite to weddings of his friends or family you can always ask at least for his brother wont you have to make arrangements with work yes i am in the hopeless phase right now im in the having it all planned out in my head and just need to start phase dont give up just yet youre doing well with breakfast and lunch its just dinner thats messing you up so maybe try telling your wife thats a problem shes going to have to be supportive of what youre trying to do or this wont work you can go out to eat but watch what you order have a salad before your meal chicken or fish and a veg then when your meal comes half everything in the plate only eat that and ask for a take away box thats tomorrows dinner box it up and be done have a coffee after dinner and maybe a few bites of your wifes desert when youre going to eat at home youre,Mentalcomposer
going to have to plan for it grill up a bunch of chicken on sunday use that for a day or two add a salad or a veg its ok if you and wife dont eat the same things every night there were plenty of times i cooked for the fam and ate a salad and added a protein i almost always snack on nuts in the evening if i just need something to nosh on i find they satisfy that need with a small portion youre doing so well all day long dont let the one evening meal mess it all up this was your tipping point not the time you spent working while planning for and having a baby and he did nothing but tag along on vacation while you worked was that part of your plan you can have a year off with the baby so he gets one too im gonna guess that he isnt making the same money you did and thats why you need to have such a,Mentalcomposer
tight budget but did either of you think maybe he should have been working last year and you could have built up some savings you had a plan but it had some holes in it im afraid this is going to be a very long year for you youve been stuck for several years coincidently youve been with the bf for several years is it possible that part of your dissatisfaction is that you cut your traveling plan short to stay with your bf and youre wanderlust is creeping back in you have been working so its not as if hes been supporting you not everybody is going to be so career driven or always have another goal to reach a lot of people just fall into a career find its pretty ok and stay with it no one can tell you what you should do with your life but you like traveling and have had a passion for it so maybe try to find something in the travel planning sector or work for,Mentalcomposer
an airline to get the travel benefits theres also online teaching english which might be better than in class i think theres some kind of test you can take that shows what you have an aptitude for you might try that and see if it gives you any ideas otherwise just look at some job sites and see if anything sparks your interest you might get lucky and find something what has he tried to do to get his weight under control that after 2 years he hasnt been able to find something he can stick with we all know exactly what we have to do to lose weight and control our cravings and a lot of us just cant be bothered but when it becomes an actual medical issue thats when it shocks us into action is he not actually scared about this health issue why not you have to decide if you are ok with a relationship of no sex and a man 10 years older with health issues at 24 it,Mentalcomposer
would be a no from me you need to have a serious talk with your bf he wants to move and you dont have you discussed this at all have you told him why you want to stay your job daycare and family support what could he say to counter that you live together but are on and off how does that work when youre off does one of you stay somewhere else or do you just ignore each other on the regular while still living in the same place look this relationship doesnt sound very stable its good that you are conscious of stability for not just you but also your child but buying a house on your own with no discussion will not go over well at all and i could absolutely understand that from his point of view have the tough conversations now nobody wants to have them but you need to figure out what is going on with your relationship because honestly it seems like neither one of you are,Mentalcomposer
all that committed to the other once you figure that out a plan going forward will quickly emerge youll either both want to stay together and youll buy a house together or youll go your separate ways and figure out visitation and child support whichever way it goes at least youre both not in limbo thats the only way i like them firm and crunchy or dried is really good too but i like all my fruit like that theres something so gross to bite into a fruit and the juice goes everywhere we only do it for final jeopardy if we need time to decipher the clue during the game we just yell out the answers your art is stunning you are very talented so he keeps saying he wants someone on the same level as him in regards to some very specific things has it occurred to you that he threatens divorce just so you will bend to his every whim do you find yourself changing things you do after he threatens,Mentalcomposer
you shouldnt have to put up with a looming threat over your head every single the day from the person who is supposed to love you the most id tell him the next time he brings up divorce is the day i will be finding a lawyer he needs to find a better way of communicating the old heshe loves me so much they want to spend all their time with me excuse no its weird and controlling 5 pm for preschool yikes i still wouldnt do it its not your job and frankly you went to school to be a teacher not a bus monitor i cant believe the other teachers dont feel the exact same way this is an assistant problem they can figure it out id remove myself from the situation give the assistants the number to call for a sub bus monitor and be done if they cant get a sub one day then one of them does it you know because its their job nah so greeting guests means,Mentalcomposer
what after church when we walked out we stayed by the church doors and as the guests filed out we greeted them thanked them for coming and they have their congrats but this was both sets of parents then leading up to us if this is what youre doing why would you not have stepmom standing right next to dad while receiving guests if greeting guests is a mob thing then id think its a fob thing also are your new inlaws in this receiving line also and its really not all that much trouble to have her in the room where youre getting ready im assuming your bridesmaids will be there also this one seems petty to me like theres not really a reason for it other than exclusion and lastly ive never seen anyone but the best man give any kind of speech at a wedding but that could just be the norm where im from if your dad is making a speech then sm can stand up there with him she,Mentalcomposer
doesnt have to talk but its the acknowledgement that they are together and shes a part of your life and his speech should reflect on that nta i wouldnt do bus duty either if its not part of my job as a lead im sure you have other teacher duties that you need to do after school or at home thats the stuff you do and assistants do the bus you have 4 assistants its their job so they can take an extra day each week i would just tell all of them not my job i get car sick and im not doing it they are free to do whatever they want what time does school end that you get back at 6 pm this is really odd to me tho where i live the bus company hires drivers and aides for the bus any change in how they see him is only gonna change if they see him so if he wants any relationship with your fam he needs to start showing,Mentalcomposer
up thats really all there is to it so now im curious does she print her signature on everything like im thinking a drivers license or bank acct application my youngest is 26 and they were taught cursive the ex is certainly taking up a lot of space in your head why is that are you not secure enough with your bf how does she ever come up in conversation and what did he say when he told you she misses him but if you just want to break up to save yourself some drama then thats perfectly ok also it may be your intuition telling you that this isnt a forever thing not that hes cheating or anything more a feeling of shes always gonna be lurking somewhere and you just dont want to deal with it and honestly it doesnt seem like youd be all that hurt if you do break up so maybe youre not as invested which is good ill tell you this tho if you decide to stay make,Mentalcomposer
sure you go to every family function make yourself seen shes thinking she intimidated you into not going and shes right treat her like shes any other of sisters friend thats not really an ultimatum tho he hasnt really given you any indication hes into you but you keep trying anyway why im sure hes a great guy but theres not much coming from him his indifference is telling you all you need to know hes not the last guy in the world find someone who actually wants to be with you and stop wasting your time do you really want to be with someone that you have to chase until he just gives in then youll be here all sad because you chased and chased finally got him but it isnt the grand love affair you envisioned so its not really about having an independent life its all about having a partner well to attract a partner you need to be a good partner your mh is bad but you arent getting help,Mentalcomposer
for it you had a job but they cut your hours so you just stopped showing up instead of getting a part time job since you had extra time to work take a second and just stop and think what you need to do to get where you want to be ask for help if you need but no one else can just give you a life you have to make one just like every other person yta hes 6 hes not a man and you shouldnt be trying to teach him to be a man at his age honestly you sound terrible you can disagree with a book he reads or any other issue but you have a normal rational conversation with his mother and come to a mutual decision she left over this even if its for a night shes got enough sense to leave when you show how absolutely unreasonable you can be next time she may not come back i mean no offense but is there something about your autism,Mentalcomposer
that makes you not able to live independently and if you dont mind how old are you you need 2 things a job and an apartment do you have a job if yes then stay where you are for now and save as much as you can if no then figure out what you can or want to do and start looking for that work if you cant find what youre looking for right now take any job the idea is to just start having an income after you save enough money then you can begin to look for an apt and a room mate or two then come back here and ask how much you can afford to pay in rent based on your income and well help you figure that out also i think you over reacted to this situation she was with her bf who i assume you trust since he stays at your home sometimes i can track all my adult kids and only 2 still live at home but,Mentalcomposer
i rarely do because they tell me whats going on just like your d did we just always had it since they were teens why would you check that she made it to work what if she just up and decides one day she wants to skip work and go to a park are you gonna go to the park and make sure shes ok leave her alone shes an adult and doesnt need you constantly on top of her tracking is for when they up and disappears and i can tell the police where the last location was but even then the cops can get more info than i can anyway its not just rich people who want more money its pretty much all people there are exceptions of course some people are very content with what they have and arent always looking for more esh im just sitting here baffled that the h is actually complaining to his wife that he has to find a new job because wife told gfs husband,Mentalcomposer
about the affair like how is this even a regular conversation between them what should you do you turn to her and tell her cut the crap stop your crying like a baby because i saw an a on tv if you cannot get your insecurity under control this isnt gonna work go see someone if you need to ive been more than patient over the last 4 years but my patience is wearing thin and im tired of it now were here to have a good time and im not putting up with this you can go back home if youre going to be miserable for the next 4 days over something that literally literally does not affect either one of us and then you stuck to that stop giving in to her this might be the most absolutely ridiculous thing ive ever read on reditt and we all know the ridiculousness that is on this site keep in mind that while you would be ok with not having any contact with your,Mentalcomposer
family she isnt you and when faced with that choice i think a lot of people wouldnt so she cuts off her whole family and then what she has you and only you you cannot possibly no matter how hard you try replace a motherfather and siblings those are unique relationships that for most people cannot be replaced take some time to get over her and try to let go of some of the anger you have thinking that you were so easily discarded this was probably extremely hard for her to do life goes on and this too shall pass im sorry youre dealing with this you tell your parents what you told us here that theyre lovely people you love them and severing them from your life will be hard but if thats what they choose then youll abide by it but add that you refuse to be verbally abused by anyone at any time so they can call off the dogs you can add that you are absolutely positive in the,Mentalcomposer
fact that somewhere in their minds they know they have to know that being gay isnt a choice its the way whatever their deity is that they believe in has made you then you go live an absolutely wonderful life and surround yourself with people who love you being you please do yourself a favor and download a news app even if you dont read any full articles you will at least read the headlines and have a very vague idea of whats going on in the world nta what exactly does she want an apology for your wife is allowed to still be pissed and take some time she offered to drop the kids off what more does dad and wife want has the wife taken responsibility that what she said was done in such a way to make you and your wife look bad and why would she even want that because until she ponies up that admittance and apologizes for it theres no way id want to see her this whole,Mentalcomposer
fight was her doing no way is anyone holding my kids hostage like that grandpa will just have to get used to not seeing the kids then depending on the ages if the kids ask just say that grandpa is being a brat and hes in time out nta but your first mistake was not having your own acct have a joint for bills thats your 7030 a joint for savings decide on an amount and each have their own ideally each of your paychecks should be deposited in your individual accts and each person transfers what they need to by you leaving your extra money in a joint acct you are essentially giving her free reign in that acct since she can access it but you cannot access her own acct how did you even agree to this i would say just use your new thought process of understanding to slowly work through to the next step dont look at the next big picture slowly work through the concepts one at a time,Mentalcomposer
until you have absolute command of that step then move to the next eventually the bigger picture makes sense abstract concepts are hard to understand is there really something to be learned in a sense if theres no definitive way of proving what the end is so maybe the point of your paper is to apply what you think believe to be the end result based on your individual thoughts im not sure this applies to you and what youre studying tho just to be clear hes a male 32 your post says 32f hes pushing way too hard i wouldnt even keep talking to him youre under no real pressure from your parents to get married right now but it seems that he as a 32 yo man who has up until this point hasnt found a match for himself is trying to push you into a marriage before you have even met i suspect being pressured by his parents stick to what you want a marriage where you are in love that,Mentalcomposer
means no more meeting people who do not live within a realistic amount of distance that you can actually date dont shortchange yourself on this picking a spouse is literally the most important decision you can make it is the one decision that can make your like a living hell if you get it wrong or can give you a lifetime of happiness if you choose right move to the other place take the manager spot there hire a nanny i dont know why you think you cant raise your child by yourself millions of women do it every day with a lot less resources than you seem to have youre an adult but you dont seem to want to do a lot of adulting time to step up here leave him to his deal with his child hell probably end up hiring a nanny too he cheated with your sister is this a man you even want to be involved with even if he didnt know it was your sister hes an older,Mentalcomposer
man with a very young wife who still cheated on her what more is this guy looking for whatever it is he has proved it is not a monogamous marriage i usually try to explain how im understanding it and the other person will then point out where my flawed thinking is so id say so x does this and y does this so when x does its thing how does y know how to do their thing this way the other person is seeing where im getting confused and explain just that part of it so i can make the connection so instead of hearing the explanation that still doesnt make sense they explain just the part thats tripping me up and thats why neither of them should be running after the last 2 elections we should not still have to choose between the lesser of two old horrible candidates im kind of hoping there are a slew of people just throwing their hat in for both parties someone new might just rise,Mentalcomposer
to the top yta do you even like your mom she wanted one thing and even paid for it tell work you cant make it you should have told work before you changed shifts that you have plans that day and needed it off ill bet you would have done that if you had plans for an outing with a bf or friend you wouldnt forget about those plans you wouldnt cancel on those people but this is just your mom and you dont even like the event so she doesnt get the same priority i would absolutely rat out sil to the company this woman is making fun of you for not being able to get a job while gloating about hers which really could have been yours if she didnt lie as for your sister being mean to you think about this her wife doesnt help her with any bills even tho they should be partners she was mean to you until you cut her off so where do you think sil,Mentalcomposer
put all that snark id bet on your sister your sister probably is not standing up to her wife so shes taking out her annoyance on you getting mad at you over little things could be because she feels she cant get mad at wife id get sister away from wife for an afternoon and have this very needed chat is she even still happy with her wife what is really going on there with any luck sil will be gone and you can get your sister back this is not your fight dont use a relationship with your kids and their aunt as an excuse your kids have other aunts and uncles they wont be scarred for life if they dont see this one aunt as long as they are told that mom and aunt are fighting and thats why they dont talk no biggie happens to a lot of families your sil is finding it hard that in her mind she did everything right and just how the parents wanted got a,Mentalcomposer
great job and yet her sister gets all the praise and praised for something sil probably doesnt think is such an accomplishment but thats whatever let your sil come around on her own time or not the new baby doesnt care if they meet auntie you cant afford decent groceries but theres money for weed priorities man if you cant afford your bills then every single non essential expense goes away thats weed cable eating out etc if she doesnt like it she can get a job and pay for those things nta why would you clean more than once without being paid its 45 hours that youre over there after 1 or 2 times she could have told him at this point shes using you shes using your labor to fund her vacation gtfoh please stop cleaning for her if shes so bothered by his messiness she can clean his apt id youre at the stage of a proposal you should be at the point where you can flat out ask her if,Mentalcomposer
she wants to give you an idea of what she likes if she wants to give you a few pictures of exactly what she wants and youll choose from that or if she wants you to just pick out the ring on your own the proposal will be a surprise as far as when and how its a phone call he has the time this is important to you you need to see him supporting you in this tell him that since your dad thinks the teacher was out of line he should call her and if your mom thinks shes out of line she should also call let them tell the teacher that your behavior isnt out of line or worrisome and that he doesnt appreciate her telling you it is or separating you from the class and to cut it out or hell be speaking with the admin of the school the very first time a partner hits me is the last time i would ever see them idc if its a,Mentalcomposer
man or woman doing the hitting it will not stop it will get worse get out now why would you want to be with someone who resorts to hitting when youre having an argument i want to know what she says the reason is that she wont get a job does she not realize you two cannot afford to live on your income id also stop buying her any special food wine and nicotine im not saying not to buy vegetarian food just not any specialty stuff that is not your responsibility honestly youve only been married 2 years id cut my losses split up and let her make her own way she is not adding anything to your life at this point i thought the same thing like what interviewer would even ask that question out of the blue why m of all the women out there it makes no sense the absolute only way id believe it is if the discussion somehow went to who would be a good model spokesperson for,Mentalcomposer
the line and since it is dm based in the uk they asked about m to somehow tie the article to the uk through h the prince and then of course flip flop the quotes so it seemed as if the m question was asked first of course tw takes this as a win that a rockefeller even knows who she is she should have answered with who how long are you together and how old are you all if its not very long maybe he just doesnt think its that big of a deal its a lot to meet the whole fam at once so going to the baby birthday is his out im not so sure that because his friend is a girl is as big a deal as youre thinking it is this girl is with the father of her child i doubt shes looking to make moves on your bf your friend has im sure tried to talk to her friend about this guy and it fell on deaf ears,Mentalcomposer
there arent some magical words that are going to make her see the light now so julie can go be witness at this mess of a marriage or she tells friend she wants nothing to do with it but if she needs help getting away shell be there for her and have julie start saving money for that plane ticket what kind of guy doesnt know how to cook a hamburger or a steak grilled chicken is stupid easy how about a salad i refuse to believe he only knows how to cook those three things i wouldnt order out just because of the expense but when its your day to cook make enough extra just for you to have it the next night or take a sunday and make yourself 3 or 4 portioned meals that you can heat up for when he slaves away in the kitchen and makes pancakes again oh no youve misunderstood his concern worrying about security to the spare means hes really worried that hell be swept for,Mentalcomposer
recording devices and or shadowed everywhere he goes to keep him in line he has no fear for his personal safety he knows no one cares enough to do him harm so what at least hell have something to eat at home and she shouldnt be as stressed if shes working so she wont stress eat ill repeat what others have said do not buy a house with someone who is not your spouse your gf wants to buy a house get engaged and have a wedding all within the next few years oh and go on 1 or 2 big trips and youre supposed to fund the majority of those endeavors must be nice to be her you need to decide what you want what is your priority is it a house then you buy it on your own if its getting engaged and marrying then you buy a ring and ask if its travel then you plan that but you have to tell your gf that her pressuring you is only going,Mentalcomposer
to make you rethink being with her this isnt the way partners go about things see how she responds but if she is reluctant then you know shes looking at what she can get out of it not so much looking toward a life together there will be other perfect houses skip this one well they shouldnt have been wasting time trying to clear up a stream of errors as it relates to m its a ridiculous notion that above all else they felt the need to devote their time to that just let it go not every freakin little blip needs to or needed to be contradicted that was the problem they wanted so badly to make it look as if m was this perfect person that wasnt real then and it isnt real now i like the idea that both of you on your journeys together great thought he wont feel so alone then youve got this one step at a time and you and him will get there ok so nta,Mentalcomposer
for not wanting to take total responsibility for your brother your parents tho total ahs they cannot just decide they are done being parents that aside you dont say what mental capacity your bro has so you need to explain to your bro that you are not equipped to handle being his caretaker and he needs to find whatever is going to make his life the best he can make it but its going to mean he has to work at it no one else can do it for him he is an adult now and a if a group home is the best place for him thats where he should be the idea is to get him as self sufficient as possible mom must have some contacts that she has used in the past contact them get bro evaluated to see exactly what his strengths and weaknesses are autism is a huge range but he at the very least will need mh therapy after that he may need some basic vocation training so,Mentalcomposer
he can get a basic job best of luck its not easy youll be overwhelmed at first but once all the pieces are in place you and your bro will be better off im so glad im not the only one who found the idea of him peeing too loud to be bizarre couldnt really care about any of the rest of it i was just stuck on that no not just anyone can go vote you have to register to vote then you get or at least i did but it was lots of years ago a voter registration card in the mail depending on where you live you are assigned a specific place where you vote you can only vote at that place because you will be on their voter roll the list of ppl registered to vote at that spot so when you go to vote you give them your name they look you up in a book you sign the book and they are supposed to make sure your signature,Mentalcomposer
matches what you signed when you first registered and then you can vote info i need to know how old your brother is so sit by your dad even if hes not conscious idk his state and just talk say whatever comes to mind ramble he will hear you and youll have no regrets you will have told him everything you havent been able to say in the past hugs to you from your comment i think it matters what he did during this fight that made you feel you had to leave if you felt threatened its completely diff than if you were just done fighting he wouldnt stop and wanted to just get some space in any case hes just embarrassed and even if some of your friends have reached out he thinks others will hold this incident against him so you tell him he either comes on thursday or he doesnt but he cant be sad if you go seems he wants you to avoid these friends so he doesnt look,Mentalcomposer
like the bad guy also i feel pretty strongly that you need at least one friend you can vent your problems to thats what theyre for its ridiculous that you would never talk about him or your relationship with your friends we all do it and dont hold it over the partner its a way to get an objective opinion on whats going on very sorry for what youre going through i think the answer is very different for everyone it will depend on what you already know so for instance was your dad military and never talked about it do you want to know that did dad have a first wife and youre curious why is he fighting with or do you just want to hear that you turned out alright in your parents eyes are you doing ok do they like your partner or kids maybe you want to make amends over an issue figure out what it is that you need or want to know and have those conversations maybe your,Mentalcomposer
dad should tell your sister that not that i think it would do any good she knew it was wrong and thats why she never said anything to anyone even if she was having a reveal youd think shed have spoken to your mom about names even just in passing conversation look you need to have a talk with pam explain to her that you actually love this guy and even tho you married im not even sure why for a lark a joke just for the trope of a vegas marriage that over the last year you guys realized you had more and are happy but let her know you arent going to divorce just because shes not happy you two are together ask why she is so upset is it because its her friend or did she want him or what because she seems to be upset for no actual reason something else is going on with her during peri i had bleeding that lasted weeks also that was pretty much my,Mentalcomposer
only symptom but it lasted years on and off my doc prescribed micronized i think thats it progesterone it stopped it then normal periods for a while and when it didnt stop i was able to just call her and shed call in another rx maybe ask if that might work for you i think youre in the wrong subreddit but i found this and its from jan of this year so its up to date i am not familiar with the diff between a lpr and a green card but you may be also found this i dont want c to pony up one red cent this is harrys burden to bear she can have half of whatever he has and he can pay his own damn lawyers and he can fight for custody on his own if he gets full or half or visitation or none oh well he had those kids with her c doesnt have to worry about those kids being in the los it is practically guaranteed they are,Mentalcomposer
never going to be anywhere near taking the throne and if she wants to go and spill all his dirty little secrets so be it he deserves everything he gets is this her first year in school maybe she is really stressed just getting used to it how long are you together maybe shes just over this relationship but the insults yeah id let her know she can think youre joke isnt funny but she cant insult you but by your own admission youre clingy she may have been ok with it in the past but as you both matured she might feel its too much youre both adults you should be ok without constant contact all day long talk to her tell her you feel shes pulling away or not being as receptive and would appreciate it if she just owned up to what shes thinking and feeling rather than you having to guess nta what is wrong with your bf even if this person likes you they did nothing odd or creepy,Mentalcomposer
to you so why does he care i would tell the person what bf did and that it wasnt you tho just to clear up the situation so this person doesnt go on thinking you like them go ahead and end this these games will never stop and your bf will never take accountability for anything he does mainly because my whole family is here parents are getting older my kids are here and i would never leave them i dont want to be hours and a flight away if there is an emergency plus my life here is good slight yta why is the bf not going to be in school if they would both be home all day then no i wouldnt let her i would have told her she can stay home on friday and have a nice 3 day weekend please be aware that just as adults need a mental health day so do kids my kids were always allowed to stay home just because because sometimes they just need,Mentalcomposer
a break especially by hs it can be mentally draining seriously its a month 30 measly days you are not in love you are not sexually satisfied and you dont want to wait so do what any one would break up and find someone whos not a virgin and date them amazing that at 30 yo you need to be told this it doesnt matter if one of you is home for him now this marriage may not last thats the problem how old are you guys she seems immature your wife needs to figure out what it is she wants either her marriage or affirmation from others because she cannot have both put a hold on the foster and have a heart to heart with your wife shes still talking to this guy which means shes getting something from him that she isnt fri you and thats not necessarily your fault no one can be absolutely everything for another person the last few cruises i went on they lined up the boarding group,Mentalcomposer
we had to put our bags on the floor and the sniffer dogs came by so be careful idk what vacuum sealing does but just saying and why does that not immediately scream that this guy is just looking for a wife anyone will do you are just way too naive to realize it hasnt he been in trouble previously how does he keep getting elected or how has no watchdog group been keeping a close eye on him i agree i hate the way it looks even tho i currently have this look haha i dont have very big roots showing but theyre there and i see it a lot more than anyone in my family notices brown to blonde isnt hard to upkeep but it has to be done very often and im due but i just got home from vacay so i scheduled it but its gonna be a few days also depending on what process i have the brown can be made to almost blend into the blonde so its,Mentalcomposer
not all flat blonde but highlighted blonde with still some brown so it isnt as obvious youre only 25 theres no shame in living at home if not now then when in your life would you ever be able to save as much as you can youre lucky that your salary affords you a chance to get yourself financially ahead why spend money unnecessarily your gf cares more about what your money can do for her she has said you two should have a lavish lifestyle and travel but the thing is she cant afford to do that only you can afford to finance her lavish lifestyle id break up with her honestly but you need to think about if you want a partner who has goals closer to your own and she doesnt she thinks youre boring unless you can lavish luxuries on her and its only going to get worse as you make more money shell want bigger and better by your own chart it takes 95000 just to start up a,Mentalcomposer
daycare less if the contingency and working capital is lower so lets say you magically find a benefactor for that money im not sure i understand how youre going to lower the cost even if its not for profit it needs to self sustain at some point being transparent in how the money is spent is all well and good but it doesnt make up for the fact that running a business takes money you could run the tightest budget but there is an absolute bottom line needed to run teacher costs need to be in line with teacher salaries especially that pre school is in a sense a specialty i proposed the admin being paid at the same rate of a teacher so no excess bloat there and at a modest 45000 year for each of those positions were at 9000year per child ok so we take a loss for a year or two weve only got about 40000 contingency and capital how long will that last we add in older kids for,Mentalcomposer
a smaller ratio and increased income thats another teacher but we have to get them to the center after school do we need a van or a bus maybe we add night or weekend baby sitting service for a small fee we still have to pay an adult for that we can ask for volunteers older folks who are retired or moms that have their kids enrolled they dont add to the payroll but they need to be bonded maybe you dont have your own building maybe utilize empty classrooms in a school or community center of the town im sorry i feel like im missing something but am very intrigued to see a way for your idea to work so i think your idea sounds great in theory but a quick search brought me to the staff child ratio for kids 2 124 is 1t for every 10 ks so lets assume a teacher salary of 45000year conservatively that divides to 4500year per child just to pay for a teacher add to that,Mentalcomposer
at least one administratorrent insurance supplies and idk what else lets say we pay the admin the same as the teacher so were looking at 9000 per child before factoring in any other expenses the average cost of daycare in nj is between 1012000 a year so based on these numbers i cant see how you can run a childcare center for less than most parents are paying now and even if you dont take a salary to start at some point youre going to want or need to draw a salary now i dont know if the state has any programs that help with daycare costs if so then maybe its doable you might be better off getting a home based daycare license and having less children while also incorporating a learning atmosphere maybe your friend is the boring one and he needs drunk you to make his party a success or youre just really fun at parties drunk or not and he just thinks youre drunk because you are such fun and,Mentalcomposer
hes too drunk to tell the difference i would be slightly insulted by someone saying that so go to the party have a few but dont get drunk and be your fun self nah you havent actually explained why you dont want your h to take this job has it occurred to you that he has been out of sorts for 3 years and maybe your h feels like he needs to work a lot of people get their self worth from working and contributing to the family plus you mention insurance which if you dont have is kind of important how is his health now can he even handle this job why exactly do you not want him working is it his health or do you need him home with the child so you can grow your business or do you just not want him gone for 2 weeks at a time because then you have to do it all does your business cover all of your bills or are you dipping into,Mentalcomposer
savings every month its always better to have more savings than less you need to find out why he wants this job at this time if he has legitimate reasons then maybe you should try to support him in this if you need to you can put your child in daycare while you work on your business will it be hard while hes gone absolutely but supporting our partners is part of the deal he supported i dont mean just monetarily you when you wanted to start your business ok i have to ask what exactly is he doing for work hes in an awful rush for someone who is a spender why is he in such a rush its been 6 years he can wait another 2 youre both still so young you say you have money saved for a house down payment i cant help but wonder if he sees you as his cash cow has he saved any money since he dropped out of school sit down and reiterate to him,Mentalcomposer
that you have always said you will not be married until you have completed your schooling and have a stable job let him know this is what you want and him constantly bothering you when you are still in school is useless because even if you wanted to marry right now you wouldnt im sure hes a great guy but think long and hard if you who from all youve said sets a goal and works towards them and achieves them while he seems more like flitting from one to another thing based on his whims you need to see how comparable you two are when youre both out in the real world rent bills chores etc you may find you want a guy who is more on your wavelength nta who believes that youre a fool if you learn from your own mistakes isnt that the point make mistake learn from it dont do it again does she keep making the same mistake over and over again in this case her saying she,Mentalcomposer
knows shes right and youll continue it at another time just means she will harp on this until you agree with her and she can then gloat about it yta how has this conversation not come up in 3 years stop brow beating the poor kid his mother has told you how she feels maybe you should try listening to her it is quite possible that you arent as all knowing as you think you are i will say tho one way to get kids in the habit of please and thank you is to just always say it yourself they hear it and model it it almost becomes rote to say it kind of like amen at church thats my experience anyway its 3 months youre not officially bfgf and hes asking telling strongly encouraging you to get rid of something youve had from your childhood nope not happening adults are allowed to have comfort things him saying hes there to comfort you is weird to me like only he can do that,Mentalcomposer
for you you keep that bear forever and take him out when you need to you got this now hope hes a good kisser okay i can better see why you wouldnt want her there but she really wont be able to outshine you at your own wedding as long as she doesnt get the dance which is easily done what else could she do you let the photographer know to put her in her place you get the band to ignore her requests and you warn her shell be tossed if she gets out of hand if you might want things to get better then ask sis if shes be willing to go to therapy with you maybe an outside person explaining to her why her attitude is harmful to you may just make her take a back seat at your wedding or just dont invite her but that plays into her idea that you know shes better than you and thats why you dont want her there good luck dont stress too,Mentalcomposer
much you have a year to figure it out how about at the end of the night when he drops you off at home you can just flirtingly say something like what no good night kiss it will only be a teeny tiny moment of fear but i guarantee you he will kiss you good night ywnbta im struggling to understand what is wrong between you and your sister i understand sm being nicer to sis but thats not her doing anything wrong she was a child at the time too so i can understand you not having anything to do with dad and sm but you got along well enough with sis to be a bridesmaid for her just so i understand tho you dont want her there because you think shes going to somehow have a fd dance with step dad at your wedding easily fixed you tell the band they cannot under any circumstances take song requests and you also let sd know what shes thinking and ask him to not,Mentalcomposer
dance with sis at all if he understands the whole dynamic and realizes the place he has in your life he should be willing to do that thats what i was talking about put that on your tik tok your insta anywhere you use social media and ill add the florida law has a rape exception also but it has to reported you may be toxic but that comment was not how about compiling a list of birth control resources put it on tik tok instagram twitter places younger women might frequent and fb for the older women take a diff approach and try to prevent an unwanted pregnancy instead of having to deal with it after the fact and have a connection resources that connects women willing to fund bc for women who cant afford it well the easy hard answer is to find a job in london and move there you have a roommate now so get one there or find a job in london and live in a suburb close enough,Mentalcomposer
to enjoy the city but less expensive what kind of engineer are you this is what i always thought also just let me get up and walk off then the rest can deal with getting their bags and while were revamping debark can we just board the plane by rows starting at the back please ill even let first or business board before me theyre not the problem find a boy scout troop in your area they would be happy to have it they do lots of camping and might have kids that dont own gear elementary schools have cub scout troops but boy scout troops usually arent run through a school but if you can get in touch with a cub troop they can put you in touch with a boy scout troop that they usually feed into tomatoes i could not stand the texture of the seeds even now i wont eat the seeds in the big tomatoes i cut them out but can handle the small cherry tomatoes i love the,Mentalcomposer
way he says itll never happen with you two because you arent going to have kids as if thats where he draws a line pretty convenient for a guy who doesnt want kids but what happens if he for whatever reason decides hes not sexually attractive to you or what if you get sick and cant have sex for a while is it ok then for him to cheat because you know he just cant go without i feel like you are going to be doing anything you can to keep him from cheating probably to your own detriment and it wont make a diff anyway im thinking hes already cheating when youre not there he cant possibly be expected to go without his sex needs being met for a whole month gasp if i was you id slow this relationship way down if he wants to move to canada ok but hed be getting his own place but im not you so id get rid of this guy i want my partner to,Mentalcomposer
go into a relationship with the absolute idea that he has found the person he wants to be with and not having pre conceived ideas of circumstances of when hed cheat 11 hours non stop to hawaii in economy this was the smallest seat ive ever been in i dropped my ear bud right in front of my seat and had to contort my body to reach for it im not a large person either made it 7 hours ok but the last 4 were really really tough and then had to do it again to get home the whole family agrees that well never do that again im not in texas but im not so sure there are specific parking lot laws drive slowly thru the lot i think my shopping center has a 10 mph speed sign yes please stop for pedestrians crossing in front of your car the lane directly in front of the stores near me have stop signs usually close to each of the stores entrances exits you dont,Mentalcomposer
have to stop as soon as you see a person but it really depends on how far away they are from you if theyre like 2 stores away you slow down and or stop until they cross id wait until the person was pretty close to the other side of the road before scooching past especially if theyre older or have children with them just so they feel safer better to be safer and drive slow or stop if youre not sure nta i would not apologize for any of it substance or tone your tone needed to be what it was to get the message across that he is no longer welcome to stay too bad if it upset him you basically said what your mother has been unable to do on her own he needs to get out your mom said she needs a break from him so now she has it wouldnt the line be drawn by what are natural genetic advantages to a person if one is just as is,Mentalcomposer
said naturally gifted in a sport should they be not allowed to participate because its not fair to the other participants their genetic make up is basically what is making them what we would call naturally gifted but with trans women athletes they have an unnatural advantage over women due to their genetic make up as being born as men hormones may counteract some of this but it is never going to completely reverse the effects of the genetic processes of male puberty on things like strength and muscle mass are we talking during a marriage or a dating situation why would you think that just because one person cheated you will never find another who wont cheat,Mentalcomposer
