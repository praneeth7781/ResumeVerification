yeah op said there was nowhere else to park in the post and it was 2 am and they were tired plus honestly i personally wouldnt go the confrontation route too many crazy people in the world
she literally works until 6 pm in the post most people get off work at 5 its an hour different most people arent unfit or unable to be there for their kids so the hour isnt going to change that 
she is absolutely abusive to her husband but none of that is directed at her kids you want to make it the same thing as being abusive to her kids and i get it really i do but it just isnt in the eyes of the law shes completely fit to be a mom this isnt about me saying she isnt abusive this is about me pointing out she is abusive to her husband not her kids there is no way she will be deemed unfit by a court so his choices are either stay in an abusive situation or leave to his home country if she wont willingly give up her kids then there may be a tough choice to be made i cant tell you how many tragic stories ive heard of women in the same positions who needed to escape abuse and their partners used the kids as a pawn if you dont understand this sad reality idk what to tell you
absolutely be kind to yourself you can and should allow yourself to feel how you feel the panic attacks crying not eating thats real heartbreak even the constantly checking his location it isnt healthy but it is totally normal you can allow yourself to give into it for a bit but make sure to give yourself a hard deadline for fully indulging your sadness because you dont want to lose yourself in this you will survive this you will find someone else and they will make you forget the pain youre feeling now thats life and just remember youll make it through this whatever happens
working until 6 pm and having a shitty marriage is not child abuse not by any legal definition which is all that will matter im sorry but youre just factually wrong about how a custody battle would look you can say what you think should happen until youre blue in the face but it just isnt how it works no judge will say this is abuse because it isnt working until 6 pm isnt not having time for your kids its called having a job its delusional to imply thats abusive its a fucking extra hour on the normal work schedule plenty of people work until 5 and have a 115 hour commute i just cannot fathom how you can intelligently argue working until 6 pm means you dont have time for your kids 

his support system is in another country he may not be able to afford to live in this country alone with his kids that means yes the options are either stay in an abusive situation or leave because unless his wife willing allows him to take the kids he cannot take the kids you want the world to work a certain way and i get that but it doesnt
lmao yeah the sub that notoriously has a huge gender bias against men having a huge gender bias against men is shocking
your partner telling you no planning a bunch of activities to prevent you from being able to and then using your kids as a pawn to prevent you from having any free time to go see your friend because shes not comfortable going on the activities alone isnt controlling to you wtf of course that is the wife always plans the trips again imagine its because she forces herself in that role and doesnt allow op to plan things which is a pretty fair assumption with her blatantly telling him no when he asks to plan something here op asks to make time for his friend she flat out just says no and then makes it virtually impossible for him to actually go and do it on his own otherwise hell be the reason why his kids cant go do xyz for fun 

you cannot genuinely tell me if a man did that to his wife you wouldnt be waving the red flag and honestly if you cant see how easily this is just a controlling partner then this conversation is pointless anyway because its pretty apparent to anyone who looks at behavior more than gender have a good day now
 really you think thats less evidence of her being controlling that is the evidence for her being controlling just because hes a man and shes a woman lets not act like that changes anything
they very obviously only invited op because they know shes really good at planning and researching for these sort of trips it was about what she provides not her presence
its a road trip they clearly arent driving to get to a destination theyre driving to enjoy and experience the journey so its not the same as lets get a bit of sustenance its lets see what x city has to offer thats not a reason why they couldnt plan things though
its a 20 hour road trip at that point it seems rather obvious that part of the vacation is the driving and in that case yes i think its fair to want something more than mcdonalds you dont go to hawaii and do nothing but eat fast food ya know with gas car rentals hotels and food its definitely cheaper to fly if its a 20 hour trip so for sure this is supposed to be part of the experience for them 


and experience which they absolutely only invited op on to plan things for them and they need to be adults and ya know plan things themselves
its good you recognized this is most likely heading towards a breakup i think its best to prepare yourself for it being a breakup and all of your emotions are natural you can give yourself a few weeks to grieve a 5 year relationship and make sure that next week you are firm in we are either together and you are in therapy working towards sorting yourself out or we are done and nc because anything else is going to destroy you and you need to look out for your mental health 

he might be happier right now hes got friends around booze and feels a lot less pressure to be happy or act a certain way it sucks it isnt your fault you need to trust that this is part of his journey and isnt a reflection of you necessarily im sorry youre going through this be careful to let yourself feel the hurt while also cutting yourself off once its officially done from hurtful info his location his sm anything else that gives insight into his life moving forward it will only hurt
that is definitely not true i have known a number of people who meet a partner or fling or whatever you want to call it online playing video games never leaving their house
is she taking on the mental load or is she just a type a  personality and controlling because remember controlling people do exist and they can be women and it definitely sounds way more im doing things my way and you dont get a say rather than the typical nothing ever happens if i dont do everything and he never gives any input you see here
typically holier than thou redditor ego seeing as any rational human being knows having your car towed from a private property like that is going to be at least a few hundred bucks which unless youre quite wealthy is going to hurt at best and seriously endanger your financial wellbeing at worst dont park illegally but we also have no idea if this person got lost or what and the idea that we should treat any mistake as if its the end of the world acts as though people dont routinely make mistakes and they do some kindness and grace should be afforded for what is a normal human experience because even though you think well i would never do xyz that probably isnt as true as you think
you should sit him down outside of these moments and ask to talk about something with him honestly then say ive noticed a pattern lately well be talking and out of nowhere it seems like youll say im not funny and should stop trying to be funny but the reality is im not trying to be funny i have never tried to be funny this is just my personality and how i talk so it feels like youre not only criticizing my humor but also who i am its made me think and ive realized youve never even laughed at anything ive said and while i meant it when i said i never try to make you or anyone else laugh its made me think you dont enjoy me or my company much and thats becoming an issue for me we need to address so im hoping we can have an open discussion about whats been going on
eh its also been 3 months i dont really think you can conclusively say anything about what this other woman does or doesnt know
well have the conversation again and next time she replies with that just say okay then its clear the relationship isnt working out lets part ways shes either bluffing in which case you need to call it out or she isnt bluffing and its only a matter of time before she breaks up with you so might as well beat her to it and leave with your dignity
you literally just tell her plainly if this is how you feel we need to break up if you still want to stay together you need to stop the comments which one and make her pick and hold her to whatever she picks if she refuses to pick tell her youve picked for her and its over 

stop being so passive and firmly shut the behavior down and if she doesnt back down you end it pretty easy way to show someone what you will and wont tolerate
i think you just need to communicate with her are you really this unsure about our relationship because if you are i think we should end things now it isnt fair to either of us to stay in a relationship where youre having this much doubts and if you arent that unsure you need to really be mindful of your language because its starting to feel like you dont want to be with me and at this point its honestly making it difficult for me to want to continue seeing you 

and then see where the conversation goes but really if she doesnt say hey youre right this was super uncool behavior im sorry and ill work on it you probably should just end things sooner rather than later as its pretty obvious this isnt a relationship made to stand the test of time so if marriage is a goal of yours why even bother here anymore move on to someone who will be sure of you
lmao props to you for not even blinking at the ultimate manipulation your family tried to play and just shutting it down so hard even the cops breaking up a house party would be impressed
he was also very likely getting ready to end it if op hadnt im unhappy in our relationship means if you dont change im out
youre aware your opinion doesnt change how courts sometimes handle these situations right no it isnt okay but generally unless the kids are in physical danger courts try to keep both parents in their life the husband wouldnt be able to get her deemed unfit and take them out of the country this isnt a comment on how things should be but a reminder that unfortunately no she is not unfit to be a mother and unfortunately if the husbands support system is in another country he wont really be able to take his kids with him unless the wife will allow it and she doesnt seem the type to do so freely
you did though what do you think saying someone is unfit to be a mother means
also 300 m2 isnt really big enough for two separate families i dont know if you are currently or ever plan to have a family or even just a partnerpet but while 300 m2 is good for you and your needs it isnt really a two family house as a permanent set up which this obviously would be
that is definitely not how it works plenty of parents work until 6 pm 5 days a week and arent forbidden from seeing their kids thats insane to suggest

and even her abuse means nothing if it isnt provably directed towards her children family custody battles unfortunately are notorious for failing to take into consideration abuse of a partner when deciding custody if she gets even partial custody he cant just move them out of the country
might not be an option abusive partners often dont just let you walk away with their children and i dont think he would legally be able to just take them without a custody arrangement to another country unfortunately leaving an abusive relationship isnt always easy and there isnt always an easy solution when someone wants to make your life miserable and willing to use your children as pawns just to hurtcontrol you
sure but theres also plenty of free porn too that doesnt stop people from paying the thousands of gothwhatever other category of girl on of out there
does abuse actually change things though its an unfortunate situation but i dont think it changes the issue of op wants time alone with his family and doesnt want to be paying for things for harper like a father figure would thats an acceptable boundary to have yes even if abuse is at play after all if jennifer is aware enough to tell amber there is abuse at play shes aware enough to also know that she shouldnt be staying and exposing her kid to that environment
you do you but its unreasonable to suggest you wont even leave your house until your long term boyfriend is where he said he would meet you
trying without any belief it will change isnt trying its going through the motions
therapy is a joke because youve decided its a joke of course if you go into something convinced it will never help it wont help  thats like thinking everyone will break up with you you make yourself so miserable to be around it becomes a selffulfilling prophecy
he cheated on you and feels guilty
op said she was living with this guy talking about fantasies of marriage and shes also extremely close to this cousin the cousin knew op had a pregnancy scare with her summer fling she just didnt have a name or a face apparently which feels so weird to me possible absolutely just so weird
ok pause youre saying youre still not over the ex you had at 22 its time for therapy no you arent unlovable but you are stagnating yourself its okay not to be over him but you need help its time to love yourself enough to get it
i think you need to be honest with her and be very very blunt hey friend sorry to message but i didnt want to wait until closer to the wedding i love you and want to support you as much as i can on your special day but i have a very hard budget for how much i can spend in total on the wedding its x ive already contributed y i wanted to be really clear that from now on i cant contribute anything else and i am not comfortable asking people who dont know you to come to any paid events if you no longer want me to be a bridesmaid i will step down and be a regular guest because i dont want to be a source of stress for you but ive felt a lot of pressure to spend more than i am able to and while i understand its unintentional i want to be really transparent with you

and then go from there
you would be incredibly selfish to message him knowing he is in a relationship let him move on if they break up and youre still single and feel this way reach out but know your place do not invite that sort of bad karma into the world
id do it over facetime in your backyard garage or even walking to a park
just tell him then i want a kid and that hasnt changed if youve changed youre mind thats youre right but were no longer compatible i hope we can split quickly and amicably as i wish you no ill will but am firm on what i want in life
for either side shes allowed to be willing to die on this hill but honestly if she knew her sibling was at risk and knew she was offering a safe haven that should have been a conversation she had with her boyfriend long before it came to fruition then they couldve had the discussion and had a plan and he wouldnt have felt like an outsider in his own home
to be honest i would figure out if you can move on from this if you cant and no one would blame you simply tell her you found her notes and want a divorce but decide beforehand i would either accept it and leave it be or tell her youre looking for a divorce but i wouldnt tell her what you found and expect your marriage to survive
i mean hey if youve decided how you want to handle it go ahead i hope it goes as well as it can
well she very realistically may be sacrificing her relationship she seems okay with it but she shouldve been more upfront about her priorities
look fam if youre willing to be dumped over this go ahead but fully understand that youre in the wrong here not him you always communicate beforehand even if the answer is i am helping my sibling and if you are unwilling to support me in this its a dealbreaker but you need to have that conversation first hed be a fool to propose to a woman who cant even respect him enough to give him a phone call before agreeing your sibling can wait another 20 minutes
yeah but even before all that how did op know her cousin was in the same school and major yet never mention his name to the cousin or so much as a picture i know my closest friends partners names and faces well enough that i would definitely recognize them if they showed up in my physics class
dont even wait 3 days tell her she needs to get a job and start contributing let her start the divorce herself
if you want to protect yourself you get in front of it dont just wait for him to decide hes built a strong enough case instead strike first
info have you contacted the school and asked for an exception because most schools will give out more than the two tickets if you ask
i mean the reality is what other choice does she have live in her car she has no family or friends around is attending a school with poor resources and doesnt make enough to easily afford a new place sometimes you have to act ignorant for self preservation not everyone has the luxury to immediately and shamelessly leave shitty situations
idk man the facts here i see no way for op to go hey you need to pay for a new place for me and the grandma to go oh okay here you go i mean like i guess maybe she could but i very much doubt it especially because ops boyfriend would likely step in and even if he didnt i dont really see a world where a landlord is legally required to provide alternative accommodation and legally unable to simply terminate the lease hence it being a situation that would likely require a legal battle if theres even any chance of success which im dubious of i dont really care to get into a back and forth on hypothetical legal situations though suffice to say ops housing situation sounds on borrowed time so shes better off focusing on that right now and only then looking into anything else if shes so inclined because im sure if she tried anything legal with her boyfriends elderly grandmother unless she has backup accommodations right then and there he isnt going to continue living with her as she tries to sue his grandma or even send a strongly worded legal letter
definitely op needs to learn renters rights and how to protect herself but at this point in time she probably has much more pressing matters than any potential recourse rethe old apartment sometimes unfortunately you learn lessons the hard way long expensive and complicated legal battles arent always the answer
theres a good chance it wouldnt go anywhere landlords are under no obligation to inform you about renters insurance thats your own responsibility to limit your own liability some places landlords can require it but ive never heard of anywhere saying a landlord needs to usually the way the law is written a landlord either needs to repair the damage or if the place is uninhabitable they can terminate the lease which it sounds like is what she likely did i obviously dont know the law everywhere but dont feel bad about not wanting to pursue anything legally as i cant imagine a judge seeing i didnt know i needed insurance why didnt anyone tell me as a very good excuse
im sure it depends but if the place is uninhabitable the landlord is allowed usually to just end the lease which is what it sounds like she did typically landlords are only under obligation for their home to be habitable and in the case where it isnt end the lease not to provide adequate housing elsewhere if their accommodations are uninhabitable renters insurance is what provides accommodation if yours is unavailable and its definitely not the responsibility of the landlord to tell you about renters insurance thats on you to do research and decide some places require it but thats mostly for their own protections op can definitely try to double check but given her situation her time money and effort would probably be better spent finding a place to live that meets her needs and she can afford on her own as i suspect this friend wont let op stay much longer much less past when the bf inevitably lets the beans spill
you probably dont want to hear it but unless you have a backup plan no i would not say anything to him right now things are only somewhat fine because hes under the impression youre none the wiser as soon as you let him know there is no reason to pretend theres a goooood chance things get very ugly and at this point it seems like the people youre living with are only letting you stay because of your boyfriend you gotta look out for yourself number 1 so take this information and plan find an apartment on your own and get a move in date of asap only then should you bring it up as most likely once you do hell be honest with you and good chance you get kicked out of where youre staying
probably would send them a were so happy you want to celebrate officially becoming a family but we are holding off on the big celebration with a dress and photos until baby is old enough to be a part this is important to us and hope you will respect our feelings as they wont change that being said wed love to have you and fiances parents said this was as your husband should be sending the message not you over for dinner to celebrate all of the good fortune in our lives lately
did you buy or sell i dont know if the person who boughtsold it did so maybe the real estate agent honestly i have no idea how it works and id say it usually is pretty accurate but it definitely can be inaccurate and i suspect it has to do with someone incorrectly reporting it fringe case for sure but zillow definitely isnt getting the info from the government for every sale thats for sure

but yes i saw the price and was a bit annoyed i wish i didnt have to spend that extra 100k but i definitely did
500k in lottery winnings comes with a minimum 125k in federal taxes and a potential additional 44k in state taxes that means he only got a maximum of 330375k thats still a lot of money but it isnt buy my family a house money or retire early money and thats assuming he was in a position to save all of it but most likely he had some debts or large purchases he was able to make with that money like student loans credit card debt maybe he paid off a mortgage or bought a new car 

it sucks but money doesnt go anywhere near as far as people think it does especially when you factor in taxes so just remember even with that huge leg up you probably canshould still have sympathy for him for all that stuff
yep and for mine it shows a completely and wildly inaccurate price thats more than 100k less than i paid and a price that was never even remotely possible so while yes its a good starting point it isnt always 100 accurate
just a heads up those arent accurate and must be selfreported by someone the house i bought was listed as being sold for well over 100k less than i paid and since i know how much i paid i know that zillow was very much not correct
well theyre only 22 now so i would probably say theres not a huge difference between discussing it when theyre 1819 the ages they actually were as they met at 15 and were together for 3 years and at 22 its really only 3 years different and yes you change in that time but idk if youre really ready for marriage at that point where you werent before ya know but also i just find it so hard to understand how op can be madly in love with him and living with him but her cousin who shes really close to and is in the same major and school as had no idea nor did kenny how did you not say anything all my friends knew about my partner within a few dates certainly 3 years and marriage talks would never happen without showing a picture or giving a name especially if i knew someone knew my partner from outside of me and then how can you have that sort of heartbreak its rather obvious kenny ended things and not say anything to your cousin about it like hey dont date him im not over him idk man sounds really weird
again doctors are more than just mds and even so yes the starting average salary is 211k for medical doctors thats after residency but you can complete your residency in your midlate 20s especially if you do medical school in another country or take advantage of a number of accelerated programs that pretty much every med school offers 

remember just because you havent had this experience doesnt mean it hasnt and cant happen to someone else my niece has just graduated as a doctor yes being vague to illustrate my point and makes 185k at 24 with a signing bonus of over 10k and my sibling who graduated a few years ago was able to purchase a 4 bedroom home in a really nice area at 23 this one not a doctor but in a well paying field i wouldnt call it a mansion but its an impressive achievement at 23 

it happens it might not be common but personal experiences on reddit arent supposed to be the average experience theyre supposed to be what happens to you so try to open your perspective on what you see as possible more and dont discount something as an obvious trollfake just because you personally havent seen something happen but in the end totally up to you what to think of what you read on the internet
its grossly selfish to stay in a relationship with the intention of thinking you can change her mind so assume she is 100 serious on never wanting kids if you know wanting kids is a must have in your life to the best of your abilities you two are fundamentally incompatible and the only honorable thing to do is leave her to find someone who doesnt want kids either 

if you think the right person is worth not having kids for i would be very honest with her so she is allowed the choice as well i have always wanted kids but i also feel a very strong connection with you i am not asking you to change your mind but more i am open to seeing if our relationship develops into something more where i accept not being a father but i also want to give you the choice on if youre on board because i cant guarantee how i will feel in the future and dont want to put you in an unfair position if we ultimately do disagree

now chances are she probably will also say hey lets call it here and save us the potential heartbreak but at least youre being open and respecting this woman enough to communicate openly with her so many guys hear a woman say i do not want children and think it means i dont want kids right now or think to themselves well its too early to think about kids anyway so lets reevaluate in a few monthsyears but no do not do that this is why people bring it up early because they dont want to be in love with someone and have to break up they know if theres a fundamental incompatibility its just not worth pursuing the relationship further because you can be on the same page in everything and a relationship still fail why pursue one where its break is inevitable
 uhm yes lol it is the pandemic completely changed the game for salaries in fields with burnout and high demand

dentists average starting is 123k with source 

doctors sources vary pretty widely depending on specialty but average entry level doctor salary is 211k with source 

vets 107k average starting salary with source 

and this is average starting meaning a lot of people make substantially more than this right out of the gate i know a number of people who were graduating this year and had 150k offers with starting bonuses just because they were well educated and theres such a high demand right now and not enough supply i dont really know why its so surprising to see why a specialized field in medicine would start out low six figures even nurses right now are making 100k starting in certain areas location matters your education matters the experience you gained in school matters heck even your connections matter but its definitely not a crazy idea to me at all that someone out there could be a doctor and have a nice ass house before theyre 30
girl come now dont be so dense hes 8 years older than you and already trying to isolate you he wants you to move in with him and is displaying an issue with your job he wants you to be financially reliant on him to survive and if you are then you cant go back to school to finish your degree hes doing his best to make you his good little housewife and youre playing right into it
youre going through something serious and something scary you are looking for support and youre not getting it you and your boyfriend are both so young that its no surprise he isnt equipped to handle this well but neither of you are handling the stress too well 

you shouldnt need to make up anything as you did nothing wrong ultimately even though it hurts you need to accept that he is entitled to feel how he feels and if hes unable to be understanding and supportive of his sick and scared girlfriend he isnt the right one for you
i mean no lol they are definitely also doctors and its also the internet its not super uncommon for people to be intentionally vague about personal details but anyway like i said its definitely an unusual path but totally possible to be a doctor in your mid 20s and have a really nice house
i was the one who added the med school the other person just said a doctor you can become a doctor a number of ways without going to med school

so i reiterate you can definitely be a doctor in your mid 20s and have a really nice house maybe uncommon definitely doable though
its not even an okay marriage and youre thinking of staying man you do you but youre only 30 if just okay is your standard you can find just okay with someone who isnt going to cheat on you
not residency thats totally true but could be a vet or a dentist which makes 6 figures right out of school and are still doctors
no hes over it at this point and moved on to someone else most likely trying to fix things is going to make you seem creepy and desperate at this point just let it go youve learned something about dating and about yourself and take that with you for future experiences
i agree here but she also shouldnt have sex with him if shed feel used if it was just sex because its very possible thats how it ends too and she shouldnt have sex if it will harm her mental health just to potentially keep someone around either
am i the only one who thinks its at least a little bit wrong to effectively try to manipulate someone into a relationship by using sex as a bargaining chip im not saying its wrong to wait to have sex at all but based on the post it very much feels like she was only waiting because she was playing a game
true could easily be a dentist or vet which are doctors no residency required and both have six figure starting salaries like i said definitely possible even if not the path most take

as for student loans i know when i was in school more people than you would think graduated without substantial student loans either trough scholarships help from parents or working through school but that also was very heavily influenced by my going to a top school where most of my class was well off im just a proponent of even if something isnt possible for you doesnt mean it isnt possible for anyone lol
question why were you on your laptop and taking calls when hosting a number of friends in your home you hadnt seen in a bit that seems to break a lot of hosting etiquette rules and while im not calling you an ah for it does seem like if you werent on your laptop or taking calls in the first place this wouldnt have happened
fam youre clearly way too young to be on the internet if you think the employees would ever call the cops and in the event they did that the cops would do anything more than generally gesture to take a look into it and never follow up
i mean its not actually as wild as you think you graduate from school at around 2425 if you go straight through and your starting salary can easily be 175k with the demand right now with large starting bonuses and even more if you go into criticalemergency care you could feasibly be 2526 and with that level of income afford a 500k600k house which in the right area could absolutely be a mansion or pretty close and yes i am talking about in todays day and age not 25 years ago

definitely not the path most take but if you prioritize buying a home over renting i know plenty of mid 20s who own homes and they dont have nearly the income a new doctor today would have

eta true med school requires residency but dentists and vets dont require residency and are making 100175k right out of school so like i said comment still stands just because something is uncommon doesnt mean its entirely impossible
did we get an age on the friend he could be older and away at college and in an apartment rentedowned by family oop being 18 doesnt necessarily mean all of his friends are his age and i knew plenty of people who lived in apartmentshouses their family owned while away at school
thats why it was so crazy everyone was blaming oop for simply saying to leave her out of this one i mean hes a parent to two children and it should be on him to manage his own relationship with his daughter rather than relying on the stepmom to always be the manager i feel like its super common for people to give the advice stop fixing things for xyz otherwise theyll never learn how to deal with it on their own yet here when oop simply comes to the conclusion of i wont be fixing things this time he needs to learn shes in the wrong just interesting how differently people can perceive the exact same behavior based on if it was advice they gave or just naturally how a person decides to handle a situation there was no easy answer here but i get oop wanting to be able to not always be the decision maker
did she delete some posts because the ones i see now while clearly paint her as deeply unhappy in the relationship shows shes more of the problem than him or at least theyre equally the problem
hahaha you mean like a teenager would be upset hes told he needs to finish his chores before he goes out with his friends
theyre definitely not that much anymore unless youre trying to find something expensive i went to a show a few months ago and it was 200 for the most expensive seats there were and plenty of options in the 50 range if you want to do a broadway show it doesnt need to be break the bank expensive
op is an electrical engineer engineers are pretty unanimously across the us excluded from overtime pay as it is a professional and has the advanced degree exemption
i mean he clearly picked her when he yelled at you for your behavior so i wouldnt test this any further if i were you and would just apologize and offer to step down from the wedding party or wear whatever dress they pick whatever they prefer 

otherwise kiss your friendship with mark goodbye
you should try to repair the relationship but also be aware some of them may not want an enabler in their lives anymore
i mean her behavior in this story alone should be enough to tell you its entirely possible she cut them all off for not doing exactly as she said
id just send one message saying if you truly feel badly about what you did let me move on and stop contacting me i have no ill will towards you anymore but i also have no desire to have you in my life in any capacity
oh no it gets worse later it can start very young though
if op says he doesnt love her thats totally fair but a month is plenty of time for love for plenty of people she definitely needs some help but she doesnt appear to be looking for a victimsupply she sounds like any other insecure 22 year old who doesnt know how to self regulate their emotions and is hoping a guy will do it for her try not to have the darkest outlook possible on peoples intentions when there is a way more common and way more likely answer in that shes just emotionally immature and struggling with her own demons
you should be encouraging her to get some therapy because you dont like hearing someone you love say such things
well this was a new partner and you frankly arent entitled to know about a deeply personal letter like that you said this happened in the beginning of your relationship
hes 7 good chance hes using sky because it pisses his mom off tell her to lay off and take away the appeal of sky being the rebellious name and then maybe hell change his mind in time or he wont but telling a little boy they cant do something only ever makes them want to do it more
how long was that stick
correct but this is an established thing tm in the horse world
you dont sound like youre a big horse person horse people flock to horse people and can be as cliquey as high school mean girls its no surprise the two of them would gravitate to one another when they share such a massive hobby and love of horses it also sounds like youre projecting your feelings of loneliness onto the man instead talk to your wife tell her you miss one on one time and ask to carve out some time for a date night and her horse back riding communication is key and a marriage takes work on both parties if you communicate your needs and ask her to help problem solve on how to make time to reconnect im sure these feelings youre projecting onto the friends husband will dissipate because the real issue here is you dont feel like youre spending enough alone time with your wife
this is only 3 months in the fuck just send him a message back you keep trying to guilt me about who loves who more yet you dont even feel strongly enough about me to be in a genuine relationship at this point its really clear everything you say is just manipulation to keep getting in my pants and i respectful myself enough to stop allowing the disrespect i dont think its a good idea for us to be friends after this its clear you dont have my best interests at heart and are only interested in getting your dick wet dont worry im sure someone other than me can fill that role goodbye and goodluck

then block him hes just using you and thinks you have no self esteem prove him wrong
interesting i see the opposite on reddit everyone says that you should be willing to love your partner regardless of weightappearance i definitely disagree there within reason 510 lbs whatever a significantly change in appearancelifestyle that now clashes with yours though is as much an incompatibility as anything else

but yes i agree especially before youre in a relationship if youve struggled with weight its totally understandable not wanting to be with someone you think wouldnt be able to handle fluctuations in weight never put yourself in a relationship you think might weigh on your own mental well being
i mean you can decide not to date someone for literally any reason yes
no were talking about exactly the same thing people who think weight doesnt matter and attractionlack thereof isnt a valid reason not to date someone are delusional but its also fair to not want to date someone who rejected you before solely because of your weight or even just someone who rejected you before but now cant get anyone better and is desperate this is one of those no one is wrong but actions have consequences moments
we can not judge them and also recognize that someone you rejected for any reason probably wont want to be a second choice
where do you live id like to read into this
i mean he said in more words that he was an ah for the sake of being an ah because the elderly couple did something a little sneaky too seems like no one is amazing here though i cant blame the elderly couple for giving a try something they probably saw online and had no idea it wouldnt work
am i the only one not believing hes actually bad at giving gifts and its just that op thinks anything other than exactly what she wants is terrible i mean a terrible gift giver doesnt just come up with a thoughtful gift like this and the coaching more sounds like her just telling him exactly what to get and since she clearly didnt this year he still got a lovely gift and put together a sweet day for her
it probably wouldnt be a bad idea to just know if you have toxic plants on the property not sure if theyre toxic just to pets or to kids as well or even if you ever invite kids over but just being able to quickly know in an emergency is never a bad idea even if its something as simple as asking the gardener to text you when he plants something new
get the annulment and then sue her in civil court for the cost of things you may not win but you might its easy to represent yourself
fam youre the problem here not the ex and not the boyfriend
it depends on what vibe youre going for is this a new partner or an established relationship you dont look cute but you do look ready to hike if youre the type who want someone who loves you even with no effort this is fine because youre dressed for the activity if you still want to look cute and functional there are hikingathletic skirts you could do two braids in your hair and a cuter more fitting tank topsports bra and matching socks instead

and a lot of sunscreen
its either couples therapy or divorce but he isnt an intentional abuser who would use therapy only to find new ways to abuse op hes just letting his own issues be taken out on op theres a difference the bigger issue is with op just working in a call center and both having extreme health issues and him being unemployed they likely cant afford couples therapy anyway
well ask him if moving in together would help otherwise move on
bury his head in the sand the same way you are to the fact that your boyfriend very obviously doesnt want to marry you
he doesnt want to propose to you and he doesnt want to marry you if he would marry you with no one watching he wouldve been happy to let you propose hes lying to you and youre letting him because that hurts less than the reality that he doesnt want to marry you but is fine enough to continue dating you indefinitely
i mean at this point your choices are stay as just a girlfriend and drop the desire to be engaged or wait until you piss him off and he dumps you
i mean by staying youve just told him he actually never needs to propose and youll just stay giving an ultimatum you dont really mean is a deaths blow for ever getting the thing in this case marriage you want he is never proposing he is never asking your father for your hand in marriage you either get over it and accept it or you leave but youve totally screwed yourself over for any chance of him ever proposing now because youve proven your words and threats are meaningless
honestly esh learn to say no and leave it at that stop adding qualifiers and allowing yourself to be walked all over let the 100 go but also just tell him that you dont want to hire him and let that be it no reasons no chance to change your mind
so you want this to happen again i mean do you think itll get easier if this keeps happening
the space will be helpful because itll help distinguish between himyou actually wanting to work on things together or you two just being afraid of being alone if hes holding on because hes just afraid of the unknown then once he gets over that the marriage will be done anyway taking that space makes it more likely that if you move forward its genuine and it also just helps to emphasize what being without you would be like rather than giving him a nice easy transition to leaving you
the first question you need an answer to is does he want to work things out with you the second question you need an answer to is do you want to work things out with him if you can both answer yes  he needs to cut her out and send a message saying i feel our friendship is starting to cross a boundary that isnt appropriate for either of us to continue speaking outside of work it isnt about you but i am going to focus on my marriage

the next thing is he needs to block her you both need to sign up for marriage counseling and likely individual counseling too then you two should take a break from one another sleep in separate rooms for at least 6 weeks while youre working through your feelings and how to move forward distance does make the heart grow fonder and often our desire to latch on even tighter in these moments makes it less likely the relationship survives 

he needs to be honest with you about what he thinks she gets that you dont and be willing to say the things he thinks are too hurtful you need to be willing to hear him say some really painful things too only once all the issues are out in the open can you two begin to assess if this relationship is fixable but it starts by deciding if you two are both willing to make it work and you are both willing to make serious changes otherwise theres no real point in trying itll only hurt you more
i mean plenty of people are shit heads throughout their entire 20s so theres still help there it isnt a magic switch when you turn 25 its just that the brain is finally developed but theres plenty of people that dont even start to grow up until that point so hopefully theres hope for her
nta if this man were anyone other than your husband youd be the ah you are fully within your rights to tell your husband another woman has a crush on him to ensure proper boundaries are always maintained doesnt matter if the other woman is family or not
it was a mothers day meal i would hope she wouldnt be a teenager
info you guys are married 

did you forget that once you get married its no longer mine and yours but ours it makes no difference which one of your cards were used
youre giving him way too much leniency and its going to bite you in the ass and hard
unless you want to follow in her footsteps you need to set down some iron clad expectations with your husband because hes your issue here if he isnt willing to put your comfort first you probably wont stay married very long
its not the idea of someone asking you to choose its the idea of two separate peoples entire family asking them to choose despite knowing and getting along with one another for 7 years and three other completely unrelated people to op 

once believable twice kinda weird but sure no less than seven people from five different upbringings nah unless you were raised in a cult but op already said they werent
well think about it this way do you think people who made mistakes are unable to ever change if you do know people can change and learn from poor choices theyve made why dont you think giving someone a chance is the right call hes a meth addict itll be easy to spot if hes still involved in shady shit and then if youre making a judgment based on current behavior go for it but at least give someone a chance to see if it is truly in the past or not
its the internet if you wanna act like a dumbass and say something blatantly incorrect and easily googleable dont be shocked when someone treats you like a dumbass

if you think someone correcting you is rude dont have such a fragile ego you cant take being wrong
that isnt the analogy you think it is and i already said elsewhere its birds belonging to the psittacine family dont comment correcting someone on something a quick google searches will give you the answer to there isnt really an excuse for misinformation in the age of the internet
apparently people in the sub about animals dont know what animals are but parrots are any bird in the psittacine family cockatiels are parrots budgies are parrots cockatoos are parrots macaws are parrots theres dozens of other species that are also parrots 

think of it the same way youd think of a golden retriever golden retrievers are all dogs but not all dogs are golden retrievers same thing here
cockatiels are parrots what did you think parrots were thats like saying a golden retriever isnt a dog its a golden retriever
cockatiels are parrots what did you think parrots were thats like saying a golden retriever isnt a dog its a golden retriever
what exactly do you think a parrot is
yeah its more understandable to get a fake diamond than fake shoes lmao
girl just admit you fucked up and apologize stop trying to make him the bad guy here it was you all you and just you
probably because shes drunk its her bachelorette party and people have been known to cheat during them and an ex came up to her and some really monogamous people can get really honest with alcohol involved so things dont look shady ive definitely done this before and while i looking back know it can seem more sus it really just came from drunk anxiety brain combined with i dont want to feel like im hiding something totally innocent from my fianc alcohol definitely impairs your cognitive skills i wouldnt read into it much unless you think something more serious happened

i would definitely tell my partner if i ran into an ex and i would expect them to do the same the alcohol likely just added a sense of urgency to her wanting you to know
info do you sincerely believe youll be happy for life with this man if not dont get married
i mean if you can afford it sure but at some point you kinda need to start advocating for yourself unless youre really cool spending all this money its okay to just say im sorry but i cant afford that right now i can do without the giftexperiencewhatever it is
damn i cant believe ive lived long enough to become the prude but yeah of course your relationship is going to suffer youre asking for nonmonogamy i would assume most men out there arent going to be okay with it personally you sound waaaay too immature for a serious relationship let alone a long distance one but if you want to start making content again you need to tell him and see if hes okay with it if he isnt you need to make a choice him and monogamy or the content and being single
its normal for your age but my god are 21 year old males shitheads sometimes
answer with a yes or no have you ever had sex with your stepmother
dude has about as strong a grip of sarcasm as he does on the meaning of the word emergency then
info are you telling me your sister decided she no longer wanted to get married but never communicated this to her fianc and the father of her kids because if so your sister is definitely an ah
ok if you think your relationship will be fine both from your and his perspectives then ask him to write up a lease to sign
youre better off moving out its not going to do your relationship with him any favors by moving to such a transactional relationship but hes in his right to decide what hell allow in his own home 

youre 28 you can definitely start to move towards being an independent adult and living your life the way your want to
i mean itll shake out however you decide but you have two options move out or dont have your girlfriend over
you are aware that your smoking hurts a lot more people than you right thirdhand smoke has been proven to be cancerous youre literally contributing to the death of not only you people around you but also the people who enter a space after youve left
so four hours later youre still arguing how come you havent given us a list of everything you do and everything your wife does in caring for your home and your kids clearly you have the time
the morals that marriage is a lifelong commitment you shouldnt just make with people before you know who they are and before youre willing to commit to working things out

tell me you dont understand marriage without telling me you dont understand marriage 

people should consider what marriage means before getting married that means both waiting until you know a person well enough to know there arent red flags hidden and it also means being willing to work through the shitty moments if you cant do it dont get married simple anyone you apparently who doesnt see that isnt really my problem enjoy your future divorce
 if they actually stopped ignoring red flags and putting up with bullshit they wouldnt marry those people in the first place
again if thats your attitude dont get married i already made that clear its not like everyone needs to get married but people have stopped taking marriage seriously and thats why divorce rates are so high you want to be able to walk away at the first issue sure go right ahead dont get married then
legally and morally are different just because you can divorce someone for the color of their shirt doesnt mean you should if you think marriage is such a temporary commitment dont make it
i mean yes if you just assumed he wanted kids that was incredibly presumptuous and foolish of you generally a 38 year old with no kids who wants kids will mention it especially as youre now 35 and thats generally the end of when most people start trying to conceive its also somewhat reasonable for him to assume an older woman with kids who doesnt mention wanting them also would be on the same page with not wanting anymore 

i suppose realistically at this point you need to do some tough thinking and potentially get your msh levels checked to get an idea on how easy it would be to conceive with someone else if thats even an option and if natural birth isnt possible if youre willing and able to pursue ivf or other means
might be difficult for her to see you treating another woman the way she wanted to be treated but clearly wasnt 

ive seen similar things with women who ended a relationship with someone who wouldnt marry them when they find out the ex is getting married even if the women are in new and fulfilling relationships and no longer have feelings for the ex rejection and feelings of inadequacy can remain long after the love is gone 

that being said she needs to handle her own shit and not bring it into your life set a clear boundary and if she cant agree time to put some distance between you and her and at custody swap you can send sky in by herself and you can wait in the car to pick her up
color is meh to me but the fit and length are actively bad it looks very grandmothers nightgown to me since you love the color this would be a beautiful piece if you took in and shortened the waist and then hemmed it somewhere above your knee whatever your preference
i mean probably says you prioritize being in a relationship rather than being comfortable as if i were allergic to an animal that would be the sort of thing i would ask about on a first date and not have a second with anyone with a cat
who hurt you
its not crazy its totally understandable if i may give you some advice my parents would always tell me if its meant to be itll be but never dull your shine for someone else you can leave and let him sort himself out if he does and the time is right maybe you two will reconnect in the future but if he wasnt meant to be your future youll move on and find that future every time ive been in a similar situation to yours my mom especially would encourage me to remember that if god intends it itll happen now i dont know if youre religious but i do think you will end up where youre meant to be and if thats with him youll find your way back to one another when he is healthier and if you arent meant to be and honestly i dont think you are then you will be freeing yourself to find that path youre meant to walk
i know apologies i just would hate to see such a young and vibrant woman with a bright future ruin it because shes willing to sacrifice herself for a man who would never do the same you deserve much more than this
nta if they need to crowdsource their wedding they need to downsize their wedding if they dont need to crowdsource their wedding you dont need to celebrate greedy ass people
eh of all the things wrong with this dude drinking problem doesnt come to mind if he really had a drinking problem he likely wouldnt feel compelled to hide it from his wife and kids hed just be drunk
well youve done the equivalent and then some in this post and all of your comments arguing already so instead of trying to act like youre too good for writing a 7 paragraph comment just do it prove it actually give us the information so we can see everything you do that shows just how much you deserve that break once you do everyones attitude will change and well all see you deserve this break and your wife is asking too much of you trust me its happened before everyone is calling you an ah so if you really think were wrong answering this will make everyone see what you see 

the only reason you would have for not is because you know damn well it would show just how little you do so which is it are you going to write out everything you do or are you admitting you do jack shit and leave everything to your wife
i mean nah she was extremely clear about not being able to handle you with short hair and you agreed i guess you didnt think that would be a dealbreaker and its an odd dealbreaker to have but thats trauma for you personally i would see if you can have a compromise where your hair is a bit longer than it is now but still short ish 

or you can decide your journey is worth more to you than your marriage thats okay too but you cant have both its either your wife feeling safe in your marriage or your hair short i would personally not want my wife to feel unsafe over something as superficial as the length of my hair but i also wont call you an ah for changing your mind and wanting autonomy on how you look this might just mean the relationship has run its course it isnt your responsibility or fault that shes reacting like this but that doesnt change the reality that shes extremely triggered and a choice needs to be made here 

hopefully your wife is in therapy though and can speak to them about this and see if she can work through her feelings in therapy
out of curiosity why do you want to mend things with an addict who is just using you as a meal ticket 

you dont mean anything to him youre just a tool to survive right now maybe he once loved you but his addiction has taken away all of his ability to develop a genuine relationship with you youre 25 youd be frankly an idiot to sink your future investing in someone like this indefinitely 

cut your losses and save yourself
well how about this walk me through a typical week be explicit go morning afternoon and evening walk us through what your wife does and what you do make sure you list every chore each of you does then we can all see exactly how not true it is that you dont do shit
or you could offer one
the rich and poor sure better or worse no thats often one or both people being a prick to the other no one stays married forever and isnt a prick to their partner at some point in time if its abuse obviously leave but theres a normal level of married couples are inevitably going to be shitheads at some point you cant just walk away the first time it happens
the divorce happened several years before he posted and hes still taking his kids on his time so i dont know if thats a fair comment to make
i dont think this is abusive which i think i made pretty clear but i do think op should not back down as shes already said she feels like maybe she should and i also am simply telling her to be hyper aware of if theres any additional red flags 

i am also one of those people who doesnt like everything to be called abuse so i did say this itself does not mean he is an abuser but its definitely how a lot of people say it starts so shes better off keeping this in the back of her mind and finding nooner red flags than ignoring this one and looking back 5 years from now and realizing it started here
its up to you realistically your high school girlfriend doesnt last through college anyway so you can follow the normal path and break up once she leaves
or break up now
it takes people different times to know if they want to marry someone and marriage is a lifelong commitment he could very well be telling the truth that he isnt sure yet and he may be sure later he also could be hiding a reason he doesnt think he wants to marry you you can try to have a conversation about it he ultimately wont tell you if he doesnt want to i wouldnt ask if you already are fed up with waiting and its okay if after 3 years you want someone who is sure 

i would personally decide if youre willing to wait for him to be sure or not if you arent everything else is irrelevant and its time to move on if youre willing to wait you need to decide how long youre willing to wait and then its time to sit down and talk to him ask him if theres some concern in his mind that he is keeping to himself if he says no just tell him plainly i understand it takes some people time and i understand marriage is a huge commitment i dont want us to get married unless both of us are sure but im going to be really upfront with you that if by x date next year 5th anniversary 30th birthday whatever line it is for you youre still no closer to being sure about us i cant wait any longer marriage is important to me and while i want it to happen with you im not going to wait around forever for you to feel the same way around me im not going to bring it up further so i dont pressure you into a decision one way or the other but i want to set clear expectations so neither of us are blindsided in the future
black white looks cheap and see through
it genuinely looks great if youre uncomfortable with the bottoms i would suggest a swim skirt as the flared skirt will really flatter your curves
