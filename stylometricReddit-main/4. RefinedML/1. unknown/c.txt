dating is always hard its always disappointing there will almost always be 100 misses for 1 hit thats most of us thats normal youll always have some things working against you you can only maximize the things you can control and make work for you  be pleasant find enjoyment in life be well groomed etc
this is the truth

they cant survive with out me so frequently means i will not allow for any improvement in their circumstances because the status quo is empowering for me
my limited experience was the same as yours

ive met more cool new female friends at these events than men id want to speak to a second time hell the last one i was at there was one man who admitted at the end of the talk that he was married and had only does this to practice his english 

i met more decent single men at battle axe league and pottery class and had more fun doing it i was off these mixersspeed dating events
because i dont get orgasms from you you dont get basic human empathy or respect from me
oh i wouldnt do that dont give advice to your parents and especially not when asked decline to be parentified do not take on any emotional or intellectual labour for them 

empathize tell your parents yeah that sure sucks or thats sounds really stressfulunkinduntrue tell your parents you dont know youre 26 and not his parent and you trust them and will support them in whatever they choose if they need advice suggest they look for a family therapist 

from one big sister to another dont ever let them make your little brother into your problem hes their problem do not let them forget it
as much as you may not like your brother this is actually a result of your parents choices the problem is almost entirely them

its your parents relationship with him you cannot control it or fix it they arent incompetent they could create boundaries or consequences if they wanted too

the best thing you can actually do is not be a distraction or support for your parents minimize your own engagement with your brother dont pick fights or take sides shrug and tell your parents if they dont like it change it let them suffer with the results of their own choices that is the only thing that might someday motivate them to change those choices
you want a family that includes children and she doesnt

stop trying to fix her or cure her or save her and just admit this relationship doesnt meet your needs

its very sad but its not very complicated
i love him on a deeper level than who he is now and who he has been and can be

then you love a fantasy youve concocted for yourself about him  not the person  and youre going to do yourself harm trying to enforce that fantasy onto a real person

its normal after just a few weeks to be grieving and to still be holding on to all sorts of fantasies and illusions but its time to start doing the work of letting go because letting go isnt something that just magically happens it actually takes a bit of thoughtful effort and selfcare to do if you dont do the work you stagnant and get bitter

dont keep such an open mind that brain falls right out this man was never really offering you a secure and healthy connection dont hold on so tightly to a dream that you lose sight of your own reality the reality is the romantic relationship is over and should be
this is not transparency and you know it

this is abuse 

this was immediately invasive and controlling abusive this is not just projection and not just intense this is just straightup abuse you have already correctly understood that nothing will satisfy him he doesnt just want full access he wants free rein to abuse you calling your contacts abuse complaining about the bathroom door abuse 

youre not wrong youre not concerned enough you cannot let this man continue to access you or your children

change all your password lock him out of everything you can and then break up with him
no history of cheating but history of forgetting to let my dog out or leaving him home too long when he has been drinking caught him doing this once thanks to cameras

so hes right

you want to be able to see him

you want the cameras in your shared home to check up on a 55yearold mans inability to care for your pet as agreed to the cameras are to some extent so you can check up on him and he doesnt like that because he already has shown he wont meet expectations when it comes to the dog

come on youre 35 what are you doing with a 55yearold man who cannot be trusted to let a dog out without the risk of being caught or facing consequences 

either date someone who isnt a shithead or drop the cameras and just hire a dog walker
no you either move forward from the infidelity or you dont 

a hall pass will never be the equivalent and will only introduce more shame anger and resentment for one or both of you 

if you want to discuss opening up your relationship generally thats a whole different thing but a hall pass after infidelity is nothing but a toxic shitstorm 

if youre not going to leave then youre not leaving a monogamous relationship which means youre also not fucking anyone else
she gets to have her reasons and any reason is good enough to leave a relationship she doesnt want to be in a relationship isnt a hostage situation

it doesnt mean you did anything wrong or that you need to change

if that is what she believed about you then its best you two not be dating
no sir i feel quite uninclined to be kidnapped by an utter stranger today and likely have my entire financial and social future ruined in the process in fact even this conversation could materially damage the only currency i have to ensure my basic survival so i must say good morrow to you
if your gf is responsible for the childcare of your children at any time you need to clearly communicate those times to her and gain her agreement to that labour

you cannot make her responsible for your basic health that is still your job and you cannot just sit and resent her for living her life as if she is not a parent shes not not unless that is your agreement togeather and shes offering child care support

if shes living with you and the children and not offering any consistent supervisory support then you need to ask yourself if this partnership actually works for your life and your children but shes still not required to be your coparent her responsibilities if she has any for supervising the children without you needed to be hammered out before you moved in together or they can be discussed now but you cannot force your gf to be mommy or to be a free baby sister unless she wants to be 

youre not being too sensitive but your expectation have been misplaced this is a problem youre going to need to solve probably with outside supports you can think shes a bad person or you can break up with her but you cannot make her babysit your kids
youre wrong for continuing to imagine this person is your friend they are very clearly not

this sounds like a bad habit not a relationship break the habit before it does you real harm
do you want have kids 

because this man is telling you straight up that every single unpleasant part of parenting will be your job he will not be changing diapers let alone his plans he might show up for the big game but he will not be part of the weekly practice carpool 

he doesnt put himself out for others at all not even those he claims to love the most the people who love him do the work to keep the relationship operating and he basically ignores that labour entirely 

its one thing to know your own boundaries and limitations its another to be an asshole you know which this is i wouldnt date a person this immature and self centred at all but if you want children you need to run screaming from a 32 year old who is less considerate and empathetic than most 12 year olds
youre 36 i dont believe youre actually this clueless 

you have not been subtle at all 

you know damn well this woman is working hard to establish distance and keep the conversation professional

sometimes there is no chance to kill its just not happening accept it and move on
at this point marriage is kind of a strange place to draw the line whats with the sudden attack of sensible concerns where was this hesitation fours years ago
obama said people have the right to be skeptical of the dumb shit when minority candidates say it too

attacked obama didnt even bother saying the numbnuts name
he just didnt want to date you 

there is nothing you can do to change that 

sooner you accept that the sooner you can start to heal 

this guy is closed off and noncommunicative thats not on you you couldnt fix that for him

frankly sounds like he tried for blame you for emotional issues that were of his own making
you fucked her sister

youre not that dumb kiddo youre just playing at it to dodge responsibility for your actions and their predicable reasonable impact seems like a pattern
you should apologize for laughing your friends were insulting and bullying her and you joined in you should have found something kind to say to her 

also you fucked her sister yeah thats the kind of thing that is gonna keep coming up kinda a big deal dont play dumb no one is that dumb
has she actually told you she would like an apology or is she just vagueposting because you are well within your rights to completely ignore vagueposting 

if she has asked for an apology this is one of those few situations where im sorry you felt that waysorry you had a bad time apology would be valid and maybe worthwhile

you didnt do anything wrong but you can still acknowledge that she was uncomfortable and that being uncomfortable sucked for her you can acknowledge it sucks to feel ditched even while you disagree that is what took place 

wanting to be heard and have her feelings acknowledged may be reasonable anything more than that is not if she needs more than being heard out then this isnt a person to hang out with during these sorts of events and thats good for you to know in the future
this man just accused you of being manipulative even emotionally abusive because he didnt want to take any accountability for his own choices or his own frustrations

you knew he was doing you a big favour you said so more than once you went out of your way to explain what the situation would look like and then he weaponized the situation you had perfectly explained to him

if he were saying man i did not enjoy that dont think id offer to do that again that would be perfectly fine and completely valid ive definitely done a few favors for partners and then said ok i know i agreed to that and was happy to help this time but not again

but that isnt what hes saying

dont build a life with someone who cannot handle their own choices or normal human frustrations like bad traffic without making it your fault without twisting it into a bad thing that you or someone else did to them the first time a person blames me for traffic or weather or their own regrets or their own ability to say no to something is the last time life is full of little disappointments and bad calls and unexpected hiccups of all levels of seriousness adults who pout and blame and accuse only make the situation 100x worse and are impossible to live happily with
if this is true and youre really back asking this again then you need therapy

stop asking for advice and speak to a therapist about your habit of fixating and unhealthy desperation to snag man
hes asserting control and trying to establish a norm hes saying my passing humour is more important than your discomfort its probably not that he wants to sabotage the marriage its that he wants to make sure she is accepting of this sort of lowkey abuse before the marriage so he can continue to escalate afterwards thats the kind of marriage he wants to build
stay away from kay and keep getting support for your alcoholism 

kay probably has some rather valid anger with you at this point  start drinking in moderation would have been the point at which i would be totally done with your shit the fact she disclosed more than she should while standing  in the er concerned you might die is not necessarily malicious but poor judgment that is a moment where people make poor judgements like that and speaking with a 19 year olds parents about them being in danger is also not necessarily malicious 

but it doesnt matter if youre not happy with how kay speaks of you stop sharing information with kay otherwise you cannot really control her experiences or behaviours 

and this seems rather obviously not your biggest fish to fry at the moment kay doesnt like your choices you dont like hers let it go and do the work you need too good luck
you cant control what other people think dont bother trying

but people would have to be rather stupid to think there is a problem with this you share no blood you were not raised as family members youre adults who met one another as adults through other family members youre only real risk here is the occasional awkward large family dinner
this guy is your controlling cheating ex hes not a friend you dont owe him any explanations

block him everywhere never speak to him again problem solved
it is possible to use grooming in any relationship friends coworkers other family members the word isnt actually restricted to minorsagerelated power imbalances it refers to a technique or group of tactics not to children 

however i do agree this seems to be op trying to minimize his wifes role in this situation
id tell my bf he aint subtle and to grow the hell up its rude and embarrassing to be out with a man who gawks if any of my male friends did this on the regular id tell them they look like idiot 13 year olds and to get a grip 

we all glance we all notice it had nothing to do with you or your appearance stop taking it personally and just call this ogling what it is rude and childish like picking your nose in public draw his attention to it just like you would if he was picking his nose tell him its gross and to break the bad habit
this man is just an asshole 

he understands just fine this isnt a situation where you havent communicated clearly

he knows this isnt loving 

your misery is the point
youre regularly reviewing straights mens dating profiles eh i dont spend a lot of time looking at straight womans profiles but obviously that behaviour about height would make her an asshat really not complicated also totally not necessary on apps where filtering by height is available but hey ill take your word for it kiddo

im sorry im not hating on teenage women enough for ya but i am confident youll find plenty of corners of the internet which fuel that fire for ya
i know this a repost but i still wanna see this asshat thread an overlocker 

my gaming computer requires way less regular maintenance or technical knowhow than my sewing machines
men are policed for their behaviour not their preferences

you can choose not to match with larger women on a dating site but if you put no fatties youre an ass if you are 40 and chasing 19 year olds its your behaviour thats the problem 

i dont expect you to understand the difference but there is a drastic one between preferences and behaviour towards other human beings
according to this guy hes basically required to be
it cannot be some woman have personal values interests or concerns about the world that extend beyond an individual mans needs
because as much as they whine about respecting fathers and the necessity of two parent households they only really mean that women shouldnt be allowed to leave

they never actually mean that individual men should be responsible parents

i dont think its the end of the world if someones wants to be an older father  yes there are increased risks and sure youre probably not gonna be around for highschool grad i think that sucks but it falls under you do you 

what really bugs me in the men who will both argue for the importance of present fathers in a childs life and still applaud these sorts of choices
while i think your concerns are totally valid we also know perfectly well that many many people can engage daily with all sorts of immersive fantasies games movies books and still not be confused about what is real and what is content consumption 

i think the real question you need to ask yourself is if you are compatible with and comfortable in a relationship with someone who engages with porn this much is he pressuring you to perform or not respecting your nos when it comes to sex acts you dont need to judge his character negatively or make calls about his motivations to decide hes just not for you
this is really up to you

is this the behaviour you want to have in a friendship because ill be honest not me this kind of intensity of communication is reserved for romantic partners andor very close friends at times of crisis

since youre asking this question youre probably realizing that your energy and time are not lining up with the reality of this connection your behaviour is not consistent with what you say is happening here between the two of you
it wouldnt be wrong  it wouldnt be a violation of your agreement  but it would probably be unwise at this point if youre serious about exploring the connection with him he has told you that for him he tends not to explore his options by this point youre not exclusive but he has told you that is the path he would like to be on 

ive been similar to him in the past by the time i reach date number six or so im probably not actively dating anyone else even if we are not exclusive yet 

frankly if youre at date six and youre still motivated to explore your options with other people then you may want to respectfully end it with someone who is looking for a serious commitment you may just not be aligned
youre only the bad guy if youd not clear with her when you know what the score is 

shes allowed to be upset shes allowed to not want to be your friend it may suck but its not wrong
you dont really explain its not a math puzzle you can logically describe for her 

you just own it to be kind you have to be clear

youre a cool person but im not feeling it on a romance level id like to stay friends if that would work for you

its okay for her to feel bad rejection sucks shes allowed to be upset what is important is that you own it as your own experience and reality and you dont leave any false hope
you desperately need to find yourself a woman mentor who can help you set expectations for the review process youre spinning out

write romance novels on your own time in the real world your boss is offlimits and youre running a real risk of making a fool of yourself on a personal level with him and with others these fantasies and obsessive thoughts need to be dropped 

the only actual workplace problem here is you learning what is normal during the pitchfeedbackrevision process and how to emotionally navigate it let go of the rest of this shit
its a new sleeping situation for you both youll both probably adapt

or buy a bigger bed
the only spin here to help her feel better is that she is now free of someone who clearly was unable or unwilling to treat her with any consideration or real friendship 

youre reading too much into this because reading into is a waste of time and energy its over

you may want to consider what boundaries you need as her friend when it comes to constantly hearing about this drama
how can you not understand her being perfectly allowed to just talk about work with you

it is sad but it also sounds like her husband may have had valid concerns about your ability to manage an appropriate workplace friendship with a married woman you do not appear to handling this change in boundaries very well
i dont think we need to attribute to malice what is adequately explained by stupidity

i doubt he was consciously running game or trying to manipulate you probably just wasnt thinking very much at all and was doing what felt good to him in the moment with no actual regard for you as another person no self awareness no consideration just hey this feels good to me in this moment so ill do x 

definitely not someone who is worth carrying in with  way too dumb to be any fun i would have blocked him too after that shit but also probably not someone who was deliberately trying to mess with you  also too dumb
its not her fault youre terrible at confrontation

if you cannot handle telling the woman whose done your hair  for six years  that you werent happy with the latest job then you will just need to find another 

demanding a refund at this point seems excessive when you werent able to communicate with her its strange that after six years youre allowing so much accusation and anger to fester
you dont

you end all contact you can with this unstable abusive person who threatened to publicly shame you and you figure out how to live somewhere else

from now on you say nothing but hi and bye to him you leave when he tries to speak to you you nod you keep your door close you say nothing to him unless its totally necessary never defend never explain never answer any questions or talk about your feelings anything you say will be used against you you are roommates not friends if asks state that were not friends just polite roommates 

itll be worth the expense to move out this is not a safe person to have in your life at all
this has to be made up

but on the off chance there is an adult man out there in the world who is in this stupid

you ruined your family not her your exwife is behaving in a totally sane way and you can only speak to her through the lawyer moving forward because that is the rational reaction to your behaviour

your wife is behaving in a totally logical way you fucked her teenage sister youre done

if you try to continue to attempt to entrap very young women they are going to keep on growing up and getting what they are entitled to from you
i cant stand watching people walk all over her

then stop watching because you cannot change her choices you can only change yours and you are not reflecting much trust of respect for her choices here which means this is a bad relationship for you both

this relationship isnt working for you your insistence on remaining in a bad situation is going to result in you behaving in toxic and controlling ways
tell him hes 30 dont coddle him tell him

i am worried youre going to keep making it my job to reassure you of your value comments like youll get swooped up or i have a lot of competition are really insulting to me since i have chosen to date you i have already decided that you won sp i need these sorts of comments to stop not just to apologize when you do it but to work on not doing it i need you to know that your insecurities are primarily your responsibility i can help you out a bit with it but you need to do the real work to stop thinking this way about yourself and stop putting it on me that you feel these negative ways about yourself its fair to keep putting on me and making it my job to address
youre not a superhero youre not a martry youre not her parent or her keeper or her therapist or her doctor youre her teenage boyfriend and shes it sounds like shes been telling you to stop condescending to her

youre not in charge of her and its not your job to figure things out for her 

she is allowed to make choices for her own life even if she has a mental illness she can and is choosing not to be in the kind of relationship you want to be in

you are allowed to leave a relationship that doesnt work for you
you cannot earn the relationship you want with someone

they have to be offering it 

shes not offering you the kind of relationship you want to be in
support your dad in this moment let your mom make her own decisions

the only mistake here you made here was every agreeing to attend with you mother it always made sense to prioritize your father on this day it was understandable for her to feel awkward attending alone but that wasnt a problem you can solve youd already made plans with your dad

besides that you really need to tell all of these very selfish adults to handle their own shit if your father isnt happy with how his mother maintains boundaries with his exwife that is something for him to discuss with his mother not you if he doesnt want your mother to join in events besides the funeral itself that is for him to discuss with her or with other people who may choose to invite her like his own mother and not you if your mother sends a nasty text that is none of your business tell both of them not to speak to you about it you shouldnt even have to know about that

both of your parents sound petty and mean and are putting way too much of their bullshit on you

its been a decade its not your problem to solve these two people are choosing misery and pettiness at this point and you cannot make them happy they have both chosen to some degree unhappiness

youre an adult but youre still the child when it comes to the two of them do not do anyones dirty work for them these adults are still responsible for managing their own relationships with one another do not try to save your dad from your mom or your mom from your dad tell them to talk to one another if they have a problem with one another and leave you the hell out of it

youve made your decision to attend with dad your mom can feel how she feels about that and do what she feels is right if shes not comfortable attending tell her you understand and youll talk again soon beyond that its between them dont get involved
your mother cannot force you to get a medical implant or go on birth control

if you tell the doctor you do not want it they will do put it in you you only have to say so

your mother can create serious consequences for you that might stop you from sleeping over at your bfs house but she cannot force you to use hormonal contraception

but come on you know this relying only on condoms is a little bit stupid when other options are available

the smart thing to do would be to figure out if hormonal birth control is something you can comfortably use youre digging in your heels because youre pissed with your mom she can be wrong about a whole lot of shit and also be right that its time to explore contraception options in your life go talk to a doctor about it
its feminine

im only half kidding my little brother called it feminine anger  shrill irrational and intensely emotional is what he thinks a womans anger should be preformed as

which is strange because he comes from a family full of women who are quite mellow but have ice cold rage when triggered  there were no shrill voices growing up and my house  and ive seen that he comprehends it just fine
this woman needs better friends although she probably cant keep em with that attitude

ive never met the woman who behaves the way shes describing like i havent even had to work very hard to avoid her theoretical evil woman i have had to avoid women like this content creator who scream bloody murder about the evil women they imagine exist and are treating men so badly
does dressing modestly mean trying your damnedest to look like an airbrushed 12 year old now
the first thing you do is accept that you dont have sole control over how peaceful it is 

if he chooses to react very poorly thats going to happen no amount of perfect behaviour on your part can stop him 

and hes probably going to react badly because hes already told you he feels entitled to verbally abuse you he doesnt think its wrong hes gonna do it 

your job is to minimize his opportunities 

to leave in the shortterm you need someplace safe for you and your daughter to stay since he is abusive you should make a plan that keeps you safe that means your daughter needs to not be in the house or accessible to him in anyway when you tell him you also want to remove anything highly personal or sensitive before you have this conversation passports medical records sentimental jewelry or banking information leave it with friends or family do not leave it behind in a space where he can access it you can absolutely have this conversation over the phone you do not owe a facetoface conversation to someone who is abusive towards you safety first

then you probably need some legal advice regarding leases or entitlements but the first step is physical safety and basic core documents and possessions
do you think this is because she actually has an issue with old problems that again she have not been brought up in years or because she is deflecting back to her

its almost certainly both to some degree or another

even without knowing what they are  both probably both 

she is actually still having these issues and the feelings remain real and are impacting her even if you think the issue itself is resolved

and also shes deflecting and feeling defensive and unhappy with you 

just take these conversations to a therapist who can help you both handle them better
in other words because misogyny many men do not believe it is possible for me as a bisexual woman to experience a connection with another woman that is as meaningful as the connection that is possible with them a man

which is extremely invalidating

it is extremely insulting and demeaning on a personal level to be treated that way by someone who is close to you who you speak openly to about yourself and your life it means they are not listening or believing me when i speak about my own experiences romantic and sexual history or orientation i dont want a partner who invalidates my lived experience because their ego and sexist assumptions cannot accept that two women have real sex or real romance
oh well if he started it that changes 

nothing

grow the fuck up
you dont need to date anyone you do not want to

but you need to check yourself you hadnt even met her yet you hadnt gone on a single date you wanted her to be committed to you and just you before ever meeting

there was no betrayal she was single she behaved like a single person 

you made assumptions about her life and her choices in the weeks before you even met 

if this was something that was really important to you before entering a relationship then you need to ask dont ask dont tell is perfectly acceptable during the nonexclusive talking phase of getting to know someone if her past behaviour on apps or with casual sex were important to you it was on you to ask directly about these things 

the only thing that actually happened here is she had a different attitudes towards hooking up and casual sex than you assumed she had and its okay if that is a dealbreaker for you but its not a thing she did to you
would have killed you to buy an enclosed frame or box seriously

this sounds made up if its not grow up

youre in rez there are usually pretty strictbizarre rules about what you can keep dont want to deal with rez rules and rez roommates then dont be in rez

an escalating war of snitching with a vaguely homophobic tinge to it sounds like a miserable way to spend the next few months thats about as likely to get you expelled as him but hey you do you
illegal for the landlord to ask not to offer not for the realtor to recommend they offer

it is happening more and more the realtor may be giving good advice in this case on how to secure it
in other words you dont think its real sex or a real threat if there isnt a penis involved

this is not a good look if you want to date queer women who has any selfrespect
hah this is always a shittest i inadvertently use when im dating men do they realize that sex involving two women is still real sex or are they only threatened by other penishavers if they get nervous about men in my life but never about the women then they are invalidating both my ability to maintain boundaries with my friends but also my bisexuality hard pass
it sounds like your ex was uncomfortable with the upcoming period of longdistance 

its very very rarely just one silly thing its better if you can accept that
imo the only way to fix this situation is to go scorched earth and do everything possible to take all custody from this toxic woman shes doing drugs and shes a neglectful abusive parent this should be a given

totally agree but also totally out of ops control op can recommend the scored earth policy you describe here but then brother has to run with it and probably wont at least not yet op cannot enforce it or lead this charge it wont work if they do 

all op can really do right now is start to create consequences for mother and brother for not having strict boundaries with ashley the consequence that is within their power is you see us and your other grandkids far less because youre not creating safe situations for us as family when you include ashley
nah let him laugh youre helping your manager out by making your own boundaries clear first

its important for you to tell the manager you asked him clearly politely to stop its important for the manager to know he laughed in your face makes it easier for them to do their job and to know they have too
this man cheated on you and then tried to break up with you

thats not just nre you created that narrative to protect yourself and he latched on cause it fit his needs in the moment 

you need to be seriously asking yourself if this man actually wants to be in an polyopen relationship if he is emotionally or cognitively equipped for it and willing to do the work to make it function and if you can even trust him to be able to tell you the truth on those first two points can this man even know what he wants and what work he is willing to do could he communicate that to you if he did know 

you can never know the truth of another persons mind but every bit of evidence you have here says no no you cannot trust this man to be an emotionally responsible partner 

as a general rule you should really not try to reason someone out of breaking up with you  you should have broken up and you should have forced yourself to find healthier ways to resolve your own confusion and grief the ones you picked were bandaids
it could be the longterm agreement others comes to  op cannot completely control that  but the period right now is transitional with no legal agreements in place people are feeling their way through the separation so is a period where those agreements are going to be thought about and slowly come together

which is why the best thing op can do within their power is decline to be in ashleys presence so that brother and mother have that information and that reality when making future plans and agreements
this

and then when he says its just a joke you say i dont understand whats funny about accusing me to cheat can you explain the joke part of it to me followed finally by well whatever you intend i find it hurtfulinsulting please stop hurtinginsulting me
you cant control other people

you can only stop responding to the instigation  every time you respond you make it a fight between two badly behaved people instead of one person being a bully 

ask him directly to stop once clearly in front of other people in the workplace tell him its unkind and unwelcome and you want him to stop doing that this is making you uncomfortable and its not okay to expose customers too

when he doesnt speak to your manager about the behaviour
shes not just the exwife shes not even that yet

shes the coparent the mother of the grandchildren

if you dont want to go to events where she is present dont that is the right response and it puts the ball back in your mother and brothers court to properly manage their energy and time and invites during this transitional period

and it is a transitional period

with the divorce not yet being processed and no custody or separation agreement in place it makes sense for your brother not to antagonize her further  the custody agreement is where they can spell out that when they are in his custody they will be spending time with his family members and she cannot enforce a blacklist

in the meantime block her on socials there is no reason to expose yourself in any way to that
this im baffled why he thinks the father would have signed over the land in a way that didnt prioritize and protect his daughter the only error here was not talking about what would happen to the home in the case of a divorce when deciding to build there someone should have brought that up but that group of someones includes op op should have asked both his fil and wife and his own lawyer

op accepted a financialhousing situation he didnt think through and now regrets it sucks its perhaps unkind but its not a conspiracy

and its not the only reason this marriage is in serious trouble
while i understand being upset with your wife this is also quite obviously what would take place you were 35 not 15 no one took you for a ride you built a structure on land that doesnt belong to you but to her father inheritance is usually exempt from shared property calculations this is rather basic shit im sorry it didnt occur to you but this isnt particularly underhanded 

did you think hed make some sortof cash gift to you after the marriage ended to buy you out of the land you didnt own would you have done that for your daughters ex given him a big old gift right after the marriage ended probably not 

if youre going to remain married its clear you have some big conversations and changes you need to make about your budget and legal situation

but if you want to get divorced this is clearly not the only reason behind that and you need to speak to a lawyer about the value you put into the house that you may have some entitlement too but thats a legal question not a relationship one
its this to liberals this doesnt sound like humour just like condescending lying 

to conservatives its both humorous and the truth

liberals tend to like jokes with irony and misdirection and ambiguity all things that take cognitive effort to decode thats fun that funny for them 

conservatives prefer jokes based on exaggeration and the grotesque tucker says exactly what he means up right away and then he intensifies it this requires no context or cognitive effort to understand but its experienced as funny as humour even while the exaggeration are often also accepted as literal truth 

i think jordan miss this sometimes with alex too the people who are listening to him would argue both that hes obviously joking and that hes telling the truth that makes a sort of fundamental sense to them because that is what comedy is to them irony and misdirection are mean and take work and the comedian seems to be admitting its not really true so dont always resolve tidily or feel like attacks exaggeration is validating easy to listen to you therefor funny and also true
this is not what an enjoyable friendship looks like for me it doesnt feel kind or funny

youre totally allowed to have boundaries in your friendships this is lazy humour if they really need friendships where they are free to behave this way then they have those with someone else if they value your friendship on terms that make you both happy theyll cut it out 

im younger than you and queer and none of my male friends would behave this way on the regular a few of my gay guy friends may have when we younger but a general hey thats not my vibe addressed it just fine with no real hurt feelings
you need to start saying no without giving reasons or excuses 

anything you say about why you cant will just be the beginning of a debate or manipulation

instead tell her the truth you wont youre not going too whether you can or not is not a necessary conversation because youre done lending money 

you may try to say consider the past money a gift but i will not lend money any more that might soften it and make you feel better since that is reality the reality anyways but accept that if she chooses to respond badly than she just will respond badly nothing you can do about that 

your job right now is to make yourself feel secure and comfortable saying no and sticking to it you cant really control how she chooses to react
youre being ridiculous

you shouldnt go to the wedding because youre fucking ridiculous and the happy couple really shouldnt have to deal with your bullshit

you need to get over yourself if you really cant manage that on your own seek therapy

its been over a decade you were children this should be vaguely awkward and kind of funny it should not be anything more than that pretending that you were destined or that you had any rights to her or that you have any ability to not let this happen is all completely absurd 

im dead serious if you are actually this distressed about the situation please talk to a therapist this is not a healthy or rational response
youve agreed the cats are hers the cats are hers

the care of the cat is no longer your responsibility and also not something youre entitled to if she believes a contact with you of any kind will help the cat adjust she can i ask for your help with that however its probably far better for the cat to push through this adjustment period then to have intermittent and unreliable contact with you

you just need to grieve this relationship that includes grieving the relationship with the cats
if you believe your girlfriend is cognitively incapable of empathy and has no regard for right or wrong dont date her

drugs may be contributing but they are not the sole cause
your bf is abusive

its not your job to protect him from the neighbours knowing hes an abuser its his job to not be abusive 

go to the wedding alone and then make a plan to keep yourself safe and away from this man ask your family for help 

hes gonna hit you soon or worse he is abusing you and hes justifying his escalating abuse the only thing that stopped him was the embarrassment of the neighbours finding out he didnt stop because he didnt want to hurt you he stopped because he didnt want to get caught 

youre in very real danger

gather up your important documents and have a friend keep them or mail them to your parents

you were right to run keep running
dont take your coworkers so seriously they probably arent seeing much they are more likely bored and using you two for entertainment which is another thing you need to put a stop too by not giving it any more fuel 

stop spinning out on this like you said in the end you just have to step back there is nothing else you can do that is appropriate given the place your own head is at
you need to start just saying no and keeping your distance

one of two things is happening here

1 she is truly obliviously and genuinely trying to build a friendship with you and is open to opportunities outside of the workplace to do that so you need to end it and say no to those opportunities clearly because youre not happy or comfortable with her version of friendship and thats okay as with anything you can admit that a friendship connection isnt working for you and step back from it
2 shes looking to cheat with you so you need to end it because youre entering into a situation that can only possibly harm you with someone who is untrustworthy

youre reading an awful lot in to passing comments made in the workplace  youre quite clearly overinvested yourself in the fantasy of her wanting you  but the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle shes unhappy and not fully aware of what she is doing or thinking through what she is saying 

odds are good you are taking this far more seriously than she ever has

the end result is the same tho stay away
just be the bigger person and say im sorry to have hurt you our relationship was important to me but ive accepted it is over given how you feel about my choices to move on and date again i think its best we not continue to try to be friends good luck

then block her

she has no business berating you and you know it

maybe she isnt trying to manipulate you but it doesnt really matter this isnt going to work as a friendship if that how she feels or how she behaves if she is going to be this upset by the reality then youre not friends and you can end contact
if you do not want to be in a relationship with someone who uses drugs frequently and to excess then hes not your person

what is capable of is lying to you he is capable of lying in repeated obvious and predictable ways he is displaying the behaviour of being an addict and being in denial about that

the odds of this getting better are slim

the odds of it getting better before it gets much worse are basically nil

if you go back in two weeks you will be in this exact same position again quite soon with an addict who broke their word again when it came to substance abuse
this is entirely up to her

if she doesnt wish to be in a relationship right now that choice is hers and needs to be respected

depressed or mentally ill people are still entitled to end relationships breaking up isnt a choice you make together its a choice one person makes and then its made it doesnt require your belief or your agreement if she wants this to be over then its over for any reason even reasons you dont like or agree with 

its nice that you believe you can be a source of support but in any relationship if one person chooses to end it its over

youre her bf right now not her therapist or social worker or any other adult participating in her care or treatment you dont work together on serious mental health challenges you offer the support you can as a teenage bf and she can accept or reject any of those offers
tell her you dont want to have any contact or conversation with someone she thinks might kill her

if she wants to make up crazy stories act accordingly dont apologize tell her to stop putting you in danger too

no i dont want to talk to your brother you told me he might tell your dad to kill you dont send photos of me to potential murderers are you trying to get me killed as well

you cannot fight that kind of crazy narrative so lean into it

next she calls him tell her youre gonna talk a way and dont tell the people who want you dead that i live here please
dont diagnose dont recommend a treatment plan you havent got those skills or information

there is a level of whiteness that is within normal and the bacteria that causes bad breath isnt removed by scrapping the colour change is more likely caused by whatever is causing the smell instead of the cause itself of the smell or the smell might just have you noticing something that was always within normal for him he really shouldnt just start scrapping his tongue raw it may do nothing or he might make things even worse for his health

instead tell him the fact that you do know his breath is bad and its getting worse ask him to please to speak to a doctor best option likely a dentist about how to address it
you cannot stop him from investing his portion 

tell him plainly this is not what you want for your future if he rather not buy right now that is a totally valid discussion but it needs to be a discussion with you his actual partner

if he will not do that  and it seems he has already decided not too  you have learned that you need to financially plan for yourself and yourself alone he is not your partner when it comes to money he is not working with you 

you need to decide if the relationship can move forward or even survive with that limitation
its okay to be mad but dont delude yourself into thinking you can fix it

if you had a screenshot of that conversation that would be far more relevant to share with her than his more recent attempt at contact

the choice is yours personally i dont police other people being shitty in their relationships i only stick my own neck out if they are being dangerous and i have clear evidence of them being dangerous to date what you have here is bullshit not dangerous 

too many of the people who date casual shady assholes and liars just turn on the people who try to warn them no reason in my mind to open myself up to harassment or drama just because your bf is an asshole
just block him

the core problem here is that you dont want to speak to him hes not your friend you want him out of your life

so get him out and dont insert yourself into the drama and court more contact and conversation with him or with his gf that is always a risk  a risk of not being believed or even of being harassed in response and that is the opposite of what you actually want

im all for taking that risk and telling a partner when there is some physical danger or harassment like cheating or blackmail or threats but here there is nothing but bullshit lowkey opentointerpretation bullshit its just not yours to carry its not on you to do the work or take the risk to inform her of this sort of shit just be done with him
your bf thinks youre trash and he feels entitled to treat you that way

you were not stupid you just assumed that your bf didnt still think you were trash

he does he always has he has always believed this about you and he will always believe he can treat you as if you were trash whenever it works for him 

the problem here is not about seeing your friend the problem here is your bf and its not getting better its not going to get better he feels entitled to weaponize this against you whenever he wants to lash out at you he will use this he will always shame you over this he believes he deserves to treat you this way 

as long as he continues to behave this way this is not a safe relationship for you
nice to hear a happy story with a partner who listened and stepped up thank you for sharing
you need to change the password on your amazon account

or disconnect your card

or use a prepaid card

you also need to seriously reconsider this relationship and the agreement youve come to with your wannabe trophy wife you cannot afford a trophy wife

getting a joint account with this woman would be insane 

not caring if she contribute financially to the cost of your life together isnt laudable if you have negative funds in your account its just kinda stupid
in other words you left really important details out of the op

but they dont really change my advice

hes bad people okay still her choice who is in her life and who isnt and not yours still something you need to speak up about respectfully and decide not to date her if you cant deal with her choice

still an overreaction to i dont know

youre responding as if she said definitely yes were having coffee tomorrow

and if my current bf told me it made him sick to think about me having sex with my ex id tell him to get the fuck over himself and stop fixating unfairly thats immature and unkind you keep arguing with her about her own experiences its fine to disagree but this condescending towards her like this isnt going to help her deal with her own past 

its fine to let her know how youre feeling but dear god rein those feelings in and bring more respect to the conversation stop making her past all about yourself
yeah but he also has to do the work to not make it personal that is literally the bare minimum he needs to be doing here out of basic human respect

you can and should expect better from him than the behavior youre describing

anxiety makes controlling yourself more difficult at times but it doesnt mean hes not still expected to meet the minimum of respect and kindness hes not meeting that i have a rather severe anxiety disorder and id never dream it would be acceptable to treat my partner the way he is treating you while you drive
youre overreacting 

i dont know needs to be a valid and safe response to that question

its fine to tell her that you rather she didnt its fine to be uncomfortable its not okay to loose your everloving mind over this 

its good for her to remember that you can forgive someone and not be mad at them without inviting them back in your life 

its vital you remember that she is entitled to choose her own friends and should be trusted to maintain appropriate boundaries with all the people she chooses as friends if you cannot trust her to do that dont date her
boundaries yelling watch out for anything short of immediate risk of death is not acceptable behaviour for a passenger likewise boundaries against accusations are valid and important here he can be saying things like this feels fast or im uncomfortable with the speed he should not be saying youre speeding  his feelings are what he needs to communicate not his anxious assumptions or accusations about your behaviour he needs to recognize and use his words to reflect the fact his judgments in this situation are flawed and unreliable he is not that authority

compromises you need to accept that time in a car is not together time instead of framing it as a chauffeur id recommend you think of driving the two of you places as a chore like doing the dishes or vacuuming one that is difficult or impractical to share but necessary to keep life going on your chore is driving his chore is managing his own shit while you drive so at that moment youre not together you both have taken on separate necessary tasks to get to a place 

both my partner and i have anxiety around carsdriving these are very similar to the boundaries we have in place when one of us is the passenger no spoken warnings unless they rise to the level of someone is gonna die we both agree not to give a damn about scratches or dents on the damn car we share feelings or ask questions we do not assert facts or make accusations we respect the person behind the wheel is doing one job and the passengers job is to not interfere or make the driving job more stressful than necessary and sometimes depending on anxiety levels the passengers job is the harder one but just as necessary as the drivers that it be performed well
as someone who loves you i want better than this for you

you dont need to go much further than that to start i wouldnt suggest you get prescriptive and tell him what to do but you might ask him as someone who loves you what hed suggest to you if you were calling him each day with these concerns and anxieties about a partners unkind words or drinking 

the opinions to voice here are the opinions that your father is kind and worthy its not your job or your place to address her addiction or mental health its your job to tell your father youre concerned for him and that you want better for himself than he has right now tell him this is not okay hes no okay he deserves to feel okay in his relationship
this isnt a financial question its a relationship one

you actually have two choices

1 continue to date this woman
2 or dont

you could certainly be speaking to your gf about your plans for the future and how she might sharejoin you in those you can be speaking about the compromises and agreements you would not be open to making yourself like living with someone who financially supports a parent

her choices are only relevant to you so much as they change your relationship together and introduce stress or impediments and the solutions really are hers to figure out not yours to prescribe she needs to be the driver seat on any suggestions or next steps or it just wont work 

the choices your gf actually has are far more than two and 500 is likely not reasonable rent in any way dont know how you pulled that number outta your rear its your choices you should be considering and in the end youre the one who really only has two
this is definitely unpopular but i hate how the quote wellbehaved women seldom make history has been twisted and misunderstood and turned into a slogan because the author was actually making a super cool and way more interesting point about whose stories get told it wasnt a battle cry to misbehave 

laurel thatcher ulrich who was a professor of early american history at harvard said this in an academic paper on new england ministerial literature 16681735 basically it was about early american settler women writing about their faith 

she was arguing womens lives have limited representation in historical narrative except as the bad girls and that wellbehaved women should make history that their ordinarydomestic lives were interesting and worthy and that we shouldnt be trying to classify  every woman who ever lived as either housewife or radical 

anyways it makes me cringe every time i see it plastered as a slogan on some alternative fashion or warrior princess vibe or misattributed to marilyn monroe
dude just no 

go touch grass read a book or something about people who actually did survive refugees natural disasters read academics and historians takes on settlers early societies or exploration 

this is tv often fairly called trash tv and i love it but this is purely entertainment those commenters those clips are part of the attention marketplace there is nothing to study there not in the way youre describing youre confused about what is taking place 

youre not talking about serious thoughtful considerations about human survival when youre talking about any particular seasons groups performance on this show youre talking somewhat ironically about gossip  an often femininecoded but deeply human practice of casual conversations about other people typically involving details that unclear untrue or otherwise being delivered through the lens of deep individual bias
lets maybe not conflate a single season of reality tv with an experiment 

season three of the same silly show would tell a different story and gender 

boy and girls alone paints a very different picture

but i really dont think we can learn to much about human survival from an extremely small group of people who self select to be on reality tv then are further selected by producers for good tv and who all know damn well the stakes measured in clout and bragging rights not death
yeah when it gets that extreme it a few bad apples situation imo i imagine most men could correctly deduce that a doctors office is not the place for this behaviour  even if they were inclined to it  but it only takes a few men to spoil womens experience of being approached 

and lord knows its way more than a few who feel 100 entitled to the attentions of any women they see straying into a public space
my go to is now is a perplexed shake of my head and a loud i dont know you this is not a conversation 

ignore all questions all insults dont take the bait just wait till they stop for breath and say i am not having a conversation goodbye
men who feel appropriate amounts of empathy and shame are much less likely to be cold approaching to begin with
ew no id be done with this therapist hell i might forward this exchange to thier supervisor there are a handful of what i can most generously refer to as rookie mistakes here

the observation and advice to ask him explicitly to stop might be a good one especially if the therapist is going to back you up on boundaries and tone and help to keep the questions productive

but the blame shifting and enjoying the attention remarks were so totally beyond the pale once someone said that to me id be saying thank you for the sessions i will not be attending any further no explications or justifications they have utterly closed the door on any actual communication or understanding here dont try to smash through it just say no 

someone who thinks i am attention seeking is not someone who can be trusted with any vulnerability whatsoever we are adults seeking serious assistance not toddlers or puppy dogs who are bored

youre not refusing treatment by ending this relationship youre leaving a situation where you are not respected or believed by the authority figure in the room

dont blame yourself for not stepping up early it seems likely you had properly judged the situation as not one where it would be safe or productive to do so
this

kind of specific examples but my life got so much better when i realized yes a lot of men do not likecannot handle a woman making the first move but i dont want to date those men anyways so loosing my chance with them is a perk not a failure lets start asking out who i want to ask out and stop the attentionseeking games to signal availability
sure a study if 75 women including 15 who has never had intercourse asked to judge from 33 3d printed blue wands landed on a general preference for length m  63 inches and circumference  48 inches 

so if youre buying a blue dildo for the average woman you now know what to look for 

if youre looking to drag other men down into despair and anger with you this is scant evidence for a slight aboveaverage preference amoung woman and also please stop
hey maybe we should just not have a draft maybe that is like fundamentally immoral and unworkable and weve all basically agreed on that by now anyways 

no threats of violence we need every possible delusion and excuse to shame women with vague threats of violence and harm against them and were totally cool with fucking over men just to get to keep those insults
they are only conveniently unable to decode the women they dont wish to listen too 

when other men they value or fear or respect behave in passive aggressive or indirect ways they understand just fine they pick up on those codes constantly every day because they decided it was worth it to do so 

they are not as dumb as they would like us to think

careful research  watched a lot of porn made for men by men concluded women are the problem

is this woman your friend

if not tell her to take up her boundaries with her husband all you did was show up at a party you were invited too in your work clothing

then block her the boundaries in her marriage are not your job to know or enforce if she has an issue its with her husband do not apologize for existing in a dress

if she is your friend then tell her you are sorry that her boundaries were inadvertently and unintentionally violated by you but that anything more than that is an issue between her and husband not you
or the number of male firefighters who are also convicted serial arsonists
then say that its on him and maybe encourage op to keep herself safe if he doesnt acknowledge that immediately because without that accountability spelled out your advice appeared to be that op should set themselves on fire to keep the poor wounded adult man who is abusing her warm
you realize you sound like a 19 year old 

and honestly thats fine be a bachelor be the emotional equivalent of a teenager if that makes you happy sit at home and wank and pay your taxes thats fine 

but stop allowing this woman to hold onto any false hope or expectations of you youre being a selfish shit if youre leaving her with any hope of you ever moving to be with her youre not gonna do it
not all but defiantly most eh 

there are 21 million content creators on only fans they are not all women they are not all american and less than 20000 of them make more than 50k a year

in other words barely 1 of the people on of make their living on of 

this woman is a moron
its been weeks they are 22

please leave the hes just hurting but you could save him bullshit at the door
only visits twice a year i think and gets homesick after a week or two

doubt he has a key she just has to block his number fingers crossed for her
if he doesnt have a problem being parentified like this there is nothing you can do but accept and support his desired role in the family
this is not meticulous this is also not nearly as complicated or difficult as youd like to pretend

you dont want to do it thats real simple 

youre stalling youre stalling because youre basically comfortable with how things are currently and youre waiting for her to be miserable enough to end it and accept that you have no actual intention of living with her 

its not okay its not decisionmaking youre describing its been ten years youre firmly in place of refusing to make a decision
youll excuse me for being so clear about it but

stop being a cowardly selfish little shit and end it

this is ldr is working for you but not for her it shouldnt be a battle she shouldnt be begging you it shouldnt be years of indecisiveness stop stalling she ought to dump you but you also ought to acknowledge the reality and ump her 

end this because you acknowledge you are not offering her what she keeps on telling you she needs and there is really no sign that is going to change at any point
then talk to her about what shes looking for and stop being a beligirant ass about it

the way you describe handling the above is a really good way to find yourself shocked when your gf leaves you because she never even said anything she came looking to connect with you and share time and you shut her down and shut her out and basically told her to shove it

thats not gonna get you anywhere except eventually youll have all the time in the world for your hobbies cause shell give up trying to reach you
take some initiative make a plan and spend some actual time with your gf

stop imagining that all the time youre not playing videos games is time youre spending with her or supporting the relationship chances are rather good that most of your time not playing video games is filled up with normal tasks of living not connecting with her

take on a bit of the mental labour make a plan and spend some damn time together connecting as a couple ask her what makes her feel close and connected with you and do that

your girlfriend told you she was feeling disconnected dont fight about video games and start making declarations like im allowed to have hobbies that is how 12yearold pick fights reconnect with your girlfriend
a millionaire libertarian bemoaning the lack of free libraries and water fountains
what youre saying is that you dont want to live with her

ten years and youre not actually serious about building a life with her in europe you barely enjoy visiting her for a month you dont actually want this except when its only in photos you can pick up or put down whenever its convenient for you

and thats fine but stop stalling 

admit you dont see a path forward you just like what you have let her decide if that is something she is willing to accept it probably isnt and you know that that is why you havent admitted it yet
youre incompatible

its not more complicated than that its not a red flag its just not what you want

its perfectly healthy for men to not want to jump into bed lots of men arent into hooking up

its been a damn week maybe he is seeing other women thats called dating grow up

dont date anyone you dont to

also dont be such an insecure sexist idiot
why would you forgive someone who hasnt acknowledged wrongdoing and has done nothing to display any accountability or growth

talk to him about it this is not resolved until he acknowledges the relationship almost ended and can discuss better ways to handle his stress or crunch time in the future 

if he thinks he did just fine and the problem was only your expectations then you shouldnt forgive and move forward with him
your gf is right set a clear amount between you too it doesnt have to be 50 of her income or even 40 but it needs to be consistent

she is absolutely sensible to want a clear consistent expectation when it comes to her rent obligation shes totally correct that not having a clear number will likely lead to resentment and confusion for you both

i know youre trying to be kind but what your suggestion actually does is make her think about how much she can afford to give you in rent everything single time she buys a coffee or needs to buy new underwear shell be calculating what she can give nearly every day shell recalculate if she forgets to do the laundry one day or may even if you two have a fight about going to visit family so set a number let her work to that number for most people that is the easier way to budge

set a number that seems reasonable for the next year to you both and revisit it in a year or earlier if her income changes drastically
yea in canada the requirements are gender neutral the supreme court of canada has sort of indirectly ruled against sexbased standards for firefighters and put the onus on the employer to show a particular standard is actually necessary for firefighters of any gender to perform their jobs safely 

and woman are less than 5 of firefighters in canada
walk away from him right away

either he actually believes these horrible things about you  in which case you cannot date him

or hes using these accusations as a way to manipulate and shame you in fear forcing you to be constantly proving yourself and validating and comforting him  and that is abusive  in which case you cannot date him

he has told you he will not trust you

he will not treat you with respect

its been just a few weeks and hes telling you straight up how he intends to treat you

get rid of him immediately you deserve someone who can treat you with basic human respect and trust this will get worse if you stay itll get worse fast
you just say nah lets just say goodnight talk tomorrow

and go live your life

it is annoying and inconsiderate  youre right to be upset  but its also human and suggests that youre on the phone together way too much calls shouldnt go on forever they need to have natural ends adults have lives

and this is a problem you may be able to solve yourself by having a life and saying goodnight 

stop waiting or expecting youve noticed the pattern talk about it tell her if she really needs to go youre gonna consider the call done for the night and thats just fine
stop making assumptions about his motivation based on second hang gossip until he crosses the line with your bf there is not enough to report the common friend needs to stop carrying water and courting drama tell this common friend to either keep this shit to himself or bring it to hr its not your problem to solve its just gossip and hes just stressing you out

if you have questions that arent being answered or topics that are not being covered in your training document what you are missing and express your concerns to your trainer in a coherent way this shouldnt be he doesnt tell me how im doing   cause its his job to train you not make you feel good about yourself  it sound look more like i am not confident with x and y tasks and when i have asked for more timefocus on these i have not received any if he doesnt respond to these concerns go above his head with them
you are horrible people

a is a monster youre no better both of you are disgustingly dramaseeking and selfish and your fucking around with ss feelings 

i hope s has the sense to never speak to either of you ever again she was managing her own shit privately nothing you say s actually did was disrespectful to anyone but you going on flirting with her and texting her behind as back sure as shit is disrespectful of them both 

you and your gf tricked her for your own dramatic bullshit reasons you entrapped her for no reason except your own validation and entertainment and youre still texting her now for your own selfish reasons youre shit people be less shit
no one is required to stay in a relationship with you shes not required to talk to you about it or try to work with you

once she wanted out for any reasons she was perfectly entitled to leave

and most sane people wouldnt want to talk to you when you clearly felt 100 entitled to cheat  as long as you were drunk enough  and seem to feel no remorse or regret over any of your choices and are only really upset your ex was stubborn
many consensual cues exist prior to any approach

youve described some of those contextual and situational declines to consent yourself a few times now 

this is not as hard as youre pretending it is and you might want to ask yourself why you feel the need to keep digging this particular hole
we make assumptions and typically that assumption is pleasantries are perfectly fine and make a judgment call after that

yes and those assumptions would fall under situational and contextual cues of consent

you keep on describing your personal ability to read those kinds of clues just fine im not sure what youre confused about do you think i cant read the clues you can do you think consent has to be a verbal declaration or a written agreement for every human interaction

you say you dont want to be argumentative but you seem to be taking a deliberately obtuse position when we do not actually disagree very much at all about how individuals should judge whether or not a person is consenting to conversationinteraction
its never unfair to ask for something that is important to you

youre not allowing or disallowing him youre not gonna tie him up and drag him in so tell him no youre not telling him to do anything he doesnt get to put that on you and make it your job or responsibility to tell him what to do youre not his mommy or his prison warden youre his partner and youre telling him this is important to you

youre asking him to prioritize your desire to have him join you at the event you both agreed to attend its on him to communicate to you if this is a compromise he is capable of making and if it isnt he needs to say so clearly and have to respect it

its okay to be disappointed in him if he chooses not to attend its not your job to be permanently cheerful just because he has a mental health struggle you still get to have feels and its not okay to take on the role of making this choice for him  that is not a fair position for him to put you in and a role you must always reject he is responsible for his needs and his choices
i totally 100 get cultural norms of certain places i am much less likely to speak to a stranger say in a gym or a hospital waiting room than walmart or a park

then you are actually placing a value on the other persons consent to speak with you

what about a person in the candy aisle looking at your favorite stuff or i was at a bar and someone was looking over the menu and i mentioned what i thought was good

some cultures will find this more or less appropriate based on a lot of different factors but in the end if they ignore you or give you nothing but a quick nod you shut up right if so congratulations youve just shown you value consent and will stop engaging another person when you dont receive any signals of it

do i now assume consent because shes working so now its ok because shes paid

yes you do you know thats how that works that is contextually implied consent or situational consent and if she said sorry im on break you would 100 immediately understand she meant she was declining to continue the conversation right consent
there are lots of assholes out there but i disagree that they dont know or are bad at it most of them do know and as a species were actually pretty good at it the vast vast majority of people can successfully read the cues and most abide by them youre gonna remember the 10 who didnt and not the 10000 who did

human beings as a social species wouldnt exist or be nearly as dominant if we couldnt largely read these cues successfully that is why neurodivergent is well divergent most neurotypical people perform this shit on the regular most who dont are acting entitled for some reason but are not confused
i live my life aiming to have received implied or contextual cues of consent from literally every person i interact with for more than a split second because why would i want to force other people to speak to me or accept my approach if they dont want too what benefit do i receive from that the level of consent required for 2 minute chat about the weather isnt the same as the level required for say having anal sex but consent is still in the mix

are you a prison guard because besides having a job with prisoners or infants i cannot imagine saying i dont need consent from each and every human being i ever approach and speak to i want that consent if i dont receive it willingly im going to stop approachingspeaking immediately
yeah just like they would do naturally in literally every situation involving an individual who wasnt a woman they were expressing interest in in literally every other context you can watch the vast vast majority of men judge the vibe just fine
im really sorry youre in this place op but you will be okay in the end you really will youre in the peak stage of grief right now losing your home and your relationship at once and in a particularly shitty way grief is a helluva a drug no way through it except to go through it 

relationships carry this risk youll probably want to take the risk again someday with someone else but maybe you wont and thats okay too itll still get better either way
eh happens to the best of us just turn off reply notifications and give yourself a break this too will pass
there are very reasonable situations in which you should be able to talk to anyone without them being pissed at you

i think the thing many men fail to understand and often are choosing not to understand is that even in those totally reasonable situations to approach someone a woman may get spooked or seem put off for a moment that doesnt mean you did anything wrong or that shes frightened or angry

it probably just means that being approached in public is a generally negative experience for her and she has her guard up its not a personal attack she doesnt owe it to you to fall all over herself with gratitude or friendliness its okay that she has a life experience that has taught her to be careful of men who approach her in public if she was a person you were close to youd probably want her to careful of strange men trying to get her attention in public

so dont be such a damn snowflake cause a stranger you spoke to looked at you in a way that made you feel like anything less than prince charming if you know you did a reasonable thing then its not about you let it be not about you like youd have no problem doing if you handed a man back something he dropped and was a bit curt or something seesh
absolutely the person replying to you knows 100 knows that the examples they are giving are not what you are talking about whatsoever they are just being a little shit they know you know it sane people reading what you both wrote know it do not engage its a transparent attempt at baiting you into a totally different totally stupid debate
youre never gonna reach people who feel this entitled to a strangers time

they act like they dont understand but they do people make choices all the time to leave others alone when there are zero signals of wanting to engage watch men sitting side by side at a sports bar watch a game or male coworkers sitting down in a break room they sus out in seconds who wants to speak and who doesnt

they arent as stupid as they want us to believe

they all know its okay to return something someone dropped or ask the time

these ones just dont want to do the tiny bit of work they do happily every single day with the human beings they see as equals men

when they feel entitled to womens attention and niceness no amount of logic can reach them
s invited you youre invited dont insert yourself into the situation between the two of them by speaking with u or doublechecking about u s invited you youre invited dont go seeking drama 

if youre not able to attend because of the costtimingwhatever tell s youre sorry not to be able to join him on his big day and send them both a nice congratulatory card
change the framing a bit and let him know that you are unhappy  and that you have realized a breakup will happen eventually if he doesnt change his behaviour and choices maybe not tomorrow maybe not next week but it is going to happen you cannot continue on as things are 

do not use the threat of a breakup as a manipulation tactic or a threat just let it be a reality about how you are feeling and what your concerns are
youre not a bad person for having these thoughts

but you need to manage them hes 16 teenagers are by their very nature selfish fuck ups its normal and can even be a totally healthy developmental stage that doesnt make what he did okay but it does mean he should be carrying these labels from your narcissistic ex 16yearolds are not diagnosed with npd or sociopathy by responsible doctors for that very reason 

get yourself some professional help whatever your son situation even if you dont like the adult he becomes youll want to know you were the best parent possible and right now that means getting yourself some support for your own trauma and your patterns
no

obviously not its already running into trouble 

look you and he are entitled to take any risks you both choose to take personally and professionally but youre asking if this is a good idea and you already have some evidence less than a month in that it is probably not a great idea
more context is definitely important

in the end you need to be able to trust and respect your partners choice of friends

that doesnt mean agreeing or also being friends with them yourself but it means respecting the choice is belongs solely to your partner its not your call they get to pick who is their life your call is whether or not youre going to be one of those people yourself 

if your bf is making choices for himself that you cannot tolerate or respect then dont date him
if youre asking this question probably not

the problem here isnt just the sex its the communication he hasnt told you what he values about intimacy or about you he doesnt appear to have considered speaking to a doctor although any reasonable human being could tell youre not happy he hasnt considered change or making any conscious communicated effort with you hes locked you out on this subject even though he is aware its hurting you

thats just not just the sex its not just that aspect that is a carelessness and lack of compassion not just in the sexual intimacy but in the communication about it
why do you care that this friend keeps telling you hes not sexually interested in the way you dress

why have you not told him youre not trying to please him and other heterosexual men males when you dress each morning for your job and that his opinion is as unwelcome as it is unkind

you address this by telling him if he cannot say anything kind he shouldnt say anything at all the lesson most of us first get taught in kindergarten you further address this by no longer letting him stick his wiener in someone he doesnt treat with respect and compassion

hes nearly 40 years old if he needs more than one single clear reminder not to insult the woman hes orgasming with get the fuck rid of him
because you thought youre showing her the paper plan was a good one if henry cavill did that to me and my workplace id still be uncomfortable with it that is shockingly poor judgment and raises skepticism about everything else youve reported here

but also because it sounds like youre a prospective student which means you have fundamentally misunderstood the situation shes a sales professional a financial person at a university who meets with prospective students is performing a sales role youre considering buying a product from her workplace of course shes nice to you just like a woman who sells shoes or coffee would be nice to you
you should not do this this is a bad idea

but since we all know youre going to anyways

do not lie no one enjoys that and it risks appearing creepy and invasive dont show her the paper simply leave her a sealed note addressed to her like a fricking normal person dropping off a damn note

it is better if you are not physically present when she is reading the note that is less pestering and coercive standing in front of her with that message is 100 not okay and its concerning you felt it was 

also dont do this nothing about this question suggests you have excellent judgment and have correctly understood the situation
you reframe it as a break up because that is what hes offering its not secure its not practical its not kind 

your soon to be ex is treating you like a character a secondary character in his story he is expressing to you that youre not filling the role hes assigned as happy and vibrant supporting female cast member one he is declining to consider you as a full human being or even one who might have her own adventures when hes off on his 

the fact this is unequal is the point of it for him hes not framing this as an agreement between equals but as a story where he is the main character and whatever moves his narrative forward is the right thing

if you agree you will be in a slow motion break up for months until you finally admit the intolerable thing is intolerable even if you made it through he would come back to even more convinced of youre not people he is the main character and you are the girlfriend in a few episode arch he will continue to treat you as disposable like any bad writers room would

let it be a break up consider how much contact if any you want with him when he is your ex
at seventeen i would apologize and agree to honour her mothers boundaries  for another year or two 

moms get to be wrong teenagers know this right now the biggest danger to your relationship with your niece is actually your sister cutting you off your niece will understand just fine if the next time it comes up you say look your mother has asked me not to speak so openly with you and for the next few years im going to honour that boundary unless youre in danger or afraid are you nope then do you have any older girlfriends you can ask 

nothing about this conversation suggests your niece was in danger or at risk instead of teaching your niece about sex teach her about being practical and making short term compromises to keep the peace
youre misunderstanding im not saying you should always respond when anyone knocks im saying you should provide as much positive reinforcement as possible when trying to build the desirable behaviour of knocking in someone who is resisting the boundary

most people wont change if from their experience of it honouring the boundary catches them just as much shit as not honouring it and it doesnt matter if that experience is accurate or not

sister isnt likely to think i shouldnt have opened the door because she already doesnt think that shes way more likely to think i knocked twice and it was still a fight so why bothering knocking
its a big spectrum mostly purple pill people seem to imagine they are moderates or neutral when it comes to the red pill  blue pill debate a lot of the same jargon pseudoscience and genderessentialism youll find on red pill forums but with less overt hatred of women mostly ive found it to be good old fashion sexism with a lot of boya will be boys because of evolution and all women are like that because attentionseeking

there is definitely a lot of normal well everyone has challenges and modern life sucks in a lot of ways but its all done in a way that basically accepts the red pill fundamental framing

redpillers would say purple pilled men know the truth but lack the courage to act on it the rest of us normies would probably say purple pillers are being very weird to associate themselves at all with the redblue pill narratives and jargon to embrace the shit science of the red pill or to argue that people like tate have a few good points
in other words he knows how to control himself with others  where there would be consequences for his shitty behaviour  but feels entitled to treat you poorly and doesnt think there should be consequences when he does so 

like a person who has anger issues with their partner but manages to hold down a job without every verbally abusing their boss or coworkers  that person absolutely can help it  they just want to abuse their partner
at least for a little while i think giving her frequent positive reinforcement when she does knock is going to help you establish the boundary and offer her more clarity and fewer excuses when she violates it

i understand it is what it is right now but man this really sucks for her too definitely focus on ending this living situation it just doesnt lend itself to a good dynamic between you two and while she was in the wrong in this case you have to recognize that good behaviour can be harder for everyone to maintain in bad situations and this is a bad situation for everyone everything about this set up suggests there is a hierarchy where you and your husband are more important and get more privileges than she does it really sucks that shes acting out but hell a lot of people would have to express their unhappiness and hurt over this in some way
i dont disagree with you its just that by not responding in that moment op undermined her own boundary and missed an opportunity to reinforce the correct behaviour with a civil response to her sister she wasnt napping or in the middle of something that shouldnt be interrupted according to her she just didnt wanna and she would have been wise to make the effort to reward the behavior she wanted to see even though she didnt wanna talk at that moment 

when it comes to managing family members being effective and giving positive reinforcement for the behaviour you want to see is almost always better in the longterm than being right
sure sister was still in the wrong but op undermined her own boundary by not taking the opportunity to reinforce the correct behaviour the knocking with a civil response 

when it comes to managing family members being smart and effective is almost always better than being technically in the right
your boundaries are reasonable but youre kinda glossing over the fact you and your husband walk through her room every time you need to get to yours and that the ac is in your room that is so inequitable

might not be a great situation for anyone but your sister got the shit end of the stick in this living arrangement im not surprised she feels put on by being asked to abide by your boundaries around a door when it doesnt sound like she has a door and is basically living in the hallway you and your husband use i have a bit more sympathy for someone who is acting like a child when the living situation provides them with the level of privacy wed give a toddler 

also if you ask people to knock you need to not ignore them when they do so you need to provide some positive reinforcement and make it a common practice to reply positively when someone engages in the behaviour you want them too
your exboyfriend is not required to speak with you

its not an excuse for anything he doesnt want to talk to you

he shouldnt want to talk to you he is probably hoping to never see you again youre terrible it was only two weeks and you were totally unhinged and terrible to him 

most people dont want to speak to people who throw things at them and are verbally abusive

you dont get second chances youre not entitled to them you dont even deserve a chance to apologize you just have to be less shitty in the future and accept the consequences for the shitty you were this time
we have much stronger evidence of andrew tates misogyny besides his preferences when it comes to human trafficking victim selection
its one thing to want downtime its another completely to attempt to banish your partner from a shared home

tell him no there are problems to resolve but this isnt a solution this is a toxic and controlling approach youll make plans with friends for a dinner or a movie so he can have some interrupted time with other but you will be sleeping in your own home the home you share 

if he needs to sleep separately he can go see his family not kick you out
young men are being irreparably harmed by patriarchal power structures and compulsory service and thats a good thing because they get rewarded with access to women who will tolerate their ptsd and alcoholism if they dont die young

did i understand that correctly this is the promen position a return to let the powerful old men crush your spirit and body to build their own wealth but hey maybe youll get laid
i would tell my father ive been seeing someone for x length of time and that it is a serious and important relationship for me id tell him that this relationship is my choice and that will need to be respected but that i love him and value his opinions id ask him his thoughts and if he has any questions id be clear im not really asking for his permission or blessing but i am asking him to be an important part of my actual life not just the life hed rather imagine that i have 

if he is disappointed or angry those responses arent going to go away the longer you wait they are going to fester and become more engrained and extreme the sooner you act like a young adult making a valid young adult choice the sooner he will be able to accept that reality
i didnt say difficult i said untenable that means intolerable unbearable not able to be maintained you dont just need to empathize with that empathy is not a sufficient addressing of the real issue here you need to respect that reality and realize you are approaching what may be a dealbreaker if you cannot change on a timeline he finds tolerable 

youre being extremely naive to believe your father will not experience your current behaviour as dishonesty the longer you avoid this  and you are absolutely avoiding this not managing it  the more anxiety and distrust you are generating all around most people in your fathers position will be less inclined to trust and respect your judgment if they feel they have been misled iced out or otherwise played for the fool
i understand why you made the call you did at 6 am

but the situation is becoming untenable for your bf and that is reasonable 

you need to speak with your father this isnt going to get easier the longer you leave it its only going to further damage your relationships with everyone involved 

youre not respecting anyones traditions by lying the balance you have right now is not the right balance
you need legal advice at this point

this isnt a relationship question anymore its a question of when you can legally require him to vacate and what steps you need to take to enforce the agreement that you are keeping the house and he is leaving it
thats not just a lack of emotional support that is a lack of basic consideration for another human being thats not just not showing up as a partner hes not even showing up as a friend 

my workfriends show me more compassion than your partner shows you
this is not likely to be solved by suggestions and boundaries

hes doing what works for him this isnt an accident this is the relationship he wants to be in and how he wants it to work 

which means the solution is leaving him not being in the relationship he wants with him

regardless of what you choose get some therapy and support to work on your trauma and peoplepleasing ways so you dont get trapped in one of these dynamics in the future this will not be as simple as coming up with one or two boundaries itll be a longterm challenge and youll need some ongoing advice and support
i am partially to be credited for the fact that he will soon be in line for a promotion to a leadership role i want nothing but good things for him

then youre not really working as equals are you

you need to nip this in the bud you shouldnt be entertaining his inappropriate behavior or your own irrational fantasies
you do nothing you take a step back from a man who is not romantically or emotionally stable is currently in a relationship is terribly oversharing in the workplace who is a pretty direct danger to your promotion and paycheque and who you have an inappropriate level of authority and influence over in the workplace 

im sorry but really give your head a shake and quit this fantasy life and justificationseeking 

this is a tremendous risk youre workshopping inside your brain for someone who is objectively a huge risk to you personally and professionally even though he still currently has a girlfriend

you need to take a huge step back youve crossed lines inside your own head that shouldnt be crossed certainly not at this point

get a hobby or a tinder profile and leave this dramafest alone
you managed your anger here very poorly

dont matter if it was valid anger you handled it poorly

p may also be a racist shithead your bf also should have communicated with you about the planned visit you probably should be broken up

but despite your neutral language your own poor choices still come through clearly

texting p directly was shitstirring and dramaseeking behaviour the problem was with your bfs communication with you not with her texting her wasnt going to resolve it texting her as a guest of your bf behind his back was obviously counterproductive and just about as disrespectful of him as him not telling you she was coming if you dont want a relationship with her for the love of god dont text her passiveaggressive boundaries you know are only going to cause more drama and throwing things in anger is never acceptable behaviour ever full stop

that doesnt mean your reasons for the breakup werent valid but it does mean you need to do better than this with someone better
youre right it would be absolutely horrible to go through this 

a random nonsense comment from your seven year child who either misunderstood or is looking to get a rise out of you is not the basis for a paternity test
you said youd walk so walk

youre making this way more complicated than you need too stop enjoying the drama and sleuthing its just letting yourself be dragged down 

you know the outcome so go face the outcome with as much dignity and decency as you can
boundaries require personal reflection and context we cannot give you a list of what you personally need to feel secure and happy in this relationship besides the big one obvious ones from kindergarten like dont punch people you just have to do that work 

if there are particular areas you need specific advice ask for that
you dont make him see

you tell him he is expected to behave with respect and that his negativity towards a pet is deeply concerning behaviour you will not be tolerating

a persons jealousy of a pet is a major red flag

you should be seriously questioning if this man helped you with boundaries with your friends or family or if he simply isolated you from people who actually care for you so he could control you more efficiently

in regards to the cat as others have said a rotation of toys would probably be a good thing to try youll spend a bit less and you may learn a bit more about what she really likes the most if you dont keep the newness factor dialled up to 100 all the time
its easy for things to start feeling like attacks when they dont need to be but be wary of someone who decides to treat everything like an attack because they want that excuse to ignore you 

its not unreasonable to ask a grown man to mind his ps and qs
you know the answer please consider this one more internet random telling you what you already know perfectly well this man is not reliable and will cheat on you if he hasnt already
id like you to say hello please and thank you to service staff when were out together its making me uncomfortable and embarrassed to be near you when you treat them so impolitely

this isnt a conversation about how you two were raised this is a conversation about what you need in a relationship to feel happy and secure and respected 

he should be sorry to embarrass you and make you and the staff uncomfortable the correct response to that childishness bullshit whinging is thank you im glad you care about my feelings here is the easy fix and the expectation moving forward
nope thats the assumption youre making about his motivation 

he didnt say he didnt bring it up because it wasnt important or he didnt even think of it he claimed he lied to her to protect her
he wants a maid and a chef and porn star who can never choose to service anyone but him but not one he has to pay he wants all that service in exchange for his lovely company i guess because of course he wouldnt date a lazy women who doesnt work
the pattern here is his resentment
yes not dating her would have been a valid choice for him

continuing to attack her for years about this whenever he gets pissed off aboth something else is absolutely not a valid choice

something being kinda difficult doesnt justify whatever other behaviour someone engages in this guy is not behaving in a way op is required to find acceptable she does not need to go on choosing him and if she is going too she can absolutely be clear about what treatment she is willing to accept moving forward
you mean another situation where he found an excuse to wield those insecurities like weapons and we know he will continue to do so each time hes pissed with her about something else for years

thats a hard pass from me

ops bf shouldnt continue to date her if he couldnt moderate his emotions better than this and op shouldnt date him if he doesnt commit to and begin to moderate his emotions better than this
sex five years ago isnt the least bit important to me

having it withheld from me when the past partner is currently in both of our lives because my partner thought i have the emotional skills of a jealous 12 year old would be very important
this woman is currently in both of their lives and the connection has been growing

it shouldnt have been omitted

that is not an exhaustive reckoning that is relevant today

and i dont know where youre getting he didnt disparage her cause he clearly did more than just once including the part where he decided for her that basic truths would just be too distressing for her to handle
if someone is still currently an important and valuable friend in your life you should be willing to provide your partner with the basic context for that including a past sexual relationship 

thats not an entire dossier thats just not purposefully leaving your partner in the dark about current realities and relationships
lies of omission are lies

and while op may be unhappy now she didnt tell him years ago please never tell me if youve had sex with your friends i dont want to know without that explicit rule in place he absolutely should have done so that is how a reasonable respectful person behaves her feelings of discomfort now dont validate his past treatment of her

he treated her like a child who couldnt handle it and worse he made that treatment public he cast her as an immature fool who cannot handle basic reality in front of his close friends and created the risk of even greater confusion and embarrassment for her

this should have been discussed and addressed a long time ago with respect and transparency he didnt do that it should have been a nonissue a thing you talk about and move past easily he made it an issue when it didnt have to be by treating op this way he done fucked up and now its worse than it needed to be
youre not

if youre willing to look past this behavior you need to be clear with him

it is not acceptable for him to try to protect you or manage you by lying to you

youre not a child who needs to be protected from pg13 content youre an adult worthy of respect and honesty and youre his partner not his child if something upsets you that is valid and it is something you and he may need to address if he continues to lie to you because he thinks youre too sensitive this relationship will not and should not survive

do not date someone who trying to manage you by lying to you or withholding information you both know damn well youd prefer to have
this scenario comes up sporadically when hes mad at me

so hes still punishing you for something you didnt do wrong two years ago and now hes inventing new things to punish you for from your miami trip that you also didnt do

yuck
the way you addressed only one very specific part of what i said to you leaves me suspecting you have an ongoing issue of not addressing your partners bids for connection and quality time with any real empathy

you know you were right to stand up for your needs here and shes allowed to be disappointed or annoyed but how you describe communicating here leaves a lot of room for improvement and empathy from you both
your gf experienced this as a personal rejection and nothing you did to express yourself softened that blow 

it was right to stick up for your needs thats not unreasonable but if the tone of this question is the tone you used to express those needs to your gf im not surprised communication went downhill this tone is very harsh and unkind 

do you regularly end up in these sorts of conflicts did you consider another way to spend some focused time together in the shortterm not just kicking it back one or two weeks 

your gf made a bid for connection and attention and while your desires for down time it totally reasonable your headed down a bad path here with how you express yourself
so much this i feel like this is one of those spots where you can tell this show is being made through a lens of a lot of hetero producers for a largely straight audience from that perspective vanessa is the hot commodity the kind of exciting extroverted fem pansexual that many straight men idolize but in queer circles the vanessas are relatively common and people like natasha and xander are the oneinamillion catch of a lifetime
choosing a tactic is showing intent aussie has shown some very very clear tactics 

she might not be fully conscious or willfully doing harm it might not be malicious but it absolutely tactical these are tactics of emotional abuse and control that aussie has used to get her way

i get not wanting to label the person but we can label the actions just fine the actions are abuse
this is some petty ass shit stop stewing 

she doesnt have to be your bestie its okay if she doesnt like you much that is for your ex to address if it ever needs addressing but there is nothing here that suggests it does 

as long as your childrens needs are met when they are with their father let it go
you know

you know he used access to a former clients personal information at his workplace to drop by her private home you know thats an offence that should probably get a person fired

hes not a poor little confused child he is a damn adult and he knows he knows that you know he knows thats not nice you know its not nice hes not a nice guy 

hes lying to you youll never know the full truth but the truth you do know means at least this his judgement is terrible he cannot be trusted as a safe partner this isnt a person you can built a life with the best case scenario here is that he is so stupid thats he cannot be relied on to stay employed thats the best case
there are definitely more than 102 signs
this mildred is imperfect and has some work to do but i take her tendency to interrupt and confront over passive aggression and weaponizing triggers any day 

we saw two totally different approaches to managing aussie and i think neither of them worked but mildreds not worked faster thats a win in my book
this is abusive feederism fetishes frequently are this is one of those fetishes that many people do not engage with ethically this is abuse 

im amazingly frighteningly kinkpositive to a degree that would make most people squirm but id avoid someone who embraced active and frequent feederism in real life the chances of them engaging with it in respectful consensual and safe ways are just kinda slim 

feederism is rarely about bodypositivity almost always about exerting control limiting the larger persons ability to move and act independently its about phsyical dependence and societal rejection you want to move better and feel better in your own body that is probably in direct opposition to what he finds sexually exciting he most likely wants you to be restricted and limited by your size 

he has told you and shown you that he really will not tolerate any movement towards body independence and that is abusive 

he may also have trauma but this is not trauma this is him seeking an abusive degree of control over you and calling it kink he is not behaving ethically you do not need to protect his feelings you need to tell him hes entirely out of line and if he cannot cope with that he needs to get his ass to a therapist to relearn some of the basics about respect and consent
shes still enmeshed with her abuser

two to three times a week is excessive she knows it he knows it you know it 

shes not emotionally available for a new relationship at this point do with that what you will
you dont have to be friends with anyone you dont want to be friends with

stop trying to read her mind or invent reasons for her actions youll never really know just be honest if it situation isnt working and if youd like to end it you dont need to assumptions about her motivations what you know about her actions is plenty enough to inform a decision
its a large gap it would be extremely naive to assume it wouldnt cause issues

thats not about socially acceptable and it has nothing to do with your appearance it has to do with practical matters of life stages relative power to make choices and take important life steps and compatible short and longterm goals

you dont need to take everyones opinion to heart but you do need to realize they are not being insane people who care for you are going to be concerned for you at a glance there are some valid concerns here

you might feel you just fell into this relationship naturally but i assure you that people who are 40 dont accidentally date people 12 years younger than them women who are over 40 know this about men over 40 and not cause they are bitter  its just cause they were 20somethings once too and they have eyes attached to brains which can notice patterns older people who accept or seek out age gaps like this have made a choice and there are often  not always but very often  problematic motivations for that choice
you say no

you just say no that isnt healthy for me im sorry it makes you sad but i cannot compromise on this this is my health and i need to take it seriously i need you to respect that

she has a wish you have a physical health need a need trumps a wish that is how healthy compromises are supposed to work between people who care for one another

book one or two meals a week that are together and offer to cook for you both at those times but be clear she is choosing her feelings over your health and you cannot agree to that you cannot keep yourself physically sick to make her feel happier every day thats fucked up you need her to manage her feelings so you are free to manage your diet you need that in a partner right now and that is valid if she cannot manage that for you then shes not being a very good partner right now and frankly she should speak to a counsellor about how to manage those feelings herself they are not rational fair or kind

id be seriously concerned if i were you that your partner is trying to sabotage your health plans
yeah its best not to listen too closely to someones reasons for not being interested most people dont really know what they want they are most often bullshit they are just saying to protect their own ego or avoid responsibilityaccountability  

please recognize you might have saved yourself a bit of suffering if youd had that tough conversation a few weeks earlier before the hookups became a bad habit
thats understandable youve got some work to unpack that bullshit

you and this particular guy may not be compatible  its been a few months and most people arent  but if that turns out to be the case its probably not because of his education level

you need to stop giving in to your familys bad habit of attributing everything about a person to the letters behind their name dont frame it that way thnk about behaviours and choices and your own actual feelings about your relationship 

hell to be entirely honest i now avoid dating phds unless they can take the shit outta themselves and the whole academic pyramid scheme i have some great friends who are tenured but know far more professors id never want to have to share a meal with
dont try to make friends on dating apps the risk of exactly this sort of confusion is high 

after a few months of dating one or both people will decide it isnt really working 

that is totally normal 

most people you ever date will fizzle out in about that timeframe thats dating thats life 

he just wasnt that interested it was rather immature of him to try to make it your fault but its okay for him to not be interested

if he was interested he would have done the work to communicate and alter the way he saw the connection he didnt because he wasnt 

you didnt do anything terribly wrong you were honest he probably was largely honest as well but also a bit cowardly and immature about it and unwilling to just speak to his own wishesneeds without finding a way to try to turn it around you its unlikely he actively set out to use you just set out to do what felt good for him
its three months in and youre already worried that youre currently bored by him

quite honestly you sound a bit immature and hopefully youll grow and realize that being an academic or having an advanced degree doesnt make you a good conversationalist or even a particularly smart person those are utterly separate skill sets from what makes a successful academic

some real numbskulls can plow through a phd defence and they do being an academic means being a highlyfocused and specialized learner on a very narrow subject its an amazing and laudable skill that is necessary to advance human society but it often makes for shitty condescending conversationalists who think being really informed about one subject means they have any brains at all when it comes to others

this right now is a question of compatibility and respect its three months in and you lack some important respect and you are questioning your compatibility those are concerns worth listening to about this specific individual even if your generalizations about academia and advanced degrees are off the mark
if this is a core belief for you youd be wise to build your life around it

move to a highly religious area throw your time and effort and energy into that religious community or church 

frankly it sounds like you have set yourself up for isolation and disappointment and will reject any advice that might move you out of that sort of space but the only reasonable advice to give you is to tell you that even if you choose to never have sex and you are absolutely choosing that its not been forced on you in any way you do need community and purpose youd be wise to go find that community in a highly religious environment that respects your choices regarding interactions with men
it doesnt sound like youre safe at home with your husband right now

this would be a situation where id take the baby and ask if my parents would take us in give him some very clear instructions about when and how he is able to visit ie in a few days for a few hours only while sober decline to speak to him privately until you feel prepared to do so do not let him rush you or pressure you stay where you feel safe 

your priority right now is the physical safety of you and your newborn you are not physically safe with someone who is treating you that way be very careful get some physical distance be clear with your husband the standards of behaviour that are expected and dont budge dont accept less than what that child deserves and that child deserve a mother who is safe and respected as well
id dump you for that

that is a massive violation

your gf heard you out and listened to your opinion and she told you shed reinforce boundaries the next time they were crossed she told you directly not to get involved and then you did anyways that was a breach of he trust and it was also degrading and demeaning and embarrassing her friend friends probably by now not just him now all know that she has a controlling and suspicious boyfriend who doesnt trust her and goes behind her back to treat her like a badly behaving sixyearold id be so offended and ashamed if my partner did that i dont think id continue with them

the first thing you do is admit you were 100 in the wrong here its fine to be concerned and ask questions of her but it was 100 wrong to contact him behind her back and against her wishes you apologize for not respecting her trusting her and for doing precisely what she clearly told you not to do

if you really dont trust her dont date her but never pull this shit again
youd be wise to speak to a therapist or counsellor especially one with a family practice and consider what kind of role you want to have in the childrens lives that is going to depend a lot on their ages as well as their individual personalities and it also needs to include what kind of contact with your ex is possible and healthy for you

i think maintaining some longterm committed cool uncle status would be admirable and probably bring some stability to the kids lives continuing to be dad in any real way would be more likely to be confusing or even dishonest the relationship needs to be downgraded but id hope youd be willing not to end it completely if the children value occasional but predictable and reliable contact with you
say no

he cannot afford it you cannot afford it together the answer is no

if you say yes you will be married by mortgage this is way more serious than walking down the aisle so if youre not ready to do that you absolutely should not be doing this

this is a stupid risk you are not supporting him in this for the same reason you wouldnt support him if he wanted to go hang gliding on a frame made of silly putty 

keeping an open mind doesnt mean letting your brain fall right out 

he can either find a way to buybuilt equity with his 240k or he can wait until you both are prepared for this step
tell her that you are concerned about remaining in a relationship where your gf calls you a liar and refuses to trust you or respect you when you tell her something important about how you feel

its okay to ask for reassurance at times we all need that from our partners but the way she is seeking reassurance from you is not respectful or kind she needs to find other ways to ask for whatever it is she needs and she has to respect your answers when you give them 

youre not being unreasonable do not stay in a relationship with someone who is constantly accusing you of lying to them
we both knew that was the outcome no matter what i did but it is pretty funny isnt it

x200b

she says over the last few decades more and more women have found that partnering with men is not a good deal for them and costs them more in effort money or overall happiness than remaining single the data backs it up and it is a much more clear and longerterm trend than mgtow or the rise of the manosphere

he says prove it

she says i have judged this not to be worth that additional labour from me but good luck in your research here are a few pointers the data is out there and i am confident in my understanding of it

he says i just knew she was full of shit
i dont believe you

if id have believed you were sincere i would have cited my sources but i actively choose not to do that labor based on how you decided to respond to those who did 

an honest bit of googling is your friend if you are sincere about looking into the comparative happiness health or wealth of single and partnered people woman and men the apps dont love to give current data on the decreasing number of woman users because it undermines their marketing case to men but it can be found especially if you search for impacts of the overturn of roe vs wade on these apps if you are sincere about putting forth that effort i wish you luck but i have a job that pays me to do this sort of work and im disinclined to do it right now here for free
youre repeating propaganda not data

women have been increasingly leaving the dating pool for decades especially women who are divorced widowed or have children whereas men in those situations are more likely to be highly motivated to find a new partner 

dating apps are imperfect places for information but even they are quietly reporting women quiet quitting dating in droves and the women to men ratio on the apps are getting worse and worse  and the normal ratio was already pretty bad 

being partnered is still by in large a better deal for a straight man than a straight women generally speaking men gain support wealth health and happiness and generally speaking women loose those things 

are there men who are giving up on dating sure are in comparable numbers to women no that isnt what decades of data tells us the men who are quitting are just far louder about it and louder about what they feel is wrong about the world that they cannot access sex and service from women because partnership is so much less likely to enrich womens lives sufficiently for them to pay the price men risk dating a bad individual women risk that plus the risk that dating even one of the good ones will still leave them more worn out and more poor than they were before
you and your mother need to manage your anxieties and curiosities coming up with half baked theories online is not a good way to do that

if you want to express support actual support and not just morbid curiosity then do that but your sister ended contact  and its strange and a bit suspicious you just ignore any reasons for that  that needs to be respected
im glad youre getting support 

dont stay in this relationship if its not supporting your health and happiness
you need a therapist not a boyfriend

youve struggled to draw your own personal boundaries with this guy and his questions that was largely behaviour you should have been able to shut down yourself without needing anything but more passive support from your bf and while we all may experience some anxiety when a partners friends doesnt seem to like us the extreme youve found yourself in is not healthy for anyone 

it doesnt seem like this relationship is working for you in some other key ways as well stop martyring yourself and get some treatment for your anxiety so you can handle things better with someone better
keep working with your therapist

dont connect with your ex at all

youre really not being rational about this i understand its hurtful but your best path towards healing doesnt including confronting her or challenging her narrative thats literally the worst thing you can do both for your own sanity and for the risk of escalating bad behaviour
i understand this is really upsetting but you need to realize this was the best possible outcome 

she overplayed her hand with people who knew you well enough to know she was lying nothing was going to stop her from doing this it was actually pretty predictable if youre totally honest with yourself and neither you or your friends had the power to shut her up shitty people do shitty things and most of those things are totally legal but she didnt receive positive reinforcement for her behaviour thats the best thing that could have happened to discourage her from continuing that game make it boring dont let this game of lies provide any drama or validation or supply there is no other strategy for you 

give your friends some more grace while they may have made mistakes they were probably sincerely trying to protect you from information you couldnt handle in a healthy way  and they werent wrong even now youre struggling to manage this information practically keep up with the therapy and if you need boundaries with your friends when it comes to your ex ask for those boundaries clearly
im concerned what you think putting yourself out there entails that it will inevitably lead to accusations of criminal behaviour
this is not about looking human beings notice other human beings bodies that is not what hes up too 

your bf is taking steps to cheat on you thats not a guy thing thats a cheater thing hes trying to coerce you into accepting him having sexual contact or just straight up sex with others 

get rid of him 

shopping for sex workers has nothing to do with checking out attractive people at the beach or gym that like arguing that everyone snores in their sleep and you have to learn to put up with it and then punching you a few times while youre asleep and saying its totally the same thing and you should just put up with it its not the same thing
i am sorry i misunderstood that being a conversation in front of him but seriously you still have to start with an apology 

drop it doesnt mean go have a deep heartfelt discussion with my dad which includes the private conversations taking place in our marriage where we both know you think im wrong 

you can disagree with your wife privately but you cannot talk about her behind her back especially not with a parent and expect her to feel okay about it no matter how wrong she is that choice from you is going to damage your marriage
the first thing you do is stop taking sides stop scolding her and stop telling her what she owes her wonderful father she currently does not wish to revisit the topic it would be sensible and respectful for everyone to accept that for the next 48 hours 

she asked you to stay out of it and you immediately turned around and told her father exactly what you had said to her that was absolutely an act of sidetaking and then you come back in and in front of her father insulted her that made you an unsafe person for your wife to come to with vulnerable or fraught feelings 

after the visit begin with an apology you did poorly then you can discuss how you were surprised by the amount of pain and anger she was carrying towards her father  not because shes wrong but because you were ignorant of it and unaware she had those feelings towards him  and suggest she deserves and would benefit from unpacking those feelings with a pro

if she doesnt want too than she doesnt and you let these other adults sort it out your assumptions about how she should feel or behave are not going to be helpful unless your opinion is asked for
what needs to be addressed here

its weirder to me that youre fixating on this as if its a problem then it would be even if your perception was accurate 

shes not vague posting or putting anyone on blast i eat more take out when my partner and i fight if he ever tried to address that id tell him to get bent and order a pizza

if you cannot handle this date someone your own age andor someone with a fundamentally different relationship with social media
it didnt read callous to me

wrong to do it front of the cameras sure but we wouldnt have reality tv at all without that error in judgment

my dad would give me that kind of straight talk and i love him for it he calls me on my shit and as i grow up i call him on his
the layers to her is that she isnt actually a very smart or clever manipulator shes tossing wet noddles at the wall to see what sticks shell grovel one day and be back to fuck off the next there is only what she wants in the moment 

we assume people like vanessa are brilliant and machiavellian and making dastardly moves looking ten steps ahead shes not she reactive and performative shes willful not intelligent i can empathize with her when she is hurt but it doesnt change the fact that everyone on this show or watching this show has been given plenty of reasons to just not engage with her

sometimes when you treat an entire group of people as poorly as vanessa has treated so many of the people in this group you dont get to come back from it youre not entitled to a second chance sometimes youre just out if it werent for the show everyone except maybe xander would cut her out for good and thatd be valid imo
this this is my only read i feel like im in the twilight zone reading the op 

xander screams baby gay to me shes immature because yes lots of people who come out later in life are missing some core relationships skills and go through a second adolescence but xander is inexperienced not malicious 

vanessa is terrifying and its not the fucking edit its 9 sentences out of 10 that come from her mouth scream abuser
internalized misogyny is a beast 

some women being shitty to other women means women are human not that shitty men are correct about all women
your friend is deeply emotionally immature this kind of toxic dynamic was always a risk and you cannot fix him 

tell him whatever the fuck youd like about your concerns but dont lie to yourself your friend is nearly 40 and hes picking this hes that kinda guy

the only thing you can really speak to is the boundaries you want in the shared space steve is gonna need to figure this out on his own
men know other men are dangerous

most men think other men should be dangerous or are incapable of not being dangerous 

and then blame woman for acting on this knowledge and choosing any strategy for safety that doesnt include having sex with him
like even if this was remotely true wouldnt the obvious issue be that wealthy and affluent man are hoarding 70 of young woman

and yet you want to return to a strict patriarchy where wealthy and affluent men would have the full power of the state backing them up as they hoard access to women

if you want women to be a commodity an object or a slave you whiners end up not being able to afford one either that or youre a commie
it seems there are much more serious problems here if you think this is how you need to be compensated for sticking by him and are feeling this insecure about how much he values you

i think you should both talk more openly about other expenses and savings goals and if youre going into this marriage with a now you owe me attitude that is something to resolve with a counsellor first that is gonna suck for you both

want what you want have your preferences it is your reasons here that are concerning
even if he wants to keep this friendship its the boys who need to be doing the damn work at this point i dont know why op is so set on managing them as if they are kindergarteners in her classroom
youve asked this before and the response remains the same

you cant fix it

its not yours to fix

 this is who this best friend is its your bfs job to address it at this point declining invitations is one way to address it

and as long as your bf keeps this person in his life this is a pattern that is likely to repeat from time to time 

stop taking so much on yourself youve apologized youre open to being around them thats all the fixing you can do you cannot control other people
the 1987 survey of youth in custody found that 70 did not grow up with both parents 

internationally there is no question that children raised in single parent homes are more likely to offend but so are children raised with stepparents or with exposure to violent neighbourhood crime 

this is just scapegoating women who parent and the fact he takes aim at the more educated ones is particularly absurd 

like you said this is about poverty not the bad woman who decided poverty was better than partnership or had the misfortune of having a child with a man who choose to walk away
he gets so close to realizing poverty is the problem and that toxic masculinity is behind a hell of a lot of these single mothers 

so close its right there ready to bite him but he cannot manage it must be the womens fault the educated ones who actively choose separation whose usually equally affluent partners are actually most likely to remain present coparents to some degree the ones whose children are least likely to experience poverty and the risks associated with lower socioeconomic status

its their fault not the men who walked away from women who who were much less well equipped to survive not the men who made poverty look that much better than marriage never the men
i have not yet met the woman who confuses herself with a small number of bird species
so he uses irrational emotional outbursts to silence your legitimate concerns and uses one long ago mistake you made to justify his ongoing poor treatment of you

yeah op youre being emotionally abused
the three things you describe there are the very positive characteristics of my brother 

he is 17
this isnt entitlement to money

this is entitlement to respect and transparency

respect would have been a transparent conversation early on at the very beginning offering clarity that this was a shared plan not a gift and that the expectation was they would split expenses

respect is not one person especially not the much higher earner declaring that all things shall be 5050 henceforth after the plans are already set in motion

he didnt request financial equity

he tried to enforce it over 100 so he can feel justified when he enforces it next time on 10000 again without any transparent and respectful conversation he tried to coerce her into an agreement he could lean on in the future as an absolute he tried to bully her into proving she was a not a golddigger but we all know hes probably going to keep treating her as if she is one even if she pays up not okay
 or at least ask his partners budget before picking a hotel for a trip he suggested

exactly this

this guy is treating op like a golddigger and choosing to test her over 100 

op has 100 understood the situation correctly and should simply decline to go further with someone who is functioning on the assumption shes using him for his money nothing she does will ever prove otherwise to the sort of man who would test like this instead of talking about at the very beginning of the planning like an actual adult
its not about the money or even the income

its about someone declaring the only fair way to split costs is 5050

no discussion no invitation no question of the budget prior to the plans going forward just the presentation of a bill two months in this is unacceptable this is not best behaviour

i prefer to split things 5050 generally speaking but i will not date a person who declares it the only possible way to operate especially not if there is a large discrepancy in resources i have been in situations before with higherearner partners who pressured me to keep up with spending because it was only fair i have also been the higher earner so i have always been extremely clear with what is a gift and what is an expectation at the very beginning of any plans otherwise its not fair it is not kind its not a respectful way to discuss expenses and i dont want to be in a relationship that involves this sort of nickelanddiming ive been there it sucks

it is a small bill today because it is a test its a test to see if he can pressure her into paying without a transparent and respectful conversation about budget or expectations

hes trying to create an agreement that 5050 is the only way to go so he can enforce that in the future its not an okay way in my book to approach this conversation even if splitting this particular expense makes total sense 

hes testing op is a really shitty way and op should feel free to fail and look for someone who communicates transparently and respectfully this guy has communicated that he will probably always view her as a golddigger no matter how she behaves get rid of him
i wouldnt date someone who made 5x what i did and felt that 5050 was the only fair way to handle costs that is going to lead to complete financial ruin for the lowerearner partner 

you know hes testing you 

you know hes the one who just failed 

dont get into a debate with him just let him know youve decided against continuing with him block him when he doesnt exhibit grace and respect
you walk away

shes been very clear you need to respect it

you learn to manage your own emotions and stop trying to take ownershipsave her from hers 

minimize your contact with herthe group until you are able to behave with respect
someone has sent me a video of you during a party and now im really concerned about your safety with the people you hang out with i need to ask you some questions so i can know youre safe now

id say that id have to

it seems very obvious to me that whoever sent you this video intended to shame your bf and bully him further the first thing you need to do is be clear it did not work your concern needs to be for his safety and your clear communication needs to be that nothing he does no matter how drunk he gets validates or excuses people treating him this way

do not be the tool of his bullies be clear that his safety from abusers is your only concern if he says he is stays the fuck away from those people tell him youre glad and youre proud of him ask if he wants to talk about it any further dont demand the only answer you need is that he is currently safe from danger and abuse
if its selfimposed then its not a ruleagreement with your partner its a personal choice you would make for yourself with any partner 

but to be entirely honest as a bisexual woman id still probably avoid getting too deeply involved even if you swore up and down it was entirely personal and your partner didnt even care because it just reflects that common attitude that sex between women isnt real sex

youre entitled to a personal choice other people can have personal feelings about that choice
consigned 

as a bisexual woman this implies to me that any sex and connection im having with the woman is lesser than purely on the basis of my gendergenitals 

a personal choice is fine and all  i have lived much of my adult life with only one penis but it was never a policy it was just who was in the mix at the time  and we cannot pretend these sorts of attitudes towards sex that doesnt involve a penis exist in a magic little bubble they exist in a context that id rather not operate in
no the mother would likely need to be extremely illmalnourished to begin with in order to end a pregnancy this way with any reliability

two weeks of deprivation would be totally insufficient for most reasonably healthy adult women
young wolves become way more vocal yipping and growling in ways that dont appear to be very communicative when the rest of the pack is ostracizing them for poor social graces or bullying behaviours

but human beings arent wolves either
okay that explains the problem more clearly but you still need to stop trying to solve it for him

tell him the actual problem for you hes shown you a plan but that plan is not happening you are paying for him but he is not being honest or accountable to you hes loosing your trust and your respect

stop trying to tell him how to solve it and trying to fix it for him put it back on him hes damaging the relationship being dishonest with you and being dependant on you financially its not acceptable its going to end the relationship maybe not tomorrow but eventually you will be happier and healthier without him so you choose that any sane person would

dont tell him exactly how to fix it remind him youve given him plenty of suggestions and you now expect him to fix this problem not continue to make it yours 

if that direct talk about consequences and boundaries does not get get him moving on this within a few days start planning to be rid of him if the problem is him and hes choosing to keep those problems and make them yours too then you have to solve your real problem by getting rid of him
hes told you he doesnt want help hes shown you his plan you can disagree but if he had a plan and hes working it you need to stop pressuring him to make a better one its his plan 

and he may be right about what the limits of the charitycouncil powers are and its not your business in the least if he doesnt want to ask his parents for help  

if hes paying his obligations to the shared home then you need to let him carry his personal burden the way he chooses too and speak for yourself speaking for yourself can look like i dont have the bandwidth the listen to these complaintsstress right now or even i find it hurtful you continue to complain at me but will not entertain any of the suggestions ive given you at all speak for your own feelings stop trying to fix the situation for him its his

if hes not paying his agreed on share of your shared home then you need to consider that this isnt a safe person for you to live with because he expects you to carry his burdens without having to listen to you or consider your feelings or perspectives at all
this it makes me so mad when kids are taught this was the highest of high art and was inaccessible or highbrow rj literally opens with a bunch of teenage buddies making a rape joke a rape pun but so many teachers just swan on past that
i was confused at first too then i remembered women are always bad and always to blame
youre probably incompatible this isnt what you want

you can and should bring up the idea of separate bedrooms but its concerning that he doesnt seem to recognize that option
dude the part that made this really bad sex was the part where you made it her job to take care of your feelings afterwards no hook up wants to be your therapist or your coach 

the fact you are continuing to think it would appreciate to try and demand more of her time and attention is unhinged

go watch some educational videos on performing oral sex and with the next woman ask her what she likes and make sure she orgasms before your penis gets involved 

leave this woman alone as she has clearly told you too

you are not owed any amount of chances she is owed the basic respect of you not contacting her anymore 

dont be a creepy demanding child if you showed up at my house in this situation id call the cops and let them explain to you that i will not be speaking with your further
nothing but me man me use big tool go vroom

statistically women are safer drivers by every metric on a average women are just as capable as men of spacial reasoning but they dont overrate their skills by as much take fewer risks and can more accurately assess the risks women ding cars and crack fenders men kill people 

from a pure probability pov if you want to live let a woman drive
if you dont want to be in an open relationship its time to leave this one because that is the best case scenario the best case scenario is that he wants a transparent and ethical open relationship from there it only get worse 

dont get stressed out just admit you want monogamy just monogamy nothing else if he doesnt agree fully and directly in language you can rely on let it be over
your bf just put you in the be my pretty lady not a human being box 

it would be slightly different if he had simply said hed prefer you not fart around him when it was avoidable  and because we are human he knows it is not perfectly avoidable  as just a personal preference the fact he connected it to being ladylike is gross and demeaning and very very stupid
its funny they think rich men werent hoarding women before

you know its just that less of you plebeians die young right most of you were not gonna be landed gentry you were not going to be assigned a buxom teenager you were not likely to be master or meritorious in 1020 or 1620 or 1820 either   

youre just angry you dont have a woman an assigned woman you can punch down at no matter how low you are
i always wonder if they think small children in guatemala are just failing to manifest food and clean drinking water like if systemic issues dont exist then there are entire nations causing famine with all their negative self talk
fit of rage is a phrase which should only ever be associated with an ex 

you dont have to be perfect to deserve not to be absurd that is a lie abusers love to tell to keep you trapped
thank you for explaining why this might be a deterrent it seemed like a very easy hoop to jump through to me for someone with malicious intent who wanted to create a false sense of security
i am opposed to engaging with people who exhibit a behaviour i have found to be directly connected with negatively resentment and even other controlling behaviours

also i am woman who largely but not exclusively dates men  

in my experience men who start off with this demand quickly have other demands and accusations 

i have strategies to keep myself safe this is not one of them

exactly the opposite i guess my strategy is too avoid men who exhibit a behaviour that doesnt make me feel safe and respected
your husband turned you into his private porn star without telling you about it he felt entitled to doing so without your formal consent and is now demanding a formal request they be deleted

i doubt your husband is a compete fucking moron he was aware or should have reasonably assumed that you believed the videos were deleted and that is what you wanted he should not have felt entitled to them in this way and trying to make you the bad guy who demands he give up something he never should have taken without explicit permission is revolting

you are underreacting 

it feels like an invasion because it was 

tell him to delete them 

tell him he fucked up royally by behaving entitled to these videos without a transparent conversation at very least you should express deep disappointment with his judgment
hes 32

hes not confused about pets he doesnt need it explained to him this is who he wants to be the asshole who treats your dog poorly and enjoys its fear 

he sees you only as a servant to his future baby not as a person balancing her loves and needs 

and people who are jealous of pet are often jealous of babies as well 

dont keep such an open mind your brain falls right out this is exactly what it looks like
if trust is broken dont date her

testing her is just demeaning yourself in a shitty relationship that already isnt working

you were manipulative you were toxic you decided to stay in a relationship you shouldnt have and used that as excuse to practice being a bad person
i dont understand how this strategy is protecting someone from a trafficker the trafficker is usually real local people arent they it doesnt seem like it would have helped the victim in that article
youre mistaking consequences for cant do it

you absolutely can break a contract and if it was a legal one there might be consequences for doing so 

but scientology cannot enforce their a billionyear contract in court and you cannot use the law to force your partner back into the marital home or bed if they dont want to be there
yeah im fine with that youd be unmatched not an issue for me what reason a person concocts at that point
yeah ask for a facetime first and okay but ask me to buy todays newspaper or make some weird hand signs often within the first day of matching just gtfo

i used to do it without fail these people were all bitter resentful and a bit controlling
he knows how you feel he doesnt care he feels entitled to placing this pressure on you he thinks you should preform this way for him

youre incompatible

and hes a bully

dont stay with him

but since youre going to anyways say this comments about my femininity skirts and makeup need to stop youve cross the line from expressing a preference to being really hurtful if you care about not hurting me you will stop if you care more about what i wear then how i feel we will break up maybe not tomorrow maybe not right away but itll happen if you dont stop hurting me
this it has to be really extreme before i assume they were actively trying to be deceptive im bad at reading photos 

im far more annoyed by men who lie outrageously about their height ive happily dated men who are shorter than me and secure about it dont want to date a person who isnt comfortable in the height difference
i dont know if youre joking but when someone does this to me i immediately unmatch my photos are current and authentic and i use to comply but i have never had a positive interaction when i did 

a person who comes at me from this kind of place of bitterness and control is not someone i will continue to speak with

dating is risky and often disappointing but if all youre bringing into is distrust and anger i want none of it
then be honest with your own needs and walk away 

i didnt mean to imply he needs to regret or feel ashamed only that people who have enjoyed casual sex in the past are still capable of choosing monogamy and being faithful in my experience they are often better at it because of the lack of fomo
youre not compatible 

he could be just as capable of commitment and monogamy as any man who ever lived but it doesnt matter if you cannot believe that 

if youve lost trust this is over 

you should date the person in front of you not their every past choice or the person youd hope they could become you need to be able to believe what they say about their current choices and values if you cannot be happy with that person today be honest and bow out
because freedom
the republicans are right and royally fucked

they have cultivated a delusional base that is not capable of selecting a candidate who can win a general 

running to trumps right is the smart way to get the nom and then to in loose the popular vote again and probably the election
you just know this man watches nothing but hard core anal porn and pimple popping videos and is in deep denial about his desire to be pegged
because its not about attraction

like rape the power is the point the violation is what they want 

they are just exerting power in a public place all public spaces belong to men in this persons mind women just walk through them women in mens spaces get what they deserve 

ive a had few men try to genuinely compliment me you can tell the difference and no its not that they are chads they have said shit like cool hat awesome vibe or wish i was going to whatever party youre headed too 

its really not that hard to compliment a stranger stand still do not move into their space compliment a choice not a innate thing about their body allow the interaction to end right then easy
i disagree with your premise 

the divorce rate doesnt speak to people who want to end it over the smallest thing most people i know who divorced worked damn hard sincerely to avoid it the people i know whove been married 10 years went through periods where they had to do that work too 

assuming every divorce is a personal failure is a lingering stigma not a reality 

and how can we say the divorce rate is high when were comparing it to a time when it was practically financially and often legally impossible to divorce not to mention the stigma do we really think marriages were twice as healthy and happy in 1950 as they were in 1990 or that they were 3x more blissful that people were really freely consenting to stay married more often even if your own family history was happy enough most of us can ask our grandmothers about the women she knew and be quickly disabused of that notion

and why in earth do you think people who dont want to marry not marrying is a problem
of course he did

my ex and his family were appalled that months after he dumped me with a bit of bonus cruelty i did not come to care for him during his unexpected surgery as i had during the first eight of them you see he had thought he was healthy now so he no longer needed me he had blamed me for stalling his life but once he was in need again i was a monster for not actually putting my life on pause again to care for him

the mind boggles
in other words people who are less likely to want commitment and compromise at that stage of their lives are less likely to work towards commitment and compromise at that stage of their lives
and im disagreeing it seems very obvious to me that is not many people that is a minority the majority are inclined to stay longer than they really should and keep working 

more importantly its the right outcome thats the would i want to live in if someone has one foot out the door give em a shove problem solved
hah id say they dont actually understand consent

they just glom on to buzzwords to try and make their positions sound modern and palatable its like when they talk about the loneliness epidemic and mens mental health stigma and youre nodding along because yes real issues but then you realize they are actually suggesting the government gift these men sex slaves to solve  the problem
i agree the only reasons i can see to get married today is if you believe its a religious sacrament terrifying to me but ok or if being married provides better protection for the children and their rights where you live otherwise dont get it very expensive party and pointless peice of paper for me
i cannot comprehend this attitude towards people its so objectively and observably false 

most people the vast majority keep working at preserving a relationship for months or years after it becomes objectively clear it should probably end and both parties would be happier and healthier we all know these people we have mostly been these people 

i looked back in my life and know where i should have had a zero tolerance policy lying about money throwing things in anger being mean to waiters 

healthier conflict resolution skills often contribute to relationships coming to an end because healthy approaches to adversity and conflict include fundamentally changing the terms of the relationship agreement or even ending it
i work very hard to look like im ignoring everyone who is hollering for my attention in public i always listen very closely for a few seconds before deciding if im going to engage and usually i will not if youre asking for directions or warning about construction sure if its unclear in those few seconds what youre up too i assume its no good and keep walking
thats nice

legally speaking if there is going to be marriage there must be divorce without any outside authority judging whether or not the reasons are good enough anything else in unjust to everyone 

no fault is a term of art for the kind of separation youre talking about  where no one but one or both of the two people in the marriage gets to decide its over the term exists because there was a and time and place recently and currently where they wasis not the case it doesnt mean everyone is a blameless little angel
hes certainly expressed the willingness to blame the woman when he rapes her if he sees the opportunity
this seems to be connected to new movement in the manosphere against no fault divorce she consented to be mine and she is not entitled to withdraw that consent for any reason which means its not actually consent at all so the law is wrong when it gives her the ability to leave the marriage

the problem with the divorce rate in their minds is the same problem as the false accusation rape hysteria they dont want women to be able to withdraw anything they interpreted as consent to their supremacy they want to trap one and not have to worry again about being worthy or of a partnership
this guy knows with 100 certainty that no woman has ever enjoyed herself with him and never will
motherhood is the best thing when it serves them personally or their political goals 

the like motherhood as an ideal not as an occupation that might not directly benefit them 

the fact that an actual person they have to interact with may be doing the work of being a parent while female is inherently distasteful
i think it should be a goal daily on a personal level  ignore them live your life 

but beyond the personal sphere we cannot afford to ignore them not only do the extreme members try to kill us with guns and with legislation but the shepherds are leading more and more young men to the slaughter on a societal and political level they cannot be ignored they want women subjugated and their strategy relies are making more and more men desperate entitled ill or angry enough to support that cause  on the false promise that access to an unhappy subjugated women will make them happy and that they will all of course be found deserving and meritorious by the new patriarchy
its a bad habit and she needs to stop

could it mean shes not over him sure but a bit more likely is that shes picking at the scab rerunning conversations in her head and basically letting this wound fester

she cant build a new healthy relationship unless she recognizes this behaviour is selfdestructive just cause lots of people do it especially just every once in a while and not weekly doesnt mean it okay

in the end id be more concerned that its been two years and they havent formalized the divorce
you need to go see what you can swing with work

look that kind of response is unkind its not crazy for your partner to ask you to commit to spending some vacation time with them or to ask you to confirm those plans in june for july you may not mean to be jerking her around or telling her shes not a priority or embarrassing her in front of her friends but the result of that kind of response can rationally be all those things 

if you cannot take vacation then figure out when you can and calendarize it now 

youre working too much regardless of what else is going on here in this relationship your work life balance sounds like complete shit right now and a reasonable partner will become frustrated by that
ask him what his plan is for his agreed on portion of the bills are if he is out of working for a month or 3 months or more

thats the question you need to ask him and make it clear you have not agreed to covering all the finances for an indeterminate length of time he needs a plan to meet his obligations he needs to communicate that plan to you

stop trying to fix the job search issue for him start expecting him to address your very reasonable fears and boundaries like a reasonable person 

its not your job to find him a job

its his his to explain to you how he is going to meet his responsibilities once this contract ends its not totally crazy to be looking forward to job searching after his contact ends but if that is his plan he needs to tell you he has enough cushion to make it happen you are not his safety net you just moved in together that is not a kind or reasonable expectation of you
i didnt want a better life for the women
just tell him the truth its not working for you 

this daily texting is awkward and confusing you dont want to continue it you cant build a serious connection like this its hard to even build a friendship tell him you want to stop wish him well 

block him when he doesnt reply with grace
its not fair

its obviously abusive behaviour

youre not in an ethically nonmonogamous relationships youre in an emotionally abusive one
i honestly dont know how women have sex with men in some states these days at all i love sex but it seems unnecessarily risky

but at least now you know he wasnt getting better he just has a little while where he had fewer reasons to be utter shit now he has a new  reason to be a selfish abusive peace of shit and hes going all in on it 

you dont need a perfect excuse but his transparent attempts to bully manipulate and shame you into silencing your own feelings and needs are pretty damn perfect as valid reasons to dump a person goes

hes gonna call you selfish and stubborn if you were paying his rent and donating a kidney he just wants to get his way it has nothing to do with reality
one of my few boundaries in my open relationship is that neither of us sleep with who is not prochoice even though protection is always used as well

i may stay in the relationship with someone else being pregnant but i wouldnt try to force a polycule or triad because she got pregnant the two of them may have a relationship as coparents and that would remain separate from my relationship as partner or friend with either of them

but you really shouldnt stay in this relationship

he is manipulative and emotionally abusive and if he actually uttered the words small inconvenience to refer to his own child i might take a baseball bat to his bits before i go
there is nothing here but to live and learn

people are more than just toys or experiences they are people first and foremost dont think because youre less experience its okay to treat someone who isnt openly transparently consenting like a toy or a fun ride its still really important to talk about what you want dont make assumptions about what they want or feel

even if you had watched the movie he may still have ended up connecting with and choosing someone else so dont follow that road in your head to silly places

its totally normal and healthy to have fantasies but stop fixating on this guy 

just keep dating 

use your experience to inform your future choices
this is just not a person to engage with the rest is unknowable you can know you were right to get away from her

there is nothing to learn here except that you were right eventually good for you

but the term youre looking for is serial monogamist or even cowardly little shit sociopath is a stretch based on what youve given here and monkey brancher is from incelpua land with their notoriously terrible understanding of evolutionary psychology if you dont want to be associated with misogyny dont use their buzzwords you can be plenty angry with one shitty person who happens to be a woman without buying into the resentful bullshit that will damage your relationships with all women

file this under shitty person is shitty and move on closure happens when you stop caring why shitty is shitty and just be glad to be staying away from it
youre incompatible

also pair bonding is just a profound misunderstanding misogynists have about birds that they have used as an excuse to shame women if anything human beings can actually get better at forming intimate relationships with more healthy practice at it

but that doesnt matter here youre not compatible with her and thats okay you dont trust her dont date someone you dont trust also dont be a controlling twat but that is a seperate issue it just has nothing to do with her cognitive or neurochemical ability to create and maintain partnerships in her own life
a yellow flag but not a red one

at three months you should be a little bit skeptical of anyones report of their crazyabuse ex

but reactive abuse is a very real thing the key word is react people are not at thier best when facing frequent abuse they snap they lash out they do crazy toxic things in reaction to being abused

mutual abuse is rare

reactive abuse is common and lots of abusers try to push their victims to react so they can blameshift and gaslight the victim into thinking its their fault 

keep your eyes and ears open but no not an immediate red flag
improve first then communicate to him the exact steps you are taking

telling him before youve even started the work will feel like youre making an excuse like youre asking him to tolerate it or worse solve it for you and even worse still that might actually be on some level what youre trying to do  get his acceptance and validation make excuses not changes

so change first do the soul searching pick some strategies identify a few small steps you need to take and maybe one or two big ones maybe book a session or two with a counsellor then share with him what you are doing to solve your problem
no

the two things arent related in that way 

the national pp federation is restructuring to support statelevel decision making better and to developing more telehealth the former ceo was there for 12 years new one has been in place for about 3 i dont think anyone who understands ngo life cycle would find this all that shocking sad for the individuals involved absolutely also totally sane leadership
wont lie to you that was all pretty damn bad 

the point now is to get your head on straight so you dont make similar mistakes when youre hurting or in pain in the future thats the best way to make amends and to rebuild your trust in yourself
get back to the hustle and get your financial independence back

and dont be so hard on yourself

you entered into an arrangement with someone you knew was paying you for sex like a lot of young people you came to realize just what that all meant it would have been rational to assume she was paying others as well looking back you can probably identify some places where you should have said no thank you or suggested she work with another trainer but she was probably far more skilled at pushing past boundaries than you were at expressing them

get yourself out safely and rebuild and maybe an sti check crash on a friends couch for a bit if you need too there is nothing wrong with you its a learning experience about setting boundaries listening to your own instincts and avoiding manipulators its one a frightening number of women of all races go through and youll make it through it too
i keep on validating disapointment and saddness 

you keep saying you get it but then immediately insisting on more angry assumptions and accusations of wrongdoing against her so you dont seem to be getting the discretion

good luck
youre becoming absurd in an attempt to hold on to your anger with her and find wrongdoing 

you met her in midmarch its now almost the end of may thats a very normal range of time for people to connect sincerely but for ones to realize its not going to work out
yes that was unkind but shes entitled to her belief and if she doesnt believe he can handle it then shes right to end it regardless of what he thinks of his own capacity i do not trust youre capable of meeting my needs
would be more accurate but its the same thing and valid its suboptimal phrasing but she appears to have owned her choices no problem 

but seriously his behaviour here is reminding me why 29 is my absolute floor im inclined to agree with her assessment
most people experience validation from relationships of all kinds 

youre looking for a reason to make her the bad guy because she disappointed you but you dont have a good one she just disappointed you because she didnt want what you wanted
the assumption she didnt tell you just about as soon as she figured it out herself is the bitter and entitled bullshit i mean those are the kinds of negative thoughts you need to stop indulging in
while i think its inappropriate he didnt tell you if he never replied its not that weird that he kept it to himself 

a lot of people especially men do not like to admit they are being harassed and it is harassment it may be lowkey but it is that 

i dont block the man who sends me these sorts of texts because a i worry if he realizes hes blocked he may escalate and b i want to have a record of the behaviour in case he ever does escalate its not a comfortable thing to tell a new partner about but i always do
yeah but youre letting these thoughts fester we all have passing thoughts after a break up that are are negative and irrational you have to let them go not ponder them further 

they wont support you being happy or kind in the future so drop that bullshit
be disappointed not irrationally bitter and entitled
you werent lied too

you were given the best truth as she had it to give you as she realized what she wanted more clearly she told you 

the fact you are trying to round up an incompatibility her own needs in a more serious relationship and her very open and direct communication with you into a lie and a betrayal is a huge part of why youre not emotionally mature enough to be dating older women 

this is how healthy older people date its fun for a bit if youre basically compatible but it will likely end quickly once they decide its not longterm
so you meet a grownass woman who is totally clear with you shes not ready for anything serious you date for a few months and she decides its not gonna work for her longterm then she tells you so plainly and directly

and you still accuse her of using you or gameplaying 

she just told you what she wanted and you werent it thats sad but not a betrayal 

that was successful communication you had a good time for a while you had some basic compatibility but once she knew it wasnt for her she told you

maybe the problem isnt your income or the age range maybe the problem is you need to learn to handle rejection most connections with anyone of any age are gonna just not quite work out
just stop texting him entirely

you rejected him when you rejected his intensity and talk about future wifey that was rejecting him you didnt want what he wanted and thats okay it was the right thing to do

let it be a rejection and let it be over
then your marriage is over

youve decided it

youre just trying to bully her into being the one who says it out loud it may take years but eventually she will and youll tell yourself your hands are clean but they are not 

what you are doing is cowardly and manipulative at least as shitty as anything youve accused her of here

if you actually want to be married stop this bullshit and go talk to a counsellor together
youre the one who described actively threatening the relationship

whats worse you dont even mean it you dont want to divorce right so youre just being manipulative and hurtful when you speak that way to her at least shes being honest with you about her unhappiness 

so why dont you shit or get off the pot stop making it all her job to leave your ass 

the rank hypocrisy is shocking you sound like a teenager not a 35yearold

either get a marriage counsellor involved to help you both do better you yes you really need to do a lot better than this or stop being such a little shit and hire a lawyer yourself
just let him avoid you its fine for him to avoid you

this is resolved just fine 

stop trying to pursue the fwbcasual fling with him he is not equippedinterested in that dont get bent outta shape that a 22yearold cant explain his boundaries and emotional needs clearly just take the damn hint that hes not looking for what youre looking for and stop trying to get what you want outta him 

the awkwardness is a thing you can choose to ignore for yourself
then you earned every downvote

everyone who thought your question was insincere or combative or condescending or not worth engaging with was just objectively correct
edit the fact that this got downvoted is both hilarious and pathetic

that response really just supports the decisions of others to not engage with you

if you want a sincere conversation in the future start by indicating youre willing to put in the effort to understand other people read through the thread ask for specific clarifications or identify common themes or things that seem contradictory to you reword what youve understood and ask if youve got it right these are skills were taught in grade school for engaging other people with ideas sincerely and respectfully and showing we are interested in comprehending new ideas 

dont just vaguely demand someone else spell it out for you especially in the context of this sub demanding someone else just spell it out for you is going sound combative and condescending and leave the impression of a very large risk that you are the sort who jumps into this sub feeling entitled to the emotional and intellectual labour of women who you intend to shit on regardless

that is why i choose to ignore you the risk outweighed any possible benefit to me and still does im very likely going to regret this 

if thats not who you are then dont approach it like this
does it matter if youre not compatible then youre not compatible it doesnt matter very much if that is personal or cultural
if youre comfortable with this level of prudishness and insecurities sure

i wouldnt be comfortable with this id remind her that i also kissed my ex while wearing pretty much every single shirt in my wardrobe and she had unzipped every pair of jeans i own and maybe have used every towel in the house while naked she also pet my dog even kissed his little nose can he stay 

if she wants to be absurd lets be equal opportunity absurd i wouldnt spend thousands of dollars to appease the irrational insecurities of someone im just dating especially not if they were phrasing it as a demand and not a request for support and understanding even though its a bit silly
no this is a terrible idea 

shes either looking to wound herself with this information or shes gathering ammunition to wound you with this question is inherently combative and controlling it can only damage your relationship 

tell her she needs to trust you to maintain appropriate boundaries with people you find attractive as you always have before and that if this conversation is going to be a productive one its time to get the counsellor involved and examine what she is trying to achieve with this line of questioning
i didnt say there werent many good things

but look at what this bad thing is cause its a fricking huge one

1 he felt unsafe speaking with you about his unhappiness and concerns
2 you two disagreed about boundaries and you appear to be seeking to isolate him from external emotional support you say you dont want too but in addition to number 1 that is the toxic dynamic that is developing and deepening 
3 you are now experiencing too much anxiety to join him in his regular activities or interact with people who are really important in his life

its fine to decide the good outweighs the bad but the bad youve described here is massive and youre still firmly in the honeymoon phase

you can decide to work this out and it might even work out but recognise that one of the important things about dating isnt just learning to work things out most of us will try to work out plenty more than we really should this sub is full of people trying to work out obvious incompatibles cheating and even outright abuse its really learning what is not tolerable for you so you waste less time with basically good people who are not the right people for you
its normal to maintain keepsakes especially in a private place

the fact you see this as a possible confrontation is a major issue this was not thrown in your face this was privately tucked away and your stumbling sounds a hell of a lot like snooping

its understandable that it upset you but the issues here are obviously whatever insecurities youve got going on he didnt do anything to you he didnt do anything wrong youre doing all this misery to yourself you should be talking to him about those and maybe seeking support and treatment for them this book should be a nonissue

the fact you think sentimental objects are disrespectful is absolutely not a universal opinion and frankly its a rather immature one one id expect from someone closer to 18 than 30
its been four months these sorts of issues so early on can and should be dealbreakers

in another situation id tell you that you cannot obsess about your side and that your partner needs to have people in their life they can confide in about their struggles and concerns while there can and should be some boundaries relationships cannot be emotional prisons you shouldnt want to isolate your partner from their support network you must trust and respect those people understand they are only hearing one perspective most people do understand that 

but in this situation why are you trying so hard to make it work when it so clearly isnt
dont worry about this guy hes not the issue this is not about apologizing 

are you getting medical support for your mental health right now youre in a really bad way and making really bad choices for yourself 

you just need to end all contact with this guy and get yourself some serious support and medical intervention this sequence of events was not about him it was about the bpd you need serious focused invention and treatment for your bpd
no

id say maybe big maybe if your true intention was simply to apologize for wrong doing

but it isnt this is condescending youre talking about her like she was a secondary character in your life existing only to assist in your growth underneath this all is the assumption she requires your apologyinput in order to move on with her own life you know thats not right

you havent spoken in years you know nothing you have nothing to offer except a sincere apology and what youve written here it not that sincere apology what youve written here is an inwardlooking bit of journaling about what a great person youve become this is selfcentring and personal validation not an apology its great if its all true for you but that has no value to her

nearly every time i hear a longtime ex reach out to apologize i end up rolling my eyes its almost always just selfishness and guilt and they are using the other person to make themselves feel better demanding attention to an apology that is not really an apology but is about making themselves feel better is just not a good look dont do it
the most important thing is to relax and keep on living your life

youre just talking its been good but its just talking hes moving its reasonable to believe hes probably not dodging you moving is highly timeconsuming and brainspaceconsuming

right now you are penpals trying to move things forward right away wouldnt be sensible or kind id suggest you not fight that and just accept it hoping that its temporary but not overinvesting youre going to stay penpals until at least a week after the move so think about how much time you want to give to a penpal and offer this connection only that much time

once hes moved give him 23 days and then suggest a few days youre free and even a suggestion of a placeevent especially if he doesnt know his new area well if he doesnt confirm within the first week or so of moving cut him loose

you cannot force this you cannot speed it up what you can do is decide how much of your energy youre gonna give this connection between now and when hes moved
absolutely they have issues the one in my area is very closely moderated often to the frustration of new members but even still 

however there are also guys from online dating who are posted several times a month for cheating stalking stealthing and all sorts of acts from really rude to greedy to outright violent i absolutely suggest my friends on online dating be in that group to know who the repeat offenders in the city are 

but if you look at all the posts  not just the juicy ones  most get nothing but a good luck or even i worked with him he seemed cool

this is totally old school analogue behaviour  the whisper network  in a digital space the criticism i hear from women is all like yours be critical of what you read check for the big risks not the whining but too many men are just terrified someone will say something mean about them as if they have never trash talked as ex or a hook up to their buddies and dont realize these networks exist because of a longterm systemic lack of safety for women

a woman who writes the above just really really hates other women and still thinks perfect judgment can protect her from a skilled manipulator and abuser
you might want to read some relationship books written more recently or by someone under 40 that sounds a bit regressive even for the 80s 

we are socialized in gendered ways sure but this kind of bullshit does more harm than good when two individuals are trying to understand one another
this man isnt going to save you 

he doesnt see you as a serious longterm partner and he isnt willing to take the kind of risks or make the kinds of investments an adult often would with a serious longterm partner 

on top of all of that you dont trust him he lies

this man isnt your safety whats worse he made just be a distraction and an obstacle keeping you from making other plans for yourself
ugh im so sorry im glad it sounds like you were able to keep yourself safe in the end
it happened last summer in ohio 

her rapist was arrested and she was able to get the medical care she needed in indiana her mother was advised the abortion wouldnt be legal in ohio under their heartbeat law
women are also the default care givers for small children so many women needs the legal structure of a divorce to protectcare for any dependants
i love these she dumped me for no reason stories 

one ex said i dumped him for getting a tattoo she didnt like

he got that tattoo while wastedhigh at a festival trip after promising me to stay sober and not make me play mommy instead i spent the second day to checking every medical tent and then the local er i eventually found him outta his mind in another er on iv fluids without his passport or our train tickets home

but sure it was the ugly tattoo not the 48 hours of terror and trauma followed by the cost of the hotel room and flight while i helped him sort his shit out with the embassy and hoped he wouldnt get arrested
i think theres a lot of complex intersectionality going on here and we cant really tell you much about the patterns in your neighborhoods or the ones you walk through their behaviour towards you could reflect biases in policing in the area or their jobfamily businesses or a dozen other things about the communities make up 

i walk through sort of three distinct neighbourhoods to get to my office each day and each of them presents unique risks and people respond differently to me based on how im dressed in one of them dressing more affluently will make me invisible in another it makes me a target in one wearing my more artsy queer coded clothes makes me everybodys friend in another really dirty looks and sometimes comments 

i think most street harassment comes down to punishment for being conspicuous for taking up space a reminder from men they own the space and youre just moving through it taking up space is it gonna look different in different neighbourhoods and at different times
even if it was true how is she should suffer with me because im suffering a good outcome for anyone if this were true then the women in this situation are doing a beneficial bit of emotional and practical labour for them both by ending it
oh fuck yes graduation and entering the workforce is one of the biggest transitions of your life so far dont underestimate the freefloating anxiety  totally reasonable uncertainty that kind of moment brings thats stressful for the normies please do consider putting a few of the avoidable battles back on the shelf for the time being live to fight another day i promise you itll pay off in the long run to be strategic about this personal development
notice how a shitty relationship where you or your partner is miserable much of the time seems to still be a rather good deal for men

its as if there is a great deal they benefit from in a partnership besides being happy and for women there is very little to be gained by being partnered if you are unhappy

the idea that women are more likely to leave a bad relationship is not an insult against womens character it just says something very sad about what men consider good enough and workable for themselves especially when they are not the ones doing the work
she failed his test the test to see how much shed accept from him

that is what triggered his explosion when she said maybe i dont want to accept this much

i agree op was also testing used passive aggression and needs to asset herself better  but thats because then she wouldnt waste three months with a man who wants to to play bullshit games not because she caused his verbal abuse and transparent attempts to manipulate her
exactly this

he wasnt confused he was tactical these are strategies that work for him 

op has plenty of flaws that make her an appealing target for this sort of man and a partner in his toxic dance but that doesnt absolve him
ops response was imperfect  shes a great target for his style of bullshit  but like i said he knew exactly what manipulation he was engaging in at that moment there was no reason to tell her about the text or his response except to test and trigger her

he didnt ask her because he cared he asked her as part of the test he was training her not to protest his behaviour and learning how to best manipulate her 

and when she failed the test by beginning to question and stand up for her own needs and boundaries he went on an overblown attack to threaten and coerce her into silence 

classic all my exes are crazy behaviour from this man

only thing to do is block him and move on any further contact will continue to bring out the worst in op
fellow panic disorder here and i completely relate to if i didnt challenge this id do nothing i had to manage panic around things like picking up the phone learning to drive and getting on planes 

but if nonmonogamy regularly triggered full blown panic i wouldnt do it one of the most valuable tools i have is pick your battles no that is too many battles put some back pick like two battles 

when i first started to really address my anxiety i thought i had to fight and defeat all my demons i put myself in a lot of unnecessarily triggering situations that actually made it harder to reach equilibrium and practice the skills because i was constantly pressuring myself to perform under intense anxiety when i stated to focus on the battles that were personally worth it to me things really started to click driving was 100 worth it getting on a boat absolutely not worth it i can live a very full and rich life without boats 

maybe this is a battle you want to pick but please give yourself some grace and make sure youre really picking it because its a worthwhile one for you and if it is consider putting some of the other battles on the back burner for a while dont try to everything all at once manage your energy and give yourself real recovery time time to recover and reflect is where you really firm up your tools and tactics otherwise you risk just burning yourself out
major toxic fights in the first three months are a huge red flag 

he doesnt want to be a boyfriend he wants to appear single at least to his guy friends he doesnt care how that makes you feel 

hes 34 not 21 hes not confused he knows exactly how he was manipulating you and leaving you feeling insecure and begging for his commitment and transparency stay the fuck away from him block him grieve it out and move on with your life
its actually rather cool its a real thing but the stupidest thing about this comment is that it was found largely to be fetal cells like from their sons so yes they checked it was that 

some studies have shown that up to 60 of women who have given birth to a son retain some of his cells it is naturally assumed they also retain their daughters cells but i havent seen studies for that in my admittedly shallowish reading they have also found some cells of older siblings in the younger ones and obviously twins and blood transfusions its just really not that big of a deal 

this seems to be a myth that came up in 2017 based on a study of women with male children outta seattle in 2012 but they decided to conflate the findings of male dna in the brain with the idea that the women were promiscuous and the dna was from multiple sex partners instead of what they actually were women who had sons
thats worse all of that is worse 

he treated you at least as badly as her but she had the sense to make the boundaries she needed for herself and cut him loose 

it also sounds like he used you to try to emotionally manipulate her while he was lying to you 

this is so much worse
her im trying to access a very basic prescription and also maybe not be maliciously imprisoned or murdered by the state any advice

him shouts irrational insulting assumptions about her body and sexual pleasure into the void
hes not confused

hes tactical you were convenient hes not capable of being alone

hell make plenty of excuses for himself and most of them will be lies dont gaslight yourself they are what they do not what they say

and what he did was making himself available to his ex for your entire relationship not just the first few months 9 months outta 10 that just means he hasnt hit her up super recently he never stopped
id walk 

this is his shit to overcome and he didnt probably wont 

but im his age 

and hes dating a woman over a decade younger then him because he assumes he can get away with this shit during her benefit of the doubt era he might last until you hit your knows her worth era 

a man who is 35 and behaved like he did is not capable of being mentally health alone which means hes not capable of being with anyone else either
4 year olds when they are called kiddo

24 year olds when they are called kiddo

me when my friend since kindergarten calls me sis

me when my catty sil does 

its almost like context and intent matter in human communication
this guy youre the real racist for not conforming to my sexist and racist stereotypes about you
i would consider the friendship done

his behaviour was horrible and your response was not productive but it doesnt really matter 

generally speaking i wouldnt keep a friend around who is clearly expressing a sense of entitlement to my sexualromantic interest and there is really no other rational interpretation here he wasnt defending white men in general they are doing just fine and dating plenty of women are asian decent generally speaking he was attacking you for not being a specifically available option to him and that is someone you need to stay the hell away from regardless of the racism angle
it would encourage women to buy toys and cohabitate with one another so as not to become a indentured servant 

there would be less children but possible a rush in sperm donors because youre making having children via sex even riskier that it already is
let spare a moment of shame for the guy who keeps trying to get him on mic 

best case senecio this random guy is going through some shit put the camera down and walk the fuck away stop encouraging this performance
its normal for people to grow apart especially at this stage of young adulthood

theres no going back there is not much chance of fixing it if youre this confused about what it even is after this much silence and blocking drama

allow it to end grieve it out and move on
your daughter is currently being abused your ex is trying to estrange her from you with lies about her own criminal violent potentially fatal actions that us lying likely some gaslighting and its generally emotional abuse designed to isolate your daughter from you 

your daughter is currently the victim of emotional abuse do not forget that or gloss over it that is what is happening here while you do not have the legal power to stop it at this time that is what is taking place your ex is actively abusing her
just keep persuing the parental ordercustody agreement

speak to a lawyer about your choice not to pursue criminal charges you should not have made that call without legal advice about how it would impact the custody situation if you dont already have one a lawyer will probably recommend a evaluation where a mental health professional will issue an opinion on whether or not you had a mental breakdown andor false memory

document all acts of estrangement tell your ex youre only going to discuss parenting right now over email follow up with any inperson conversations with an email that says as we discussed in person today let her reply in writing that she didnt intend to say she asked you to lie and say you stabbed yourself

youre not going to be able to repair your relationship with your daughter much further at this time she is not going to be able to read and comprehend the police reports medical reports or protection orders for many years your daughter is 11 years old and all her basic survival needs are met by her mother shes gonna side with her mother its just a basic human thing that is where her safety and her food comes from youre gonna be coasting for a few years

you need to seriously reconsider your legal options in regards to the stabbing youre not protecting your daughter if you are making it more difficult for her in the future to discern the truth about what happened youre also not protecting your daughter or anyone else around your ex from further acts of violence
you dont youve already explained plenty he had actively chosen not to understand and ignore your boundaries

you thought maybe you could be friends but his further treatment of you proved that you could not he wasnt friendly he continued to be boundarybusting and manipulative

youre not a therapist or a rehab centre for sad boys

expect him to continue to overreact and be ready to reenforce the boundaries that youre happy enough to hang out with him in a group but you asked for the texts to stop when they didnt you stopped them

leave him blocked youve communicated clearly
you can divorce someone for any reason youd like

but i do think you need to calm down if this is a hard boundary for you discuss it with him ask for his agreement to stop express to him you are willing to consider divorce if he will not 

but for my own sake i find this behaviour immature not a betrayal its just kinda ugly like a grown man having swimsuit illustrated posters on his bedroom wall
it is strange to me because pumpkin spice is a mix that humans have loved since the late 18th century when we finally became globally connected enough to concoct it there is even a bit of evidence of this spice mix as far as 3500 years ago good things taste good 

most of us loved this before it was branded psl
in hand not pinned to the back of your head like 90s barrette
your boyfriend suggested something if it will make you feel less insecure

you need to work on your insecurities in therapy

what he said was careless not an insult he fell into your baggage you need to pick some of this shit up off the floor its a tripping hazard

and dont bleach your vulva its unhealthy
you cannot fix the situation but saying i know this sucks and its a thing you need to get through that sucks will probably be validating

shitty things be shitty

sometimes the best help you can give someone when they are really in the dark part of it is is just agree this is shitty you feel shitty because it is shitty tell me how i can help you get through the shitty part
first ask her what support she wantsneeds

second recognize she is having a totally valid emotional reaction to something that is 100 true  the arts field is deeply unfair that is hard to get a job and almost nothing pays well there is a whole bunch of earning your shot and being a team player and paying your dues that you can basically only afford to do if you come from money and she was burnt out and dissatisfied in her last job she feels lost because she is that is a totally reasonable place for a person to be at 27 shes not broken shes 100 normal i know a hundred people who continued to work in the arts after this sort of period in their lives and i know a hundred who left both choices are valid but the choice will need to be made in time 

some shortterm depression is not a completely unreadable response to the situation shes experiencing especially when you stick a damn pandemic on top of it

do not say she knew what she signed up for of course she did she doesnt need you treating her like a child with that kind of comment but she didnt know how it would feel  she didnt know what the limits or stressors would be longterm she didnt know she wouldnt like it and it wouldnt be worth it she felt reasonably at one point in her life that she was making the best choices for herself it is possible you could have found yourself having the same crisis of faith about your choices in it so dont be a condensing shit about it just because art was her previous choice it wasnt a bad one it just isnt working out

keep encouraging therapy because she deserves the support

dont encourage professional networking until she has a more concrete purposegoal in mind
to be able to hurt her back for no damn reason while her legs cramp and fall asleep and wear mocha fraps in her hair all while dreaming of doing battle with a poorly photoshopped northamerican kaiju 

also i am deeply disappointed that they just greyscaled the image of a rooter instead of at least picking a photo of a black one like they come in black roosters come in black google black rooster dammit lazy shitposters
from the little window we have here it does seem like he is incapable of offering her anything but negativity and harsh judgement she may have told the group in an effort to pressure him to perform as if he was supportive and happy for her for at least a damn second
oh to have the ego of a mediocre man who doesnt even think the posting rules apply to him what i could have achieved in life with this oblivious and inflated sense of selfworth
i think she is in the wrong objectively but youre not coming at this objectively youre coming at this emotionally and trying to use a money agreement in the relationship to solve your unhappiness and money issues with a situation she is not in control of your employment i can understand why she would be upset when you frame this as financially punishing her because you hate your job that it isnt what it is but its sure what you make it sound like

you need to stop making assumptions about her savings and you need to stop attacking this emotionally objectively if that space is her office  especially if she intends to get personal tax benefits or write offs for it  then its not part of your shared home thats not about your budget or your job that is her being honest with herself with you and the irs about what her business costs to run and what resources it requires it requires a room just like it requires certain software or licenses its a business expense not a relationship one it belongs to business not to you or to her personally the business needs to be renting that room the business owner needs to pay that isnt about the boyfriendgirlfriend agreement thats about the business owing money its not paying 

and you need to be seriously looking for other work she may be unfair and maybe you should break up but generally speaking its also not fair to be constantly at your partner because youre miserable and not doing anything to fix that for yourself
i wouldnt want to be married to either of you

yelling is unacceptable to me

however so are constant accusations especially public drunken ones

what you are doing isnt being insecure were all a bit insecure you sound like you have long ago crossed the line into emotionally abusing your husband

most people will not accept emotional abuse forever without snapping snapping might look like yelling but it can also look like withdrawing running away or sobbing hysterically people break under that kind of treatment longterm they just do its called reactive abuse if he we were here asking for him id be telling him he probably needs to leave you before you bring out the worst in him and his behaviour gets worse because you are unlikely to seriously change yours 

stick with the therapy and discuss this incident there in the context of your behavior towards him
if you need to discuss how costs are split in you relationship you have to do that before you agree to go and pay for the ticket 

youre not wrong but you made a mistake not discussing the impact of this wedding trip on your budget before you agreed to go 

if you do speak to him about this start there i made a mistake i should have told you before we booked that this was more than i could comfortably spend
i wish i hadnt bothered tho this guys posting history is a nightmare before it was complaining his wife wasnt communicative enough with only the most weakass arguments shed done anything at all wrong and right here were seeing exactly why his wife has learned not to speak to him 

even when the information is totally banal he takes the opportunity to shit on her instead of supporting her
so he doesnt believe in being accountable to other human beings and honest about his commitments

youre 25 and pregnant you need to wake the hell up
youre trying to make it complicated because you dont like the simple truth everyone else gets it just fine he definitely gets it youre the one who doesnt want too 

hes doing exactly what he wants

if he wanted to be at those appointments he would be

if he wanted to be dating you he would be

he doesnt 

and he probably never will 

stop trying to fix it and start learning to live with him as a coparent
agreeing not to fuck other people is not the same as being a partner

same answer hes not your partner

its not stable with him hes not offering you that he is doing exactly what he wants and he doesnt want to be your support in this 

the longer you imagine you can turn him into either a good partner or a good parent the harder it will be for you to move forward with your life as a mother and as a human being

im sorry youre not ready for that reality sooner you get there the better off youll be
i just dont want to break up with him

its a situationship by definition you are not together 

we have a rocky relationship but we want to do better for our daughter

great you need to realize the best you can do probably doesnt include dating one another 

 i wanna start by finding a way to have him go to the baby appts mkre

you cannot turn him into either a good partner or a good parent hes gonna be who he wants to be and you need to make your peace with that
dude you were absolutely implying that she was incompetent and that you didnt trust her researchjudgment call despite the fact this was an ongoing issue for her and you knew shed taken previous steps

you may really think you didnt intend it but intention actually isnt everything what you atually did was shitty and her emotional response to being treated that way was predictable and reasonable 

it is a damn small thing and you were a selfabsorded ass about it

got to be honest with you if i was opening the garage by hand for a single week my partner would have declared that unacceptable and built a plan to correct that situation before i even got around to it

you should apologize and do better treat her like the competent adult she is and dont expect her to struggle with a daily task for months just because it doesnt impact you and then throw shade when she says its time to resolve the issue sesh youre 35 this is rather basic courtesy and empathy it is not rocketscience
i think you feel like a single mom because you are one 

stop the situationship just be coparents 

hes not your partner hes not the partner you want hes just your coparent and you cant force him to be a good parent you can only give him opportunities to be one 

the longer you imagine you can turn him into either a good partner or a good parent the harder it will be for you to move forward with your life as a mother and as a human being
let it go and focus on being coparents

she doesnt sound all that more toxic than you to be perfectly honest

go be better with someone else and find some grace when it comes to the woman who is the mother of your child your animosity over her sex life is pointless and counterproductive you may not be able to create a home with her and your son but you can create a coparenting relationship where you butt the hell out of exes sex life and focus on just being a parent and not fixating on your role as jilted or resentful ex
you probably want to begin by trying to connect with an individual therapist not a couples therapist to get you a place to talk through the particulars and make some thoughtful choices 

you want to leave the house and in the short term that is probably a good idea but you may want to speak to a lawyer if youre concerned about how that impacts your legal standing staying close by would definitely be wise and maintaining regular contact and support for the children 

if it doesnt matter where you live then you live near were your children are right now that is the default 

i dont know where you are living but you should recognize it takes way more than a night in jail to stop you from seeing your children the child have a right to know you and have access to you and no court is throwing that right of the children away over a verbal fight catastrophizing isnt going to help you here what is going to help you is focusing on being a present and available parent that should be the foundation of your decisions 

but get some distance in the shortterm and some support from an individual therapist and a lawyer
he definitely wants to fix it

if this has been your whole relationship and hes never spoken to a therapist or sought a sliding scale or a free support group or read a damn selfhelp book from the library then he doesnt really want to fix it he wants to seem like he wants to fix it so youll continue to tolerate it

youre both benefiting in some way from this unhealthy dynamic and you both need to admit it to yourself and eachother
he needs to realize this has to be fixed if he wants a healthy relationship with anyone ever and certainly if he wants to marry you

he may hate this about himself but as long as he tolerates it about himself it has the impact of guilting and silencing his partner

you cant remedy this for him he has to do it for himself and for you
this was my ex too

i tried desperately to point out that hed reply with no as the first word out of his mouth even when i was 99 correct or if had just used a wordterm he deemed less accurate then the one in his head 

he expected me to make all the effort to make myself understood but not to have to put himself out for a second to try and understand
i wouldnt i would text him after i post it

conversation can evolve from there or not 

make sure you know the policy at your company but if there is no risk of a direct reporting issue this is just a question of mutual interest
id start by asking if shes changed her mind about porn

the deception is a major problem but struggling with a change of opinion on a loaded topic like porn can be very different than a hypocrisy or betrayal unless youre in a race toward divorce your best path forward is an open conversation about porn and frame it as an upsetting and confusing but valid change in her choices and opinions and not a personal attack

you saw what you saw youre confused and more than a little hurt

try to put aside your assumptions about what she thinks or how she feels or even how often shes engaging with try to approach the conversation as an opportunity to reset the understanding about porn and just porn its possible she might still think its wrong and be disgusted with herself which would also account for her physical withdrawal from you

if she struggles to be forthcoming recommend couples counselling urgently to help moderate this important conversation dont spend too much time banging your own head against the wall and fixating on the betrayal
go back to therapy and figure out what kind of relationship if any youd like to have with your mother and what steps you need to get there that could absolutely include cutting her off or minimizing contact 

its totally valid to feel like you do and its really mature and wise of you to be able to recognize that your mother has changed and is making efforts you dont have to feel bad youre clearly trying to be fair to her and the person she is today but that doesnt mean your feelings are totally valid be fair to yourself too and get some more support for this stage
tbh i often forget this is criminal in the places where most redditors live

a few times ive given advice like thats not something you can reasonably expect from a matchhook up youre looking for a very specific service and you should be hiring someone and tipping well and completely been oblivious to the fact i was suggesting a crime
you cannot control how he feels

you can tell him youre concerned thats fair but dont get into specifics

youre concerned hes stressed out and overworked youre concerned he wont accept advice or listen to doctors on the best way to manage his pain or his diet

dont assume you have the answers dont be your mothers little helper speak for yourself and admit youre worried you want better for him than he seems to be choosing for himself and as someone who loves him that makes you sad
youre a piggy bank for a man who hid his child from you for four months

the fact hes an unreliable dad isnt something you can fix for him 

being a reliable parent means showing up he cannot do that without the financial support of the new gf he lied to 

you made the first right decision the second right decision is removing this person from your life
but she thinks your lusting after your sister however wonderful you think you ex is that is what she thinks of you she thinks at best you lack boundaries and at worst that you are incestuously obsessed with your sister 

that really should be insulting and offensive enough to help you get past this

your ex has shown you who she really is shes possessive and jealous and willing to make up extremely offensive insults in the attempt to isolate you from your sister and her kids
you cannot fix crazy

your problem is that youre trying to fix crazy

and why would you want to date someone ignorant and stubborn really

your exgf has decided to believe something absurd and offensive about you youre never going to reason her out of it you shouldnt be trying to work through it you should be removing someone who thinks such irrational and hateful things about you from your life
you need to stop seek therapy

it is extremely unlikely this man was going to pick you if youd just agreed to go home with him after the first date thats not realistic its a fantasy story youre telling yourself just to beat up on yourself you keep shifting the details but the core of it remains true he met someone else

it is a good idea to be upfront up walking to book a second date with someone youre into but that probably wouldnt have change the outcome here 

he connected more with someone else 

its just a rejection its a normal part of dating

the way you are behaving here on reddit suggests you are not ready to be dating and handling normal rejection as part of that process stop fixating speak to a therapist
stop supporting and start laying down some expectations

if hes not a jealous person then the way he is treating you and n is irrational and unkind

that drunken attack was not acceptable he doesnt need to be coddled he needs to be told this isnt an acceptable way to deal with whatever hes feeling

you have been nothing but open to working with him on this but he continues to make it your problem to live with his shitty attitude and random accusations followed by gaslightingeseque denials its not kind to you its not respectful of you he needs to do better because this is a shitty way to treat your partner who is very very willing to adapt this friendship to address your feelings 

stop trying to be his therapist and tell him to get his damn ass to an actual one if hes experiencing intense feelings he cannot speak with you honestly about
youre incompatible

and she basically said she feels she needs too and is entitled too financially punish you in order to stop you from becoming lazy why does she want to marry you if she thinks that you need to be threatened with higher costs in order to perform and set goals yuck

but honestly the even bigger longterm issue here is disagreements about parenting like the importance of private schooling if the rest of this doesnt scare you that should terrify you that disagreement is going to harm the children 

shes told you she is going to be constantly chasing status and making comparisons between your family you and everyone elses family if dont share that keeping up with the jones mentality and want to spend big to keep up public appearances then youre signing up for misery

also shes way too old to be this much of a brat
dont do this

use the letter to sort out your thoughts but then if you really need to express these thoughts to him and have decided to take the risk do it facetoface

whatever the outcome youll feel far far more confident and at peace with it if you do it face to face i promise its scarry to do things the right way to get a clear answer but thats the better path and believe it or not if youre gonna get rejected itll hurt less that way

if you cannot face this risk in person then you shouldnt be taking the risk at all
hes not a faithful man he never has been

can you be secure and healthy with someone you cannot reasonably expect to be faithful to you

you are being naive these are not challenges this is him making choices major changes in character and in core choices are rare and they have to be internally motivated unless he has explained clearly why he has changed his choices moving forward for himself and the life he wants for himself and not just to appease you there is no reason to believe he will not choose what he feels perfectly entitled to choose which is to engage with sex workers and lie to you about it

youre 23 you got a hell of a lot more life left i wouldnt recommend wasting any more of it on this one
nothing about that ran out as rhetorical to me if it was an attempt to persuade op of anything else except that you believed her to be held culpable for being emotionally abused and manipulated for years it was not well stated
yet here you are claimed it was a joke to brush it off as if not trying to get him mad at you for lying to you thats pretty wild and makes no sense

it makes perfect sense for someone in an eightyear partnership who is used to being silenced lied to and made deliberately distressed you stop responding reasonably to the manipulation and abuse because reasonable responses to it never stopped the behaviour in the past you get confused direct communication feels impossible that is the goal of this kind of abuse to make it feel impossible and pointless to respond in the reasonable ways  with legitimate anger or clear boundaries  that you assume op should it doesnt happen overnight its not all ops fault they cannot fix him by being better their responses to being abused are flawed but very human this is the kind of flaws that ongoing abuse will bring out in most of us

this isnt enabling this is the misfiring of survival instincts and toxic coping techiniques after years married to an emotional abuser

it doesnt get better for op until op gets out
youre supposed to leave the man who is either so conflict adverse he is unwilling to admit when he hasnt done something or so maliciously and gaslighting abusive that he takes pleasure in manipulating you and making you suffer

this is a big deal hes acting more like an unhinged prison guard than a partner 

at some point it stops mattering if he does this because he is weak and fearful and cannot admit when he has failed to do something or if he does this because he takes pleasure in abusing you the end result is the same
hes a gameplaying numbnut divorcee who wants to be chased even as hes telling you that he is not available to be caught he wants to feel desired by you and others without actually having to offer anything of himself or do any of the hard work of being more than just nice 

just end contact there is nothing here for you but drama
so all these people like each other more than they like you

which sucks for you but isnt a fight you can win there is not letting these adults make their own choices there is only you deciding what relationships you still want to be in 

its not your flat youre not on the lease these other people the subletter and your girlfriend were invited by the person who does lease the flat you didnt do them an act of kindness it wasnt yours to give to them 

the core issue here is that your gf doesnt want to move in with you when you return shes not prioritizing living with you thats plenty of reason to decide the relationship cannot or should not continue but this narrative you have about other people taking advantage of you or victimizing you is nonsense they disappointed you is all you had a room in someone elses house and that someone else has invited others instead 

if you dont want to continue with your gf dont but drop the rest of this bullshit
id consider it a rather serious red flag if a man used the word emasculating at me in anger because i had achieved personal success or experienced personal stress both of these are human things 

hes telling you he thinks his achievements and his stress and carry more meaning than yours because hes a guy and youre a girl this is a serious issue 

you need to stop building him up about his career and instead tell him plainly that he is not entitled to rip you down because of his own twisted ideas about women and men or his own negative feelings he needs to manage his feelings without explosions of anger or gendered insults those behaviors should be dealbreakers 

emasculating is not a word he should be using or even thinking when it comes to your career path or achievements
yeah i dont get it

my parents are rather happily married for 40 years they are both basically good people but they described their vows as sincere workable wishes which is the best way i think you can look at it and something i practice with my partner now its not a prison sentence its a promise to work hard and work first at this shared wish and also to stop working and go on wishing the best for one another if we find no amount of effort means we can stay in the partnership without being miserable
yeah so friends speak once and then hold their peace or remove themselves

that is how you deal with a serious concern about a friends choice in partner respectfully

and ill happily agree for the second time they may be toxic and we cant know

i dont think youre being the critical thinker you imagine you are

but you do seem to be reflecting a common bias where a body you find undesirable is immediately associated with behaviour or personality you assume is undesirable as well there is nothing here that suggests op is an unreliable narrator while that is certainly possible there usually are tells i dont see any and you havent pointed any out

your interpretation took way more assumptions than mine did

all mine hinged on was the fiance not speaking up for his own choice to be with op clearly to his friends thats a pretty defensible take whether we completely accept ops reasoning or not fianc should still be standing up for his own choices  even if those choices are mistakes

you really should consider why your story  the one where op must be toxic and the friends nobbling defending him from her  is the one you felt compelled to tell and doubled down on because it didnt require critical thinking or skepticism it required a rather fallaciousseeming leap

the devil has plenty of advocates already and playing one doesnt actually make you seem interesting or insightful it just makes you sound like a motivated reasoner
why do you want to imprison this man with a wife who resents him and doesnt want to be with him its not like thats a great deal for him either if op isnt able to willing to change the shared goals and expectations she has then he deserves to be free of her just as much as she deserves to be free of him 

and do you think people didnt walk away from their partners constantly in the previous centuries due to poverty or illness cause they did in droves sometimes with a bit of social shaming but far less than you might imagine men more than women which is not a comment so much on mens general character as it is their power and agency to leave a undesirable situations and seek greater comfort and convenience elsewhere

its so funny how individualism went awry just the time as when women achieved the most basic human rights and the ability to leave situations they found intolerable
no we dont get to dictate how others deal with objects or memories from experiences that were traumatic or abusive

op can absolutely bring his feelings and needs forward but she doesnt have to do this because the ex was abusive if anything the fact he was abusive may contribute to her connection to objects that represent the positive aspects of the relationships because all abusers have some positive traits at times that is how they entrap
it does to me

but also these are very stupid and desperate criminals
unlike the magic power to declassify documents by looking at them he retained that until the very last second and then some yes  
id recommend these things get put away in a drawer and from there you suck it up

not because your feelings are irrational but because grief  especially grief and processing after long term abuse  are super fucking complicated 

you can ask her to do this work for you and your comfort that fair if its a thing you really need and boundaries you need to revisit but id recommend you not force the issue shes very likely to let go of more in time but two years after seven of abuse is not full processing time for most people

shes probably not holding onto him shes preserving the story of her own life
you shouldnt stay in a relationship you dont want to be in

your husband needs to stop gettingseekingstaying at jobs where he is either not able to succeed or his work ethic doesnt line up with expectations 

becoming successful is not a reasonable expectation if that is what you need its probably time to walk away go date someone who already is 

becoming stable reliable and less miserable should be the shared goal and expectation of him if youre going to stay that may include a major change of industry andor changes in expectations about how he will contribute
laugh

and then hopefully wake up from the strange dream where my partner and my father are not both rational and civil men who can resolve disagreements and do not order me around like a dog
we always just have ops pov they are frequently manipulating the internet for validating responses do you jump in on every thread to remind us of that fact or just the ones where you suspect the fatcard 

look if you think its not very probable that a group of people have deemed someone unworthy primarily due to their weight i do not know what universe youre living in cause it aint the one i inhabit

ive happily agreed they may be toxic and we cant know but you seem to need more than that you should ask yourself why
friends speak once and then hold their peace or remove themselves 

they dont speak about another persons body or level of perceived hotness as being a huge mistake

while its possible these two are poorly matched or toxic there is nothing here to suggest it and fianc should still be standing up for his own choices  even if those choices are mistakes
does it matter

most of the time he kept talking about his friendsfamilycoworkers and exes and only asked about 3 questions about me the entire time

and

i was like no i dont kiss on the first date and we kept talking about it untill he leaned in and kissed me

this man is a boundarybusting selfabsorbed asshat who is not relationship material

unless youre just looking to get laid move on frankly even if you are probably want to be moving on a man that selfabsorbed and indirect in his communication is a coin flip odds are not great hes a fun lay anyways a guy who asks you nothing about yourself is rather unlikely to get you off 

dont so be desperate to be picked by somebody that you chase after selfish little shits who basically ignore you as a person realize you get to do the picking too  and then put this one back on the pile unless the earring is worth a small fortune let it go along with this guy
i think the real issue here is your fiance is refusing to stand up for himself with the people he calls friends which is sad for him and it limits your life together

basically he needs better friends or to tell these friends they are expected to be better or to gtfo
no you probably shouldnt

you should be speaking to a therapist about how to best move forward in your own life

you still havent sorted out the difference between her doing something wrong and her doing something that disappointed you

youre not expressing all that much love for her as a person but for the role you have cast her in and are frustrated she is no longer consenting to perform

youre not owed a certain number of chances and your family as you previously envisioned it doesnt need to be back together that is your preference not a fact of the universe she doesnt have to agree she doesnt agree

these attitudes all make it extremely unlikely that youve done the work you need to be an independent and reliable adult and even if you had done that work she might still not want to reconcile because youre not owed a certain number of chances she can just choose not to be in a marriage she doesnt want to be in and she has

take these thoughts and feelings to a therapist they do need to be addressed but not by your exwife
your mother is dating an asshole and what is worse she knows it and she appears to have quietly approved of his behaviour she warned you when she should have said if you are verbally abusive to my son in yourhis workplace i will dump your childish ass

dont talk to him hes not relevant to you and if youre in a union situation you should seriously consider reporting him for threatening your workdayincome because hes pissed off you didnt buy him a meal

tell your mother kindly but firmly that your invites do not include him unless you explicitly include him you need to avoid these misunderstandings in the future by being clear if he is coming or not
